{"body":"I look at the map when you ping and form an ETA. Afterwards my focus is on the lane and my opponent to spot an opportunity "to land that cc" in the correct time *window*. It is not a point: if the opportunity comes up a bit early it is still fine if it is within tolerance (hence "window").  	If you are close the ETA may be off quite a bit if you take significantly longer due to not coming straight to the lane. Due to my focus being on the lane (gotta land that cc - may not be easy and certainly can't be done at any time I chose nor without focus) I may not notice it if you stop along the way (e.g. doing scuttler).		Certainly depends on the elo. If you constantly get teammates that do this sort of thing though you should surely start to expect that.

I *could* study this map and try to forecast whether my jungler is just wondering around for what ever reason or if he's really on the way to may lane. But as I don't know how some random Soloq dude behaves, I certainly can't spend all my time with studying my jungler so I can predict his moves.		Junglers do all kinds of weird rooming around, I simply can't know if he's walking by because he invades/wards/does crab/prepares drake/actually ganks.		Even then, tell me where you are going to come in. Wave-preparation is very different for river or tri-brush-gank. When the jungler moves from e.g. blue to river, there would be no reason for me to think he's gonna gank. I will hope for a gank when he moves from drake/baron towards my lane. I got cooldowns to take care of. If I wait until I can be sure he's coming to my lane, I got no more than 5s. When I wait until I'm sure about an upcoming gank, I don't have much time for preparing. And no, I can't simply be prepared all the time. Especially not on bot in soloq.		As a support, I could do pretty neat things if I knew the jungler came for a gank: I would go ward river and tri-brush, this would allow me to have a reason for clearing their wards maybe baiting them into counter clearing and thus running into my incoming jungler. Also, I make sure to have CC ready (if I don't, I can tell him to delay a little before he gets into enemy's vision). But this requires knowing in advance. Preparing requires time.		When I play support I don't have to focus on CS'ing so I'm always having at least one eye on the minimap. This allows me to predict many things, but preparation could be way better if I knew all that stuff before it becomes predictable.		And really: What's the harm? It literally takes no time to ping.

{"body":"It's a 5v5 game, if you want to play solo I suggest you play heartstone. Just because you queue up alone doesn't mean you play alone, maybe one day you will understand the difference.		So if you warn your laner you can get counter ganked but if you don't warn your laner you can not get counter ganked? See, how you keep using this flawed logic which seems to be really popular amongst LoL players. You have the exact same possibility of getting counter ganked you can't just randomly use it to promote your "style" of not pinging.		The big difference is that one is an informed decision and one is an uninformed decision. In my opinion an informed decision is almost always better.		You do the usual solo Q thing of assuming your teammates are braindead retards who only hold you back and you have to 1v9 carry the game. It's what makes playing solo Q so fucking disgusting.		To show you how flawed your logic is im gonna address the points you made:		>>If you don't warn him and you assess the situation correctly, the worst thing that happens is you trade your hp for enemy laner hp, the best is that he dies, you are NEVER risking the game with it. 		Or you misjudge (oh wait, sorry I forgot you never misjudge and it's only your shitty laners who hold you back) you get destroyed by the enemy laner who expected you because you walked through a ward your laner didn't warn you off because he didn't expect your gank. Your laner now flashes in to save your stupid ass and you both die because of a counter gank. If you pinged your gank your laner would warned you and you coulda taken another path and your laner coulda set you up with a flash stun into your skillshot you missed the first time and got destroyed.		>>If you do warn your laner and he is retarded, at best you lose time, at worst you get counter ganked and YOU lose a lane, its not the laner's fault, its yours, the information YOU gave, costed him the lane.		No it's not the information you gave to the laner that costed him the lane it's his action he made BASED on your information. Again I just have to repeat myself over and over again the ONLY difference is that the fuckup was based on information rather than NO information. "Yeah but the ping baited him in to do it" As I said above, no ping can bait just as much as a ping, there is not difference except that with the ping you give the laner the chance to be smart and without the ping you just assume he is braindead retarded and don't even give her the chance to show how smart he is.		I play the game in all positions and I had countless ganks as jungler with point and click CC (Panth, Vi) where I ping and my laner wastes his skillshot CC (f.e. Cho'Gath Q) trying to set up the gank instead of waiting until the enemy laner is CCed by the 100% CC. Just as much I had junglers gank my lane I was trying to win on my own so I actually concentrate on the enemy laner and don't pay attention to what my jungler is doing just to have her randomly walk into the lane just as I used my cooldowns. I especially hate that when I play laners who can set up ganks very well like LeBlanc or Lulu.			Again to reiterate. You don't want to ping because the laner might fuckup and if he fucks up you can directly assign that to the ping. If you don't ping and the gank failes you can NOT directly assign that to the lack of ping so what you do is assume that no ping is better.

But more than that, purely relying on the minimap can lead to misinterpreting the jungler's movements (taking scuttle crab instead of preparing to gank). Further, the pinging doesn't have to happen when a gank is already obvious from the jungler's position. How about pinging while taking a camp so that the laners can start setting up for it (saving cooldowns, managing the wave, building stacks etc.), or ping out enemy ward spots?
