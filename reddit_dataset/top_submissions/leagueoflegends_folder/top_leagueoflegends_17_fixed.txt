{"body":"I hear you so much. I've been playing Poppy ever since Season 2. I still remember getting into League, and trying to decide what champion I should try out. I saw Poppy and thought she was fun. I was not disappointed.		She was the first champion that I bought skins on. She was the first champion I started playing ranked with. She was the one badass yordle that carried me to Gold this season both in the NA server and the KR server. She was the one yordle that everybody hated, but I loved. People called her ugly, bad, useless, and Poopy. I called her Poopy too, but she knew I was just playfully trying to grab her full attention.		Poppy gave me Double Kills, Triple Kills, Quadra Kills, and Penta Kills. She won me games, and she won me lanes. Poppy was the first champion I reached Mastery level 5. Poppy was also the girl that convinced me to return to League of Legends after I quit ~~(or I thought I quit)~~ the game mid-season 4.		Poppy didn't know any jokes, but she knew more jokes than I did. She always fought for harmony in Valoran, so no more tragedies besides her father's unfortunate death would occur. Not only did Poppy motivate me everyday, but she also inspired Galio to fight for peace.		Poppy's hammer, and her shield brought me joy. She was a Valiant Fighter to the end. The times when our enemies would foolishly try to harass her, she would punish their misconducts by Heroically Charging them to the wall with her shield and bringing about a Devastating Blow with her hammer. She never feared to stand as one against many. Our faith in her Diplomatic Immunity never faltered. Together, we were unstoppable. Poppy was truly THE Paragon of Demacia.		Now, as all things come to an end, so must the Poppy we knew. However, this does not signify the end of Poppy as the Champion. Butterflies don't just become a symbol of beauty. Now is the time for Poppy's long overdue metamorphosis as she transforms into, not just a fighter, but a beautiful fighter. If we truly loved Poppy before, we must then learn to accept this fate and let it go. Let Poppy spread her wings and fly. We will never leave Poppy's side, and we will watch her shine.		Poppy, once a Valiant Fighter, will now become the Iron Ambassador that everybody will know, fear, and revere. Her Steadfast Presence will bring an impact beyond Worlds. People will be Shocked by her Hammer, as she continues to Heroically Charge upon any obstacles that may come. For all the wrongdoers, she will lay down the Keeper's Verdict upon them and show the world she means business.		This is not the end. This is just the beginning. Poppy, Keeper of the Hammer, embarks upon a new adventure. We shall always be one in Poppy and continue showering her with our undying love, for Poppy has given us so much more. 		In Poppy we trust. In Poppy we believe. In Poppy we unite.","depth":2,"score":361,"ups":361,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"forehead_tittaes","name":"t1_cxcobwx","parent_id":"t1_cxcjcip","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1448496220,"created_utc":1448467420}

Stopping dashes is legit on her W; I had a great moment when I saved myself from a Nidalee who tried to flash W me, and I was able to get my W up in time to stop her jump. She took damage from it, and then I was able to E Q her against a wall and kill her. Felt more skillful than just "well my passive means I take hardly any damage and I'll just keep one-shotting carries as the game goes on."		I think she needs damage items now, though. I tried full tank and it was underwhelming. Titanic into tank was great, though. Dead man's is applied on her passive, so you can slow people from a distance. But you DO need some extra punch to seal the deal. She's not a one-shot champion anymore (although I did try a full DPS build and she's super strong; she just dies quickly).

Poppy got stronger as the game goes (like Nasus), so shutting her down early doesn't matter if she can just farm up for late game. Poppy had a movespeed buff and a dash, so she could and would get into a fight no matter what. She could not be kited unless she was stupid because her ultimate, if used well, gave her more invulnerability than Kayle and more CC immunity than Olaf. Outnumbering her straight-up did not matter, Poppy's ult lets her completely ignore a numbers advantage, which is bonkers. Going into a fight 5v1 and expecting to lose 2 or 3 members of your team should not happen unless you're against Faker.		The "counterplay" for that was to go fight the rest of their team 4v5 because late-game Poppy would 1-shot whoever she wanted and there was nothing you could do about it, so don't do anything about it.

However back in patch 4.9 and before Skarner was a fantastic duelist, regardless of you're elo, of course people in high elo tend to lean more towards team fighting so anything that doesn't excel in team fighting is mostly just viewed as bad therefor making Skarner overall just a bad champion in every rendition for high elo, that doesn't make him a bad champion overall.

Fighter? sure, 1v1 monster? possibly, outside of a 1v1 scenario where you have to engage and CC, you could stun multiple enemies and slow just as many without the need for R, isn't that pretty good for your team? yeah more damage on Q would be cool, but it's the sheen reset ability and dealing AoE damage is the counterpoint to this, W still grants MS.

Most of that is what I build except 3 things, Cinder Hulk is garbage, the nerf was too hard to it, the sunfire damage doesn't get any use if you don't stick to your target, and it's way overpriced.

Guardian Angel is core in my build because my build focuses around the two good things about Skarner that are left. Q low CD, and W is a decent ability, with max CDR for W + Steraks, + GA, it becomes a lot harder to kill and Trinity Force/Steraks autos do a shit ton of damage even on a champion as weak as Skarner.		About yours though, both of the defensive boot upgrades feel really not worth it in the current patch, Swiftness and Lucidity are the two best boots right now, they are the only ones that feel worth the gold.

{"body":"20% cdr in masteries? assuming it's meant to say runes here, that's a pretty risky build with no MR and not much early reward until your scaling CDR is full-- 10% scaling is alright and you get more early combat stats, that aside, I run MR instead of CDR.		Cinderhulk isn't that great but it's still better than others for clear and sustain, you could pick Warrior and that's fine too, Banshee's has nothing to top Spirit Visage, same health and MR, the spell-shield is of no need to your tanky scorpion, Guardian Angel has good resistances but no health so it doesn't add to your W's shielding and has a difficult/expensive build path, Dead Man's Plate + Rage (Phage) + Furor are enough sticking power, you probably haven't tried it before to know.		Lesser health = easier to kill, GA's resistances are available on other items with health, the passive is cool but collecting the combine cost is troublesome for a frontliner who lives off assists most the time.		Ninja Tabi are my current favourites because if you're faceblocking everything you'll need the basic attack damage reductions, your shield can take it all and some more, worst case scenario you have Sterak's Gage for backup and again higher health = bigger shield for Sterak's Gage too.		Agreed Swiftness is pretty good right now if the enemy has low amounts of hard CC, Lucidity for your Flash-R, but my build is more tank than duelist, and it works best in teamfights, Alacrity is just k because it's not needed with DMP, Furor takes it's place for sticking power or Captain so your team can follow as you tear the enemies apart.		With my proposed build you'll have ~5000 health without Elixir of Iron, and 5200 with the Elixir, that's ~700 shielding from W, duration 6s with 8.8s cooldown at that point, uptime 66%, remember here it also has increasing / charging movement speed (good for DMP synergy).

Skarner is the one champion requiring me to actually get creative with the runes. http://puu.sh/lzepo/d017d9557e.jpg That's 2 armor quints and 6 marks, 5 AS marks because the odd number of armor you get if you go full armor marks bothers me and Skarner needs AS anyways, 20% CDR because hitting the cap with least sacrifice is essential. I rune health per level which gives me a decent hp pool vs mages by time I encounter, add in Trinity Force and Steraks hp, and the 18 defensive masteries.		Skarner doesn't have clear or sustain issues, if you have shield your hp will be fine, Skarners passive is useless in PvP but in PvE it gives you AS and limitless mana so no sustain issues there.		Warrior is never worth building ever, if anyone wanted Warrior they could just build ghost blade instead. It's same stats + active and armor pen. The only time you could even consider it is as Hecarim wanting blue smites movement speed steal, that's an argument I heard recently but I still think Ghost blade is suprior.		Guardian Angel serves the purpose of giving resistances in a low MR build, you're gonna need armor by third item every game and my build runs low MR which early works fine but you gotta get MR eventually, GA synergizes with Steraks which synergizes with Trinity Force (and Crystalline Exoskeleton) which synergizes with Skarners base AD. GA + Steraks is very hard to kill, drop em low and he gets a big ass shield, break through that and he revives once more.		Skarner is not a front liner that lives off Assists, I would never degrade a Fighter by playing them as the teams tank, my team either picks a real tank (or mundo) or I play on my own.

Then you have Fighters, these are damage dealers, like Assassins, but with a few differences, Fighters have a generally higher skill floor, and are a lot less insta kill type champions. Fighters are also the most spread out type of class, having some lean more towards durability than others (Such as Nasus - Riven) Fighters require durability in order to be able to survive long enough to do their damage because they can't just press a button over someone like talon can and then press all the other buttons in the correct order.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePurpleKnightmare","name":"t1_cxctkdu","parent_id":"t1_cxcs3sg","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1448504048,"created_utc":1448475248}

If you E someone into a wall and auto Q auto (and throw in a Titanic reset) you will almost certainly kill them.		Her Q, while no longer an auto reset (something I DO miss), still does really good damage. E is the same. Her W is very similar (except now it freakin stops dashes, which is cool), despite not providing instant AD. But you can still take Fervor and stack up and pretend it's the same. :p  Really the biggest difference is her ult, and they've talked for years about removing it. Now she has better teamfighting, IMO, because she can actually interact with her team instead of just pressing R and then auto-winning because she's immune to 80% of the team.		Between her passive and her W, she's still pretty tanky at low hp, which feels familiar. She just has to actually build some defensive stats instead of relying on admittedly broken ult. Yes, it felt cool, but it was not really healthy for the game. Now she has more nuance and counterplay, but she still feels very similar. There's just more depth to her kit.

League's diversity is in a great spot, evident by the amount of champs picked in games at Worlds. Hopefully the item changes extends that.

{"body":"They deliberately nerfed Poppy's laning phase to disincentivise her being played until she was reworked, and refused to touch her in any way that would really promote gameplay. Morello iirc outright stated if Poppy was ever meta again she was getting nerfed to unusability. It's true she was never as safe as Ekko's even with retuning, but old champ, added before mobility and skill creep. If Poppy had anything like a laning phase and could get going before 40 minutes she would still overwhelm the game. So just like Evelynn and LB before, they had to hit her where it hurt for her style of play: early. They nerfed her dash too although I'm not sure if that was just for mechanical consistency.		I agree Trist etc. were good picks against Poppy but you sort of need to pick your comp around her, just having one champ that can disengage is not very useful, particularly because of her burst with procs and crits. And I agree if you got to lategame as Poppy you earned it. But that was the point. If Poppy is in a game, she centralises it ridiculously, even when she remarkably can't hold her own in lane.		She is a ticking time bomb more than any other champion, because if she makes it out of laning phase with anything that looks like an item and an inner turret you can't stop her. Vayne, Kog, etc. all have much more exploitable points of vulnerability when fighting than Poppy, because of her ult. It's disproportionate. That's why she's said to have no counterplay, it's not just about being able to deal with her on a macro level but also on a micro level. If you can only delay her but never do anything when she inevitably reaches those points except hope you pushed all her turrets down is she really counterplayable or just possible to hold back?		edit: I feel like a better analogue would be Nasus or even old Mordekaiser, but there are more avenues to deal with Nasus nowadays. It's not like Poppy was a good champion, just broken in a certain way that is silly. And I think this of some modern champs too but I think the comparison to Ekko complaints are fairer to Poppy than Ekko, simply because people have more problem with dealing with Ekko in fights than 'you can't camp him in lane'. If you could delay Ekko he would still be Ekko in fights.		edit2: also I understand why some people don't like the Poppy rework, especially those who liked her as a champion, I felt the same about the Karma rework (although if old Karma and new Karma both existed I would play new Karma too) even though it made Karma better.
