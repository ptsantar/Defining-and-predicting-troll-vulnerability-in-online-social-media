{"body":"Hey all.		Thanks to everyone who helped support this cause, we raised awareness and contributed almost 12k $ to an incredible cause and organization [American Foundation for Suicide Prevention](https://www.afsp.org/), [Charity Rating on AFSP](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=6745#.Vc_6d1NVhBd)		The level of support from this community in only a few short hours was incredible and touched so many hearts. What started this all off was a viewer (Sebastian) reaching out in a time of need, and I figured that we could do a little extra to help raise some awareness for people feeling like Sebastian. The initial goal of 2k was blown away within 5 minutes and the level of support just kept growing until I couldn't keep reading the donations because my voice was giving out and they were coming too fast. Thank you so much everyone who took part in this event, but there is obviously still so much we can do to continue to raise awareness for this.		"Place your hand over your heart, can you feel it? That is called purpose. You’re alive for a reason so don’t ever give up.”		http://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/  Here is a list of international resources and hotlines if you need someone to talk to.		There are always people that will be there to listen, to love, and to care about you, so even if you are feeling down or contemplating hurting yourself, PLEASE just reach out to anyone that will listen, and you will be surprised at how much people do care and will help you pick yourself back up. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel.		This is the best community ever, thanks again and well done guys. Keep spreading the love and compassion and it will come right back to you.","depth":0,"score":2607,"ups":2607,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Voyboy","name":"t1_cu4m01e","parent_id":"t3_3h5o0v","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1439732162,"created_utc":1439703362}

{"body":"Hey Voy!		I work for a non-profit that provides free mental health care for the gaming community. Specifically, they acknowledge that gaming is often an escape for people really struggling with things internally. 		Most recently, our group has gotten into writing grants with the city of Los Angeles to cover the cost of therapy for low-income gamers, donate consoles and computers to youth homes, bring in a hotline for individuals having panic attacks or feeling suicidal, and host video game events in at-risk areas to promote gaming as a form of stress relief. 		I had our director email you with the subject title,  "Anxiety Gaming - A Mental Health Non-Profit". I think that the two of you could work out a lot of ways to take this awareness campaign to the next level. We hope to here from you soon!			Edit: Thank you so much for the gold and the $50 donation! Seriously, we have therapists in our network that do $30 sessions for low-income families, so $50 is going to really make someones day. For those of you out there struggling, please go to http://www.anxietygaming.com/ and apply.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for over 10 years. My dad committed suicide and ive attempted numerous times. Mother has issues. It pretty much runs in the family. The cost of my medication alone was more than 450 dollars. That's a red flag. The numerous therapists i've been too also arent cheap.

{"body":"I'm really sorry to read about the issues you and your family have faced. Depression can indeed spread from generation to generation almost endlessly, but it can be stopped. If you're interested in giving it a shot, feel free to contact us.		Concerning the piggy back: no one in our non-profit makes money from working here. All donations go straight to fueling the therapy grant that we offer. The original comment was fairly personal, with no links or mentions of the actual non-profit until it got bigger and was edited after many people asked. The fact that it's grown so much is really a surprise to me, but an amazing thing as we've been contacted almost hundred times today with people that we can help- which is all that matters to us.		As for the $450 cost, that's the average amount we pay out to therapists for the recovery of those that apply to our grant system. The reason is that we have deals worked out with therapists around the globe to provide care at $20-$50 a session, with the trade off being when we do receive individuals able to pay full cost, we refer them. We also help people apply for state disability and medicare, with the latter covering the cost of generic medication completely, or leaving brand name meds at $2-$5 a month. 		There are a lot of amazing resources out there aimed at treating mental health issues, but they're so well hidden that a lot of our job ends up being illuminating those things. I can very much appreciate that some of these things come off as a redflag, and I think that in most fields it should seem that way. Within Mental Health, you'd be surprised at how many people are willing to help for free, especially since so many providers have a history of mental health issues. For most of our team, it's all a matter of giving back after having fought for so long.		Again, there's really no risk in contacting us. No cost, no lose. You'd be contacting someone who's battled with depression and anxiety and can appreciate what you're going through. If anything, view it as a challenge. Can we really help you pay less for therapy?

{"body":"Doing research before donating is great but there are is a lot of misunderstanding when trying to find a cost efficient charity. A big problem with charitynavigator.com is that the calculation of how effective a charity is, as far as I could realize, is that it mainly looks at how much of the donations that go to a charity are spent on the actual programs instead of administration etc. What is does not do is calculate the actual effectiveness of the programs itself that a charity provides. This could lead to following example:		> * Charity A: 8% of revenue goes to administration and fund-raising, 92% goes to programs		> * Charity B: 28% of revenue goes to administration and fund-raising, 72% goes to programs		> Should you donate to A rather than to B? Unless you know that A's programs are as effective or almost as effective as B's, you don't have enough information to answer that question. Perhaps the reason Charity A spends so much less on administration is that it spends nothing on oversight and evaluation. As a result, the directors of A never discover that its programs are poorly suited to the regions in which they are carried out. Charity B gets detailed evaluations from its well-qualified staff and by ceasing to fund programs that are not working is able to ensure that 90% of its programs help the poor. If you knew this, you could calculate that when you give to A, 8% of your donations goes to administration and fund-raising, 83% achieves nothing and 9% directly helps the poor, whereas if you give to B, 28% of your donation goes to administration and fund-raising, 7.2% achieves nothing, and 64,8% directly helps the poor. B is the better choice. - Peter Singer		That shows that the money spent on the programs itself is not always helpful when trying to find a effective charity. I recommend you to check out [givewell.org](http://www.givewell.org/).

It's makes the people who step on others to get what they want look decent. I've been feeling this way for over 2 years, possibly even 3, and I with all my hate still do not hate myself. And I have a lot of hate.		Not everyone is me, so maybe my example means nothing but I just can't see how the two can ever be connected. Sure it's possible for both to be present in the same person, but the only way I can see them being connected is if you lose someone for something to you did and then hate yourself because of it.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePurpleKnightmare","name":"t1_cu4uoy2","parent_id":"t1_cu4osft","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1439764124,"created_utc":1439735324}

Once you have that idea in your head, it's easy to keep justifying it further, which results in full on self-loathing.

{"body":"Makes sense actually, don't know exactly what it has to do with my large amount of empathy, and I wouldn't say being depressed should make me see it that way. Honestly, I feel like I have been proven wrong to an extent, not that everything I've said was wrong but that I don't quite understand humans that well, I understand logic very well, and I knew I was no expert in humans, but since I am so different, it makes sense that I would not expect them to think like that, I expect everyone to make sense like I do. However when laid before me as you have done here, these possibilities, I can see people being like that, I could never be like that myself, just because of how much more logical I am then them. To be honest I hope he's faking, it means the situation is much less serious, and that a person trying to troll or get attention has unintentionally done something helpful with something that could have been harmful, because Voyboys charity stream is a good thing. That said looking back on my reasons for suspecting that I realize while it's still possible he is faking, it's not nearly as likely, not that it's unlikely, I was just wrong to think his wording made it more likely.		If I gave a line like that, I would be faking, if someone who thinks like me gave a line like that, they would be faking, but people aren't like me, anything you said could have happened, and there is probably more possibilities. If he's not faking I hope he gets the help he needs.		For my situation, I'm better off not alive, so I tend to think that someone else in my situation might be as well. I mean the only way to not lose something is to die before you get the chance, but now being reminded of how differently I think than others, I may be better off not alive, but maybe others in a simular situation can get over this, so I'm sorry for anything I may have said that made it seem like I didn't care, I do care, I did care before, and I do now.			For the record, please don't call me depressed, I've gone far beyond being depressed, and I never once was willing to use the term for myself, I'm not mentally ill, I just have a good understanding of my own feelings and I know what is best for me.

{"body":"Maybe, but you don't feel the loss and that's what's important. You don't need anything if you're dead, nothing lasts forever, for a normal person, you get over this by knowing there will future opportunities, lets use a love interest, if you lose someone you are interested in romantically a normal person thinks "At least I met them" "There will be someone else in the future" For someone like me, I'm hella boring, my idea of hanging out with friends is I follow them where they wanna go and am happy to be with them, it's not an issue of I want to do more and can't, I'm perfectly content with things like that, I wouldn't get any more enjoyment by going somewhere "fun" than I would just being around them. So my experiences with people are pretty lackluster, I love being around friends sure, but when I think back to the times I had with someone I've lost, I don't think it was worth it, they were great sure, but the loss I feel is so much worse than the time I spent with them ever could have been. It makes it so every loss I have ever, is going to be not worth it. It's not their fault for not being worth it, they totally are, to a normal person, but I just don't enjoy life to that extent, I enjoy friends, but the activities I could possibly partake with anyone, are all shit. I lose more than I gain everytime.		So I don't wanna say "There will be someone else" because I don't want there to be someone else, I had good friends, one of which I had strong feelings of love for, but I have no desire to replace them, because even on the unlikely possibility I find someone better, they are still not worth losing to me, and I can't not lose them if you live forever you will lose everything, the only way to not lose something, is to die before you have the chance. Like the batman quote "You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain" It's about change, it's unavoidable.		I don't want to die, I want to not live so that I don't have an opportunity to gain something that I would just lose later on.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePurpleKnightmare","name":"t1_cu5hyhl","parent_id":"t1_cu5hbcy","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1439808918,"created_utc":1439780118}

{"body":"Okay, I'll take your word for it. But do you think that going "man, that guy is fucked up" is helpful or constructive? Fuck it, he's reaching out to *whoever he can* because the dude feels so shitty that he doesn't know what else to do, that he would rather cease to *be* than continue dealing with crushing loneliness.		Should he have reached out to mental health services beforehand? Maybe. But I don't know what the state of mental health services is in [country]. I'm not sure I'd be willing to do that in some parts of the United States, because our social services are hellaciously lacking *and* the United States has a lot of cultural stigma about that, that you're crazy or defective or broken if you need that - even though it shouldn't be any different than going to the doctor because you have the flu.		Even if we assume that [country] has good mental health services and he's able to push past the stigma of mental healthcare, there's still the aspect of "does this person give a shit". I know in the United States, again, people burn out in mental healthcare really fast because the emotional side of it is just *exhausting* - and you have to convince yourself that this anonymous person that you're going to talk to through, say, a suicide hotline actually cares. And if you're at that state where you don't believe most of your friends and family care/you can't reach out to them, why should you trust some random person who's probably heard that same "nobody likes me I'm just gonna die" story 20 times before? ¹		So fuck it, if you're gonna die anyway, might as well reach out one last time to a dude who seems pretty nice and has kept you entertained, right? It's not like anyone gives a shit, you know he's not gonna answer, but hey, maybe he can do something with that money.		Is it an entirely fair viewpoint? No. But from the viewpoint of someone who is that depressed, his actions do make sense. (You'll find that a lot of people's actions make sense when you look at it through their eyes.)

[Make sure you are aware of the warning signs of suicide so that we can take better care of each other.](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-prevention-helping-someone-who-is-suicidal.htm) 		**Warning signs that might be relevant among mtg friends:** 		* **"Here, have my tickets to worlds. You're a good person and I want you to have them.** Often, people will give away valued possessions before they attempt suicide.	* **"I won't be around for much longer"** Statements like these can be warning signs.	* **"Hey, have a good life - won't be playing with you again"** Someone that is saying goodbyes and isn't going through a major, explained life change could be suicidal.	* Someone that is **always** playing league that hasn't shown up for a couple weeks in a row without reason could be going through a severe depressive episode. 	* **Sudden change in mood.** Often a sudden change of mood indicates that the sufferer has either entered a depressive episode or (if a dramatically positive change), could mean that they have come up with a plan to commit suicide. 		*****		**Remember QPR -**		*Question:*	If you see warning signs of suicidal ideation, be up front and ask the person if they have had any thoughts or plans of/for committing suicide. Note: **the wrong way** to ask this question is "You haven't been thinking about killing yourself, have you?" This is bad because it makes their thoughts seem secondary to your feelings. Instead, ask: "Hey, you've been going through some crap - have you been feeling out of sorts?" follow this up (if yes) with "Have you had any thoughts about killing yourself?" 		*Persuade:*	Persuade the person to seek medical help. Listen to them, offer them hope (such as you can), and let them know that you want to help them. Note that in this situation the "right" thing to say is often difficult for someone without training to know. Trying to offer hope and help (through a mental health professional) is usually the right thing to do. **Your only goal here is to get them to accept professional help.** Also note that while you may have had experiences with mental illness, everyone experiences it differently and stating that "I know what you're going through" can be a profoundly alienating statement for some people. For others it's nbd. Err on the side of avoiding the statement "I know what you're going through" or other statements along those lines. Calling a suicide hotline can also help.		*Refer:*	Refer the individual to the relevant crisis centers or professionals in your area. Could include clinics, police, ministers, teachers/professors, coaches, or counselors.		*****		A few myths:		**Myth:** Suicides can't be prevented.		* **Fact:** Over 60% of people that attempt suicide directly intimate their intent to a friend before their attempt. When people are referred to get help, outcomes are typically positive. 		**Myth:** Talking to someone about suicide is likely to "push them over the edge".		* **Fact:** Studies show that this doesn't happen, and talking to someone about suicide isn't going to cause "inception" and push that idea into their head.		**Myth:** People that talk about suicide are just joking.		* **Fact:** Don't ignore statements like these. You don't know if they are joking or not. This is especially true for statements that indicate hopelessness "I can't see any way out" being an example.		**Myth:** Suicidal people are all crazies.		* **Fact:** Mental distress doesn't mean a person is crazy. [Lifetime rates of mental illness are around 50%.](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/09/03/cdc-statistics-mental-illness-in-the-us/)		*****		**Remember:** Suicidal people have lost hope. Few people truly want to die. To people that are considering suicide, death is their only escape. The most important thing is to offer hope.		Not every suicide is preventable, and we should try to remember this during tragedies like these. Miko (my friend) certainly didn't show any of these signs to me. Still, many suicides are preventable, and we should do our best to take care of each other and keep this community strong.		If you would like to donate to an organization that helps prevent suicides, the [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetInvolved/Donate) is an excellent organization. If you would like proper training with the QPR method the QPR Institute has trainings at many public health and higher education offices throughout the USA.","depth":0,"score":95,"ups":95,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ScaldingHotSoup","name":"t1_cu4mggm","parent_id":"t3_3h5o0v","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1439733479,"created_utc":1439704679}

There are no niceties in this fight, no times when politeness or simple good will can suffice. Don't just pay and forget, pay and donate your time to those around you (even if it's just friends and family), and make sure that you give them hell for even thinking that suicide is ever an option. Help show them what options there are, and make sure they get up and go at them.

Of course, League being League, this horrific episode was swiftly followed by people I can most charitably characterize as "attention-seeking trolls" posting "jokes" about how Riot should name a self-killing suicide item after her. They were downvoted pretty harshly, but…the fact that these people even *exist* in the League community is pretty sickening. Or the people who "prank-called" another Rioter, who had posted his cell phone number on that Twitter thread begging Damiya to call him and talk it over. Yeah, awesome prank, guys. Give me a baseball bat and twenty minutes alone in a room with you and I'll tell you how fucking funny your hilarious prank was.		Okay, deep breath.

Great on Voyboy to have handled the situation so well and being such a good person, hoax or not. Suicide is a thing that people need to take seriously.		My best friend tried to commit suicide just a couple of weeks ago, and, while she lives in Canada and I live in Sweden, League of Legends has kept us close for about 5 years now. She messaged me before she was going to do it, and I immediately called her - in spite of the price of international calls.		That was the hardest phone call of my life.		Hearing my best friend tell me how she couldn't go on, how she was sorry, and later on having a panic attack to the point where she couldn't breathe - all the while, trying to get a hold of her roommate to get help - actual help, rather than just me talking to her.		I haven't been able to sleep properly since.		Please people, if anyone says anything alarming, like 'I don't know how I'd manage without you' or implications that you're the only one who cares - take it seriously! Ask the person how he/she is doing, and for the love of God, don't ignore it, as I did.		My friend may be alive, but if I didn't get a hold of her roommate, I fear what could've happened.

The ones who really want to do it, can't get helped, because simply spoken, some people just have nothing to live for anymore.   And who are we to stop them.

If at all, we should help them to go peacefully, without fucking Christians looking down upon it, or other morons trying to stop them making the most difficult decision of their lives.		I'm speaking from first hand experience.   A good friend killed himself while he had a big social network of people knowing he suffered and tried to help the best they could.   No 10k dollar or the help from so-called "therapists or psychologists" would have helped him.   				And my wife's brother did it too, while he was actually hospitalized psychologically for attempting it earlier because he lost his wife and kid in a divorce.	My wife was torn apart, but after all, it was his decision, and this is in no way egotistical.   Because that's the comments most people who kill themselves and still have a family get.

{"body":"It is harsh, though. I tried to commit suicide many times, and not in "attention seeking ways". I didn't have the support network your friend seems to have had; I was a ward of the state and had no friends. Once, I took an entire bottle of 30 pills of 150 mg Trazodone, once I screwed a screw into my arm until it came out the other side and then sliced my arm open lengthwise (I was in a mental hospital and that was the only tool available). I was definitely suicidal. But I got help, got better, and went on to get two degrees and have a highly successful careeer and life. I now love life, even though I still have depression. The idea that suicidal people should just be left to do it is, in fact, harsh. However, I also understand your perspective, because my mother killed herself. At the time I thought it was an extremely selfish act and I hated her for it. (Sorry, mom) At the time, I said, "well, fine, that's what you want to do, good Fucking riddance". Until my own depression kicked in and I understood. Of course, you may just be living up to your username here, but I wanted to give you and others the perspective from the other side of the glass. Since I was saved (literally, not in a religious way) I have, I think, done many good things for others. Of course, I've also done bad, as all humans do. But my life has meaning, I am worth something, and I'm glad people didn't let me die. Even if it was only because they were paid to do so.

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really.
