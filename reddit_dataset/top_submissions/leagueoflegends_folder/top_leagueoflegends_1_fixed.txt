Bear with me here... the second method also works. There are two caveats:		a.) It takes longer		b.) The "classes" need to shuffled around and changed after every comparison/competition		This is actually the way some smaller sorting algorithms work under certain circumstances. If you had 100 throwers divided into 20 teams, you could effectively find the best throwers using only team averages. Say the teams are labeled A-T, and you want the best 5 throwers on A, next best 5 on B, etc. down to worst 5 on T.		Randomly (or pseudo-randomly) assign all throwers to a team and then measure the team's average. Determine how optimized the current sorting is (basically, how well you did in making Team A> Team B>...>Team T), and then switch up the teams a little. Determine optimization again, and if it's better, keep that adjustment -- if not, change it back. Switch it up again, check for optimization, keep/change back, repeat. Once it reaches a point where no switches are optimizing the sorting any further, you've successfully found the top 5/next top 5/.../bottom 5.		This does, of course, take more time, and it would be much easier to simply measure individual results and sort accordingly. But it does get where it's trying to go.		Solo queue sorting could be perceived to work much in the same way. In theory, the check for optimization would be everyone having a 50% winrate. Maintaining a constant 50% winrate should keep your MMR and LP at the same levels, and you'll stay in place because the system's sorting is on point. Carrying games and winning more tells the system it's not optimized because someone has a >50% winrate, so it tries to place that someone higher up to see if their winrate stabilizes to 50%. It works the same in the opposite direction for <50% winrates. Short-term, it won't work perfectly, as bad players can get carried and good players can get held back by their team over short stretches of time. Long-term, if you're better than everyone else at your level, you're going to win more than you lose, and you're going to climb until your win rate levels out to 50%.		And so the question of, "If it takes longer, why can't we just measure players by their individual metrics?"	comes up.		And the answer is pretty simple. Winning is the only thing that matters. You can go 20/0/10 and ward like an LCK jungler all game, but if you can't convert those massive leads into wins, then you're not better at the game than the 0/7/1 Proxy Singed who consistently guides his team to victory at the same level as you.","depth":11,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Zephaerus","name":"t1_ctuiznw","parent_id":"t1_ctugk2f","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1438955721,"created_utc":1438926921}

Low elo idiots telling the Bronze 4 players that they are bad because they aren't Bronze 2 yet? The ranked ladder is nothing but a ladder of who wins more games.

Yes, I know, but we are looking at a very objective topic in two different ways. I want to know how likely somebody is to influence their game enough to make them more likely to win. You could call this skill, but where do you draw the line for 'skill' when ultimately it's just 'being good at winning'? You on the other hand are presenting individual skill as the ability for somebody to play the game, regardless of outcome. Since the end goal of every game is to *win*, I would argue that you're wrong about this, but ultimately it doesn't even matter.

{"body":"This is an interesting discussion. I like this discussion. Anyway, back to it...		What I was trying to imply is that the sorting algorithm is actually super similar to how the system currently works, not that it would be an effective replacement. Kind of irrelevant, really. The important takeaway is that if everyone played 10000 ranked games and did not improve/get worse at the game over that time frame, the end result would be a ladder that almost perfectly represents the skill levels of all players.		The reason for this is that, for each individual player, the only constant in all of their games is their own self. If a player is at a certain level and is a negative factor on their team against players of the same level (so they effectively make it harder for their team to win), in the long run they're going to lose more than they win, and over time they will fall down the ladder. The same goes for people who are positive factors on their team at a certain level; they'll win more than they lose, and they'll climb.		Essentially, if you are better at winning than other people at your current rank on the ladder, you're going to win more than you lose. It may take some time for that trend to make itself evident, but it **will** make itself evident. Winning more than you lose means you climb.		And we're ok with this, because at the end of the day, the skill of "helping your team win" is really what matters. Objectively and accurately measuring it would be nearly impossible. People care how you perform individually because we have some concept of what leads to winning. Being 0/7/0 only 10 minutes into the game significantly hurts a team's chances of winning. Being 2/0/5 significantly helps a team's chances of winning. But there are also a lot of intangibles -- chat behavior, pings (and their relevance to the game), shotcalling, positioning, decision making, teamfighting and enemy prioritization, blowing enemy summoner spells, effective baiting (but not getting asissts), and so on.		So rather than try to create some obscenely complex metric that would take a ton of computing power to calculate for each individual game, we stick with the one metric that really matters above all else -- the ability to positively influence your team and guide it to victory. If, at your rank, you are better than average at helping your team win, you will win more often than not. And it's because your teammates are random; the enemy team is random; you are not random. You are in 100% of the games that you play, and nobody else is. In the long run, your 4 teammates and the 5 players on the enemy team will work out to be of equal caliber. But the 10th player is you, and your skill level relative to the other 9 is what will make you win or lose.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Zephaerus","name":"t1_ctum53q","parent_id":"t1_ctujamm","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1438966995,"created_utc":1438938195}
