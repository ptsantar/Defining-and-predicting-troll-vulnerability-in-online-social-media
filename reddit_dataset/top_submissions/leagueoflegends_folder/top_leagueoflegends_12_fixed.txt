Other than that, I think it's too early to tell.		As far as Maple goes, despite his less than successful stint on T8, i never really thought he was the issue. He's also grown immensely as a player, and looks much stronger than he did last year in challenger. Their synergy is also very good, from what I can see. Regardless, RNG has Jebus waiting in the wings if they doubt him (though I personally think \#keepoddbro is a much better investment).		All in all, I'm curious what made you decide that.

I ran the numbers so I know. He is LCS bottom tier. But he's not fucking Mash, so he will carry a little here and there. If CS is anything to go by it's going to happen more often than RF or Alex doing it. 		As for RF, and he will get abused against the LCS guys like Impact, Quas, Dyrus, Zion, Hauntzer, Balls but I don't think the lower tier is that much of a threat. I'm not saying he's good, but he'll get by on the standard Maokai/Shen type stuff. He will lose lane randomly, but he will also have games he lanes well and shows up to team fights well. 		I agree Crumbz is pretty bad (I still think he's bottom 3 NA LCS) but I disagree on Alex carrying games. If you actually watch RNG games you'd notice Alex didn't do much. He's consistently solid, knows what he's doing, rarely makes mistakes. But he didn't look like a LCS carry threat anymore. That could always change but I wouldn't bank on it. 		Anyways, RNG has their issues. But I don't think it's as simple as ban Thresh, win game. Remilia is a good Morg, Braum, Janna player anyway and playing LCS you will pick up Annie, Alistar, and whatever else the meta needs. And besides, the point is Alex, Crumbz, RF, and Maple, while not a collection of great players, will have a few things worth banning on any given patch.

I also feel like it's easier to transition a play-making skill shot support player to other styles than engage heavy, tank style support players to skill shot playmakers.

{"body":"I think it's a more complicated situation because, like you said, he's never been as booed hard as he has been in recent times, and in recent times there have been racial issues tied up in it.  So the increased fervor of the booing probably feels race related to him, because it came on the tail of controversial race related situations.  		The two controversies were a girl in the crowd called him an ape, and he singled her out and got security to take her out.  People criticised him for that because she was only a teenager, but I think it's completely valid to call someone out for calling you an ape.  Then he started vocally saying that there is a race problem in australia, I think that's valid.  There are still a lot of lingering race issues here, but people don't like to hear it.    		The other thing was during the Indigenous Round, he celebrated a goal by doing a native war dance.  This is the more complicated one because celebrating your goals with a showy dance is Not Done in Australian football, so some or maybe even a lot of people would be booing him for that.  But probably some people would be booing him for doing a native dance because some people are just racist.  		I think it's more complicated than just wearing the hate because saying something about it makes it worse.  I don't particularly like Goodes but I think he's on the money when he comes out and says a lot of people in Australia are still racist, and that's something that needs to be said.  I think it's different with Remilia though, largely because all of this stuff happens on the internet, and getting into a shitfight on twitter or reddit is a lot more personally toxic than speaking to the media about things you don't like and letting people hate you from a distance.

{"body":"Actually no I wouldn't and if I did I would go back to therapy and deal with my problems. I have had enough shit happen in my life and have dealt with a lot of my own personal demons. People can bring up things that happened in my past without real issue because I know how to cope, I have learned proper ways to deal with my feelings, shames, and burdens. By letting things from her past hurt her like that she lets them chain her down, those events have control over her, not the other way around. If something like that really bothers her then she hasn't learned how to deal with it and properly live with the past. 			Personally I would recommend therapy for anyone who has triggers/shames/PTSD/unresolved issues/mental disorders. Shit is really helpful and depending on what you do or who you see can seriously solve or at least alleviate  the pain these problems are causing. Getting triggered or offended is on the person being triggered or offended, unless someone is being malicious. It is not up to everyone else to "walk on eggshells" so to say, to protect them. If she has a problem with public information about her then that's on her to learn to cope with, not run away from. 		Fuck it, I don't talk about it on this account but I really don't give a shit anymore, no regrets. I like to crossdress. For some people they would be horribly ashamed. I used to be, but then I discussed it with my therapist and I decided I was not going to hide it. My family knows and they aren't bothered by it. My GF knows and encourages it (thank fuck for that). At one point I was so conflicted and ashamed and confused I thought I might be trans. I'm fairly certain I'm not (no dysphoria) I just like to dress like a girl and feel pretty sometimes. I used to be ashamed and after time and discussion I eventually dealt with my shame and got over it. Will I be upset if someone calls me a fa****, even if they don't know what I do? No because I accept what I am and I'm not going to let some shitbird get to me. Or even better, am I going to get upset at someone for talking about crossdressing near me? No of course not.		I have anxiety disorder and take medication for it. Should I be upset if some random idiot calls me crazy or reminds me of it? Again no because I have dealt with my problems (with help) and have moved on.

You watch them play, or read their guides, or ask them questions. Summoner School is such a big resource for a reason. By the time you get to a high enough the only way you're really going to learn anything about the game is basically by talking to other people one-on-one, because self-study can only get you so far. Eventually you'll reach a point where you just can't see your own flaws, or don't know how to fix them. Same reason why author's need an editor. Finding those people to talk to one-on-one to teach you all about that one special trick, or how to deal with that one weird lane, generally requires actually knowing people.
