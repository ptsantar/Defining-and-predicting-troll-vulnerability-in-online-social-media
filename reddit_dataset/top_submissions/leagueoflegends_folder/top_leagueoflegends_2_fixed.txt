{"body":"Reminds me of this post from the Gears of War 3 forums. Anyone who played gears 3 near launch should appreciate this one:			Epic Games acquires NBA	Cary, NC - Big news today in the world of professional sports. Hugely successful video game firm "Epic Games" has acquired the NBA for an undiscolsed amount, reportedly made possible from record profits from their "Gears of War" series. Epic executives promise to "Make the NBA more accessible to the public and people who aren't good at basketball" , when asked why this needed to happen Epic had this to say: "Well we just feel like a lot of people are being left out not just from the NBA, but basketball in general. There are a lot of people that would like to play basketball, but just don't have the skills to do so. We plan on rectifying this issue through a series of rule changes to be coming in 2012 to not only the NBA, but basketball as a whole". More news as this story develops.		**UPDATE 9.26.11**		Cary, NC - Outrage has erupted since Epic has released their revised rules for the NBA to make it "more accessible" along with reasons for each rule change. Every single member in the NBA is threatening to quit and leave the league, but Epic does not care because polls show that they have about 25 times the number of players eligible to play in the NBA then previously since the bar has been set so low concerning the amount of skill needed to have success in the league. More people playing in the NBA means more of their family members supporting them and purchasing tickets and memorabilia, and while all original NBA players and fans are expected to leave - projected profits have never been higher due to the new wave of players and fans. 		Impending NBA rule changes:		- Rims have been shortened to 6 feet tall on both sides of the court	*We felt that the rims were to high, and slam dunks were to difficult to do for the average person. Slam dunks are a lot of fun, and we think everyone should experience them. Veteran players can still slam dunk, but now those who are new to the sport can as well. We feel this makes it more fun for everyone.		- Dribbling is now an option	*Dribbling the ball while you walked could get to be very difficult, especially when you've got guys after you trying to hit it out of your hands. We also noticed instances of really good ball handlers just walking all over novice and inexperienced players, which would cause a lot of people to just quit basketball all together. They had no drive to get better because the stuff the very good players were doing looked "Very hard to do". So what we did to remedy this was make dribbling optional. This way it evens the playing field. If say, and Allen Iverson would like to dribble all over the place and be fancy then he still can. And if say, Joe the Plumber who has never played basketball before picks the ball up and runs to the other side of the court - he can. It's now fair for everyone.		- All shots are worth 3 points besides free throw shots, no more 3 point line distinction.	*Having the 3 point line was a real deterrent to new players in the league. It's so far away! If someone like say, a Ray Allen has the skill to make those cool looking shots then that's great but a newer player shouldn't be at a disadvantage just because he practices so much. To help balance things out all shots are now worth 3 points (besides free throw shots). A skilled shooter still has the advantage because they can score points further away from the basket then a lower skilled player, this just closes that gap a bit more.		_____	Copyright The Associated Press","depth":2,"score":38,"ups":38,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"red_rhllor","name":"t1_cnvkr59","parent_id":"t1_cnvefa2","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1421832983,"created_utc":1421804183}

I also remember plenty of matches ending with consecutive smoke grenades knocking down players and landing free kills.

Riot wants a happy balanced games with small changes over time so that the game is fun and playable over a wide array of champions. They're mostly successful at this, despite a great deal of whining and some design flaws.		Icefrog wants a fresh game with interesting and fun mechanics. Icefrog does care if a hero is too strong, but for the most part hero selection allows for serious counterpicking and mind games so it's less of an issue if a hero is too strong.		One of the biggest running jokes on this topic is related to the fact that these sweeping changes happen all at once. Base stat changes go together with mechanics changes. The joke is that it wasn't the ginormous buff to his mechanics that makes Doom so strong, it's the 1 point boost to armor, as if the balance was so darn delicate that the 1 armor totally broke the champ forever.
