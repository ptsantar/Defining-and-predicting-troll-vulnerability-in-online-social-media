{"body":"Honestly, when I first heard about and read the leaked contract info, I was struck at how un-Riot it sounded. We had a huge internal discussion amongst probably hundreds of Rioters, and I sensed a strong, common sentiment: from our perspectives as Rioters and with our belief in Player Experience First, this didn't meet our standards--and was therefore not acceptable.		Even though I am not in eSports—I am a QA Analyst on the Skins team—I am a player of the game. I have loved League, played it, and watched streams for going on 2.5 years. Now that I work at Riot, guess what? Nothing's changed! I still love this game. I still love to watch streamers. The part of the contract that restricted what games streamers could play while broadcasting felt very out of character for us. I understand we are sailing uncharted waters in the world of eSports, and we are bound to make mistakes (and have!) but the real measure of success is how we recover and continue forging ahead with this new phenomenon, safe in the knowledge we are doing what's right by our fans and players.		I personally spoke out against the decision internally and am very happy to see it changed. I don't want to watch Dyrus miss his Challenger promo again, but if it's because he's playing something else to entertain himself AND his fans during champion select/queue, then so be it.

{"body":"It is not BS at all. I mean, you have a product, LOL that makes money. Riot is offering official support (more viewers) and MONEY to individuals to stream footage of their property. The Player can take the contract or leave it. But if they take it, Riot wants them to promote their product if they are going to take their money. It is like a commercial for beer. Budweiser competes with Coors for example. If Budweiser buys ad time and a TV company decides to stream a coors commercial during that time, Budweiser just got ripped off. It is the same with this. 		Now, streamers have long queue times. So they play games to fill up the time since the stream cant just be commercials in between games or else people will stop watching. Fair enough. Riot obviously know this, so they did not ban all games. If you read above, aside form the obvious competition form blizzard they banned some pretty specific games. Why? Well, it seems like some game companies have chosen to PAY the players to play their games, not on their own, but DURING the time they receive support from Riot. That is called playing both sides. It is pretty unethical and certainly hurts Riot. SO they made this clause. 		So what happened? Well, we conveniently ignored that all of these clauses only apply when Riot is actually giving these streamers the resources to increase their viewership. Thats pretty bad on the players who took both contracts. 		I like comparing it to a soccer player who has a contract from Nike to use Nike shoes during closed practices, public sports related appearances and games. To then go and take a contract from Adidas that says that he will wear the shoes when he is practicing means he is violating the contract from Nike even though it is just a practice. 		As a person involved in this kind of thing law and IP contracts, I totally get where Riot was coming from and think the community really fucked up because it does not understand how Riot LOSES hard from other content being streamed. It just goes to show how a bumch of Redditors really dont know the first thing about making a successful business based on programs or contract law.

{"body":"I don't usually post about the drama crap here, but I just wanted to say thank you for changing your position on the matter.  I am normally very ambivalent in regards to matters like this, but this issue really left a bad taste in my mouth. 		LCS players may play other games during their stream, but it's pretty obvious that the audience is there to see them play LoL at a high skill level, the other games just  fill in time between the *real* content.          		 I really enjoy League of Legends and I could only see bad things coming for RIOT had your previous stipulations stood.  I mean I understand why you guys want to protect your identity when you have money tied up in the image, but the rules as they stood, just didn't fit the esports scene. 		Also thank you for giving us some insight into your reasoning, it is absolutely understandable in that regard, and I think the new rules better address the issue.  Please keep perusing professional LoL with a pro esports purpose in mind,  the benefits will far outweigh the negatives for LoL. You really don't want LoL to exist in an esports vacuum, the scene in NA just isn't strong enough yet for that to be viable, and it would end up damage LoL and NA esports in general.  		Have confidence in your product, I don't think you have anything to fear, in regards to similar games, increased popularity of esports in general is a net positive for RIOT, even if it ends up benefiting other companies as well. People will remember which company made it possible in the first place. 		Lastly, thank you for not being afraid to admit that you approached the issue in the wrong way, too many companies are afraid to admit mistakes, and end up sticking by terrible decisions because of it.

{"body":"If there's a 6 figure salary for flipping burgers I'd instantly drop my career for sure :) 		You caught me on SC though, but I want to disagree heavily on the quake stuff, because it's far from being being able to attract a huge audience (yet?). 		Starcraft is kind of in a strange position.. While it really is a great game and has a very respectable amount of loyal players and fans, it's lacking something (can't figure out what exactly it is myself) to heavily break in on the western market as a huge e-sport scene.. Or maybe people are just a little scared by the enormous fascination the Korean (or generally asian) e-sport market has for SC.. 		And for other mobas there's pretty much only dota2 which would be in a position to take the #1 status from riot. But I'm not really into the whole dota2 vs League stuff to be objective enough, so I'll go on with my personal reasons, that keep me from switching to dota2:		1. I tried it 2 weeks or 3, but it kind of felt very clunky to me while playing it		2. The map and everything on it is just dark and doesn't have a lot of contrast, which makes playing it a pretty stressful job for my eyes. And I simply don't like the dark look of everything. (especially at night it gets really tiring for my eyes) 		3. Maybe that changed a bit since I tried it, but it was a very frustrating experience to try getting into the game (knowledge / theoretical wise) 		While I like quite few things more that valve does than riot, these reasons above just keep me from picking up dota2, and maybe some people are having similar problems with it. 			I kinda lost my point that I was trying to get to now, sorry about that :( But I don't want to delete everything, maybe someone still reads something interesting here :/		PS: looking forward to see how this whole e-sport scene develops over the next few years. Also I'm interested in the future of dota2..

{"body":">How do you even know. HOW DO YOU KNOW!?		Oh IDK. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE THREAD WE'RE IN YOU FUCKING RETARD? DID YOU READ THE POST? HERE, LET ME POST IT AGAIN SO YOU CAN.		>Hey everyone,	There’s been a ton of discussion around our LCS team contracts, which stipulated active LCS players couldn’t stream a variety of other games.	First, background on why we did this: there’ve been instances of other game studios trying to buy access to League fans by using (or trying to use) LCS teams/players to promote their competing games on stream.	The way we chose to deal with this was clearly an overreach. It hit our goal of preventing companies from advertising through LCS players, but it also encroached on pros’ ability to have fun and entertain viewers during long Challenger queues – and we realize that’s not cool.	After reading all of your comments and having a LOT of internal debate over the last 24 hours, we’re going to be changing the LCS team requirement to something that more closely matches our intent. While under contract to the LCS, teams and players can’t accept sponsorship from other game companies to promote other titles. Besides that, they are free to stream any games they want.	I'll be hanging around to answer questions if you guys have any. Thanks for helping us make a better decision on this.		Do you see it yet? How about now?		>If you have half a brain, you'll realize that it was probably Travis who obtained the documents.		I don't care. I don't know that for sure, so I'm not speculating shit.		>While we're at it, try fucking disputing this with me, because you certainly don't require evidence where accusations are concerned.

{"body":"Here is how contracts work:		Company A meets and drafts contract. They finalize it and send it to company B. Company B reviews it and will send it back with revisions aka counteroffer. Company A will review and discuss whether these changes are agreeable, and send it back with their own revisions. This continues until an agreement is reached and then it is signed.		Slashered seems to be stuck on this idea that he truthfully presented the "final contract". This may have been the "final" contract in terms of Step 1 (ie. the "final contract" that Riot sent out for negotiations), but it certainly wasn't the final contract that was *signed*, as per Saint and Dyrus' statements. Saint saying it was an "old" contract was most likely in the sense that it was an old version of a contract which was still under negotiation, not "old" in the sense that it was from a year ago		Basically: Riot sends out contract v1.0, Slashered reports contract v1.0. By the time this hits the internet, teams and Riot are probably already on contract v1.6, and thus Saint says it's an old contract. As of this statement from RiotMagus, Riot are now sending out contract v2.0, at which point teams will *continue* to negotiate this until a final contract is agreed upon and signed		The thing people seems to not understand about this situation is that contracts are AGREEMENTS of the parties involved. If you do not agree with the parameters of a contract, you are within full rights as an organization to establish your own counter offer. This has never been in question, and is the main reason that no major teams have made a huge fuss about this, because organizations like Curse, TSM, CLG, etc. are fully within their ability to decide their own fates and not be strong-armed. People act like **multi-million dollar organizations** are somehow helpless children.		If the well being and financial security of their players were ever in question, the **teams themselves** would have brought this issues to light via forfeiting from the LCS. But they didn't, and no team or player has. Why? Because the contract was still under negotiation and players, eventually, **agree** to conditions they find acceptable. Nobody fucking runs to the aid of Coke sponsors because they can't drink Pepsi, or the voice-over for Ford commercials who can't drive Toyotas. This entire situation is ignorant children who wear anonymous masks and think Ralph Nader is the best presidential candidate because they've never been in the real world.		I work for a pharmaceutical company and have several contracts with hospitals. There is an ***ungodly shit ton*** that I can never, ever, ever talk about.

{"body":"I know this probably won't be answered and will be downvoted to oblivion.		But why does riot constantly try to play the guy who is trying to promote esports as a hole, but has consistantly done stuff like almost preventing their players from streaming other games and has consistently bribed/tried to bribe tournament organizers to not host other MOBAs ( Or at least used to.). And yet, you do this, trying to appear to be good natured and "the good guy", your reasoning doesn't explain why you removed Guardsmen Bob from your featured stream list for doing this, when he wasn't under contract, and didn't even send him an email ahead of time warning him this could happen.		Sorry, maybe I'm just jaded, but I would just like Riot to stop appearing to be the good guys, and then do shitty things and make up for it and everyone seems to forgive them. Hell I still haven't forgiven them for being lied to about Replay system and the lack of ANY  real information on whats happening with that. Or the fact that League uses probably the WORST client, especially for a game of its popularity.		Edit: I know I just seem like some mad Riot hater. But I'm honestly not. I LOVE Esports. I plan to get into it when I get my graduate degree. And I just want riot to have some accountability. They say they have "built this sport from the ground up" ( Which I don't really think is true, they've advanced it sure but I digress) and I want them to realize, it's not all about making money.

{"body":"A couple things, 		1, Riot never paid for tournament organizers to not host other MOBA's. What you're referring to was a recent PAX in which any game which required bandwidth would have be be paid for by the company in which to have it available. Riot paid to have bandwidth which got them League installed on all of the computers and allowed their fanbase to play their game while attending PAX. On the other hand, Valve didn't pay for bandwidth which in turn made them not have DOTA 2 installed on the computers so people were not able to play it. It was made a big thing because people thought Riot was forcing them out when in reality they actually just put forth the money to have their game accessible while Valve did not.		2, They didn't lie about the replay system. It has been on PBE for quite a while now. The issue is, currently, servers are struggling enough as they are(EUW) so adding more stress by forcing them to save replays won't help. It also takes a long time to iron everything out on such a system. There are loads of issues with LoLReplay and I feel as though Riot doesn't want to release something that may not work properly AND have it possibly cause more issues with server stability. 		3, the whole Guardsmen Bob argument is pretty flawed from you. You go on to talk about how he is not under contract but make a big deal about him losing a PRIVILEGE? I have never watched his stream and I have never heard anything bad about him but Riot gave him a privilege and although it would obviously be nice to be informed as to why it was taken away, he was not under contract so Riot doesn't owe him anything.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hock3y","name":"t1_cdvqj4s","parent_id":"t1_cdviodo","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1386434218,"created_utc":1386405418}
{"body":"1. No, this is something that goes back to the day when they used to have to pay Dreamhack to allow them into tournies. ( This is easily confirmed as their tournaments used to be "Showcase" or whatever games, and all these games were confirmed to have to pay to host the tournies.) They bribed MLG atleast once to NOT host other MOBA's and tried to bribe other mobas. I can't find the source right now but I will keep looking. Here is a confirmed story of them trying to bribe teams to not host other MOBA teams if they have LoL teams http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=366477.		2. So you don't think it's a lie that they stated first that the replay system would be out for SEASON 1. Which is what, 3 and a half years ago? Secondly, thats a very flimsy reason, considering how long they've been working on it, and considering how their client isn't server side, they could easily host replays there if they wanted.		3. The thing is you are right, it was a privileged, and I don't really mind they did this from a purely business perspective, it's the fact that Riot and all their fanboys claim they are these white knights.

You might not get a chat box to talk to them other then friend list, but it was an experience. Maybe end up on their friends list and become friends with them.		Genius since clearly they made a lot of fame behind the game, a card game with 1 set cards should not have 6-12k viewers constantly.

{"body":"EA is a great example for what happens when you let professional managers run a gaming company (or any company for that matter). The interest becomes short term profit. A Dragon Age game made in one year with lots of DLC makes way more money than one that takes several years of development. The issue with this is that you are risking consumer trust, which hurts on the long run. Shareholders and professional CEOs wont give a shit about that tho, cause theyll be over the hills and far away (and by "far away" I mean "Hawai") by then. Essentially, the company gets out of touch with the consumers. You can see that with Riot already (I blame Tencent for that tho..), however, were not quite there yet and hopefully wont get there. That LCS contract was actually a gigantic step into the direction EA is sitting in right now because it essentially only protected corporate interests over consumer interests. Im glad its gone and I hope its not a sign of the direction this is headed in. Im not opposed to Riot being a business and acting like it, however, I do hope that they continue to prioretize long term consumer trust over short term gains.","depth":3,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iTomes","name":"t1_cdvhq4k","parent_id":"t1_cdvgu0k","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1386407069,"created_utc":1386378269}

{"body":"Here's a few sample quotes to give you the flavor of the internal discussion. I haven't modified any of the text between the quotation marks, but these are not entire posts (I pulled some of the most evocative and representative quotes): 			>"I’m not convinced in the slightest that this is the correct course of action. We are, at our core, gamers who make the games we want to play. How can an authentic group of gamers think that strong-arming our core community advocates and players is acceptable? How can we honestly look in the mirror and say “what we are doing is Player Focused"?"			Another one: 		>"Although I can see the parallels we’re trying to draw with the NFL and other pro sporting organizations, there’s a lot of not-very-Riot-y things they do. We should be careful how we use them as a model."			Another one: 		>"Honestly, I’m surprised by this. It feels like a betrayal of the values we all believe in. In this case, I feel we need to grit our teeth, put things right, and be prepared to eat humble pie for a while. It’ll hurt, but it’s the Riot thing to do."			Another one: 		>"This isn't a good experience for players, either the professionals who make their living streaming our game, or the many viewers that continually make League of Legends the most popular game on twitch."			Another one: 		>"When I heard this opinion, as a passionate Rioter and fellow gamer… it really hurt. It hurt, and it made me angry."			Another one: 		>"Can we honestly say that we’re player focused if we look at that and don’t find a better solution to the problem? We wouldn't have made it this far without the support of our players, and we won’t be able to hit our future goals without them either."		This internal discussion, which was largely consistent with what gamers were saying in public forums, helped us evaluate and quickly come to a better solution to the original problem, which as we've mentioned elsewhere, involves game publisher/developers who had offered to pay pro LoL streamers to promote other games.","depth":4,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vladcole","name":"t1_cdw3vlt","parent_id":"t1_cdvk8v5","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1386483939,"created_utc":1386455139}

Twitch is full of different games, many heavy influences on eSports, how much difference would it make if say hearthstone or starcraft2 sponsored dyrus?

{"body":"Forgive me, I don't like being negative, and I don't like being that guy, but I can't help but be skeptical about the reasoning as to why Riot tried to implement these policies in the first place. You say it was because other studios trying to buy access to League fans, but I just don't buy that. I feel like this was another attempt by Riot to tighten their grasp on League teams. 			While that may sound stupid, why wouldn't Riot want to consolidate their presence in both League and MOBA scene by making it so their players didn't play other games? You have to remember, Riot has claimed, on multiple occasions, that they want to grow the eSport scene as a whole. Riot's past actions have always contridicted their statements. As such, I think the reasoning that Riot has given is bullshit, and in reality they're doing this in a petty attempt to remove the free advertisment their competition is receiving. 			I want to state again, I understand that Riot is a business, and that of course you don't want to help your competition, but Riot claims that they want to help eSports as a whole. Riot's claims, and their past actions have always contradicted each other, and because of that we, as a community, should always question their reasonings, and judge their actions. 			I personally don't believe Riot's reasonings on this, I think they just wanted to continue their campaign League as the only game, by doing all they can to shut down advertisment on other popular games. I would be more incline to believe Riot on this if they hadn't been targetting games like Heartstone, World of Tanks, Fat Princess, games that have nothing to do with MOBA. You can make an argument that they target Heartstone because it's a Blizzard game, and Blizzard is coming out with Heart of the Storm, but Fat Princess? Like, what's the reasoning behind that one? I'd also be more incline to believe Riot, if they hadn't been forcing the LCS contract onto non-LCS players, like Guardsmen Bob. What was the reasoning behind taking Twitch.tv Featured Streamer? He plays Heartstone in the que times, he's not an LCS players, why the hell is he being held to their contract standards. 			I don't know, maybe the past moves by Riot have just made me bitter, but I can't help but look at their statements and words the same way I look at politicians words. They look and sound nice, but I always just assume they're full of shit.

{"body":"> It's interesting, because while the original issue was blown out of proportion by the commenters in the first place, the overwhelmingly negative reaction is what led to the change.		> It'd be nice if everyone involved tried to be reasonable about things, and also if that were effective.		This is a common misconception. Coming from someone who has industry experience with online communities, what changes the mind of a company is not necessarily 100 million rage comments about how something sucks, but the percentage of those comments that are reasonable and constructive. All the mass outrage does is carve a general idea of how a community's sentiment is regarding an issue, and that it does need to be addressed at some point. But it isn't always what is directly responsible for changing something. It only seems like that because of what subsequently happens.		An enraged "this sucks" doesn't really do much in terms of allowing community people who work for games to actually provide the right amount of feedback to the company about what needs to change. In fact if all I saw was irrational hatred for something and it wasn't viable to fix, it was very difficult to get the company to understand what was wrong. But a "this sucks, here's why, and here's how I think it could be improved or fixed" is what gets compiled, quoted, and passed up. I wouldn't be surprised if this was how Riot operates - after all, with such a massive community they have no choice but to look closely at and perceive good, constructive arguments and file much of the rest of it under a general sentiment that the community is responding negatively to something decided. 		Reasonable and constructive negative criticism is truly the vehicle for changing policies and things because they provide a measured argument other than blind anger to elicit such change. The problem is that it is often obscured by a massive amount of noise that people think is effective. Pitchforks and torches may help drive the change along, but how and whether it does get acted upon is driven by people "reasonable about things".","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dresdenologist","name":"t1_cdvgxcd","parent_id":"t1_cdvgjxr","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1386405018,"created_utc":1386376218}

{"body":"If you think 4 months without a hero is a pain I can't imagine how you would've felt back in Dota 1 when new heroes were introduced at a similar pace. Entitled much? Also it's quite obvious that those regular releases were because heroes were the main priority back then. They had a dozen heroes playable by the time the International was hosted (DK, Kunkka, Riki, BS just to name a few) so it only made sense that heroes would be released at a faster pace.		Fast forward to now and not only is the number of Dota 2 staff smaller but the focus has shifted to maintaining and improving the game experience (especially for newer players) and adding new features. Seriously the people crying over new heroes are a bunch of whiney fucks. The hell is 6 heroes (out of 112) left to be implemented compared to tutorials, improved matchmaking, addition of ranked matches, a crafting and socketing system and a bunch of other quality of life changes? Heroes will come in time and if you knew anything about Valve you'd realise that they spend a bunch of time trying to get the character right.		There are two extremes here. Valve doesn't seem to talk much while Riot can't seem to shut the fuck up. Sorry but Valve talks when it needs to and explains things thoroughly meanwhile Riot seems to send out drones to thank those who praise them with sweet talk while attacking those who are negative towards them. They are obsessed with explaining each and every one of their actions and at times presenting it as fact rather than opinion. As for bug fixes, most remaining ones are slightly irritating at best and do not affect the quality of gameplay at all.		What exactly is it that they lose to Riot?

Nope.	- A game like Dota 2 or LoL is never going to be finished. 	- There is no arbitrary full stop/period to such a game concept. 	- (Of the 8 unported heroes) the only remotely competitive ones are Pit Lord/Abyssal Underlord and perhaps Terrorblade and Oracle. All of the others may or may not find their way into the metagame but absolutely none of the remaining heroes yet-to-be ported over are necessary for the game to be played competitively and enjoyed. 	- What meaningful content? You mean skins, temporary game modes, more skins and rehashed champs? 	- The way they treat the community? Bahahaha... they don't even trust their community with any more advanced or powerful abilities and thus stick to rehashing gap-closers, wave-clearers and mass damage ults. 	- They still force you to sink time or money into the game to unlock actual gameplay content.

Collective bargaining is something that should be worked towards first by the teams, and also by the players themselves. They need some sort of bargaining power outside of Riot's judgement, or else they will be able to be taken advantage of. Simply relying on the good will of Riot Games is not adequate enough.

{"body":"**TL;DR** : I APPROVE! WAY TO GO RIOT! RIOT NUMBER ONE!!!		I know I'm rather late on commenting and this might get buried, but I think this won me over for Riot.

However, when the game's popularity exploded, I expected it to change, and the game developers to focus on profit over community happiness. 		This 100% changes that. I now completely believe Riot is not like other game companies, and that their game was the right one to help truly launch Esports in America and to continue Esports in other countries. If me playing League for 3 years doesn't show that I'm a fan, my new "next level" amount of respect for Riot should.		Way to go guys, NOW SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!		Side note: I understand this can also be looked at purely from a business point of view to actually increase Riot's profits by making the right move to make the community happy, but I don't believe this is true. They have been player focused this entire time, and when they have something like this happen, they could have easily walked away by saying they're a business in competition with other businesses and need to make money, but instead they changed it.

{"body":"I honestly don't think this was the best way to handle this.  Closing these teams out from getting other sponsorship money could hurt them in the long run, every dollar that these teams can make helps the scene as a whole.		A better way would have just been to have a ban list that actually made sense.  Like nobody would bat an eyelash if you were to just ban DoTA, DoTA 2, HoN, Smite, HotS, and whatever other DoTA clones come out.   Banning like Hearthstone, WoW, Starcraft, etc... was just stupid, though.		Look at NBC, for example.  They broadcast for two sports that have heavily overlapping seasons in the NHL and NBA.  It's not uncommon to see ads for upcoming NHL games being played during NBA games.  Neither league is angered by this, because having viewers know that NBC frequently broadcasts sports in general benefits both leagues.  Because NBC becomes a go-to place for sports enthusiasts when they're looking for something to watch, both leagues get to expand and retain their viewership.  Rather than trying to compete with one another, they have a symbiotic relationship.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BanjoStory","name":"t1_cdvrdbo","parent_id":"t3_1sa59j","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1386439951,"created_utc":1386411151}

{"body":"Dodged a freaking bullet right there. I am the driving force for founding a League club at my college with the intent to help people with pro aspirations organize and reach the competitive scene. However, I actually prefer DotA and am only doing this to help my friends who love League, because I have experience running a club. I feel that Riot are overall, incompetent and ham-fisted in their operation, but I put all that aside for my friends. Then I heard they would be making such monopolistic and draconian moves as this and I was ready to pack it all up and cancel everything.  Unfortunately, even though you saved yourself from the most dire consequences, Riot has only confirmed my view of them has ham-fisted oafs lumbering their way through the esports scene, kept alive merely by the amount of money they pump into it. I wonder how long you can last in such a state.
