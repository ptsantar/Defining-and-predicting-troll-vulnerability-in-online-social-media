PNG is lossless, which means that even when it compresses, it does not lose any data, rendering it immune from artifacts like you get when re-re-resaving JPGs.		To make up for the fact that it is lossless, PNGs carry their pallette information with them. In other words, a PNG with only a hundred or so colors in it can only reproduce those hundred colors. This is good for stuff like screenshots of games like LoL with low numbers of colors in the palettes, but for something like a photograph, needing to add all those colors to the pallete would make it much larger than the JPG.","depth":5,"score":62,"ups":62,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WiglyWorm","name":"t1_ctv8kf1","parent_id":"t1_ctv7xar","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1439009924,"created_utc":1438981124}

{"body":"I think it's fine to charge as well, but the current model isn't very consumer friendly. Having to buy 3 with no alternative when you'll most likely stick with just 1 is somewhat insulting, especially if it's a chroma for a skin you already own. I own the Pool Party Leona chroma set because pink is my favorite color and I always use the skin on her. Since the skin came out I thought it would look better with pink accents instead.		If I had the option, I would have loved to just buy the pink on its own. I was forced to buy the whole package for 1 color.		That means I essentially came out paying  1565 RP for the skin I wanted. The pool party skin itself is priced highly considering it only changes the particle on zennith blase onto a parasol. If I could buy just pink for 200rp or something, I would mind less. Of course it was my decision to get it, but it doesn't mean I feel less cheated. 		It isn't so much the fact that they charge that bothers, its more the way they charge. It isn't a "deal" if you'll only use one. My local supermarket pulls scammy shit like that all the time with "buy these 2 things you didn't plan on buying and won't really use and get the thing you were actually planning to buy for a dollar cheaper!

When you spend money on the game, you are paying for the item you want ONLY, you aren't paying for anything else. When you buy a toy from the toy store, you aren't buying the toy to ensure the quality of the other toys in the store, are you?		>we give the company money and we expect quality service from them.		First of all, League of Legends is a free game. You're not paying for any service. Think of the Skin/Chroma pack system as a Gift Shop, not a restaurant. When you buy a Chroma Pack, you know EXACTLY what you're getting, and therefore, Riot is under no obligation to ensure the quality of it because they show you what you're getting.		Let's take a restaurant, for example:	The menu says "The Cheeseburger" with a picture of a really good looking Cheeseburger for 10 dollars. However, when they serve the cheeseburger, the meat is pink and the cheese is rotten. 		- In this scenario, the Customer has a great reason to complain because they are not getting the result the restaurant promised in the picture and the quality is much worse than expected.		What if, however, the restaurant put a picture of the burger with pink meat and rotten cheese on the menu? Would you still complain if you bought it?		No, because you got exactly what was promised in the picture. Is the quality shit? Yep. Is it correct to complain if you buy it? Nope, because the restaurant delivered exactly what was promised and you were the idiot who makes the decision to buy the thing in the first place. You KNOW it is going to be bad quality.		How this is a money grab, I fail to see.		>it's their LITERAL OBLIGATION to provide the playerbase with quality service, period		Nope, they aren't obliged to give us anything of quality because they showed us what they were selling and it is our choice whether we want to invest in it or not.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"riperoni","name":"t1_ctvabyb","parent_id":"t1_ctv7sq2","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1439012815,"created_utc":1438984015}
