Surprising people with punishments out of nowhere is a terrible approach to fixing toxicity.  Punishing people who got chat restricted for a few games 8 months ago and have since reformed is an *even worse* approach.  I can get behind a "remove from the worst 5%" or whatever methodology.  I really see no value in this "REMOVE ALL THE THINGS FROM ALL THE DUDES" approach.		I just don't understand what this method hopes to *achieve.*  It's purely built to punish players--not create a better experience for *anybody.*  That's not the typical Lyte approach that I'm used to seeing, and I think it's horribly naive.  There's no long term toxicity reform goal here.  The goal is to punish.  That's a shitty goal.","depth":1,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Scarynig","name":"t1_cuavabz","parent_id":"t1_cuauen1","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440206527,"created_utc":1440177727}

{"body":">Yeah, it is. It creates a better place for players that haven't been punished ever.		Is it?  We've already had a post on the front page about somebody trolling because "he won't get rewards anyway."  Maybe that player would troll that game regardless, but maybe not.		You're right in that it will eventually cause *some* toxic players to either reform or quit the game.  My problem is not so much with the players who are perpetually toxic that are unlikely to change, they're fucked under any system.  It's with the large portion of the punished playerbase who *does* actually reform, as well as with the fact that they're being told "tough shit" with roughly two months left in the season.		I've never been punished or received a warning either, but I still think this approach will have a very shallow effect on the long-term health of the game.  It'll make some toxic players leave, it'll make others worse, and a third group probably won't change their behavior at all.  My expectation is that the third group encompasses a large majority.  Regardless of how awful any person in these groups are, punishments should still be outlined before they are issued.  This punishment is retroactive.  It's not for all players who receive punishments from August 20th and onward.  If you received a punishment in March, the rule made in August applies to you.  I don't see how that's fair.		It doesn't provide motivation to improve behavior when you can have the rug pulled from under you at any moment.  It says "You fucked up, we punished you for it, but here's a second punishment for that thing you already paid for."  What does that motivate anybody to do except get angry?  Expectations matter.  The worst of the toxic players probably expect to have rewards removed, as that's what happened last season.  The player who received one ranked restriction?  He's probably kinda mad.  Anger doesn't often lead to reform, especially when reforming has no notable benefit for another 3 months.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Scarynig","name":"t1_cuayvh4","parent_id":"t1_cuayfzf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440211770,"created_utc":1440182970}

The ones that get worse or don't change will just get banned. Honestly, I think if anything shows while playing this game is that people are still too toxic with the current system in the game. I would *welcome* more harsh punishments.		You fucked up and received punishment. Sometimes its something that you don't expect. That's how shit in life works. This is completely fair.

It took me a while to figure it out (ended up being a specific bug between EVGA Precision X and the LoL client).  The issue was hard to diagnose because it wouldn’t happen in every lobby.  Some games would go through and I could play and sometimes the client would freeze, I would have to restart the client, and re-que.	I have fixed the issue now (took me 6-7 days), but I needed to que in order to see if the bug was fixed.  I actually tried replicating it in custom games, but I would never get them.  So the worst I did was make people re-que in a lobby because the system thought I dodged.		I want to re-iterate, I never made anyone 4v5 IN GAME.  Either I would get into the game or would have to re-que for another game if my client froze.		I have never received a chat restriction or ban in the 4 years I have played this game.

No problems since, and I haven't changed my behavior in the slightest since I don't think it's ever been a real problem.

Never in my life have I heard of someone being disqualified from receiving a piece of paper with their grades for getting kicked out of class nor detention (maybe for repeat offenders, but then they're closing into suspension territory), I've even seen people get suspended but they are still allowed in the award ceremony if they reformed by the end of the year.		Expulsion makes sense for obvious reasons and I would also agree with suspension, you could make a case to allow the reformed but I think riot changed it so only the light suspensions instead get chat restricted or rank restricted(not sure what this actually means so haven't talked about it, I'm guessing it's between chat restricted and suspension?).","depth":2,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"asdasdasdwwww","name":"t1_cub1pg7","parent_id":"t1_cuaum7u","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440216118,"created_utc":1440187318}

{"body":"They're giving out a reward for having climbed a ladder. That's what ranked games are you. You win, you get promoted. You get high enough, you get rewards. If you take away somebody's gold rewards because they may have had a toxic spell, that's a punishment. You get season rewards from climbing the ladder. Otherwise they wouldn't only denote/represent your ranking. They would be completely different and general for being good summoners, not good ranked game players. They set up a ranked system that advertises rewards if you can climb the ladder, then take it away from people who did it because they may have been a dick. 		For example, I had a death in the family recently and I went to LoL to relax, as I usually do. Of course the usual trolls showed up and I snapped and fired back, which got me reported. Rinse and repeat, I got a 3 game chat restriction. I've worked since then to deal with IRL and being a better person in game as well. No further punishment was dealt to me since, and I've been getting honors. However, they announce that because I was under a lot of stress *a few months ago* and nothing since then, I am no longer eligible for the rewards I earned from winning ranked games? You can't honestly tell me that sounds fair to you.		If you make rewards for earning ranking in the game, then you can only give rewards for that reason. You can't make it as though they didn't play the game all season because of a spell of toxicity due to the already toxic community. It's like the Joker's monologue from Killing Joke story. "That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day." One bad day and you become toxic yourself. With the pre-existing toxicity in the community, it's hard to get back to being above it once you've dropped to that level.		The problem is that Riot doesn't look at those factors. They'd rather deal with it en masse, than find out how to help players improve. There's no "hey, let's all get better together" it's either you don't get reported for any reason whatsoever or you get punished by having the reward you worked hard for taken away. Yes, that's a punishment. When you work hard for something (playing a bunch of ranked games to climb the ladder that earns you icons, borders, skins etc) and then get it taken away for something else.		As for your "It's called ignore." Even Riot has a helpful tip in loading screens that says cooperating and communicating win significantly more games. Yet they made the only way to not deal with toxic players to mute them. Each time you mute a player you lose 20% of your team. That means you only have 60% left to work with (since you're the last 20%). That bumps each played at 25% of your team's communication being lost with each muted player. The pings are a slight improvement in being able to communicate, as are ult and summoner timers, but there's a lot that can't be said with those.		If you want to stand a chance to make it to higher levels you either need to play with people who are also not only good at the game but good as a team, or you need to take the chance of talking to the trolls and other toxic players. 		Don't make it seem to cut and dry. Nothing is black and white, but that's what Riot wants to do in order to avoid making any sort of actual improvement.","depth":10,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ugly_Muse","name":"t1_cubbvcc","parent_id":"t1_cub41zf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440233824,"created_utc":1440205024}

I may be the minority or w/e but I think anyone who is toxic and ruins the game for other people, even if it's "only one time", deserves to be punished. I'm glad Riot is doing this. If it's seriously such a big deal to show off your past-season ranking then take a fucking screenshot on the last day of the season and show it to all your buddies so they think you're "cool" for getting gold or whatever. All these rewards are fucking cosmetic for god's sake, you can still play the game just fine without them.

{"body":"> Why don't we start rewarding these guys for not beating their wife?		Very convenient of you to pick and choose the examples that you like and ignore the ones that don't favor your view. 		Should we reward everyone for not murdering people everyday? Should we give all employees bonuses for showing up to work not late? Should we reward students for getting educated and not dropping out of school? 		Why don't we do these things as a society? Its because these are the bare minimum standards with which we build on and are absolutely not negotiable. It should be the same in this game. If you absolutely CANNOT even meet the minimum standard of not talking (this is the bare neutral minimum, its not even asking you to be a "good" or "helpful" person), then you should not play. 		When I use the word "normal", I'm not talking about some weird tumblr thing of people getting excluded because they're not in power or something. Its the general societal contract of being able to live with and cooperate with others. In our case, this is something like the summoner's code. 		Now, moving on the the topic of reform, I'll try to elaborate on my fat person analogy a little bit since you thought that it doesn't make sense.		Let's say that being toxic in chat = overeating. You don't HAVE to constantly flame people but you feel like you do. You don't HAVE to eat 3000 calories a day but you feel like you do. 		When a fat person makes genuine effort to "reform" their regular behavior, they don't need any rewards because the results themselves are rewarding. Moving into the sphere where most people are functional, is the reward. There are examples of these everywhere. You are actually belittling the achievements of these people by assuming that rewards are needed and the only way they could reform is through Pavlovian conditioning. You're the one thinking of them as sub-human.  		But then you have the fat people who are continuously dieting and getting off diets, they do not consider this a change to their normal behavior. This is what would happen if rewards were directly tied to improving behavior. This is why their attempted "reforms" always result in them returning to their normal habits of eating too much. They're only in it for the reward, and they will go right back if there's no reward involved. They then claim that diets are useless and they're totally right about it, but its because their goal is toward the reward and not bettering themselves. 		This is a video game and few people care about bettering themselves on a personal level, I get that. But there are literally millions of people who are able to uphold the bare minimum of not talking at all to be able to participate in a neutral to positive way in this game. 		EDIT: There's an important word you missed when you quoted my sentence:		> But these players are expecting to be treated like normal people when they (by choice) refuse to meet even the bare minimum standards of normal person behavior. 		Quoting the first part surely makes me look like someone who hates "abnormal" people. Then you look at the 2nd part: "By choice". Another important parallel between toxicity and fat people is you made a choice and don't want to accept the consequences.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"borisyeltsin2","name":"t1_cub1j99","parent_id":"t1_cuayfgq","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440215860,"created_utc":1440187060}

{"body":"Everyone seems to be saying that the people who get a five game chat restriction are getting the same punishment as people who got a 150 game ranked restriction, and that's just not true. Ranked rewards need to be looked at as rewards earned for reaching a certain rank while following all of the rules of the game. If you got ANY TYPE OF PUNISHMENT that means that at some point during the 2015 season you broke the rules of the game and therefore you lose your ranked rewards. That is the blanket punishment: you don't get rewarded if you don't follow the rules. After that the additional punishments are doled out to fit the offense. 		Think of it like a driver's license: if you receive a punishment you get a certain number of points, and the more serious the offense the more points you get. Along with the points you also receive a fine you must pay that changes based on the offense. If you reach a certain number of points you get banned. You are only eligible for ranked rewards if you finish the season with no points on your "license" and the additional punishments change in severity based on how many points you have. Your points get erased at the start of the next season and you get to start fresh. 		A person with a five game chat restriction didn't just get the same punishment as a person with a 150 game ranked restriction, their punishments just included one similar element. 		People keep saying that anyone punished will now not have an incentive to improve their behavior and that is also incorrect. The incentive is to not get ranked/chat restricted even further. To not garner enough "points" that their punishment will escalate to a ban. Even those who have exorbitant numbers of restrictions have to keep their behavior in check if they don't want to be banned. 		Ranked rewards are rewards for reaching a certain rank and being toxic doesn't take away from the fact that you earned a certain rank, that much is true. However, before playing League of Legends you agree to the Summoner's Code and that explicitly forbids negative behavior in game. I think it's fine that Riot chooses not to reward players who break the fundamental rules of the game no matter what their skill level is. They dole out appropriate punishments for the offenses, some harsh and some completely menial, but if you were bad enough to deserve even the smallest one then you aren't eligible to be rewarded. I also don't think this is something that Riot needs to articulate at the start of the season. People shouldn't need an explicit reason to not be a dick, you just shouldn't be a dick. If you're having a bad day then yell at the air or punch a pillow, don't take it out on someone else. You wouldn't walk up to a random stranger on the street and yell at them, would you? Don't do it online then.  		**TL;DR: A player with a 5 game chat restriction isn't getting the same punishment as a player who got a 150 game ranked restriction, their punishments just include one identical element. Every player has a League of Legends "driver's license". When you break one of LoL's rules you get a certain number of "points" on your license. The worse the offense the more points you get. If you get too many points you get banned. While the severity of your punishment is relative to the number of points you got, (5 game restriction, 30 game restriction, 3 day ban, etc.), if you got any points at all you are ineligible for rewards because Riot doesn't want to reward players who broke the rules at any point during the season.**","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EmergencyTaco","name":"t1_cuauant","parent_id":"t3_3hv450","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440205102,"created_utc":1440176302}

{"body":"I think that one of reasons why there is such a reaction to this kind of thing is because of how incredible broken the system used to punish the players are. 		League of Legends is the most toxic game I've ever played, because it's designed to reward toxic behaviour. Riots stance on what is deemed to be a bannable offence is absolutely ridiculous. 	I've gotten warnings for using bad words, which blew my mind. It's 2015 and people are still afraid of swearwords. 		Since the system basicly revolves around do anything you want in game, don't swear and don't openly do an ad hominem attack. This opens up a whole new world for anyone who wants to be toxic, because you can be as toxic as you want in game, you just need to avoid doing those three things, and if you can trick someone else to do one of those other things then you suddenly have an incentive to be toxic, since you can basicly garantue that you get the other person some kind of punishment. 		The ammount of flame baiting I've seen in the last few days is more than I've seen in all of my years of DotA combined because it works, people just pick someone out and they will pick and pick on them untill they just break, be it by intentionally ruin a game or by just baiting it out of the poor sod, and for a lot of people that is all they can take and they break.		If that interaction happened in real life virtually everyone would be on the side of the person being picked on going "wow, that guy was an asshole" yet if you say that in game, that's a strike on you for being nasty, even when justified. This is one of the big problems the system does not give a shit if you were justified in your actions, it just cares about presenting reality as a 1980's school sitcom, where every flavour is vanilla, radical!		This in turn has created a community that is incredibly thin skinned, since you litterarly can not criticize someone even in a constructive way unless you slather it in so much honey that Winne the Pooh would go "We need an intervention... oh bother." 		Litterarly everything that isn't "GOOD JOB GUY KEEP GOING!" is considered a personal attack. For example, if you say "X could you stop splitpushing it's really hurting the team, and we need you in teamfights". Yes even in that incredibly fake and plastic way of typing conveying 0 feelings, there will be at least two people going "Dude, stop flaming, just play", in a team game. That to me it's astounding, a team game where criticism in any form is frowned upon. Just imagine a football coach going "You have to tighten up at the back, they keep exploiting the room between the fullback and the midfield, you just have to fucking get stuck in there" and someone went "Well, that was hurtful. I really wish you could put in a way so that I didn't feel so singled out as fullback", it's ridiculous. 		In the current system, the vast majority obviously will be punshied for outrageous behaviour, but there will be a very unproportional size that gets a ban or restriction simply for acting human and that really did nothing wrong and for them to hear riot talk about toxicity is sort of like listening to owner of BP to talk about saving the evoirnment.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Keskekun","name":"t1_cub4hrt","parent_id":"t3_3hv450","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440220547,"created_utc":1440191747}

The games I enjoy most are those where no one whines about, complains about or blames another player.

{"body":"Everyone thinks that toxic means that you were constantly harassing someone or telling them to go kill themselves. That rarely happens in games and the people that play for 5+ hours a day know that. I haven't been banned this season but I've been chat restricted and put in low priority queue. 		The reason why I've been chat restricted isn't because I flame my teammates when they do bad. League is a very frustrating game. It's even more frustrating as you realize you're the reason why your teammates are losing. Before when I use to get chat restricted I would keep my mouth shut the whole game if I was doing bad, but the minute someone said something to me I would begin pointing out their mistakes in a very passive aggressive manner. I realized this was bad so I stopped doing it and started muting people anytime I started to type in chat. I've been doing this for months now and have not gotten a single punishment since then. 		The problem with this isn't that toxic players are being punished, it's that I feel as though I wasted my time trying to reform and making progress.

I see where you're coming from, but I think I'd edit it a bit to say that "a lot of the times the toxic players *think* they are highly competitive and don't play like shit."		In my experience the people who are the loudest, most toxic, and negative are the ones that think that they belong in a higher elo/that they're losing because of other people/that it's other people's fault their KDA is bad. 		People who are really good and carry usually do so by keeping their mouth shut and playing the game to the fullest instead of going 'OMG TEAM' or 'im fucking done' whenever they die. I have a lot of friends with really high elo (I went to HS in Asia and my friends from back home are mostly Diamond/Plat/high gold and are here in the US for university, playing on NA servers). The only one of these friends that is toxic  is the one guy who is in Silver. I *know* he feels he should be a lot higher elo than he is now, and is embarrassed/pissed that he is the only one in Silver. This makes him pour his frustration on the unfortunate randoms we play with whenever he dies/we lose. ( I really don't enjoy playing with him very much because of this).		Last example is a ranked game I played last night. We had a very toxic jungler who would dive into their team and die pretty much instantly everytime, and everytime would go 'OMG WHERES MY TEAM' even though nobody was even around him, and it had happened in the enemy's jungle. People who are toxic are toxic because they think they are great, and everyone else is bad and his holding them back.		Again this is just my experience, and doesn't describe everyone that is toxic. But from my experience people who are toxic pretty much always **believe** they are really good, and that's the true common denominator. Sometimes they are skillful, sometimes they're terrible, but either way they always think they're good.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"awindwaker","name":"t1_cub7vb9","parent_id":"t1_cub6tc8","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440226379,"created_utc":1440197579}

{"body":"This is such a joke. Just like Riot. Can you guys name a single other game where people get banned for being "toxic"? No other game has these rules in which they force us to be nice to each other like we are children. Basically telling us how to act. Shit talk is a huge part of sports. Think of Mohammad Ali, Kobe Bryant, etc. I realize most of you have probably never played on a sports team in your life, but in sports people get heated. First of all, a bit of shit talk to the other team is standard. Then, there was often shit talk towards own teammates in the heat of the situation, to make them understand they need to step it up. No point in acting like children and babying each other when we know what needs to be done. It didn't happen everytime but it happened. 		And the fact that everyone is glad is so hilarious. You guys want us to act like mindless idiots and be like "hey i love you for going 0/6/0 man. Can you give me your address so i can mail you a special present that relates to your username?" We shouldn't have to be nice to each other. I shouldn't have to be happy about a person going 0/6/0. So now i don't want to be nice to a guy that won't listen to anyone and is 0/6/0. And i can't say how i feel cause then i'm "toxic" and he'll apparently be so hurt that he will cry because clearly he is that sensitive/a baby. So now i can't type anything in the chat. Which is not how it should be. And not everyone uses racial slurs, or tells people to kill themselves. 		But yea the guy that won't listen to anyone and is feeding is not saying anything in chat so he's fine. He's definitely not the one "ruining my game". The guy that tells him to stop feeding or asks him to do something in the game such as rotate/group/etc. is "toxic" for not expressing his love for the feeder.","depth":0,"score":-10,"ups":-10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"h05","name":"t1_cuaz5ld","parent_id":"t3_3hv450","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440212189,"created_utc":1440183389}

{"body":"Compared to what I've been doing since January, no.		I'm not extra respectful or positive, I've mostly just stopped talking when things go negative.		I was particularly rude in game (the rude and obnoxious type, not "get cancer and die fuckhead"), it was because I had problems in my life that my usual de-stressing mechanism (video games) wasn't working on and I was letting my anger out in a rather unfortunate way.		I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint now either, I've probably called someone an idiot or told them to fuck off. I've pretty much just limited myself to not starting the flame train and most of the time I stay out of it entirely by not responding when someone else starts it towards me.  	This has the added benefit of actually helping me use video games to de-stress properly again, so it's a win.		Basically, the chat restriction had the intended effect, my behaviour is now "in line" with the standard (mostly quiet and neutral, sometimes a little negative, sometimes a little positive).		 	I haven't complained that I'm ineligible for community gift rewards and such, because Lyte told us about that almost a year ago. So it was expected, it's part of the punishment. However the season rewards being denied I was not informed about.  	That's the problem, for me at least. It's not that I'm not getting the season rewards. While I think the punishment is excessive I did earn being punished.  	I'm mostly pissed that I'm being punished additionally now, in a way I was not informed about at the time and which has not been done previously, thus I could not have reasonable foreseen it.		This is knowledge that was relevant for me during the 7 months or something like that since my chat restriction.

Like I'm saying, if that was the way they wanted to go with it then that's fine, but they didn't do it last year or the year before that. So there's a change in the rules, and it's coming pretty late.  	If they want that to be the rules that's fine, but this is changing the rules that's been used for years pretty much last second (last couple of months, but considering the time frame).

I can make the argument on it's own merit, and it's pretty much "it's a skill based reward, adding a behavioral requirement is fine if you want that but do it before, not after".  	At the very least tell me when I get the punishment, don't let me go 7 months thinking I've done my time and accepted my punishment then smack something new on me whenever you feel like it. It makes me not trust you. Sure I can think I'm done with it now, but you've already demonstrated that you will change the rules and retroactively add to my punishment, what if you still think there's a toxicity problem next year and you just say "anyone who's ever had a punishment can't get rewards". Apparently I've been punished once and will have that punishment added on to every now and then with no warning, with no clearly defined reasoning or even a limit.  	(the "you" in this part of the comment refers to Riot, not you personally).			> If you really see the time you spent playing the game as wasted, is it really a game worth playing? If the only reason you're having fun the shiny toy at the end?		You're kinda ignoring the latter half of my statement here. I'm not saying the time was wasted because I was playing and can't get the prize. I'm saying I sacrificed time I could've spent playing with my friends to play solo because I wanted to achieve a certain goal.  	It's like running a 5K, sure it's fun to do anyway, I could do it just for fun, and I have. But I could've also spent that time going fishing with my brother in law. I allocated my time differently because I wanted the shiny prize at the end.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AntiChr1st","name":"t1_cuaxxvx","parent_id":"t1_cuax6aj","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440210386,"created_utc":1440181586}

{"body":"Literally posting this in every thread about the end of season rewards:		Just received a 20 match chat restriction and I'm not even sure for what, so I'm glad that not only am I chat restricted but now I'm losing season rewards this late into the season for something I'm not even shown proof of. The amount of people that flame the team is unreal and I get at least one or two every game, my response to then is a "LOL" and "muted" and a report after the game so I'm not sure what qualifies as being toxic yet I have not received a confirmation that said person was punished nor have I received a chat log to my email account detailing what exactly resulted in this punishment. It feels as if the people reviewing the logs are...the toxic people I'm trying to report as it is lol. I also strongly disagree with the fact that your reports diminish in value if you do it frequently, so now I'm being double punished for getting intentional feeders and toxic people every or every other game? Not sure how that's fair either because I can't help my team when top and jungle are flaming each other then somehow take it out on the adc who then tilts the entire game. I'm sorry but I can't 1v5 and so I'm glad that when I tell people to "just stop talking and play" that that's somehow worthy of even getting reported but on top of that I'm to get restricted. It's unreal and I'm also perplexed that Lyte would wait THIS late into the season to announce this. Like announce it for NEXT season if anything so players know what to expect, not just a big fuck you at the end of this season with no prior knowledge of the decision or fair disclosure of evidence of what got you restricted or banned in the first place since it's usually the person who was flaming the team and you muted who is now reporting you.","depth":0,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"th3doorMATT","name":"t1_cuayf24","parent_id":"t3_3hv450","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440211091,"created_utc":1440182291}
