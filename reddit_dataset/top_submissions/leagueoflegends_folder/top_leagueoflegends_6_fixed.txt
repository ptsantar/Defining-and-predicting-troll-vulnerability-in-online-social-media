{"body":"As someone who's watched Xpecial since Season 2, I don't think he's arrogant. I've never seen him toot his own horn when he was on TSM and they were dominating. I didn't see him toot his own horn when he transferred over to Curse. I didn't see him toot his own horn when they were Team Liquid. Xpecial is always the quiet guy. The Summer Split of 2014 and Spring Split of 2015 did not give him much right to be arrogant when Curse/TL were struggling during the regular split and he's mostly kept to himself during this split. His problem really is the way he talks and how he basically has no charisma which is why I think some people might get the arrogant vibe. He tries to phrase things as objectively as he can but the way he words things might accidentally tick some people off. As I said, Xpecial has always been that stoic and quiet guy.			Same thing goes for Dom. He never really tooted his own horn after he reformed and came back to the LCS in 2014. I think he's actually one of the most mature guys there in the LCS. He's just a very hypy and emotional guy so excuse him if him thinking he's good helps him to perform better. Really, I think people just say he's arrogant after Reddit blew out of proportion the whole "Xmithie sucks" comment he made.

TL have a weak ass mid game which teams use to claw back into the game, TSM have no presence pre 30 minutes, TiP, whilst mechanically excellent, aren't exactly good on a macro level, and GRV rely really heavily on one type of setup.

{"body":"**Meme Ecosystem Endangered by CLG 3-0, Scientists Say**			The Reddit community may face incredible and profound shocks in the meme ecosystem due to CLG’s inexplicable victory over TSM during the North American League Championship Series, experts warn. 		“The Reddit ecosystem has developed over years and years of consistent failures by Counter Logic Gaming,” said eSports scientist /u/Buttsooooorin. “An ecosystem such as ours is a delicate one. It can withstand changes like Curse’s transformation into Team Liquid and Kassadin reworks. It is welcoming to new influences, such as Yuri Jew and Link’s bible of memeorable maxims. But I fear that the evolution of CLG into a consistent team may be too much for reddit to handle.”		The series win represents an extinction of memes on an unprecedented scale. Memes that have endured years and years and will now never see the light of day again include such classics as:		* r/doubleliftstrophycase 		* Win 1 game to give fans false hope		* Playoffs: Tilt head in case of choking		* Heart attacks		* Potential		* Doublelift, the lonely farmer boy		* Xmissing ultimates		* No thread is safe, savage		* Gold Engage		Although memes such as [Mario plays toplane](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CAqIekwUwAAY830.jpg), [Pobelter.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJwZ0CVUkAE4YC0.png), [and](http://i.imgur.com/Pl534tL.gif) [all](https://31.media.tumblr.com/75062e06ffa96371252224e720e2e399/tumblr_nbnw2pzdak1swm6rso1_500.gif) [the](http://i.imgur.com/n56bVr6.gif) [rush](http://41.media.tumblr.com/efecabe95541e788b4a1f4c86db19556/tumblr_n3c1oiwSwL1qzlsw0o1_500.jpg) [hour](http://i.imgur.com/FbZhfuT.jpg) [gifs]( https://gfycat.com/AnnualShallowBlackwidowspider) are not expected to be as impacted, professional memers are nonetheless disappointed by the tragic loss in meme diversity.		“With their victory at the LCS finals, CLG has declared war on our very culture,” said passionate redditor /u/SALTYTSMTEARS . “We’re donezo.” 		------------------------		**About Me**		For my audition piece for ESEX, I wrote about CLG and their partnership with a hospital for heart attack patients. The first published article I had a hand in was [hacking lift's gmail](http://esportsexpress.com/2014/08/doublelifts-gmail-hacked/). CLG has given me this job, and my passion for this scene. I've had this flair for a long while, on this account and all of my prior accounts. Today, I'm thrilled to be celebrating this victory with fans all across the world who've held on to this flair through thick and thin, because no matter the throws or the failures, we knew that Counter Logic Gaming was *our* team.

{"body":"It is a counterpick. Viktor is an absolutely miserable matchup for Yasuo at all stages of the game, both in lane and in teamfights. Viktor has the tools in lane to punish you severely for trying to aggress against him while also having strong enough poke to punish Yasuo if he just tries to farm passively. But it gets especially bad in teamfights. If Yasuo's team does not 1 shot Viktor off the ult, Viktor is going to 1 shot Yasuo the instant he's able to move because his burst is both extremely fast, extremely high, and nearly unavoidable. And you can't afford to ult in either if Viktor isn't one of the ones knocked up; he'll just lay his gravity field right on top of you and then delete you instantly. Bjerg did get outplayed, but he also put himself in a position to be outplayed very easily by picking Yasuo into Viktor twice. There's a reason Yasuo isn't seen that much in pro play and an even bigger reason he's picked mostly as a counterpick. Yasuo's bad matchups are really, really bad and certain champions just shut him out of the game unless his team snowballs out of control.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DarthLeon2","name":"t1_cueh7ez","parent_id":"t1_cuegzsd","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440488097,"created_utc":1440459297}

{"body":"CLG won this through picks and bans. Viktor + Yasuo game 1 completely caught TSM off guard - and the genius of the comp is that CLG wasn't even using Yasuo for damage, just for his knockup. Pobelter went glass cannon on Viktor (Luden's into Deathcap) and blew up TSM's squishies every fight after Zion held them in place.		Games 2 and 3 felt like TSM going into full panic mode because bans weren't enough to shut down CLG's combos. Kalista and Tristana bans became mandatory and that meant Xmithie got comfort picks every time; plus TSM was scared of CLG counterpicking Bjergsen's Viktor and ended up letting Pobelter get him all three games. Santiron didn't look comfortable on Ecco whatsoever in game 2. Bjergsen taking away Yasuo felt 100% like a reactive pick since TSM has literally no answer to Zion's Yasuo. You also saw how Pobelter adjusted his build in games 2 and 3, going Hourglass first since there was no longer a need to go glass cannon.		TSM ended up picking Kog all 3 games as well, which was weird because Sivir (one of Turtle's more common picks) was open the whole series. Maybe TSM was afraid of Doublelift's Kog'Maw - regardless, even if these were planned-out comps from TSM, this entire series felt more like they were scrambling to take away picks from CLG that they themselves didn't fully understand how to play.

{"body":"#CONTEXT FOR r/all		TSM and CLG have been long time professional League of Legends rivals. TSM in the past few years has been one of the strongest if not the strongest team in North America. They always perform very well in playoffs, while CLG usually performs poorly in playoffs and has been struggling the last few years. CLG has just beaten TSM 3-0 in a best of 5 in the North American finals.			Besides bragging rights and the trophy and all that, getting first place in North America is extremely important because of the world championship. The winner of this match (CLG) gets first seed for North America, meaning that they get to play lower seeded teams from other regions and do not have to play against the top team from other regions in the group stage of the tournament.			EDIT: Both teams will still be going to the World Championship. TSM performed well enough during the first half-season (split) of play combined with their second place finish this split to lock them in as the 2nd seed from North America. CLG will be attending as the 1st seed. The 3rd and last seed for North America will be decided in a Qualifier next week.","depth":0,"score":1286,"ups":1286,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GeckoSoldierX","name":"t1_cudcuah","parent_id":"t3_3i506g","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440404312,"created_utc":1440375512}

{"body":"Huge congratulations to CLG, they played outstandingly well. TSM, get your shit together.  	  	Every single player on CLG showed how well they can play both individually, and as a team. I don't know if there was a single moment in that series where CLG *truly* faltered to TSM's desires, and that's just because CLG **is** the better team.  		Huge props to ZionSpartan for being consistent in dominating his opponents, especially to the likes of Dyrus and Santorin, who tried - **and** *failed* - to harass him.  	  	Xmithie really showed me what it means to be a superb jungler and not disappoint your team with your performance and assistance as a roaming carry.  	  	Pobelter, you've been a great player for so long, and I'm happy to see you finally going to Worlds. I can't imagine how hard it's been for you, nor what it feels like to have made it this far after trying for so long.  	  	Doublelift. Damn, what can I say? You've been trying your damnedest to make it to Worlds for what seems like eternity. You've come close many times over, but you always end up an analyst instead. Now you're getting the chance to be shoutcasted over on the global stage with the stakes undeniably high. I hope to see you prove that you should've been there oh so long ago.  	  	Aphromoo, you're a godly support who's long been lacking of a team to finish what you start. Now, this new CLG team has been the unstoppable force that has thrown you into the limelight, and I hope you show off some sick support plays in front of the Koreans and Europeans.  	  	Good job HotshottGG on creating this team; they wouldn't have come so far if it weren't for you.  	  	Once again, congratulations and good luck to CLG.

About to get up and shut the browser down, the microphone was on Hotshot, and I thought that was my last look onto the monitor.			For one second I thought my headphone is broken, that doesn't sound like hotshot. I stared at the other ear bud, having my right ear listening to the weird voice. Not too long until I realized, the man, hotshotgg, dropped his manly tears, and has its voiced cracked.			I honestly didn't know what to feel, on one hand I'm super disappointed with TSM's poor showing, on the other hand, seeing hotshot being so incredibly touched and joyful for CLG's success makes me feel weirdly positive. I'm so confused by myself, but I have to say, congratulations Hotshot, without you CLG wouldn't have today's success; without CLG, TSM would be so lonely in NA; without CLG and TSM League of Legends wouldn't grow this big, thank you so much for all you've done, you deserve this.			Until Doublelift said freeSM in front of thousands of people, I'm awake.By here I can confidently say, our boys will come back huge, and put CLG back in the dumpster.

The games I watched showed every single player on CLG playing WAY better than their counterpart on TSM, save possibly Lustboy - who had some nice flash ults.		TSM's players need to be responsible for getting outplayed. There is no need to blame Reginald or Locodoco for the picks. They didn't tell Wildturtle to back outside a bush, they didn't tell Bjerg & Dyrus to get so badly outplayed by Zion, they didn't tell the whole team to chase Pobelter at the Baron.

{"body":"**TL;DR- This series re-ignited a rivalry thought to be dead (CLG vs TSM), was the first tournament victory for one of the most popular players in north america (CLG Doublelift https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XQQhrssnBY), and saw a polarizing team that has been dominant (TSM) recently get shit stomped by a team that has repeatedly fell short (CLG).**		_		sorry if this is rambly and uses too bananas ()()))(((()(()(		_		It was a massive upset (CLG beating TSM) because these teams go back a long time, starting when the game did (5-6 years ago) and the rivaly between them had died down because TSM had been easily beating CLG for the last 3 years. 		_		TSM (Team SoloMid) has a reputation as a top tier team that is run ruthlessly by it's owner Reginald (not completely ruthless, but he owns the TSM brand and operates a lot of the team roles). They have been importing talent from other regions and have been extremely successful, even winning an international tournament (it was a bit of a weak tournament, this coming from a TSM fan, but they still played very well). Teams from north america rarely win anything on the international level.		_		CLG (Counter Logic Gaming) has a reputation as a team full of "potential" (a rampant meme about the team), but they always fall apart at the end of the split (2 splits = 1 season = 1 year) and restructure.		So after many poor playoff performances, and many splits where they missed the playoffs all together (they came within 1 game of being kicked from the league all together this time last year, but pulled out 3 wins in a row to stay in the league) they finally appointed a coach with an education in coaching and HotshotGG (the team owner and former player) appointing a new CEO of CLG. They slumped in the middle of the split, so it looked like they would collapse again, but they demolished the playoffs and look to be the best NA team.		_		So the game was a Madison Square Garden in New York and it was a super hyped match because of the rivalry. CLG absolutely demolished TSM, so the CLG fans are hyped that the team won after doing so poorly for so long, and the fans of every other team get to shit on TSM because they have been so dominant recently and have a rather cocky and immature fanbase (this is a general notion, I don't consider myself immature, maybe cocky).		_		Another big talking point in that a player for CLG "Doublelift", has finally won a tournament. He has played for a long time, and he is hugely popular in the community, he was kicked out of his parent's house and was homeless for a while but kept playing the dream and now he is insanely popular.		(the story is more complex  than that, it is a very good one as well. Here it is told by him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XQQhrssnBY)		His story and personality has made him very successful, but he had never actually won a tournament in his career. He clearly had plenty of talent, but there was a lot of buzz about how possibly didnt work well in a team environment. A lot of people thought he was the problem CLG had failed so many times. Winning this tournament was huge for him, this means he will also make his first appearance at worlds as a player (he usually is there as a personality on the broadcasts).		_		yeah so lemme know any questions you have and ill answer to the best of my ability.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BigDiqMystic","name":"t1_cudhs1s","parent_id":"t1_cude42e","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440412793,"created_utc":1440383993}

Letting xmithie get 2 only junglers he is actually really good with(all u need here is to check his winrate in LCS with gragas and ekko). Letting Pob pick Victor whichever roatation he wants to, him being the only control mage op pick left after azir getting banned every game (surely bjerg can play him too if they want to leave him open?). Letting bjergsen play the second game of Yasuo after first one has shown that it is not gonna work. You have an enemy team full of cc and with 2 exhaust... There is a reason  why Yasuo is only picked as a counterpick to champions/teamcomps... Especially when they saw in the second game that it isnt working.		Overall western teams(both NA and EU) will be destroyed in worlds playoff phase (if some reaches it) not because of the mechanical skills of players but due to every team being so one-dimensional. Every team has obvious flaws, sometimes its pick and ban phase, sometimes its small champion pool, sometimes lack of macro tactics and not properly executed rotations or objective control, and sometimes its vision. Asian teams will spot this weaknesses in an instant and there is no way a western team an win in a bo5 unless they all improve and solve these problems rapidly.		I dont mean just NA teams, european finals was full of tactical blunders and mistakes by both teams. In LCK and LPL teams make mistakes too, but mostly only one per game because and at that point their opponents take advantage of it and win the game.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DraleXBadger","name":"t1_cudibim","parent_id":"t3_3i506g","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440413810,"created_utc":1440385010}

{"body":"The fundamental issue with TSM is that they are absolutely ideologically opposed to letting Dyrus be a carry. ALL of their problems since IEM start from there. You look at the game and you have one player who has been spamming Yasuo top for weeks, and you have another player who ADMITS he doesn't fully understand the champion, and you put Yasuo on the latter. Something is fundamentally wrong with how the team approaches League of Legends. The refusal to have Dyrus on carry tops warps their entire strategy and pick and ban in a lot of ways, as well as makes the team super predictable. Imagine if TSM was capable of responding to the game 1 Yasuo pick with their own Yasuo pick, or with a Fizz pick (when Fizz is quite possibly the best top laner in the game atm) or with a Gangplank pick (the other best top laner in the game)? But nah, just stick Dyrus on Nautilus.		You know what team was also ideologically opposed to letting their top laner carry?		CLG.		You know what team just won NA LCS largely because they cut that shit out?		CLG.		Second, Bjergsen just isn't that good people. He's NOWHERE near world class, proven by the fact that he gets destroyed whenever he goes against world class mids. He wins lane by virtue of getting to play with a 3rd summoner spell, and sometimes he can get fed and have a big impact, but unless he has a hyper mobile assassin, he just doesn't produce as much as the team puts into him.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ancienregime","name":"t1_cude1es","parent_id":"t3_3i506g","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440406316,"created_utc":1440377516}

The only difference is that middle has way more impact than ADC so he was able to carry that hard. I mean if you look back to the whole locodoco thing bjer pretty much has right to force pick in pick and ban so I feel like he doesn't trust Dryus on it.

{"body":"Welcome people from r/all! You must be asking yourself why the fuck is this so damn important.		Lets go with some bare bones basics. League of Legends is a video game. NA LCS is the North American professional esports league or League of Legends.		This is also the game for not only the first place match for NA but it also determines who goes to the world finals with the highest seed and the second seed. Winner of this match gets first seed and then the second is based on points earned through this split and the previous split.		So yeah there is a lot riding on this game however this is still only part of why this match is so huge. The other half is the teams.		The teams playing this match(CLG and TSM) have been in the scene since the start. When the professional scene was a little baby these were the two teams to watch. However over the years CLG has basically fallen flat on their faces. The last time CLG has placed 1st in anything is 2011. Even then the only time they have finished second between 2012 and now is once late 2014. Needless to CLG to even be in a finals match these days is HUGE.		Now what ends up happening is that underdog that never makes it to the finals  not only beat their long time rival **without dropping a single game** they are also on a 12 game win streak between the end of season groups and the playoffs.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"InvalidZod","name":"t1_cuddmtr","parent_id":"t3_3i506g","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440405618,"created_utc":1440376818}

I mean, not like that would've helped or anything, the issues spread far beyong pick/ban. It just kinda looked like TSM forgot about their new plan of being a dynamic triple threat team they did vs GV and TL, instead going back to their form in regular season with Santorin on support junglers, Dyrus on tanks, Bjerg picking god knows what for god knows what reason, and Lustboy getting constantly caught out when placing deep wards without any backup.

{"body":"Regardless of any misplays in-game, TSM's pick/ban strategy has been putting them at a huge disadvantage going into these games.		CLG first pick Braum, and TSM respond with a Kog'Maw and Gragas lock in. Quite standard.		CLG then lock Ashe and Ekko, and in response, *TSM should be locking Viktor and either Gnar or Janna*. For a Kog'Maw protection comp, it's essential that TSM lock a control mage like Viktor for waveclear, and can then choose between securing the Gnar pick and facing Yasuo in lane, or locking Janna for a counter-pick top.		Instead, TSM lock Nautlius and Janna, followed by Yasuo for a comp that makes no sense.		Gragas, Naut and Yasuo will all be diving the backline whilst Kog'Maw is hung out to dry with no way to safely attack CLG. They've locked half of a dive comp, and half of a protection comp with minimal waveclear.

{"body":"I can only think that TSM went on to full on Tilt mode in that last game.  Some of the stupid decisions made in that game...		Horrible pick ban from TSM in all 3 games.  All 3 single games.  Loco has been terrible in pick bans all season....and when he really needs to step it up when it comes he fails.  		Cant lay it all on Locos shoulders though.  Frankly all of TSM played badly.  Santorin was yet again non-existant as a jungler...and when you have the best Ult on your team to set up Bjerg Ults he never once managed to get them off properly.  He got outplayed by Xmithie who had a much bigger impact for his team.		All of TSM were off their game..but honestly CLG showed exactly how you beat TSM.  You dont let them play passive.  You dont let them get to late game.  A better team than CLG would have ended that game even earlier.		Worlds coming up and TSM are nowhere right now.  They are playing poorly, have no real co-ordination.

Why not pick OLAF the 3rd game when enemy team has an ashe?? Why didnt turtle walk in the fucking bush?? I fealt like those three games were Wildturle and 4 wards. He had some questionable positioning but to me he played the best out of all 5 of them. Bjergsen was just disappointing the whole series. Their team comp was complete shit last 2 games with no ap damage since jungler and top were going tank and all clg needed was frozen hearts.

Xmithie did great despite the hate, he's back to his S3 form IMO.		Pobelter played amazing. Very underrated and finally lived up to potential.		Zion did great despite being behind in the beginning.		Aphro/Dlift did great yet again.			TSM doe		Wildturtle despite doing pretty well in the series, will be remembered for that exposed recall.		Dyrus is done, he played ok but his shit champion pool got exposed.		Santorin didn't do to good as well. He had some chances where he could flash ult with Grag but never took it. 		Bjergsen played alright but focusing Janna on that Dlift pentakill.		Lustboy got caught a few times too.			Overall as a TSM fan, CLG really deserved this.

{"body":"Im an avid TSM Fan, they introduced me to the world of esports back in S2 and they'll always be my favorite in my heart, but I gotta admit that CLG played way better this series.  	STILL, I'd be surprised how much of a time's left on whoever did the drafts for TSM. Not a fan at all of an unmovile adc for a team that holds so much engage and CC (even tho they picked it early on the first game they should've adapted to it).  	Second, I don't know if Bjergsen can't play Viktor for shit, but how on hell do they let Pobelter have it the entire series??!?! This really upsets me, why dont you give it to Bjergsen, let alone pick it, and if they were so afraid of the Yasuo, why dont they ban it instead of handicapping Bjergsen with it for the other two games, as far as I know Yasuo is not a meta mid laner and TSM lacks a control mage and magic poke on the midlane, this was awful from TSM.  	Third, not a fan at all of Nautilus toplaner, he's a bag of CC but I dont think he holds the kit to become a helpful toplaner, and it felt that it got picked for the sake of making the Yasuo pick even worse, still, this might just be my opinion.

The only things that went wrong was a few mistakes in the early game and miscommunication at a few separate times. Congrats once again to the entire CLG organization		TSM on the other hand....they just seemed so lackadaisical in this final series like they were content with just a 2nd seed at worlds. This isnt fully a representation of how TSM can play but they should be worried that the constant issues of the draft phase, team fights, rotations, and early game will continue to be a issue at worlds. These issues yes can be fixed but, boy its going to be tough for them.		We all know CLG out drafted TSM in this series and congrats to them. The questions i have for Locodoco is why wasnt there more adaptation in the in the draft phase? Why wasnt the advantage of a red side counter pick used for Dyrus?

{"body":"Team Solo Mid just hugely underperformed the entire series. WildTurtle had mediocre positioning, causing him to be hit by numerous ultimates and unnecessary damage. They tried to stick with the same, wait for late game teamfight comp while CLG had actually stepped up and halted any attempt at that. 		"We've been scrimming each other for a long time now, and we know each others playstyles."		So then CLG outpicks TSM purely by a surprise factor + locking in safe picks to retaliate against whatever TSM could bring to the table, which would end up as the same comp dressed up differently. They left Viktor up for picks in all three games, which had gone to Pobelter for free. You could have thought that maybe they had came up with something to punish Viktor, but instead Bjerg steals the Yasuo pick from Zion and proceeds to get 1-2 man ultimates that barely clean up the fight. Pobelter played great, of course, along with Zion but imo the mistakes made by TSM outweighed the achievements of CLG.		Also; what's up with Dyrus ulting Xmithie in game two? He's low, but compared to a Jinx who was positioned right next to him within range, which happened TWICE, which was understandable the first time when Janna was hovering next to Jinx, but the second time was a let down.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ImJustHereForABanana","name":"t1_cudczzx","parent_id":"t3_3i506g","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440404579,"created_utc":1440375779}

This style will absolutely not work at worlds, and it's honestly better for TSM to have this massively exposed now prior to boot camp than at worlds.		It's also good that NA will be sending an early-game focused team to World. Zion definitely deserves to showcase his talents vs the best top lane talent in the world.		At this point though, it'll come down to the group draw. The certain thing is CLG will not face LGD or FNC, and most likely not face SKT (barring the outcome of KT/SKT). However, they could still get a group potentially of AHQ Origen EDG.

Now they're going to spend the next 5 weeks in Korea; hopefully having their style getting wrecked until they adapt a new one.		It's clear: Adapt a more aggressive early game with the juggernaut patch, or exit Worlds in the group stage.

When they faced another early game team (TIP) they had pretty decent deficits in 2 of the games, luckily for them TIP couldn't get out of their own way. Against TSM, they faced a team that let them do whatever they want; but they still had trouble team fighting.		What does CLG do if they face a Chinese team that just smashes their early aggression, and outskirmishes them? What do they do if they face a Korean team that out-rotates and avoids the early aggression, when CLG's team fighting is suspect? 		In my opinion, CLG faces similar problems to TL; their individual laning will hold up at worlds but I have some serious doubts about their macro play. TSM is the polar opposite, I think their macro play would be fine at the international level if they didn't exit the laning phase with a 2 dragon/5k gold deficit every time.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tyrandis","name":"t1_cuddy2a","parent_id":"t1_cuddokj","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440406154,"created_utc":1440377354}

They never adapted all split long to the meta shifts.  They never changed their focus to be stronger in early/mid game.  As it stands the likes of FNC/SKT will have TSM beat in sub 30 mins every single time.		So they should know where the game is at...and if the players champion pools are not suitable for the meta then as a coaching staff they should see that and make the players play a stupid amount of hours on the champions that are in meta.

{"body":"While CLG did play very well and I give them all the credit for winning the series handily, I believe TSM Lost in pick ban by only using 1-2 threat compositions and not setting up the yasuo pick for success. TSM has 2 phenominal Yasuo players in Dyrus and Bjergsen. Dyrus climbed to challenger on Yasuo's back and Bjerg is a monster on anything. It was obvious TSM was constructing their p/b phase for Yasuo in all 3 games but they should have flexed the pick in every game in an early rotation pick rather than taking it in the last rotation. By taking it in the last rotation you are essentially telling the other team that the yasuo will be mid which is why Pobelter got away with picking Viktor blindly into yasuo twice. In game 3 it would have been better for that Yasuo to go to the top lane as Pobelter had already locked in the Viktor and Yasuo would beat/go even with  all 3 of Zion's most comfortable and likely champs (Gnar, Fizz or Rumble). The Naut Janna lock in the 2nd rotation for TSM in Game 3 was beyond comprehension, and basically ensured that CLG would beat TSM in game 3 who was running a 1 threat composition until Kog reached his power spikes. CLG would have never seen Dyrus's Yasuo top coming in a million years and I for one believe that Dyrus put in enough time/games on Yasuo to pull it off. This would have allowed Bjerg to play a hard counter to Viktor that could effect the map/team fights with either an LB pick or Orianna. Not a fan of this last Bo5 series from TSM and as a TSM fan I hope we can get back on track. Lots to learn from here.

CLG's bans were expected.  Game 1, frankly, I was a little surprised that Kog wasn't flexed to MID, and they looked to pickup Sivir or something.  As CLG fan I was afraid of Kog bjerg poke potential.		Game 2 banning Trist was the right thing to do, but Kalista makes no sense if WT can actually play her.  It may have changed CLG's p/b strat then leaving one of those 3 champs up for TSM... Olaf is fine really unless you were planning on FP it.		I think this was the game i was most nervous about seeing that TSM had some dive-y champs and wasn't sure CLG had enough peel for Double.  it got extremely dicey in the middle with some even/losing fights and I was getting worried.  I think CLG just outplayed TSM that game, especially Zion 1v2 and DL able to penta late near bot inhib.		Game 3.  Again at this point, I felt like Kog should have flexed mid, but I think they were set on playing Yasuo, and since Dyrus wasn't able to play it to counter Gnar, it went to Bjerg which just is not as good mid.   And again CLG got Viktor, which o well :/.		I think Game 3 p/b was just tilt.  And while they took away Gragas from Xmithie, it left Ekko open.  So that did nothing for them except give Yasuo a bely slam + barrel for Yasuo.

I feel like the only reason they picked Gragas is to peel for Kog with R or allow Yasuo to ult with bodyslam. Sorry but again Ekko done his job better. Mobile jungler with AoE stun, and able to deal dmg even in tank build. Jungle Diana would be 10000x better if they really wanted to build around Yasuo since Diana can easly R->E for DianaxYasuo wombo combo. And if they wanted peel for Kog then Udyr or Voli or even Naut jungle would do this job much better. There is so much good junglers and they picked Gragas xD 	* Yasuo? lmao wtf Bjerg was thinking? why would you even pick Yasuo vs team with CC on every champ and 3 bruisers/tanks? please even Annie mid would be more useful. After seeing Braum, Ashe and Ekko they should totally forget about Yasuo..... unless... they wanted him JUST for windwall...oh wait most of windwall was easily avoided by Aphro by moving few steps to side :D?	* KogMaw? I won't even mention how odd WildTurtle played (specially that action when he didn't recalled in bush with rest of the team so it ended with whole team annihilation cause of that -> Ashe ult and chain reaction of that). First pick ADC that have no mobility? Let's counter him with CC machine team	* Janna? the only normal pick. Sadly it was forced because of that retarded KogMaw pick and lack of Lulu + Yasuo in plans.
