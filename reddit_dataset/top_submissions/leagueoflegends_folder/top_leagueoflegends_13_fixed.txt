Fnatic, who went 21-0, had a *15k gold lead* in Game 4, and waited for legit 25 minutes before just LOSING. Their pick and ban in multiple games was awful. Huni, carry top laner, had an awful series all around; even his showings during their wins were subpar. Febiven was solid throughout but never really made any huge plays. Xpeke was exposed. The one highlight of the series was OG's great fucking team composition game 1, which proceeded to be never let through again in the series, for good reason. 		Positioning, vision control, rotations, decision making... there never seemed to be a really clear gameplan from either team, or at least on the level that you'd expect from teams hoping to make it into the Top 4 at Worlds.

I already stated Game 1 was some clean shit, before you. But it was all downhill from there; you can't highlight any other part of the series and go "wow that was impressive or well executed," but I'm still getting downvoted to hell because I'm doing an objective comparison of both regions.

I'm still waiting for someone to either refute any points I've made; I could make a VOD, play by play, and point out more mistakes in this series than any other I've seen this season. People were expecting Fnatic to clean 3-0, and other than game 1 the fact that this series was close was not Origen's prowess, but Fnatic's overconfidence.

That isn't a throw, that is Origen playing well. It isn't like Fnatic went to a baron and Origen stole it or get an ace. 			So with that said, game 2 was just fnatic snowballing the game, Game 3 was reignover giving Huni the lead and Origen couldn't get to back line so it was over. Game 4 was Origen playing to late game and playing the peak of a Tristana team comp and fnatic lacking engage. Game 5 was just xpeke getting caught and playing really bad (even though I am fan of him), this game fnatic could end the game, so what is the "throw" you are talking about? was any baron stolen? any  bad fight? both team really did good teamfights there weren't any sloppy teamfight (besides peke not playing azir really well).			If you watched  Tip vs CLG, Tip doesn't know how to teamfighting.		TL vs TSM was 30 minutes farming and  then TL not having teamfight sinergy and just went donezo in TF.

Usually I subscribe to Thorin's "potential is bullshit" and "rate teams as they have actually presented themselves", but Fnatic had such a stellar rate of growth combined with seeming to be  fast adapters when facing strong competition, that I'm optimistic for them. At MSI alone they seemed to have improved at a rapid pace. And the Korean teams behind SKT have shown some weird inconsistencies even in important matches. Yes, in this playoff semifinals KOO and KT looked good, but considering there will be patches and foreign teams I'm not quite so confident that they will be exactly as good at worlds. If any other team but them makes it, my concerns would be even greater.		About OG, yes I might overrate them but they do have some clutch players with great experience and have shown that "strategy is their weak point" is much less true than we originally might have thought.

{"body":"I have to say that was really overall well played by Soaz. He was the biggest reason why Origen won game 1 and kept Origen in the game early-mid in game 4 for Niels to carry it later, *and* was the biggest reason why Origen had a chance to win in games 2 and 5. I had pretty much wrote him off for this matchup against Huni but he definitely showed up today despite their loss. He provided a lot of pressure that forced Fnatic to go after him, freeing up the rest of Origen to do their work.  		Soaz is my MVP of that final even though Origen lost.  		I have no doubt that Origen will easily go through regionals hardly breaking a sweat. Their preparations for the semis and the final have been top drawer, defeating the now #2 EU seed 3-1 and taking 2 games off a team that hadn't lost for 3 months.

While I have to admit his positioning was good, it was Fnatic's decision to not field any hard cc during that game that caused him to carry it.

It was a protect the AD carry comp that was allowed to scale to late game because of the lack of decent engage from Fnatic.

{"body":"Half of Fnatic's roaster gets benched, when asked about the teams status Yellowstar stated: "Our team wasn't in it's Element and we're currently not working well together, the fact we couldn't end undefeated really turned the people inside our Alliance into a bunch of Renegades."

When the scene was investigated by the police, a bunch of salt from unknown Origens have been found in the studios.		 It's belived that the fire also destroyed 85% of the lore department material, we've only been able to recover a few lines of text regarding "Dark, secret pasts" and "Mysterious creatures", it's unknown what this could be refering to.","depth":0,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Vroxis","name":"t1_cud4h3r","parent_id":"t3_3i46bk","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440389752,"created_utc":1440360952}

{"body":"> Where in what I said is an emotional rant? 		All of it. Especially when you mashed your caps lock for extra dramatic effect. 		Oh yes, you state one thing and tunnel your entire analysis around it. Ermahgerd 3 fail tower dives, that's all I'm going to talk about. Ermahgerd 3 baron can't crack open base. Ermahgerd Peke bad Azir. 		Cherry picking things and using it as a summary is not analysis. Nothing you've said is constructive, or valuable to any discussion about this series. Let me break down everything for you. 		> Holy shit I don't think i've ever seen a worse fucking series in my life.		First of all, nobody gives a flying fuck about what you've seen in your life. Second of all, that statement is clearly bullshit. There have been MANY series that were "worse" than this. If you truly believe that this is the worst series you've ever seen in your life. Then it must mean that either, you barely watch League, or you have no clue what you're talking about.		>  Game 2 FNC wins when they failed 3 fucking dives		Yes they do win when they failed several tower dives. So lets take a look at why that is. Origen's draft Olaf/Gragas/Lulu/Sivir/Alistar. Compare that with Gangplank/Elise/Orianna/Tristana/Janna. Which team scales better? Fnatic's. Which team has the superior teamfight? Fnatic. How did Fnatic win? Through a teamfight. Voilà, the mystery is solved. 		> Then Fnatic cant even break OGs base with 3 fucking baron buffs in game 4. 		Once again, lets look at team comps! Fnatic have a Gangplank that was solo killed at least twice that game, a Nida/Viktor/Corki/Tahm Kench. They have wave clear, but have to walk into dangerous range to hit the tower. Origen have siege defence with Lulu and Tristana who can clear from a distance, as well as a Braum that can block valuable siege spells. They also have to pay attention to the potential flank from a fed Fizz/the splitpush pressure that he creates. So how else can they "crack open the base"? Through getting a pick. But how can they get a pick with a poke comp? Hmm, I don't think that's what their comp is meant to do. The only thing that they could've done better, is attempt to tower dive the inhib towers and use Tahm Kench to reset aggro. 		> Xpekes Azir was fucking god awful, literally if he did anything in half of the fights OG would've won game 5		Yes his Azir was poor that game. But let's look at the Azir pick, what's he meant to do in his current state? He's not a burst mage anymore, so he has to do consistent dps through his sand soldiers from a safe distance. But he also has to worry about a fed Olaf with ghost, who can ignore his ult, and who has a lulu speed buff. Let's look at xPeke's only source of peel, oh a Janna. What else though, does he have a tanky front line to protect him? No, he doesn't. There's no tank on his team. So yes, he played poor. I'm not denying this, yes his ults and his positioning was very poor. But it's not like it was going to be easy for him to begin with. He had to play with 100% self sufficiency, that game he didn't.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"xXDaNXx","name":"t1_cud6eq0","parent_id":"t1_cud5i0x","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440392986,"created_utc":1440364186}

A rant.....sort of but that's what telling your opinion on something is. You can call every post on here that's more than 2 sentences long a rant. That's not really something to try to insult someone with. 			What is made up about my points? It is a fucking opinion on Fnatic and the retarded reaction of some of there fanboys. All opinions are "made up".......that's what the fuck an opinion is. 			How is it hard to understand? I watch these teams play.......I see a lot of terrible games and terrible teams playing in them. That leads me to believe that the region is in a terrible spot....given that 7-8 teams in the EU LCS are just a complete shit show. 		You tell me how you think the region is super competitive atm....You think it makes a region appear strong when 2 teams that are fucking awful play against each other in a close match? 			Do you really think Fnatic going undefeated for 18 games has more to do with them being SOOOOOOO much better than any team in the regions history more so than the 9 other teams as a whole just being so damn weak? 		I think Fnatic is a good team and could compete with any other all time great team in EU but they are not undoubtedly superior. They are not the best team in the world and I think it's pushing it to say they are even top 6-7. 			I mean all i'm hearing from u is that you love Fnatic and therefore they are good.....Fnatic is way better than those other teams because.......i like Fnatic right?","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iwin555","name":"t1_cudqh99","parent_id":"t1_cudpgrr","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440437935,"created_utc":1440409135}
