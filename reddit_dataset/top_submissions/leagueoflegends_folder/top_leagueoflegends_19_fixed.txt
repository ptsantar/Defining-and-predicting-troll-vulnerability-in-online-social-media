These guys have all been considered superstars of their teams and/or legends on their own right at certain points in time, it really shouldn't be overlooked how much midlane talent there is at this tournament, all these players have a LOT of individual storylines behind them too, it's crazy		Faker, piece of topic, he who lived up to the hype of becoming an incredible e-sports superstar right away and whose reign doesn't seem to end		GODV, midlane prodigy that stood up to the Korean mid-lane imports of china without fear and is now regarded as a star		Pawn, coming to his 2nd back-to-back world championship having been the victor last year after a season of kicking the king's ass like no one else could, both with SSW at OGN Summer and with EDG at MSI, a lot of people overlooked him as a legend in his own right, but he has proved himself and is here to do it yet again		xPeke, who was there at the beginning and just now is seeming to slow down, tasked with the duty of proving he's not done yet after a lackluster showing at the EU LCS finals, the Spanish Superstar now brings his very own squad to compete, but will he be at the level of the individuals he, himself, put together?		Febiven, as a part of Fnatic and their undefeated campaign this summer is followed by the hype of taking the king down at MSI, but to him, that doesn't matter, this is the stage where he wants to prove himself and though he's a team centered player, he's shown time and time again he CAN make the plays, it's all down to confidence		Bjergsen, seen as the sole threat of TSM, will come in with the viewers' eyes set on him; as the meta seemingly shifts in favor of assassins, after a transition from an individual killing machine to a team player and leader, will North America's finest individual manage to carry his team on a group where they're expected to fall? 		Incarnati0n, the long-awaited prodigy of Europe saw resurgence from death after having been dealt a ban that would seemingly last forever, became the new beacon of C9 with big shoes to fill; his first competitive season wasn't an easy one. It wasn't clean. It wasn't pretty. But despite all that, behind the promise of the very person he replaced, it's Incarnati0n's turn to prove himself and the hype behind him as someone who can compete with the very best. Having to face the likes of Westdoor, Rookie, and Febiven in the group stage, only time will tell us if the magic worked by Incarnati0n and Hai in the late summer season has run out.		Pobelter, another long-awaited prodigy, this time straight from North America, saw the first year and a half of his LCS career end up in utter failure, playing in relegations not once, but 3 times, finally being defeated on the last one... All the hype around him seemed to be dead, however, Pobelter wasn't done, and after just one split with CLG, he finally saw the North American trophy become his, and although he's a man of low expectations, eyes are set on his team to get out of their group and show NA's finest are no joke.

{"body":"I feel like Armada is more of a methodical wall. He's incredibly consistent and just going into a set against him there seems to be a lot of pressure since you know he's always going to perform near his true skill level.		A player like Leffen is incredibly inconsistent, and he drops sets to non-gods on the regular, has some pretty poor placings otherwise, and when he loses he sometimes gets flat out dumpstered instead of having it be close. When he's on, he's really frightening and high tech skill, but most of that to me seems the opposite of Armada. 		I mean Faker is consistently great as well, but I'm not sure I would compare the two. Faker doesn't seem to be as evenly measured and cautious as Armada is, Faker is like a white hot ball of flame that will be aggressive on you even in situations where he shouldn't be able to and make it work.		Current form Mango is having some issues, but Faker honestly reminds me more of him. Not in personality but very much in play style.		Faker will play or do whatever he wants in a game, he'll go in when you don't think he should be able to, he will always out play you in the moment.

{"body":"Ken (SephirothKen) from SSBM.		What's interesting is that a lot of these players (Boxer from SC, Ken from SSBM, to name two) were so dominant in their day because they literally invented a new dominating meta. Boxer played Terran at a time when Terran was considered weak and invented/popularized a lot of techniques like dropship plays that made him so devastating. Likewise, Ken incorporated a lot of dash dancing, aerials into his game and of course the Ken combo. Everyone they played against were just trying to keep up with what they were doing.		Nowadays, since these games are much more mature, the meta is much slower to change and the gap between the top players is much smaller. Going back to SSBM, by consensus there are now 6 "Gods" of Smash and they are close enough that any of them could take games/sets off the others by having a good day/their opponent having a bad day. It's hard to picture that a new player in the SSBM scene could show up today that can dominate as much as Ken did, just because all of the top players are playing so close to the limits of what the game allows.		Likewise, Faker is coming in doing things on multiple champions that people didn't even know was possible -- he is pushing the boundaries of the game. Of course, others will eventually learn the limits of these champions as well, and when that happens it will be interesting to see if Faker can stay on top. To say that Faker is "the greatest player that LoL will ever have" or "the greatest player that eSports will ever have" is very shortsighted to say, I think (although it does make for a great sound byte). Boxer and Ken are not considered great players by today's standards of play, and likewise I think future LoL players will play with even more effective metas/styles that will surpass Faker's.","depth":1,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"4A18B156","name":"t1_cv8tx9s","parent_id":"t1_cv8kvi4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1442852329,"created_utc":1442823529}

{"body":"Daigo "The Beast" Umehara of Street Fighter was very much that kind of a dominant player for a long time, and by rights is still a top level player.		I'm not sure if you know much about Street Fighter or follow fighters so that might make it seem less impressive, but Daigo's [full parry] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtuA5we0RZU) is considered one of the greatest moments in competitive gaming history, and I still get chills every time I watch it. 		For context, he had to parry every individual kick with exact and precise timing (As simply blocking would have assured the kill on him, which was what Justin Wong was going for, something that was practically assured and the safest option by far, he thought), having to jump to parry the final hit as well which is even more difficult, and then building his meter at the end to chain it into a finisher of his own to claim the match. 		Considering his deficit going into that video, along with every other factor (In an interview Justin Wong claimed that he even tried to shake the table to disrupt his concentration and timing so he would mess up and die, but it didn't end up working), it was just incredibly clutch even for someone who was considered such a great player already.		After all, Daigo is to this day, considered the greatest Street Fighter player of all time and the most successful statistically, with the record for most wins. He still maintains a respectable amount of 1st place finishes to this day, and at the age of 34 years old. He got his very first, 1st place finish in 1998, at age 17, so he arguably has the most longevity of a professional player in competitive gaming, at least I can't think of any players that have been top level competitors for so much time. He has 40 1st place finishes as of 2015 according to the internet, with most of his other placings being 2nd or 3rd. 		Sorry for the wall of text, especially since I've just now seen that Daigo has been mentioned, but I wanted to give some context to who Daigo is, an example of his amazing level of play, and his achievements throughout the many years he has competed. Incredibly interesting and dominant player, and one of the reasons that I love and watch E-Sports.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Milk_Cows","name":"t1_cv8wery","parent_id":"t1_cv8kvi4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1442863780,"created_utc":1442834980}

High pressure situation, crowd yelling in your ears, his opponent trying to physically mess him up, down to a sliver of health where blocking any move would kill you, frame perfect parrying of individual kicks (15 I think), building his meter with the last few hits, and perfectly executing his own finisher.		For some more context, in a special edition or version/collection or some such, the "Daigo full parry" situation was added in as a challenge event/training mode option. Watching two normal people try it on youtube, it took them 152 tries to do the full sequence of events (Parrying the chunli, the jump parry, the meter building, the special move usage).		Keep in mind that they're also doing it in a zero pressure environment at home making it a lot easier, and still it takes 150 tries to get it right.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Milk_Cows","name":"t1_cv9ksz6","parent_id":"t1_cv99mnr","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1442906142,"created_utc":1442877342}
