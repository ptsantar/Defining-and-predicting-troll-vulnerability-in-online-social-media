{"body":"As I view it the league of legends team works like a sitcom cast.	 	Bot lane consists of a stable character who often has to work alongside someone who is on the verge of being incompetent. The dynamic between these characters is often a big draw. In this way they are a foil to each other pointing out the differences between them. The stable character is the support and the more absurd one is the adc.	  	Mid is the reasonable character and usually the main character. The focus is usually on them and they can relate with any of the other roles pretty well and has much more responsibilities than the wild child and as such will usually get more blame when they mess up. They are also seen as needing to help the rest of the family with their problems. 		The jungler is the recurring neighbor/close friend. They show up and you know things will be central to who is the focus. They can be used with any other character and something is sure to start. Their ability to move from location to location makes them able to tie the group together more.  	  	Top is a stand alone character. Usually their story lines are apart from the rest of the group but sometimes they work with the reasonable child and the close friend. They aren't necessarily the focus of attention intially but they are crucial to the show. They also can have some of the whackiest adventures. Eventually they get tied into the rest of the characters.	  	You could probably make a team out of most sitcoms using this.","depth":1,"score":71,"ups":71,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TeTrodoToxin4","name":"t1_crhbasd","parent_id":"t1_crh1o34","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1432320849,"created_utc":1432292049}

{"body":"Reminds me go the ranked game I played where I supported a Vayne that thought he was the next LoL messiah. It started in laning phase where literally every time he got in lane post-4 he would all in the Sivir and try to tower dive 1v2, he thought that if he killed the support, but Sivir killed him he was winning lane, but by the end he was 5-4 and Sivir was 5-2 and up 50 CS. Mid and late game got worse because he thought he was a hero and split push without wards and kill anyone that went to stop him. One time late game my entire team except for him were by the mid lane river brush after doing dragon and he engaged 1v5 and obviously died and then flamed us for not being there to help him. Actually the one time he grouped he got a pants which he took total credit for and immediately after went right back to going in 1v5 and 2v5.
