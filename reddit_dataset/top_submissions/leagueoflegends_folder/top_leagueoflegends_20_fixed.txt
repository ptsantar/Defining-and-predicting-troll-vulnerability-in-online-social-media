{"body":"In general it's because there's little value in taking it level 1 compared to Q. 1 Q does more damage than 1 E, Q starts stacking your passive, gives you ms to harass and back off better, and costs less mana level 1.

{"body":"In lane you don't have an offensive/defensive summoner for early on lane phase, even later you have to get challenging smite if you're going to be using it for 1v1s. You also have to invest in items that don't give you actual stats (basically they give you jungle stats which do you no good in lane), which hurts in trades. I know there's the whole thing where you can heal off raptor camp, but that can be easily countered by being aggressive. Then you get to the late game and you have smite, which isn't all that great for team fights, unless they are diving you in which challenging might keep you alive.		I'm personally not a fan of it because exhaust does wonders on Cass, but I could see it's usefulness if it's just going to be a heavy farm lane (like Ryze, Xerath, etc.) in which you could take raptors and wolves whenever smite is up, and you could steal skuttler as well. Also, once you have the jungle item, you get extra gold from jungle monsters which will help you snowball faster. 			The real problem is that going jungle on Cass puts you behind on getting your scaling items like tear and RoA. The only way I can see it working is if you're in a farm lane, you only pick up tear, and then go for the jungle luden and archangels followed by Rylais. It's just not very efficient.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DaddyF4tS4ck","name":"t1_czifmxr","parent_id":"t1_czie8hm","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1454259284,"created_utc":1454230484}

Following Cass's normal buildpath after starting Talisman and replacing Luden's with Runic Echos, you ramp the way you normally would into late game.
