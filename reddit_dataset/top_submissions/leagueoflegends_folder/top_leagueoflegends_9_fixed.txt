Phage used to slow as well, now it doesn't so it makes it weird to build into the Frozen Mallet.		What I would suggest is to change the recipe of Black Cleaver: Remove Kindlegem, add Brutalizer. Pros are	* Brutalizer has a second build item	* Both passives of Black Cleaver are justified. The Brutalizer for the first, the Phage for the second.		One could argue that you have to change some stats for the item. I would say you only would have to change the attack damage of the item, and the total price of the Black Cleaver. Just make the Black Cleaver with 45 AD and up the total price to 3150-3200. Therefor, you dont really change the efficiency of it.		You could also make a Liandry's kind of item for the brutalizer. For example, the Razor Blade:	* Razor Blade = Brutalizer + Pickaxe	* 60 AD	* 10% CDR	* Unique Passive: +15 armor penetration	* Unique Passive: Dealing physical damage causes the enemy to bleed for 1% of the target's current health per second for 3 seconds.		This makes it a AD focussed Liandry's.

As an example, the Dota 2 item [Poor Man's shield.](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Poor_Man's_Shield) As described there, "It can greatly help some agility heroes tank harass damage in the laning phase and slightly increase survivability in other situations."

I believe this type of item is exactly what brutalizer is as well. You get a cheap item that is gold efficient but will not be as useful as another item later in the game.

From the very first comment I responded to: "thats like the point of dorans items, very cost efficient for the stats they give, but dont upgrade, shouldnt be put into items you actually upgrade too." While his wording is poor, my understanding of it was that Dorans is gold efficient but doesn't upgrade, but that if you upgrade into an item (Brutalizer) it should not have the same problem where it doesn't upgrade again. The person who said that further reinforces this belief by saying in other comments that he thinks Bruta sould still upgrade even if its another niche pick-up for champions that normally build Brutalizer.		> "you got something nice, you don't deserve another nice thing"		Yes that is exactly what I am saying, please show why it's good to have a great item build into another great item. That's like saying, "[Insert champion] should not be weak at any phase of the game, they should scale perfectly." Items can peak in mid game and fall off late game, just like champions.		Why is it exactly that Brutalizer has to upgrade into some other shitty item? You keep talking about a brutalizer upgrade, but that it should suck balls so as to not be too efficient but at the same time better than selling and buying another item. Your suggestion is to give it a slightly shitty upgrade because you want it to build into something. Why not leave it well enough alone?

{"body":"The other response you got doesn't give the full explanation, so I'll try!  I'm sorry if this seems pandering, but I don't know how much you know so I'm starting basically from scratch.  Just give me a reply if you want or need more explanation or detail! 		Basically, you need to start with how armor works.  Each point of armor gives you 1% "effective health," meaning if you have 100 armor, for all intents and purposes, you have twice your normal health when taking physical damage which means you take half damage.  With 200 armor you have three times your normal health, or you take one third damage.  If you look at the numbers, though, you'll notice exponential decay.  From 0-100 armor your damage halves, from 100-200 it only reduces by 33%, and so on, so even though you gain the same flat amount of effective health it's a smaller bonus relative to how much you already have. 		With this knowledge it's a given that armor penetration will reduce effective health.  Now in theory you always reduce their effective health by 10% with it, but using the same reasoning as with armor, reducing them from 40 armor to 30 gives you a larger damage boost than reducing from 65 to 55 because that 10% is much more significant when taken out of 140% than 165%.		Example:  Say a Zed with 120 base AD is autoing two targets - one with 30 armor and 1200 health, and one with 80 armor and 1200 health.  		For the first target, the math is 1200*1.3/120, or 13 hits to dead.  For the second, the math is 120*1.8/120, or 18 hits to dead.  		Now I'll split the calculations: the first set giving Zed only the AD from brutalizer, the second giving him both the AD and armor pen. 		First enemy, AD only: 1200*1.3/(120+25)=10.76ish hits to dead, round up to 11 since .76 hits is impossible. 		First enemy, AD and arpen: 1200*(1.3-.1)/(120+25)=9.93ish, rounded up to 10.  As you can see, the arpen shaved an extra auto off of what's necessary, which is only made more prominent when you factor in physical damage abilities and higher base AD. 		Now then, second enemy, AD only: 1200*1.8/(120+25)=14.90, or 15 autos.  Note that the bonus AD reduced the necessary auto attacks by 3 in this instance and only 2 on the first target because it's applying more times total since he's attacking more. 		Second enemy, AD and arpen: 1200*(1.8-.1)/(120+25)=14.06, or still 15 autos necessary.  Something interesting happens in the math here - while bonus AD reduced the number of autos necessary by a greater amount on the higher armor target, it was a flat reduction from the armor penetration.  10.76-9.93=0.83; 14.90-14.06=0.84, which is within rounding error.  		You can then take this reasoning to the extreme: in the case of a Zed, he's gonna be popping squishies like nobody's business, so say that the 10 arpen makes it so a full combo and 1 auto with deathmark instead of full combo and 2 autos with deathmark, that's suddenly a 50% reduction in necessary autos, whereas on a tankirr target it may reduce from full combo (ultimate included) and 9 autos to full combo (always ult) and 8 autos, which is an 11% reduction in necessary autos. 		This also explains why arpen often isn't a good buy on ADCs - their job is to just hit shit, whatever the most important target that they can _safely_ touch is, they do it.  This will often be the tank, where the arpen is shown to be much less effective overall.  In the case of an assassin, though: they just want high-priority targets, and carries usually have significantly less armor.		Also, not that this is ever really relevant, but you can reduce enemy armor and MR below zero, in which case you'd be doing more than true damage!","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tatsko","name":"t1_cugldy4","parent_id":"t1_cugj7ee","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440645444,"created_utc":1440616644}

The reduced flexibility in build paths wasn't a gigantic deal... until she fell out of the spotlight due to _further_ inconsiderate nerfs and no future compensation for them when tank junglers were buffed and assassins were nerfed. Nowadays, Kayle suffers from one of the lowest pick rates and is only played by hardcore Kayle mains (i.e. Shakarez).

I'll be honest: I haven't yet tried Runeglave on her, but what benefit does Kayle jungle give over other AP junglers anyways?

{"body":">"Do you want Pantheon and Riven nerfs?"		I agree with your notion, but this is reddit and you can't ask that question here and get a logical answer, this subreddit hates Riven.		On a more serious note, Black Cleaver might have been targeted in the past, but with the juggernaut upgrade there is literally no AD top laner or jungler who doesn't build Phage in one way or the other. Black Cleaver is popular on Garen, Pantheon, Darius, Riven, Fiora, Lee Sin, Gnar, Gangplank, Jayce,Kha'Zix, Renekton, Rengar, Talon, Urgot, Vi, Xin and Zed. Other Champs who deal mixed damage build a triforce (Jax, Irelia, Shyvana, Olaf etc.) Phage has to be the most popular item after the Dorans items. 		Add to all of that that Pantheon and Riven have immense problems dealing with loads of health, and that the juggernaut meta encourages 4-5 people with 3000 or more HP in one team. Moreover, Riven and Pantheon gain nothing from building the way juggernauts currently do (BC and Fulltank), so they are currently immensely set behind. Steraks Gage, Titanic Hydra and the new Warmogs encourage those with Health scalings and high free resistances to get a lot of damage, a BorKish brutalizer upgrade might help those who can't build HP effectively to still be viable without creating more "feast and famine."		And to finish this, all the juggernauts post-rework immensely stop snowballing of squishy champions alltogether. Garens Villain mechanics even punishes you for getting to the feast part.

I'm not sure on the specifics but mostly I was just thinking that one core group that loves Brutalizer but doesn't know what do build it into are those early-game snowbally assassins like Talon or Shaco who rely on gambling everything on a stupid early gank to get ahead.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Aconator","name":"t1_cugv33e","parent_id":"t1_cugjoaq","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440660477,"created_utc":1440631677}

If our sole goal would be "reduce IE purchase rate", this would be an easier solve.			Not considering the Brutalizer path for Marksmen, you are more thoroughly correct.  Right now, the optimal direction is too clear.

It's cool that 1-2 ADCs actually can play like assassins, 1-2 can play like ad casters - given that they have appropriate downsides in other areas (twitch is very squishy and vulnerable with backloaded burst in terms of expunge, graves is low range and thus worse at teamfighting).

So... QSS and Banshee's. Blegh.)		Well, utility items are pretty lacking in variety for the ADC class don't you agree? 		Again, I know you're probably sick of it, but drawing from DotA 2 - adding more item actives would be more interesting. 		For example, an alternative lifesteal item with an active that triples your lifesteal bonus (and maybe gives some other bonuses?) for a short time and then drops your lifesteal to 0 gradually increasing until it's off cd again. It'd be extremely powerful in keeping yourself alive at the right time, but if you activate it too early you waste it and lose power, and if you activate it too late you'll die (or at the least, lose dps because you died sooner). But the enemy can also play around it holding onto cc to cc you during the brief duration, or kite back while you use it. It'd also be a situational item based on team comp because it'd be near useless against a heavy dive comp with cc, even bt would be better for the shield, but stronger in 1v1s and in kite comps where you can choose to disengage and wait for the cd to gain some of your power back. 		Or for a poke siege comp, your range and damage for your first attack increases by x/sec (capped at max tower range, if that really matters) after 5 seconds being out of combat. One free AA once in a while won't make you a dps god in teamfights but it does emphasize the ADC role in sieging towers or in poke comps/sieging in general, if that's what your team needs. 		Perhaps giving specific item ideas is bad because that specific example could be totally retarded and I don't want it to detract from my overall argument... but anyway, I don't think the idea of interesting utility items for adcs has been played out enough. item builds in dota are not at all stale and if/when getting things like BKB or manta style, and then accordingly playing around how they afffect your playstyle, is pretty interesting. 		Again, i recognize that the greater the complexity the harder it is to balance, but things are kinda boring as they are now...

Is it so bad to have diversity in the ADC class?		Oh yeah, it is cool. Twitch is a Marksman/Assassin. The worry I present is if Brutalizer becomes an efficient Marksmen item then *all* Marksmen become "I kill squishies". Simply because of how strong that output is.		These types of identities tend to work better, though there's always pleasant exceptions, at character choice than they do at a systemic selection system level (items).		One of the way DotA accomplishes this (or... used to? I played DotA a lot primarily from like 2006 to 2009~2010ish - so before DotA2) is by more hidden synergy with stats without direct functionality. Int/Str/Agi lets you bind characters very directly. That comes with other trade offs though.		There's quite a few other notable differences. For example, in League we make finishing an item much more efficient than the base items. In large part, this is because it feels good to do so. So when you start seeing item choices occurring is AFTER some large items have been locked in. Basically, unless it's responding to very specific conditions, you don't get a lot of choice early in the game due to this effect. Making generalist power usually win out.		To me, this means we need to examine the specific cases when choices would be reasonable and then are still not made. Last Whisper for example is boggingly silly for Marksman as an assumed choice to me. There can totally be cooler effects or more interaction at that point in item builds.		The choice model of the two games are pretty different and each comes with advantages and disadvantages.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Reinboom","name":"t1_cugpgcg","parent_id":"t1_cugokcb","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440651303,"created_utc":1440622503}
{"body":"First of all, I speak as a top laner that plays AD bruisers like Renekton and Wukong. I love Brutalizer for its early power spike and laning dominance, so it's an item I try to buy as early as possible. The problem with Youmuu's Ghostblade is that the build path is awkward and the item has no identity because it gives **SIX** different stats: AD, Crit, CDR, ArPen, AS, MS, and it builds out of a GP10 item that has no business in just about anyone's inventory because it's a bad (useless) item for an aggressive laner. So mostly Youmuu's Ghostblade gets finished late-game to maintain slot efficiency, even though it's a mid-game item. Is it a caster item? Does it belong strictly on Twitch? 		So mostly I think the problem is the build path, because Youmuu's Ghostblade builds from two disparate items; Brutalizer gives a power spike and Avarice Blade is more of an anti-spike. If there was some more diversity in the advanced item genre we could find a solution, but I think Avarice Blade is the culprit because it doesn't have stats for a caster. It *should* make sense to build Avarice Blade first to accelerate towards Youmuu's Ghostblade (800 gold vs 1337), but then the tangible power spike of Brutalizer is delayed and it's not much of a power spike anymore, and the real spike happens when Youmuu's Ghostblade is finished. Statikk Shiv should be part of the conversation too, but Avarice Blade builds naturally into that item.		It would be cool if Youmuu's Ghostblade built from Brutalizer + Long sword + X Gold and gave +35-40 AD and lost the crit. Then at least it makes sense for a caster to build.
