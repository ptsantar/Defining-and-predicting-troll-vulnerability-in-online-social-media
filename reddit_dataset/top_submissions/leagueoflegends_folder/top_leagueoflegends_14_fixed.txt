Minion manipulation in general is pretty big in bot lane, although you could argue that it's less important than top (bot lane freezes can be very real if you have an engage support, though). I think that in mid-game, this becomes more important in the bot lane, where pushes away from baron can force a lose-lose situation for one of the teams. At that point, though, it's not necessarily the ADC and support that have to worry about setting up the push.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Third_Grammar_Reich","name":"t1_cuejkul","parent_id":"t1_cue1pto","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440492162,"created_utc":1440463362}

It's actually better because you can setup a freeze and if you killed Irelia, you're more than likely going to be able to deny her farm / kill her again. Also if Irelia TP's back, Fizz doesn't have time to shove and Irelia can setup a freeze.		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEX7JxeKCxg&t=5m18s		 * It is important to insist on the fact that grouping minions from the enemy wave make them come to lane in the shape of a "fist" while the friendly lane is a "line". The fist will focus the first minion in the line, while the line will spread its focus over the fist, hence why it pushes. The zone where you setup the freeze (1/2/3) merely matters.		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEX7JxeKCxg&t=5m30s		 * Do **not** do the "drag technique" unless you're extremely ahead of your opponent, have proper vision of their enemy jungle, or your lane opponent is not here. Otherwise you expose yourself too much.		 * There's another less known freeze technique where you keep the enemy minions close to their turret (by facetanking them) and then your minions hit the enemy minions under their turret.

That does not apply when your opponent does not have TP or when your team is ahead and can just group to force objectives. In that case, just shove. If nothing deals with the wave, it will bounce back to you directly if T1 is up, and after 1-2 min if T2 is up.		Of course those are details. As a person who's very into those details ([Example here of a micro analysis of a Riven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ceDWCpEky0&t=9m35s)), I think those matter the higher you climb!","depth":0,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yace987","name":"t1_cue1uk6","parent_id":"t3_3i6upi","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440464010,"created_utc":1440435210}

{"body":"Sorry for the block of text haha. 		Haha even if i am a "dyrone fanboy", I can see your point. But I think that you have to look at the bigger picture. Dyrus has been overwhelmingly put onto tanks in the last couple of seasons. And for tanks to actually do their job, they need items. The difference between a 2 item and a 3 item tank is huge. 		Now, you're a toplaner and you need to scale to be able to be the main tank for your damage dealers who you have chosen to put the majority of your resources into other lanes (read: Bjergsen). You know you probably dont have kill pressure in your lane because your jungler is most likely not going to gank. You dont have sufficient vision because there are too many routes to get ganked by for you to ward by yourself. Your support has to hold your adc's hand because him getting behind is far worse for your team than you getting behind. Your jungler sometimes sets up vision but its not a consistent thing. 		Now here's the decision. Do you stay back and get no farm while the clock ticks down to the inevitable team fights (due to riot's changes to dragon and baron) for which you need to be prepared with items? Or do you risk overstaying because its important that you stay relevant, because if you do not, there is a straight path between the other team and your backline. I will agree and say that Dyrus isn't a perfect laner. But he's stayed relevant for so long because he knows HOW to manage these limited resources. 		The game has changed no doubt, and one of the fundamental things that has is vision becoming very team oriented. If you watch a lot of TSM games you'll see lustboy and santorin heavily securing early vision around wildturtle and jungle entrances around mid and dragon. but very rarely around where dyrus is (although this has changed recently, as is dyrus getting roams and ganks). 		A good juxtaposition for vision and the toplane would be Zionspartan who consistently during the playoffs against TSM would push up without ANY vision. Many times this was a bait, because he had Xmithie and Aphro ready to come in through the lane. The thing with Dyrus is that when's he's alone, statistically he's alone. TSM couldn't consistently punish Zionspartan because the outcome is uncertain. For teams ganking dyrus, they are very sure that Santorin and Lustboy wont be there. I believe this is a team effort that TSM has only just been making gradual efforts to fix. 		In terms of TP plays, there are anecdotal highs and lows. You can just as easily quote Dyrus TPing perfectly into TL's jungle in the playoffs with a perfectly managed Gnar ragebar to 4 man ult their escape route. 		TL;DR: Decision making isnt about making the spectator-obvious BEST choice. It's about making the best choice with the information that you do have in game.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"duranta","name":"t1_cue9jj3","parent_id":"t1_cue6psf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440475702,"created_utc":1440446902}

{"body":"Easiest way to get out of silver without getting mechanically better, is decision making.  Things like my entire team is grouped mid but blue buff spawned,in a perfect world your team will wait for you to get blue then group and fight.  In actual world especially in lower elos people just run at the enemy after they type group and you must sacrifice blue buff to be around your team when they inevitably get engaged on.		Greed is another huge issue at all levels but especially in silver.  I notice that in silver players are skilled enough with their champs to pull off most combos and come away with kills, but they very often attempt to fight for no real reason, no objectives to take no positional advantage, they just fight for the hell of it.  Blowing summoners is worth it in itself a lot of times, I've seen so many players blow an enemy's flash (win) and then impulse flash and do nothing with it making the trade even at best.  Also, always look to punish the enemy team when they are outnumbered, don't chase half way across the map for a kill when you can easily group and take down a turret for far more team gold and less risk of getting ran into a trap.		Lastly, knowing what everyone is doing as best as you can will help a lot, know that often, especially in early game you can expect the enemy jungled to roughly mirror your jugglers position.  For example 7 mins in you are top side and your jungler is headed to blue, odds are the enemy jungler is headed to their red so maybe don't be super aggro bot lane.   		Final thought,  always assume your enemy is as good as you are.  If their play style shifts drastically from passive to aggressive, no they aren't suddenly brain dead, they have more information then you do and you will probably be ganked.  In silver it's fairly obvious once you learn how to read lanes when your going to be ganked, I can recall several times when I see the enemy walk towards me and I know I'm being ganked despite my lack of wards (becuz I'm bad)","depth":3,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KevinR91","name":"t1_cue880m","parent_id":"t1_cue6haq","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440473741,"created_utc":1440444941}

Therefore, things like freezing, fastpushing, and the likes are a lot easier to accomplish. Meanwhile in league, the way you utilize these same strategies is thinning out the wave slightly or pulling the wave before it hits yours so that it focuses one creep.

{"body":"I've played both Dota and League at a relatively high level and people have this false notion that one is harder than the other. Yes, there are certain mechanics in Dota that are more nuanced and complicated than League such as stacking camps in the jungle, shift queuing,  usage of smoke, FOW juking through trees, etc. but you can also say that league is more complicated in other aspects. For one, turret diving is much harder and juggling turret aggro is quite difficult. The fact that there is a lot more room for outplaying your opponent through dodging skillshots also stands out. Skillshots are limited in dota and in general are much easier to hit outside of pudge and potm. You can also make an argument for good placement of ES fissure and a few other skill shots, but for the most part skillshots in league can be dodged with good reflexes and/or predictions. This leads to a hugely complex mind game of where the enemy is going to shoot their skillshot, when they are gonna shoot it, etc. In reality, both games have difficult parts and easier parts.

[**Gameplay**](https://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/Minion#Gameplay) of article  [**Minion**](https://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Minion) (from Leagueoflegends wikia): [](#sfw) 		---	>	>The blue and red team minions start spawning at 1:30 and every 30 seconds afterward from the Nexus in order to support the champions. Every 90 seconds (4th wave) the minion waves will grow stronger, with every type of minion gaining different stats. Minions deal 50% increased damage to Turrets and deal about 40% reduced damage to enemy champions. An enemy turret's armor is reduced when minions are near.	>All minions have a Movement speed of 325. They always Spawn in 30 second intervals starting at 1 minute 30 second. All follow the same Behavior Set and walk in a line until they encounter a target. Spawn order is: Super Minions (if active), 3 Melee Minions, Siege Minions (intermittently, change to Super Minions if that lanes opposing  inhibitor is destroyed), 3 Caster Minions.	>Each type can be buffed. Detailed Buffs are noted below, but general buffs are listed within each sub-section.	The  Banner of Command grants the following to any minion promoted:	>* A permanent Black Shield which grants total immunity to magic damage.	* Tower Shield (reduced turret damage).	* All gold gained by the minion goes to the champion who promoted it.	>* Tower Shield (reduced turret damage).	>* All gold gained by the minion goes to the champion who promoted it.	>The  Hand of Baron grants the following to all minions near a champion with the Hand of Baron aura buff:	>* increase speed to match 90% of average movement speed of nearby champions, capped at 500 movement speed	* resistance to slow effects.	* Non-super minions have 75% damage reduction versus area of effect, damage over time, and persistent effects	>* resistance to slow effects.	>* Non-super minions have 75% damage reduction versus area of effect, damage over time, and persistent effects	>Minions and turrets will only deviate from their standard behavior to come to the aid of an ally under duress. Whenever any unit is under attack, it generates a ‘call for help’. Minions and turrets have slightly different reactions to a call for help.	>Under normal circumstances, a minion’s behavior is simple. Minions follow their attack route until they reach an enemy to engage. Every few seconds, they will scan the area around them for the highest priority target. When a minion receives a call for help from an ally, it will evaluate its current target in relation to the target designated by the call. It will switch its attack to the new target if and only if the new target is of a higher priority than their current target. Minions prioritize targets in the following order:	>*  An enemy champion designated by a call for help from an allied champion. (Enemy champion attacking an Allied champion)	*  An enemy minion designated by a call for help from an allied champion. (Enemy minion attacking an Allied champion)	*  An enemy minion designated by a call for help from an allied minion. (Enemy minion attacking an Allied minion)	*  An enemy turret designated by a call for help from an allied minion. (Enemy turret attacking an Allied minion)	*  An enemy champion designated by a call for help from an allied minion. (Enemy champion attacking an Allied minion)	*  The closest enemy minion.	*  The closest enemy champion.	>*  An enemy minion designated by a call for help from an allied champion. (Enemy minion attacking an Allied champion)	>*  An enemy minion designated by a call for help from an allied minion. (Enemy minion attacking an Allied minion)	>*  An enemy turret designated by a call for help from an allied minion. (Enemy turret attacking an Allied minion)	>*  An enemy champion designated by a call for help from an allied minion. (Enemy champion attacking an Allied minion)	>*  The closest enemy minion.	>*  The closest enemy champion.	>Minions will only reevaluate their target every few seconds. This means that if a champion initiates an attack against an enemy champion, the attacking champion will continue to be viewed as the most threatening target for a short time after they have broken off the attack. This is true even if one of their allied champions has joined the fight, since minions always prioritize their current target over a new target of equal priority. If a targeted champion leaves the minions' sight, the minions will automatically reevaluate their target and will carry on walking or attacking something else. Because they are continuously reevaluating their target, minions will lose interest in an enemy champion if that champion breaks off an engagement with them, provided that there is any other target left for them to choose within range.	>[**Image from section**](https://i.imgur.com/5kFMzAr.jpg) [^(i)](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141107214159/leagueoflegends/images/d/d6/Minions.jpg)	>[**Image from section**](https://i.imgur.com/rvzAkI8.jpg) [^(i)](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141107214159/leagueoflegends/images/d/d6/Minions.jpg)	>^Interesting: [^Caster ^minion](https://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Caster minion) ^| [^Siege ^minion](https://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Siege minion) ^| [^Melee ^minion](https://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Melee minion) ^| [^Super ^minion](https://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Super minion) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cuerfzl) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikiabot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cuerfzl)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikiabot/wiki/index) ^|  [^Source](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py)	 ^(Please note this bot is in testing.
