{"body":">**The crews had difficulty getting enough water to the building because of a lack of hydrants** and had to perform an "inline operation," in which six trucks were spaced out over a mile and connected by hoses to pipe water,		In all honesty this really isn't a huge big deal. In today's economy where we prefer to put money into tax breaks for businesses or certain groups versus improving actual municipal infrastructure it's becoming a norm. I've been doing the firefighting medic gig for several decades now, and to see actual waterline and hydrant go into ground is almost never seen. Some areas around me still have terra-cotta sewage lines that may or may not be lined by poly sleeves.		It's getting harder and harder for many departments in cities around the US to say X or Y has perfectly working hydrants. We've been cut back and water departments have been cut back to the point that you might not know until you try, and then your left with trying to find ample supply. Not saying that's the case here, but I've spent many nights looking for water when something was burning.  		Edit: sorry if this came out a bit misunderstood, but it was way too early and me entirely too tired for me to even realize what was ranting out. The " no big deal " was meant in jest... Sort of a city planners sarcastic remark towards news outlets when we have to do the same thing. I should've used /S, but oh well.		As for the tax breaks and other mentioned stuff... It's just crap we've dealt with for ages. A frail dying system built of fragile asbestos water pipes that are so delicate, and serious pressure changes or weight imbalance would cause blowouts. Business come in, and instead of actually making improvements to their properties they skate by on the bare minimum allowed by a somewhat corrupt pipeline of elected officials.

Water mains installed in the 1800s, many of the hydrants in the early 1900s. We still do a good job, but it could be a lot better.		It's hard to convince people that yes, we do need to raise taxes or issue a bond so we can start replacing some of our aging infrastructure, especially that which isn't seen. I've heard plenty of people say something similar to, "I've got plenty of water pressure from my faucet and shower head. Why do we need to replace the water lines?" We need to because the couple of gallons a minute you use is literally a drop in the bucket compared to the sometimes hundreds of gallons of water a minute we may need when your neighbor's house is on fire and we're trying to save yours.

A service like the fire department is nothing more than an insurance policy.

{"body":"Wow... That's crazy. There were no thrust blocks in use behind the flange of equal proportion to system pressures? We had a similar incident back in November where a new businesses contractor was doing an insta tap into an 24" asbestos line. Whoever was doing the tap apparently didn't realize 24" asbestos lines are not always "truly round or even 24" ". They popped through the bottom of the line or at least weakened it enough that after they poured their blocks and dumped in several yards of 610, the bottom blew out and caused a sinkhole. 		It swallowed up two trench boxes, about 100 yards of feeder road, several yards of state highway and a D3. When we arrived on scene, we blocked off the road access and watched the ass end of the D3 seep into the murky mess. It took two out of state contractors to repair the mess, and no one wanted to take blame. All the contractors were like "well we had a water department guy on site, he could have told us to stop".","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OMGWTF-BOB","name":"t1_cpmepdb","parent_id":"t1_cpmdc2p","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426981151,"created_utc":1426977551}

Pretty much every 6" or 8" GV in my district we've had to dig out of the asphalt too. It was so bad at one point that if a hydrant broke open we placed a diverter on it and waited until someone could come metal detect the valve housing (sometimes for days or even a week). That's 6/8" pouring full force 24 hours a day.

This is a joke about the privatisation of phone and utility services (beginning under Thatcher?) which resulted in a proliferation of long numbers replacing easy to remember ones. For example, we used to call 100 to speak to the operator if we didn't know a number and a helpful lady would help us, (in the 90s?) this service was privatised so now dozens of companies can try to rip us off in novel ways and no one can remember what to dial for which service or how much it'll cost. (price is roughly proportional to how easy the number is to remember, they all begin 118 i think).
