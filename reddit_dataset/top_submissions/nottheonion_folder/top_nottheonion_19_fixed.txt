What is insane is that, from what I understand, even most republican voting people would benefit from the existence of Obamacare.  A popular argument is that business owners would have to pay more for health insurance packages for their employees resulting in less money to pay employees, thus hurting growth.  But employees would have alternate solutions then as well... And there is nothing obligating business owners to hire more people or pay people more if the business owners get their way.  		Obamacare isn't perfect.  Medication costs will/would still remain super expensive.

{"body":"As a Floridian with connections and friends in the environmental agencies of Florida, I can tell you this: After decades of republican rule in Tallahassee (that has only gotten more and more extreme, beginning with Jeb Bush and ending with Rick Scott) many good people have simply left these agencies.  They have been replaced over decades with more developer-friendly, business-friendly types -- *particularly at the top* of these agencies.		Because an anti-environmental boss at the top of an environmental protection agency works to drive out even more of the good employees.		I don't know the administrator of this program Ann Lazar, but the fact that she is upset that an employee used the phrase "climate change" in a coastal management conference, leads me to speculate about what happened here.		The employee was new, and claims he was not aware of the ban on the use of the phrase. 		Did he get pissed off about an environmental meeting on science and planning for coastal Florida where scientists and land mangers aren't allowed to talk about climate change?  (Basically, talking about this is what your job should be about).		It looks like it.  And this is exactly how we've watched good people get drummed out of Florida's environmental agencies since the Bush days. Fired, demoted, harassed, downgraded, or quit in frustration.		It's not like this came out of the blue, it's been going on for a while.							EDIT: You can read about more people who have been reprimanded, fired or quit for similar reasons here:		http://fcir.org/2015/03/08/in-florida-officials-ban-term-climate-change/		As someone familiar with these agencies over the years, I'd say he's the tip of the iceberg.","depth":6,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"flantabulous","name":"t1_cpl414l","parent_id":"t1_cpl0x9d","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426871610,"created_utc":1426868010}

[Retaliation: Public Employees and First Amendment Rights](http://www.workplacefairness.org/retaliationpublic)	> The first thing to know about the First Amendment is that it is a limit only on government. It prohibits the federal government from making laws that infringe on the rights of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition. Through the Fourteenth Amendment, state and local governments are also prohibited from infringing on these rights. Yet, one of the most powerful restraints on individual freedom is the power of employers to discharge workers. If your employer is a private entity, the First Amendment offers you no protection from being fired on account of what you say. (You may still have protection from other sources described below, or in the one state that abolished employment-at-will, Montana).	> 	> Public employees, on the other hand, work for the government. So, public employees do have protection from retaliation for exercising certain First Amendment rights. Courts have been cautious in this area, limiting the protection to speech that is on matters of "public concern." The Supreme Court is not yet ready to say that public employees are protected from retaliation for any First Amendment activity. Thus, while the government could not put someone in jail for complaining about a meager raise, the government might still be able to fire a public employee for this reason, unless the complaint was a matter of "public concern."","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jabbaciv","name":"t1_cpl6dda","parent_id":"t1_cpl294x","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426875350,"created_utc":1426871750}

{"body":""I want to kill you" could be restricted as "fighting words."			>In 1942, the U.S. Supreme Court established the doctrine by a 9???0 decision in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire. It held that "insulting or 'fighting words,' those that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace" are among the "well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech the prevention and punishment of [which] ??? have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem."			Employers typically have pretty broad discretion to limit speech as the Bill of Rights is specifically intended to protect citizens against an oppressive government. This is obviously an exception as here the employer *is* the government.  This is what I found in the vein of "government as employer:"			>The government is not permitted to fire an employee based on the employee's speech if either the speech is on a matter of public concern, the speech is not said as part of that employee's job duties, or the damage caused by the speech is not outweighed by the value of the speech to the employee and public. Specifically, speech is "treated as a matter of public concern" by reference to the "content, form, and context of a given statement". The exception with regards to balancing the harm of a statement and the value of the statement (the Pickering test) is done by considering the degree to which the speech either interferes with close working relationships, disrupts the office, or even has the potential to do either.				My thoughts on the matter are the gentlemen could/should mount a legal challenge to the discipline he was subject to because it would seem as though it is a decently novel issue.  Also - there is probably a distinct possibility that was his intention all along.  A lot of court precedent registering government's power is the result of someone intentionally thumbing their nose at something and setting up a situation they'd be able to challenge (e.g. *Plessy v. Freguson* where the actual train conductors didn't like the rule regulating race on trains and agreed to kick off Homor Plessy who was 1/8 black.)				This is where I'll leave it for now. I'm a JD but not as familiar with such a specific scenario of First Amendment case law - perhaps someone will come along and add to it.				As a side note: Wikipedia is a **very** good source for constitution defining case law.

Now let's say 48% of people prefer A, and 52% of people prefer B if those were the only people you could vote for. However 6% of people actually prefer C over B over A.

However if these people vote for C, now A wins the election 48-46-6, even though 52% of people would have preferred the outcome of B winning over A.		Independent candidates only win in rare situations on smaller voting scales, when one or both parties lack a passable candidate.

{"body":"A vote for a third party is a vote for the lead candidate you least agree with. This is a nearly universally accepted fact of political science. Did you even bother reading the paper? It's not even a full 4 pages. 		Using your own example; if the leading candidates are tied and it all comes down to your vote there are 4 possible outcomes		Firstly, you can abstain from voting and there's a runoff. Secondly, you can vote third part and there's a runoff, your vote did nothing. Thirdly, you can vote Scott and he wins. Fourthly, you can vote Crist and he wins. So in the case where both candidates are going to tie, your vote for third party is useless.		Now consider the scenario where Scott is favored over Crist before the independent is considered, and you also favor Crist over Scott if they were the only 2 choices. Now a vote for independent is still wasted, because Scott would win over both Crist and the independent.		Now consider the final scenario, Crist is favored over Scott before you factor in any other candidates, and you also favor Crist over Scott if they were the only two options. Now a vote for third party splits voters between Crist and the independent, strengthening Scott's position. Scott isn't literally getting more votes, but you did increase his marginal position, which is the exact same outcome as voting for him.		So at best a vote for a third party dark horse counts for nothing, at worst it actually helps the candidate you least want to win. Your vote for the third party candidate isn't literally counted towards Scott, but it has the exact same effect on the outcome as a direct vote for him, which is why people say voting for third party is just giving your vote to the candidate you hate the most. **This is a widely known and accepted consequence of our political system**, even if it doesn't "feel" right intuitively.			If you don't want this to be the case then you can always help advocate for election reform, but in the current electoral system a vote for anyone other than the two leading candidates is a wasted vote.

They were 46th in terms of number of faculty, 45th in average teacher salary, 46th in revenue per student, 44th in per capita spending (at 78% the national average), and 40th in terms of graduation rate (at  71%, vs the national average of about 80%).

To me, a bipartisan system (which FPTP inevitably leads to) is simply ludicrous.

{"body":"Why do people make drastic assumptions about sea rise and climate change? Do you base your assumptions on science, or on Kevin Costner flops? 		The EPA published information showing predictions for sea level rise for the next 100 years. Because there are so many variables they give a chart that shows both extremes, the worst possible sea rise VS the most benign. 		At most they are talking about 72 inches of sea level rise by the year 2100. That is less than 2 meters, more like 1.5 meters. 		So heading over to geology.com and using their handy dandy Florida-meter we plug in 2 meters because we want to be pessimistic and then it shows a map of what the state would look like with a 2m sea level rise. 			It looks almost exactly the same.........The only changes are in the everglades, a vast swamp that is already under water. In fact the Bahamas have more to fear from sea rise than Florida and even they won't really be impacted by the darkest forecasts and worst case scenario. 		Here's my proof [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/c672Bew.png)			Speaking of which, do any of you think the coast lines of the world stay the same? The change in the planets carbon footprint has natural components, and human caused components and of the human caused, the industrial revolution and industry of the last 120 years is where the majority of those carbon emissions took place. Yes the seas have risen since then, inches.....And the sea level was changing long before the industrial revolution. 		Did you know that Jamestown, one of the first permanent settlements in North America is underwater now? That what used to be inland 200 years ago in North Carolina, Florida, even the west coast, is now ocean front property? 		It's called weathering, erosion, and tides. Even if the ocean level didn't budge for the rest of human history, coastlines would still be eroded, beaches would still be under water, and the world around you would still change. 		It's not like Jamestown was above water, then the flood gates opened and the people were driven out in some huge catastrophe. The change took place over hundreds and hundreds of years. Nobody was displaced, as the ocean slowly creeps forward or backwards over the centuries, houses, dwellings, piers, and docks also slowly creep out and back. It happens so slowly most people don't even notice it in their lifetimes. 		Its been happening for the whole of human history but we didn't have photographs to directly compare the past with the present so nobody noticed. 		The only thing worse than climate change (which is going to happen, the climate is NOT static, never was, never will be) is alarmists trying to scare the crap out of people in order to manipulate them.

{"body":"The waterline has already changed and been changing is my argument back. The most pessimistic outlooks are still talking about small changes over decades. 2100 is 85 years from now. How many houses in your town are 85 years old? People are constantly tearing down and rebuilding, cities evolve, population density changes.  		And yes, I used a strawman argument right back, that's why they all it debating. :) But I actually based that argument on a couple of the comments people posted about their governor being in denial that his state was going to be ruined by climate change, and others talking about it being under water. Some would say strawman, others might call it summarizing or paraphrasing. 		I'm not from Florida and I kind of hate the state and it's governor. I'm trying to keep my argument non-political because I think any argument about science or facts should not involve politics. There is the truth, and there are lies, and it shouldn't matter how the truth affects your political position if your goal is to learn the truth. And once the facts are found we can either try to fix the problem, ignore it, or try to fix it based on feelings instead of logic. 		Climate change is very real, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's dangerous to exxagerate the impact because if someone is told "The world is going to be ruined, cities will be under water, there won't be enough food, it could end civilization" and then they find out that isn't the case, they are likely to dismiss the entire argument of climate change. 		It's real, it's slow, it won't have nearly the impact on your life that manipulative people and organizations would have you believe, and it is still incredibly important to understand it, try to mitigate the impact it will have, and change the way we use the resources we have. 		It's like someone being told smoking 1 pack of cigarettes will make their lungs black and give them cancer and take a year of their life away. That person then smokes 50 packs, figures out they didn't take 50 years of their life away or they'd be dead by now, gets good medical checkups, and then falsely concludes everthing they were told about cigarettes was a lie and that you can't get cancer. 		You have to be honest with people, give them the facts, let them make their own conclusions. Manipulation is a double edged sword that cuts both ways. And crying wolf can kill the sheppard.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kodack10","name":"t1_cpl94th","parent_id":"t1_cpl8h7j","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426879742,"created_utc":1426876142}
{"body":"You make some good points, particularly about climate change being a slow process, which is why so many scientists are frustrated by the lack of action.		To use your smoking analogy - which is a good one - what if people had believed the scientists who said smoking caused cancer 20 years earlier?  How many lives would have been saved?  How much money would have been saved in medical bills?		Instead, we had to wait until there was simply no denying the link between the two, long after a great deal of avoidable damage had been done.  The same is true here, 20 or even 30 years ago we were being warned that our activities were affecting the climate.  To your point - yes - worst case scenarios were used, and had the effect of polarizing public opinion between those who agreed, and those who only read the 'Sky is Falling' headlines and said "I don't believe it."		People making public policy - like Rick Scott - need to read beyond the headlines and understand the real issue.  But as a politician, he has chosen to pander to his uninformed base, thus making us wait to do anything about it until the damage is done.  We were told we had a chance to lessen the impact, but that opportunity is now largely gone.  All we can do now is make plans to mitigate the effects that are coming, such as by discussing it in Coastal Management Forums like Mr. Bibler was attempting to do.  Instead he was reprimanded for it.		I have yet to hear from anyone a legitimate ulterior motive for claiming we need to act on the effects of climate change.  What do they think scientists are hoping to gain by telling us we need to act?  One phrase you'll never hear is 'Fat Cat Scientist.'  The same can't be said about politicians and lobbyists.

{"body":"I know I'm probably not the only one to think this, but if there is any issue that has the potential to lead the world into war it is climate change. Especially if the U.S. doesn't take a leadership role on sequestration and reductions. If the rest of the world is evolving on this issue and actively taking drastic measures while one of the worlds most culpable nations stalls, denies, and continues with business nearly as usual, soon enough the rest of the world is going to have a big damn problem on their hands. 		The good vs. evil line in this kind of fight probably hasn't been more stark since World War II and the stakes are way higher. Most people don't realize that some of the worst case scenarios are only projected out to 2100. After that things are going to get much worse. Most of the planet's land surface will be uninhabitable and some think the place may go full on Venus.		The most worrying aspect of the issue for me is that there has been an enormous amount of effort that has been spent on studying how the atmosphere and the oceans may react to the increased heat, but almost no effort has been expended on looking at how the crust is going to respond. Granted, the crust is most likely to be the slowest to react but there will be increased heat conduction coming from the ocean and atmosphere.		If the crust shatters in new and unpredictable ways due to thermal expansion via heat conduction coming from the atmosphere and oceans then we may wind up with a volcanic event similar to what happened during the Permian Mass Extinction. This killed 95% of all species of life on Earth. It was a volcanic event that lasted a million years and it clouded much of the planets' surface in Nuclear Winter like conditions. 		We are a clever and ingenious species, but I dont' know how civilization would survive such an event that lasted for a million years. Not only that, but given the unprecedented nature of what is underway in terms of speed, we may see something much worse.		Even if we stopped emitting all Greenhouse gases today and began a global sequestration program that had a real impact, the ocean will continue to trap most of the increased heat for a long time and it's not just going to be going back up into the atmosphere. It will emit heat across it's entire mass and some of it will be absorbed by the crust. It is highly unlikely that the crust won't experience thermal expansion in some capacity. 		The lack of effort expended on studying this seems negligent, myopic, and is highly illustrative of the lack of systemic thinking on the issue. Although it is likely that a major contributing factor to this may be the traditionally close ties those in the field of Geology have had with the Fossil Fuel Industry professionally and across academia.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AllenIll","name":"t1_cpl9nl2","parent_id":"t3_2zop33","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426880566,"created_utc":1426876966}

{"body":"I didn't say it was evidence - I said it was a rebuttal.  It offers an explanation to the charges made in the reprimand - specifically (to paraphrase a different post):		He claims he used the meeting organizers agenda document as a template for creating his notes - makes sense to me - who wouldn't start with a document that already contains most of what they need?		He says he inadvertently left the word 'Agenda' in the header - again - plausible.  At least - it's as plausible as the reprimand's contention that he was trying to forge a copy of the agenda to secretly insert climate change.  They asked him to take that word out - and he did - replacing it with 'Meeting Summary (partial)" and left the rest of the summary intact. He says the summary did not include any mention of Keystone - only that climate change and sea level rise were discussed.  Since we don't have access to this version of the summary - it's his word against theirs.		He also included in the attachments to the email an image of the word 'Keystone' with a red circle and slash through it. It was not in the document itself - as is implied in the reprimand, but rather it was just an image included with the attachments.  To me that sounds more like he was using it as an emoticon than anything else, but again - it's his version of events.		He was then told that the image was inappropriate, and told to provide ANOTHER summary - devoid of any hot button issues, which could only be construed to mean 'climate change'.		He says he refused to provide such a document for use as a public record of the meeting since it would have been inaccurate. That is when they reprimanded him.		I'm not saying it's the undeniable truth, but it is a plausible explanation for everything they're accusing him of.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PixelSchnitzel","name":"t1_cplmkxd","parent_id":"t1_cplg1vk","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426904534,"created_utc":1426900934}

{"body":"This is not remotely believable.  It's not even a good tabloid quality lie.  I will believe Gov Scott wants to notch down the global warming hysteria. It is also indisputable that just as Pres Obama sets the agenda for the federal executive branch Scott is legally allowed, to a certain degree required, to set it for state employees.		BUT! There is no way in bloody hell a guy was sent for mental health evaluation for saying climate change. That is intentionally misleading. Perhaps he was sent for evaluation, but NOT because of that.  More likely he is batshit crazy and this ruse is just his latest psychotic breakdown.		Articles like this are a giant waste of everyone's time.
