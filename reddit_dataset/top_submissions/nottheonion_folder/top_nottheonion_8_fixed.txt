{"body":"The same way EVERY OTHER department does? Lol.		Solicitation charges aren't exactly something new.. cops make them all the time without banging the poor girls.			Edit: This was taken from a criminal law page about prostitution.		Common Myths about Prostitution Convictions	Myth: It???s only prostitution if you make it clear that you are trading money for sex.		Fact: Juries are allowed to consider the ???totality of the circumstances??? and draw whatever conclusions seem reasonable to them, so it doesn???t matter whether or not money is ever mentioned. If you post sexually suggestive photos and hourly rates on your website, then meet with a client who contacted you through your site, the jury will probably assume that you were charging for sex as well as companionship.		Myth: You are not guilty of prostitution if the client doesn???t actually hand you the money, or if he tells you it is only a gift.		Fact: Juries often conclude that an offer or agreement to have sex for money was implied by your words or actions. So if the prosecution can prove that the client contacted you looking for sex, that you agreed to meet with him, and that he brought money to the meeting, you will probably be convicted even if there???s no evidence that he actually gave you the money.		Myth: If you get suspicious that a client may be an undercover officer, you can avoid a prostitution conviction by telling him you changed your mind and don???t want to have sex anymore (or that he doesn???t have to pay for it).		Fact: As long as the prosecution can convince a jury that you agreed to trade sex for money, you are guilty of prostitution even if you later withdraw your offer. Providers in Minnesota who have tried to appeal prostitution convictions on this basis have not succeeded.		source: http://aacriminallaw.com/prostitution/common-prostitution-myths/","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"buschdogg","name":"t1_cnsz43t","parent_id":"t1_cnsx6vr","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421606330,"created_utc":1421606330}

It's like if you have a problem with people selling knock-off shower curtains that contain mercury on them, causing people to become ill. But short of testing every single shower curtain, there's no real way to tell, and the suppliers keep changing. Now if you just pass a law that says "No shower curtains" it's way easier to take the bad ones off the market. And eventually their usage will decrease to a small point, which means the amount of people poisoned by them will become negligible.		Of course, it's a silly analogy, and prostitution is far more complicated than shower curtains, which is all the more reason it'd be more difficult to find out where the abuse is exactly. And the regulations needed to make sure it were safe would almost defeat the purpose of a business... You'd need to inject oversight into a business that inherently relies on privacy and discretion.

{"body":"I mean, I've heard that there's some evidence that in countries/districts with legalized prostitution there's a higher incentive for human trafficking. Even if it becomes legal, prostitution will still be seen as an underworld industry, and so it will still be dominated by shady people looking to make the biggest profit possible. To do this, they'd still want to use sex slaves or people hooked on drugs that they supply in exchange for their compliance. Yeah, there'd be regulatory agencies but they'd avoid them like those guys who sell TVs that fell off the back of a truck, and people might ask less questions because they'd assume that because prostitution is legal this operation must be legal. 		Anyway, this is just an argument I've heard; I agree that that might be an unintended consequence, but one of the ways human traffickers stay in business now is by instilling fear in the people they own/abuse/extort is by hanging the illegality of the ACT of prostitution over their heads. If people were free from the fear of being prosecuted for prostitution they might come forward more easily if they are under the thumb of a shady pimp. I honestly think that prostitution should be legal from a moral standpoint; how is it the government's place to say that a person can't trade sex for money? When done right, it's a simple way to become self-sufficient, and in an industry dominated by poor women without higher education, it could be a life-changing opportunity. And with the government's involvement, regulatory agencies could provide much-needed assistance in preventative healthcare for sex workers, and perhaps help out those who want to move on from the profession by training them in other, more mainstream industries. 		But the thing is, while there's this utopian idea that all legalized sex work is inherently empowering, how many people enter into prostitution without some "unfair" pressures? I know for a fact there are sex workers who love their job and feel entirely free to turn down clients, but is this also true for an impoverished person? Is it fair to ask a person who cannot otherwise put food on the table to have sex for money? Is it fair to allow this? I'm honestly unsure. I mean, people scrub McDonald's toilets for $7.25/hr; that's difficult work at an astonishingly low pay. Is having sex to escape destitution any different? The thing is though that prostitution already happens, legal or not, and always will happen. In any case, it IS safer for it to be legalized and regulated, if only to protect sex workers themselves. But what lawmaker is gonna be the guy to propose THAT bill? What judge will make that ruling? In America, none.

{"body":"Well, I'd say contemporary, mainstream feminists are definitely supporters of abolishing laws that punish sex workers for practicing prostitution. And there's certainly been a push in recent years to elevate the voices of truly "free" sex workers who run their own business and operate within the sex industry on their own terms. But early US feminists worked to abolish prostitution mainly because it's an industry that has historically exploited women, not necessarily because it was  "icky" or "slutty." 		For similar reasons, first wave American feminists led the prohibition movement in America. For them, it was significantly about taking away the dangers of "drunkard husbands" who would come home from the pub and beat/rape their wives or go on benders, die in an alleyway and then leave the family without a breadwinner. And because women couldn't really acquire gainful, family-sustaining employment around the turn of the 20th century, the dearth of husbands who were lost to alcoholism led many families into destitution.		In general, if mainstream feminism is against it, it's almost certainly because on the whole it hurts women. First and second wave feminists were definitely against prostitution because they felt it ultimately could only be explosive, but third wave (current) mainstream feminists see it as acceptable when done under truly egalitarian circumstances. The differences between feminist waves, in this case, are in semantics/nuance. Basically the point of this comment is that while feminist movements in America are similar in goals, they are very different in execution and should be remembered as such.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thirdfavoriteword","name":"t1_cnt1uf5","parent_id":"t1_cnsteo7","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421611543,"created_utc":1421611543}

And 2) the problem of young, white, college-educated Americans piping up in conversations about sex work - and people from Belle Knox to the women of r/sexworkers have this blind spot - is they fail to recognize that the vast majority of the women who participate in prostitution are not white, are marginalized, and are often being coerced, or using it is their only possible method to feed their families, or are using it to fuel a drug habit. 		And to say "the vast majority of prostitutes go into the business willingly!  My friend Becky using it to pay for harp lessons and fund her student film!"  Please cut the shit.

A long time ago, the Miami Police Chief (Chief Quigg) and several officers beat and shot a black bellboy to death for disrespecting them. Chief Quigg went on trial and was cleared. The officers were acquitted, also.			I've personally heard several horror stories from a friend of mine who's a federal agent in Miami concerning police corruption. He says some of the things that go on are unreal. For example, a few cops are in cahoots with the Cuban Mob, and they're often know to harass blacks if they try to move into the better neighborhoods where some Cubans reside. For example, they'll beat their relatives, blackmail the potential homebuyers with arresting their relatives who happen to be on parole or have criminal backgrounds. 		You'll say I'm lying or whatever, it's fine. But, out of all the links is just provided of incidents that happened within *the past year* so it can't be too hard to believe.. Look up the shit that happened in 2012-2013. 		Plus, I've seen them do some pretty shady things, too. About 10 years ago I saw some throw a guy off of a drawbridge for not "moving fast enough"  and because he was "talking shit". They saw me and my friend standing there and called us over. But we just took off and hauled ass into an adjacent neighborhood. I didn't leave the house for like a week. Every time cops drove by for about 2-3 months after, I would have panic attacks. 		Edit: and just to clarify, the cops didn't kill the guy they threw off the bridge. He was basically a neighborhood rock head. We saw him a month later or so selling socks & t-shirts at the corner store. We asked him about what happened and he said he just swam up to the shore and the cops cursed him out and let him go.","depth":2,"score":60,"ups":60,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cnsl05w","parent_id":"t1_cnsj47y","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421559032,"created_utc":1421559032}

It sounds like you are really just looking for people to agree with you. I am looking to change the world, even if it's just one opinion at a time.

The whole website claims to care about people equally, no matter what their circumstances are, but clearly if your an officer, reddit wants to know the bad things about you much more than if you were any other kind of person. I'm fighting the hypocrisy. Because Reddit can sit here and say that it's about protecting people, but the upvotes tell a very different story, it's really "if you're a cop, what's the dirt on you".

One of my conclusions is that we're spending more time looking at cops than regular people and that it's distorting the reality of how many officers might be "bad eggs". If you spend all your time looking for the bad, you're going to find it.
