{"body":"Try not to think of it in terms of what you can do right now with faster internet. Think of it in terms of what you might be able to do in the future with it. As people continue move away from cable TV and toward online streaming, the speed of your internet becomes a major factor in whether or not you're going to jump ship. Sure you could drop DirecTV for Hulu & Netflix, but why would you if your internet isn't fast enough to handle the streaming? Keeping the internet slow is a huge advantage for companies like AT&T and Comcast who provide both internet and cable TV, because it encourages their customers to keep paying for their cable. 		Also, as we become more technologically advanced, more and more of the products that we buy are starting to have internet capabilities. Weight scales, thermostats, televisions, stereo systems, lamps, watches, security systems, picture frames, all these things can now be bought with wifi capabilities. But if your internet is super slow, there's no way to use them, so they're worthless to you as a consumer. 		Right now, a lot of this stuff would still fall into the "luxury" category. But who's to say it'll all stay there? I mean, when cell phones first came out (hell, even car phones), they were definitely a luxury. The only people who had one were the few businessmen/women who needed them for work. Fast forward a few years and they're pretty much a necessity. There's no reason to think the same thing won't happen with internet speed. And as those wifi-capable products become more common, the ones that don't need wifi to function will eventually stop being available. Right now you have the ability to live comfortably without a fast internet speed. But in a few decades, you very well might not have that option any more.		As an ISP, keeping the internet slow is like building a fence around your customers so they can never escape your grasp.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"general_0408","name":"t1_cml3dgu","parent_id":"t1_cmkwxpx","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1417714393,"created_utc":1417714393}

{"body":"There are none today that are meaningful, other than streaming very high quality video. It's premised on the same notion as moving from dial-up to broadband. If you were still on dial-up, you couldn't even use mediocre quality YouTube streams. You'd suffer through downloading ten small mp3 songs, and so on.		The US has the best business Internet in the world, enabling the giants like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. to build what they have. Everyone understands the value proposition there, why faster speeds are important in terms of moving immense amounts of data and why business networks need to be fast. I can get a 1gbps pipe with 1tb of bandwidth from Digital Ocean for $5 / month. So why isn't it so well accepted that consumers need dramatically faster speeds? Practical utility has been limited thus far (there is little practical use for 1gbps for a consumer); I think that's about to change, and with it the consumer end demand for dramatically faster speeds.		1gbps will be necessary, as an example, to enable what's coming down the pipe with virtual reality. It's going to be massive, the data requirements on both bandwidth and storage will be so large, VR alone in ~15 years will require more storage and bandwidth than all of the Internet combined does today. Think that's impossible? Netflix went from consuming almost zero of the Internet's bandwidth, to a sizable portion, in a very short amount of time. And if you don't think VR will have huge demands, you aren't thinking big enough when it comes the scale of the worlds and their quality. People won't store 10tb world files on their local system (with millions of VR worlds that big, from VR casinos, to VR stadiums, to VR parks, you name it), they'll stream them out of the cloud.		We're going to need 100 times more bandwidth, and 100 times more storage, just for VR in 10 to 15 years.		That's one blatant example.		Another is moving more of the guts out of the PC, and into the cloud. For example, shifting gaming purely to the cloud, such that you never download another game, and have lower system requirements natively.

Travel, relaxation, sex / porn, gaming, education, exploration, drawing / art / design / architecture, therapy, companionship / dating / chat, gambling, psychedelic, music / partying, hiking, roller coasters, skydiving, driving cars, flying planes, alternate reality (superheroes, fantasy, vampire worlds, anything you can think of).		Instead of playing poker on your phone, you'll pop on VR goggles, and be transported into the nicest casino you've ever seen. You'll move about the casino, rent a room, play at the tables, converse with other people, buy random things in the world (outfits) - we're talking total immersion.		Then apply such a concept to a grand theft auto world or the sims. Imagine how stupid vast The Sims VR could be, endless terabytes connected in one giant MMO. Capable of housing a billion players. That's one game, and I think if you tried to build that in scale and the quality it should have, it'd bring down the entire Internet today.		How about people walking about the world help 3D capture every store, with constant updated data. So you don't have to leave your couch to walk around the store and see what they're offering, in high quality VR. Or you can walk into the store, sit down, be talking to your friend across from you, wearing augmented reality glasses, and virtually get up from where you're sitting and walk across the room in the VR version of the store and look at the items in the bakery, while never leaving where you're sitting (the store could have a few cheap VR cameras that constantly update sections of the store, such as the bakery, basically in real-time; such cameras will come down in price so they're $50 or $80). Now apply this to the entire world - you need more storage than exists on earth today for this.		One of the greatest human limitations is the speed at which we can travel from point A to point B, and the cost of doing so (not to mention safety, health, etc). If we map the entire planet in VR, the total number of experiences a person can have in a lifetime, will increase exponentially. It's not realistic to enable everyone to travel to all parts of the world in one lifetime, but with VR we can do exactly that; and once the quality hits a high enough level - and it will - it'll feel damn near real.		In 20 years a poor kid in a slum somewhere - who otherwise might never have access to such experiences - will be able to pop on cheap VR goggles, and explore the Vatican museum or Louvre in hyper detail and quality. It's such a simple example, but you can apply it to almost unlimited other examples. Experiences change who we are, and good / positive experiences change us for the better. Something like this can dramatically boost the quality of life of the poorest, light a spark of imagination and curiosity. Think: access to a public library multiplied by a million fold, any culture, any place, any thing.		Sports players will wear micro dots on their bodies, that will map in real time to almost perfect VR representations, that will be imposed into a VR creation of the stadium they play in. So you can be at the game, watching the players move in real-time, with representations of such high quality you can't tell the difference. And perhaps they'll figure out how to display the real-time image onto a model in the VR world (I see that as being damn hard, but).

This sounds too advanced and unnecessary for students since "they should be doing it the traditional way using hands and print outs", but giving students access to automation gave then a lot of advantages.

Each piece takes 4 minutes, while a laser cutter can do each piece in 45 seconds. You save yourself roughly 80% of the time. Now, instead of spending the majority of your time on cutting and gluing, you can spend it on conceptualising. 		Faculty know this. They know that students are able to build faster because of the tech, which means they can give them more difficult projects to work on, thus giving them a more robust education. 		Having VR in education means students can worry more about concept and theory and less on actual model.

{"body":"Yes, obviously the upward trend in computing power is infinite, there can't possibly be an upper limit.  I'll just plan to go to Alpha Centuri next year with my replicator so I can trade with the Ferengi.		Seriously, though, if you think this is really happening I don't want to dissuade you.  It's important to have dreams.  If you are going to dream, though, maybe dream a little about how to make it happen?		Here is the fundamental issue with virtual reality, IMHO:		VR isn't easily searchable.  Lets ignore the marketing issues that causes for the moment and focus on the user.  Bad search means it is hard to find things you are interested in when in virtual reality, which is a huge obstacle to VR being compelling for users.  VR in and of itself will only keep people around for a little while before they get bored and wander back to the 2D internet.  Lets say you decide to make interesting things, since you can't find interesting things.  The friends you tell about your interesting things might like it but drawing people outside your personal social group is extremely difficult.  Even the best developers in virtual worlds find it hard to find an audience.		Currently virtual worlds use keywords for their search engines, and the keywords are set up by the owner of the region, which makes keyword stuffing and badly chosen keywords a problem (which is what killed the use of the meta tag in HTML).		One fix might be to catalog all the objects in an area.  This is processing intensive, but if you believe in infinite computing power then why not?  The problem is, this doesn't do a very good job of describing the area.  Look at the room you are in right now.  Think about all the objects and how a computer would interpret them.  I have a VCR in the room I'm in right now, so would everybody searching for a VCR end up here?  This room is not about VCRs at all, it's about being a bedroom.  Think about a dance club.  How do objects in a club, in and of themselves, differentiate a gay dance club from a rave?  How about an Irish pub from a Russian bar?  How do you differentiate the oval office from the office of a judge or a banker?  When you get right down to it, you have to be pretty specific about how you describe the objects in a club to differentiate a dance club from an Irish pub.  They both have lights, they both have a bar and stools and maybe a stage and speakers and alcohol.  How can a spider describe objects with such specificity?  To render an area the computer just knows this object is here, and it has these properties, this mesh and this texture.  How do you turn that information into meaningful information people can search with?		Maybe the solution is to analyze the text chat in an area.  This would be less processor intensive than the previous option.  Aside from people freaking out about the privacy issues and using encryption to combat it, text chat is going to be uncommon, especially with Occulus.  People will use voice.  So we catalog the voice chat, right?  Voice chat algorithms aren't accurate enough to capture that in a way computers can read, especially when you take different languages and dialects and voice encryption into account, and none of this is a processing power issue.  You can't brute force that.  This technology does not exist.		Maybe bringing social networking into the virtual worlds to get text content to spider would work, but how to get people to use it?  You ever try to read a book in a virtual world?  Text is 2D, by it's very nature, so VR is not the medium of text.  It's just awkward in 3D.  You won't have people putting facebook posts on billboards in any meaningful way, because nobody will read them.		Anyway, if you are ever bored and want to play a thought experiment that might pay off some day just look around wherever you are and think about how you would find this place on Google or Bing.  What would you search for and how would the search engine know that this place is the place you wanted to go?  Bonus round:  Think about this while in a historically important place.  You want to find a restaurant in Gettysburg, PA, but you don't want to find civil war reenactment sims... how does that work?","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bubblesort","name":"t1_cmktdt3","parent_id":"t1_cmksd97","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1417684521,"created_utc":1417684521}
{"body":"Well see, you're trying to design a search algorithm with modern limitations. We have no reason to assume that searching will remain a static field, and every reason to believe it won't.		If you have the technology to make VR, you know the properties of every object in the environment. You have to, or you can't render them. So why not just analyze the assets directly? Even if we're a pretty dumb alogrithm, we can naively search for any object similar to a rectangular cube. Bam! VCRs, and maybe some alarm clocks and bread boxes, show up in a list. This is a pretty dumb way to search, but it would work.		You ask a lot of good questions. What you don't seem to understand is that they are completely answerable, and will be answered. With faster computers and more processing power, algorithms can perform more complicated operations and calculations without slowing down your computer. You can start to consider what in the modern era is ludicrous, like analyzing the mesh of every 3d object in a scene for certain properties, as things you can routinely do.		In the modern era though, searching may become easier than ever before. We've invented a technology called "crowdsourcing". We have a concept of "tags". People might be able to slap different kinds of tags on both virtual and real objects. You could define a class of object to automatically have a tag attributed to it, through any conditions which turn out to be useful to use. The countless people of the internet would then slowly tag real things, and with a proper algorithm you can use those to quickly search for anything you can think of. You run into the issues of moderation that comes with any crowdsourced product, but we're getting better at filtering those already.		Alternately, think about how Google Search actually works. A lot of what it does is genetic programming - learned associations. When people search for a thing, Google records what they eventually click on and look into. The most used paths are understood by the algorithm to be more relevant, and it can guess at what qualities made it more relevant, and try to use that knowledge in the future. It might be wrong, but thousands of searches and new learning opportunists let it gradually improve its accuracy over time. And Google Search gets more than just thousands of searches.		See, these are just algorithms that exist *today* though. It's likely that the search of the future will use some entirely new thing that nobody thought of because it didn't make sense before. Nobody tried to put a genetic learning program on an Atari. Having only 64 KB of memory to work with (Not hard drive space, not RAM - memory. There were no hard drives, and so no distinction existed.) made the idea of a genetic program that *saved data* and learned laughably impossible. Where would it store what it learned? after 10 or 50 queries, it'd fill up all your memory. Then what are you going to do? And unless you have a lot of floppy disks to write all that to, your learning is gonna be lost. Not to mention that, even assuming you can store and read all that data somehow, you're gonna have to wait a few hours for it to look through that much memory before it can even start calculating.		The whole point of "we can't even conceive of it yet" is that these ideas will sound crazy because they have to. Star Trek introduced a lot of stupidly impossible futuristic technology, like doors that opened for you and communicators that fit in your pocket (and many others! I'm sure someone has a list).		Every few years someone pipes up and says "Alright, I know Moore's Law of doubling has held for a long time, but this is it guys, we're gonna hit the wall of limiting returns!" and then we promptly don't, and then in a year or two they go "Alright that was a good show there, but seriously this time it's gonna stop doubling!" and then processor speeds and memory storage double again, and then they "no really! This time it'll-" but by now, we should have started ignoring them. It's been decades, and despite countless naysayers the theory has been upheld. It's a much safer assumption at this point that technology will just keep getting better, really damn fast. And since we've seen first hand how radically new the new technology is with this kind of growth rate, it is only natural to expect we'll see things in a few decades that don't make sense today.		But, you point out. There has to be an upper limit somewhere! True, at some point there was only so much we could do with magnetic tape as a storage device. We got magnetic tape as good as it got. So was that it? Was the development of memory storage tapped out forever? Well, no. We invented floppy disks, which used magnetic storage in a different form, and hard disks, which had a more durable storage of magnetic data. Gone were cassette tapes, but development continued. Then came flash memory and SSDs. There's an upper limit to the technology we're developing today, but you might not even notice when that upper limit is circumvented and surpassed. Did you notice when desktops started changing into laptops and tablets and those things we still call "phones" but use for almost everything except phone calls? Have you ever confused an iPod touch with a cell phone because all you use it for is apps and you couldn't tell it couldn't make calls?		There are a lot of arguments which suggest that technological development will slow or halt. Those arguments are inherently flawed by their reliance on the status quo of the modern day as a baseline understanding of the future, which has historically been shown to be highly inaccurate. The fact the you can individually reference the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and get different understandings of culture, society, and technology from adjacent decades belies the belief that the future is tied to the present. There is still a causal link, obviously, but things won't be like they are. Things are always changing. So far, that's the only thing that has stopped changing.","depth":8,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Elathrain","name":"t1_cmkug17","parent_id":"t1_cmktdt3","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1417690244,"created_utc":1417690244}

Now for the juicy bits... The reason that this level of feigned idiocy appears, in my opinion, is because AT&T is not just an ISP or cell carrier. They are also a utility owner/LEC (Local Exchange Carrier). I know from talking with some tech foremen that I work with that AT&T is starting to push to install entire fiber grids. They have a current plan in place to install a fiber grid to cover the entire city of Chicago by 2020. So if they have similar plans in other areas, they would try to keep people complacent with what they have now instead of supporting a new grid like the one mentioned in the OP so that ATT can place THEIR grid and rake in those profits later on. That's just my opinion. The company may be chaotic, but some of the people really high up are very smart, but also incredibly amoral and greedy as all hell.

Capping internet use to as little as single digit usage is not right, and is utterly infeasable for any family to not overuse their internet in an age of HD video and video adverts. When the company then offer larger packages for well over twice the price, this is where it becomes dirty money.		And unfortunately, for many people in America, the shitty service is the ONLY service that is provided in their area. In the UK, you can often get a variety of options for your internet provider, but in America you can be utterly limited to a single company, with no other option other than not having internet, which is a service that I honestly believe should be considered as important as water, gas and electricity, given it's broad usefulness in work, living and entertainment.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TallestGargoyle","name":"t1_cmkwzvx","parent_id":"t1_cmkvi57","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1417701084,"created_utc":1417701084}

{"body":"Back when DSL Internet was new here in Sweden, I think around 1994 or so, the first provider was the national Swedish telecom company Televerket (now Telia). They offered 0.5MBit, and people was asking for faster connections. The standard response they put out was that they were Televerket, and they knew that the copper wires (that they owned) could not handle anything faster than 0.5MBit. A month later BoNet (or if it was BoStream, something like that) announced their 2.5MBit DSL connection over the same wires. 		After that, the development has been going forward mostly without hickups. Today, you can get DSL at ~8MBit, but the 24 and 64 MBit variants are the most common. Most cities already have fiber connections available up to 1GBit. And that is without traffic limits; you only find those on mobile (3G/4G) connections.

{"body":"Remember when Ma Bell was broken up specifically because she had a defacto monopoly on phone service?  It's already clear that the big broadband companies won't go head to head against each other in large markets, but now they're standing up against public utilities as well.  Everyone is always stating how the free market will fix all our problems while meanwhile companies are doing all they can to prevent such markets from actually existing.  I wonder why Justice doesn't look into these things anymore or why Congress refuses to pass legislation that immediately fines any company for attempting to shut down actual competition. 		I live in a rural area where we have a choice between no service, dial-up, pitiful microwave-relay DSL that requires line of site to their tower to get about 256K, satellite, or cell phone internet.  Our satellite company charges $125 a month for relatively fast internet with a hard cap of 25 gigs during the day except for the hours of midnight to 5 a.m. After that cap it's $9.99 per gig.  There's no way this wouldn't be seen as gouging in any other kind of industry.		We're supplementing this with a cell phone data package that adds about another $50 to our phone bill for 30 gigs more at much slower speeds and constant interruptions.  For about $110 more we could get up to 100 gigs still slower than even the weakest broadband.  With these two combined, we're still getting almost 100 gig less than what AT&T allows for their fiber system that is offered at a teaser rate of $35 dollars.  That's a $140 dollar difference or five times the cost.		The government set aside all this money specifically to bring broadband to areas like mine, but this only meant we had six months to sign up for a program that would have brought us up to 60 gig for about $100 a month still on satellite. Of course none of the companies notified us of this despite the fact that we were on another satellite carrier at the time. The really crazy thing is we live maybe one mile past the usual switching station limit of five miles. Every time I call AT&T for something else and ask them about the chance of them laying fiber out here they basically laugh at me.		The only way I see any justice in any of this is through some sort of class action lawsuit, and even then I would be lucky to see $15 out of it.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"wolfdaddy74701","name":"t1_cml73sv","parent_id":"t3_2o7lt6","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1417720706,"created_utc":1417720706}
