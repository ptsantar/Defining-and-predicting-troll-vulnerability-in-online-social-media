{"body":"People don't say "lock up the crazies" - at least not the sane politicians - they say "treat mental health". There needs to be greater access to mental health care. You would not believe how difficult it is to get affordable psychiatric and psychological treatment, even with the Affordable Care Act. Granted, I'm grateful for the ACA, but, even after it went into effect, I was put on a waiting list for a psychologist, because the state won't hire any more. 		Plus, my case worker has been on leave for a year, and they haven't given me a new one, just telling me that I need to wait until she gets back. She's on maternity leave, which is great for her, but I need them to give me a new case worker while she's out. They refuse to do so because the county's program is "understaffed" and "under-funded" - though it's part of a major hospital, and is on an "ability to pay" sliding scale.		*That* is what the whole mental health policy is about: making sure everyone who needs mental health treatment gets it, even those who can't afford it. It's about expanding access and resources.		This is especially important so that those who are *really* bad off can be treated, and disasters like Sandy Hook can be better prevented. If whatshisname had actually been treated by a mental health professional, maybe someone could have seen what was wrong, and those kids and their teacher would still be alive. *That* is why mental health policies are tied to politics surrounding gun violence.","depth":7,"score":21,"ups":21,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MoonChild02","name":"t1_cppv9ib","parent_id":"t1_cpppqd3","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427256718,"created_utc":1427253118}

{"body":"[Cop and his online buddy shared their fantasies about kidnapping, murdering, and eating women, including the cop's wife.](http://nymag.com/news/features/cannibal-cop-2014-1/index2.html) His wife found the emails describing how he'd kill her. The cop was targeting real women, sending his buddy their photos, using the NYPD database to access their personal information including home addresses, and discussing how to kidnap them.		>In January, Valle had e-mailed Vanhise photos of Alicia Frisca, the friend of ??Kathleen???s who teaches at the school where she once worked, and offered to kidnap her for him for $5,000. Vanhise replied, ???Could we do four???? To which Valle responded: ???I am putting my neck on the line here. If something goes wrong somehow, I am in deep shit. $5,000 and you need to make sure that she is not found. She will definitely make the news.??? In chats happening about the same time with Ali Khan, Valle suggested taking Kathleen on a trip to India, where the two of them would kill her and prepare her for dinner. ???We will take turns with her,??? he wrote, after sending him a photo of Kathleen in a bikini. They also discussed killing Andria Noble, one of his college friends. ???It???s personal with Andria,??? Valle wrote. ???She will absolutely suffer.??? Later, he added that he???d found a recipe for chloroform online.	???		>They settled on Kimberly Sauer, a college friend of Valle???s, and Valle started planning the details: ???Once she is dead, I will take her out and properly butcher her body and cook the meat right away. And that could be out on a rotisserie too.??? Valle later e-mailed Moody Blues a short Word document titled ???Abducting and Cooking Kimberly, a Blueprint.??? He listed materials he???d need to do the job: a car, chloroform (???refer to website for directions???), rope, a gag (???duct tape????), a tarp or plastic bags to protect the trunk from any DNA remains, more bags for Sauer???s clothes, and ???cheap sneakers.???		But, because police didn't actually find chloroform or a person-sized oven or other kidnapping/murder goodies, this was all dismissed as just talking out fantasies and the only thing the guy got in trouble for was improper use of the NYPD database.","depth":6,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BurleyQGirl","name":"t1_cppqjrj","parent_id":"t1_cppm2fl","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427248419,"created_utc":1427244819}

{"body":"So, being admitted to a mental health crisis facility/intake facility, and involuntary commitment are two different but similar things.		Admission to a mental health crisis facility is voluntary. People checking in to one of these facilities do so because they are experiencing a mental health emergency. Reasons why a person may check into one of these facilities could include a psychotic episode, persistent panic attacks, or other serious acute mental issues. These individuals are not a danger to themselves or others, and often they go to these facilities because they don't know where else to go. 		On the other hand, involuntary commitment occurs when individuals experiencing a mental disturbance present a significant threat to themselves or others. Here in Florida, involuntary commitment is commonly known as being [Baker Acted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Mental_Health_Act). These individuals can be held up to a period of 72 hours for evaluations. 		Police can bring individuals to a mental health crisis facility, however they are not obligated to do so. If someone who is arrested is clearly experiencing some sort of severe mental illness, but they do not appear to be a danger to their self or others, then the officer may take them to such a facility. Alternatively, the officer could simply take them to jail, where they likely won't receive the mental health services they need. Additionally... an officer could inappropriately "Baker Act" an individual that is experiencing mental distress, yet is not a danger to their self or others. In such a situation, the individual would likely be released quickly upon being evaluated. 		Involuntary commitment to a psychiatric facility is reserved exclusively for an individual who is a danger to their self or others.

Around this time, corruption and scandal gripped prohibition and narcotics agencies. The ensuing shake-ups and re-organizations set the stage for Anslinger, perceived as an honest and incorruptible figure, to advance not only in rank but to great political stature.[citation needed]		>In 1930, Anslinger was appointed to the newly created Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) as its first commissioner.[3] 		and		>Some of his critics[10] allege that Anslinger and the campaign against marijuana had a hidden agenda. DuPont petrochemical interests and William Randolph Hearst together created the highly sensational anti-marijuana campaign to eliminate hemp as an industrial competitor. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between development of nylon and changes laws for hemp and marijuana.[11][12] Indeed, Anslinger did not himself consider marijuana a serious threat to American society until in the fourth year of his tenure (1934), at which point an anti-marijuana campaign, aimed at alarming the public, became his primary focus as part of the government's broader push to outlaw all recreational drugs.

In this case, believing she had Marijuana based on the smell when she didn't have any allowed them to take her car away then her being upset over this allowed them to lock her up for 8 days involuntarily. That is a tactic commonly used in my area also, the smell excuse not being locked up. It is frustrating and an easy way to have your rights stripped legally even if you haven't committed the crime.","depth":7,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MrsMagnum","name":"t1_cppell8","parent_id":"t1_cppe5y4","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427228881,"created_utc":1427225281}

{"body":"Theoretically, this is correct.  However, there has been no shortage of cases where people who were not severely mentally ill, or posed a threat to themselves or others, being involuntarily committed.  Sometimes it's incompetence or apathy on part of the institution, and sometimes the institution is in cahoots with the police or another party.  It sounds like the sort of crazy conspiracy theory that would suggest one perhaps needs to be mentally evaluated, but there's too much evidence to the contrary.		One case that stands out in my mind is  that of [Adrian Schoolcraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Schoolcraft).  He was a cop that was trying to expose the corruption of his fellow officers in the NYPD.  Those officers had him committed to a mental institution against his will, and if not for the fact that there was a hidden audio recording of the corruption he was trying to expose, everyone else would probably just assumed he was indeed mentally unstable.			>Schoolcraft reports that the Department directed him toward psychological treatment rather than taking his concerns seriously.

In any case, the fake patients came in to the hospital pretending that they were having hallucinations, the doctors diagnosed them, and kept them in the hospital for a few weeks to watch for any recurrence of symptoms, and then let them go. Since they had no reason to suspect they were lying about their initial symptoms, what else should they have done differently?		To quote a critic of the study:		>*If I were to drink a quart of blood and, concealing what I had done, come to the emergency room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.*		Also, I realize that at least one person was kept longer than he should have been, and that a few of the nurses mistook some of their normal behavior as possibly indicating other symptoms (although that probably didn't even affect treatment decisions), but keep in mind that the field of psychiatry has changed quite a bit since that time, both in diagnosis and in how they treat patients.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LinT5292","name":"t1_cppqrdk","parent_id":"t1_cpppbqt","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427248779,"created_utc":1427245179}

I worked in psych for a few years and it's unbelievable to listen to the doctors read into the patient's actions.

His doctor interpreted this as him being a people-pleaser because he must be buying the coffee to share with everyone since he got so much of it. Which is a sign that he must have low self-esteem which also must be contributing to his depression.		Another patient noticed the pilot light on the stove in the kitchen. He told a coworker about it concerned someone left the oven on. She just explained to him that it's a type of range that has a pilot always on and that was the end of it. The patient didn't really do anything else that day other than read and hang out in his room, so with nothing else to talk about, she mentioned during shift change that he had asked about the stove and read and that was about it for the day. His therapist interpreted his asking about the stove as hyper-vigilance over his safety which was caused by some trauma he experienced as a child. Even though I'd personally heard at least half a dozen other patients mention the pilot light thinking that someone had left the stove on in the few years I was there.

Once she told them it was a BMW, they started demanding her age (she does look young for 32) and she started to get upset, so they handcuffed her and threw her in an ambulance, insisting that they were taking her to her car.","depth":2,"score":146,"ups":146,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AllTheCheesecake","name":"t1_cpphv9c","parent_id":"t1_cppbqe3","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427233940,"created_utc":1427230340}

{"body":"Yes electronic records are now the norm. At this time a police officer has no access to psychiatric records. Would only be able to access court records to see that someone has been committed for involuntary treatment. Being treated in a clinic or hospital for depression with suicidal ideation doesn't impact your right to own a gun. The cops could not enforce a restriction unless they had knowledge of the mental problem which is in the legal not medical realm. I once requested police help when a person being treated made direct threats to kill a person. I'm required to report this. While waiting for transport to the hospital the deputies traded stories with the guy about hunting and equipment. This guy still has guns. Unless a judge puts into an order they get to keep those rights.

{"body":"Yikes! That is some gross malpractice right there. I wonder are these people just completely unqualified or are they actually aware of the damage they are doing?  	Either way, in my opinion the problem of  poor (and dangerous) treatment in the mental heath field is just ignored due to the lack of understanding of those kind of diseases amongst the general public.  		For example, I can hear of a doctor not maintaining hygiene while operating or giving a bad diagnosis with *physical* results and instantly see their negligence, despite not being a doctor. However, unless the cases are as clear cut and messed up as your examples are, I really can't tell if a therapist's advice is valid. The best I could maybe do is say that it doesn't "sound right".  		Anyway, Ireland's problem with mentally ill and elderly care seems just as severe. [This](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1209/665564-aras-attracta-mayo/) was one of the more recent stories about it, and the amount of [cover-ups and silencing of whistle-blowers](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/whistleblowers-suspended-after-raising-concerns-about-nursing-home-1.1869443) means that there is almost certainly a lot of abuse that goes unreported. I think that just about every country needs to step up the screening and requirements for carers of the mentally ill. Unfortunately, society seems to try to get them of the way and then forget they exist.   	 	Out of curiosity... *were* there actually bodies buried in the woods? Because if so it almost sounds like the therapist was trying to make the patient take the fall for his own crime, hoping that the authorities would discredit the man's denial due to his history of mental difficulties.

Many can be quite dangerous to themselves, so most psychiatrists are very reluctant the take any risks releasing patients who might end up harming themselves or others.

It's now (~~not~~) believed that depression, and in part anxiety, is a disorder of **neuroplasticity**.

{"body":"Depression and anxiety decrease neuroplasticity in a number of different ways; each individual case can have a number of different reasons.  There is no 'one cause' of depression physiologically or on a molecular scale.  		Some cases of depression can be caused by stress.  Stress causes a number of different things, but a primary physiological response is the release of cortisol.  Cortisol can have an effect on the HPA axis, such that there is now a dysregulation in regards to the negative feedback loop.  This abnormal cortisol release and fluctuations can have an impact on the neuroimmune system (specifically microglia).  This on its own can induce a multiple number of effects.  Cortisol (or corticosterone in rats) can "modulate multiple immune functions, including cytokine expression, immune cell trafficking, immune cell maturation, and the production of chemoattractants. Additionally, CORT can influence glucose metabolism, blood pressure, lipid metabolism, deposition of glycogen, neurotransmission, renal activity, and muscle function."		However, stress can directly impact neuroimmune cells (glia and microglia).  It is important to note that roughly 10% of the cells in the brain are microglia.  One primary function of these two types of neuroimmune cells is modulating neuronal architecture and functioning.  This can be disrupted in the presence of stress. 		One primary example is its role in synaptic pruning.  		http://www.nature.com/news/microglia-the-constant-gardeners-1.10732		It's not entirely known how this occurs, but stress has been implicated in this process.  		SSRI's work in that 'post-stress' period.  They increase levels of certain things, such as 'BDNF' which **promote** synaptic plasticity.  Depression has abnormal networks of synapses that 'may' result in the depression-like behaviour.  SSRI's help the brain change these abnormal pathways to reduce depression-like symptoms.  This is still not exactly proven, but recent evidence over the last 4 or so years really supports the theory.  		EDIT:		Again, there are many different causes.  This is just one of them.  Each individual case is different, but the vast majority can benefit from increasing synaptic plasticity from SSRI's.

{"body":"Yep horrifying. 20 years ago I attempted suicide. I was in an abusive relationship stuck living with an ex-boyfriend who regularly threatened to kill me. I was trapped in a year lease with the guy and didn't know what to do.  		I was never close to my parents and couldn't count on them for support. They told me if he was so bad then I shouldn't have moved in with him in the first place. Ok thanks for rubbing a mistake in my face instead of helping me out!  		My friends weren't much better. When I said he was abusive they laughed at me and said he wouldn't hurt a fly. Yeah that's why he put a knife to my throat for not being "nice enough" to him ugh		So I didn't mention the abuse to the medical staff. If my own friends didn't believe me, why would strangers believe me? Nowadays if you go to the hospital/urgent care they tend to ask you if you feel safe at home. They didn't ask then. So I was treated like a lovesick girl who just broke up with her boyfriend and wanted attention. Couldn't be farther from the truth. 		It was close to Christmas. Both the EMTs and the hospital staff asked what I was doing for the holidays. I was in college and said I was going home to Wisconsin. The very next question they asked was if my parents were going to pick me up. They didn't say from where. Since we were just talking about the holidays I'm thinking: From the airport when I go back to WI? Of course! What a dumb question! I could not understand why they cared so much about who was picking me up from the airport!		They were actually asking if my parents were going to pick me up from the hospital after my stomach was pumped. What? lol Of course not. They're in WI. Duh! I don't know why they assumed my parents lived in town.		When the psychiatrist on call found out my parents weren't picking me up from the hospital, he immediately threatened to throw me in the psych hospital. He was pissed that I had said my parents were going to pick me up. One vague question nearly got me a psych hold. wtf 		And I got billed over $300 for that asswipe to do nothing but threaten me with being committed. Again, this was over 20 years ago.

{"body":"As someone who ended up in a psych ward, i appreciate when I see posts like this warning people. I was "voluntarily" committed because I told my college counselor that I made a suicide gesture that was never likely to actually succeed (plastic bag over head. I know...)		Part of me can't be mad because i understand I was treated the procedural way for suicidal people. But part of me is furious at how I was treated for trying to get help. When I was signing in downstairs everyone in spoke to said one night's stay, which I stupidly believed. A major part of my episode was stress related, because of my stressful job combined with college finals and debt.  I could spare one night, but if I missed a day or two of work with no notice I'd be fired, and it was Friday and i had finals on Monday. Of course I didn't warn my workplace I would be gone, because of the "one night" lies		Of course when it was time to sign the papers committing myself, suddenly it's "upon request, the doctor will take 72 hours to evaluate and release you." When I tried expressing that, while I totally came here with the intent of getting help, being imprisoned for 72 hours when I had PLENTY of building responsibility to attend to wouldn't actually help me at all, they just threatened to have me taken in involuntarily. So I was coerced into signing to retain some measure of control over my freedom. 		The staff were so condescending and unhelpful. They asked my motivation for attempting suicide and I answered honestly, "I've been dissatisfied with life for a very long time and finally wanted to do something about it" they seemed to think I was lying. What, do you want me to fake cry?  Make up a breakup I didn't have?  interacting with the nurses was horribly stressful because they'd shown me that telling the truth made them suspicious so I never knew what to say since at that point my only goal was getting out before I got fired AND flunked all my finals. When I told anyone that, they would tell me not to worry about it. That was so fucking frustrating. If I wanted to not worry about my future then why would I even get mental help in the first place? 		For two days I only saw the real doctor for about 40 minutes total. The first day he too threatened to have me committed involuntarily. No matter what in said no one seemed to understand me. I wanted to STOP engaging in self destruction, and waiting around for days and days in a happy place while my life and responsibilities collapse without me is actually one of the most decadently self destructive things I can think of. 		I finally got out, and didn't follow up on anything they gave me. It's years later now and I'm still paying the bill I received for my entrapment, but I'm much much happier and better because I put task effort into helping myself. Before, all i knew was "depression is a serious issue that needs help from your doctor" so it seemed like my efforts were ultimately worthless. After the incident though I knew that doctors turned out to be no help at all and a gigantic mistake, so in didn't have any excuse not to improve my outlook myself.		Haven't had a suicide attempt since. Had plenty of suicidal _thoughts_ (especially in regards to how STUPID I WAS TO WASTE ALL THAT MONEY ON NON HELP etc.) but you can bet your ass I'll never speak to another living soul about them ever again for fear of a repeat of this debacle. 		I don't even know who fucked up in this situation. The doctors and nurses were ultimately following protocol for a situation like mine. The counselor is obligated to act on suicide attempts no matter how ineffective and halfhearted they may be. But still I had an awful experience and feel shocked and scarred. 		Sorry to hijack your excellent post with my long preachy rant. I just feel as someone who was hurt by the mental health system and got better outside of it that this perspective doesn't get represented much.

{"body":"> You're description of Borderline Personality Disorder is not even close to accurate.		I should've been more specific: I'm not describing BPD, I'm describing how I've seen *clinicians* describe BPD. I've seen people diagnosed as BPD, because they had PTSD and the therapist didn't think their trauma was "That Bad." They didn't have the impulsivity, self-injurious behaviour, or any of the other clinical criteria other than "high strung and confrontational" (due to PTSD), but the therapist saw it fit to call them liars over their lived experiences. They could be married for five years with very few arguments with their partners or friends - stable relationships through and through - and it still gets foisted onto them.		>t is a personality disorder that can be exacerbated by abuse, but studies show brain function abnormalities in areas like the amygdalae and hippocampus often causing distortions in object permanence and memory processing.		AFAIK, those abnormalities are a direct result of the chronic stress of (usually, early-childhood) abuse. You can see the same abnormalities in people with PTSD, to a lesser degree. 		>One further point, what you say about BPD being a diagnosis for difficult patients was once very true, but as more research into BPD has been done, including deriving better diagnostics, much of that practice has been minimized.		Not where I come from. Maybe I live in a very psych-conservative area, but BPD is still thrown around as a label for "frustrating client" like a hot-metal brand. I know so many people who don't fit the BPD diagnosis who have it.		What's *really* fucked up is that virtually every psych protocol out there (UK N.I.C.E, for instance) says not to medicate people with BPD with things like SSRIs. They recommend very low doses of mood stabilizers instead (Lamictal, Lyrica), but what ends up happening? All of them end up on Paxil and Seroquel. This even includes the people I know who are actually BPD and going through DBT-type therapy: their doctors just shove them on a cocktail and leave them to rot.

Okay, so I don't want to come off as lecturing here so bear with me-- I actually felt the same way for a long time. I think my experience was a little different in that I was raised non-religious. I was raised to learn about different belief systems and appreciate that they all served purposes (and that they share a lot in terms of mythological themes and intersecting histories--really pretty fascinating) but at a certain point I thought "fuck this, these people are chumps." But I learned to see it differently over time. I don't believe in god, but other people do--and their reality is just as true to them as my reality is to me. My philosophical perspective is that people need a system in place to help make sense of all the crazy input that comes with being. If someone has a different way to make sense of it from the way I do, it isn't good or bad--I think it simply is.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheLadyEve","name":"t1_cppsepa","parent_id":"t1_cppr5dr","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427251587,"created_utc":1427247987}

{"body":"You make an excellent point, and actually there are two areas of research that relate to this: the first is that counseling psychologists (defined as being doctoral level) tend to be more secular on average. The second is that atheism is *not* typically included as a belief system when psychologists attend training. So, by belief system, I am not saying atheism is a religion, but it *is* a belief system--and while professionals get a lot of training to work with different faiths, atheism is not included. A lot of clients want to have a therapist of a specific faith because they want to feel understood, but ask two Christians (or Muslims, or Jews) to interpret a specific passage and they'll likely come up with slightly different interpretations. It's not about wanting a therapist who is exactly the same, it's about wanting a therapist who can understand them. 		To respond to your specific statement regarding "meddling with" belief systems, it's my experience that clients don't want a therapist who agrees with their beliefs so much as a therapist who understands them and understands why their beliefs are important to them. And this comes back to my earlier point--their beliefs often help them survive in the world, make sense of the world, feel a part of communities, etc. If their faith is clashing with other facets of life, they will often recognize that with guidance and support rather than judgment. I can't speak for other non-religious mental health professionals, but I can speak for myself--I don't believe I am somehow more informed or more enlightened than people I work with who are religious simply by virtue of my beliefs. However, I feel torn sometimes, especially when I look at research that shows that more conservative Christian practitioners tend to be less accepting or less professional with GLBT clients--but then therapists are responsible for recognizing their own biases, *and* that correlation drops when level of education increases. So, long story short, I do think it's possible to resolve these different perspectives because, after all, a *lot* of beliefs are going to clash when it comes to a therapist and a client--the differences are definitely not limited to religion. It's how we maintain awareness of those differences and learn to understand different perspectives that makes us better at communicating.

Not anyone respectable that I know--a huge tenet of working with psychotic patients with reality testing is to *not* say stuff like "you're imaging things, you're wrong."

{"body":"I don't know if you'll ever come back to this, but I got to thinking about it last night after I signed off.  And I'm still dissatisfied with the 'humor them on matters of religion if they're not hurting anyone' approach for a few reasons.  		Again, it's black and white thinking, glad I'm not a psychologist, okay, but I'll give an example (no actual religions will be used or harmed in the making of this example, don't worry!):		I get on Reddit one morning and someone is preaching the Gospel of the A Team.  And I see the light shining off B.A.s sparkly jewelry and convert.  It's a great religion, you pray to each member much like some have patron saints.  B.A. for travel, Hannibal for leadership decisions, Face for public speaking, and Murdoch for those nutty moments when you're reading a post like this and wondering if you might just lose your mind over so much silliness!  		In any case, the religion requires you to help others and wear 80s clothing.  Not too terrible.  But there is one flaw.  Every weekday at 3pm (or whatever time the show used to come on in your area), in honor of the 'skilled' driving featured constantly on the show, you must drive your car (or better yet custom A Team van) the wrong way down the road.		So the police are not amused by my new religious practice and when I start praying to my gods out loud, they haul me in to have a nice chat with you.		Perhaps you convince me that the driving part can be symbolic, using an ebayed A Team toy set with a toy van.  Eventually you decide I'm otherwise sane and turn me loose.		You don't tell me this is the dumbest idea for a religion you've ever heard.		I go happily on my way until I violate a particularly important tenant of my religion (lose or break a gold chain, maybe?) and I decide the sin is so great that, just this once, I'm going to have to go back to driving the actual van the wrong way down the road.		The police, not being fond of traffic pattern aberrations, show up, and soon I'm back in your office.			So here are my issues:  		No matter how hard you try, can you really treat a religion that is thousands of years old and a two week old religion with the same respect?  (I also wonder, would you really do so?  Or are there writings and research on the subject of the differences in mental states of someone who follows a religion, however boring and unoriginal that is, and someone who creates one or adopts a very new one, however creative and original that may be?)		Second, maybe the best way to stop my hypothetical A Team worshipping self from putting myself and others in danger a second time would not have been to mold my religious beliefs into something less dangerous (the symbolic example).  Maybe the best way would be to say what you're really thinking.  That this is the dumbest religion you've ever heard of.		Even if that isn't true, you said something about gaining trust.  But if you gain a patient's trust and never reveal how you truly feel about their belief system, aren't you betraying that trust by being dishonest?

Sounds kinda hippy-dippy, I know, but I know no other way to take the selfish motivations that are at the root of everything negative in the world out of people.  If everyone is loved, cherished, held, and cared for there would be no need for people to try to make themselves above others as it wouldn't accomplish anything.  Boom.  World peace.		But that's just pure hyperbolic conjecture.  Obviously that sort of thing can work for a time on a certain scale, but the reality of the universe is everything is transient and temporary.  So it would eventually come to an end.  Not to mention that people would probably still want to change, evolve and challenge themselves because of that's the nature of humanity, and of all life, really.  And those actions don't always have positive outcomes.  So I don't think we can ever hope for a perfect world.  Even the Dalai Lama says he doesn't think our world will ever truly know world peace.		But if we're not trying for a utopia?  I would say just regular, good old-fashioned kindness and empathy.  Actively thinking about what others are going through and being nice to them goes a long way towards minimizing hurt and anger.  It's not always easy, or even possible in certain circumstances, and can be especially difficult in the heat of the moment.  		But pound for pound, kindness and empathy *will* make your world better and the lives around you a little kinder and easier.  That's not to say you let others run all over you and take advantage, merely that you try to see why they try to take advantage and don't get too upset when you can't just will their behavior to change.  Some people are just dickbags.  Yeah, we can storm the castle all we want, but there will always be another dickbag ready to take the former's place when the time comes.   Because if we just keep storming the replacement's castle all we're doing is playing a very long game of whack-a-mole.  And nobody really wins when they play whack-a-mole.  Though I'm sure bringing that hammer down and balancing things (if even for a moment) feels really fucking good.		So, in a fucked up way, I think embracing the flawed nature of  people, the world, and reality is the key to making things better.

{"body":"Indeed.  I've worked in several roles on multiple inpatient psychiatric units through the years, and more often than not we're turning people away who probably should be committed.  The reality is that there is a desperate shortage of psych beds in most parts of the country, and people who should be admitted are often turned away.  Likewise, people who are in the hospital are often discharged prematurely because beds are needed for more acute people.		The notion that somebody could be admitted for simply claiming that Obama followers her on Twitter is absolutely absurd.  Anybody who thinks that's possible clearly has no familiarity with how the system works.  It isn't as if you get admitted simply because the police detained you and took you to the hospital.  Someone first has to go through an extensive evaluation (often lasting several hours) by a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals, and a working diagnosis is obtained.  In order for this woman to be admitted she would have either had to have been determined to be a high risk to her own safety (suicidality) or a high risk to other people's safety (either due to homicidality or due to being severely psychotic).  The evidence for those claims would have to be very carefully documented, and saying some shit about Twitter is most certainly not sufficient.		As others have said, the fact that she was chemically restrained (sedated) is an indication that she was pretty out of control.  Mental health workers will *put up with some shit* before they ever initiate the process of chemically restraining someone, which requires *a lot* of paperwork and is a very tedious procedure (as it should be).  In most states, that paperwork includes a description of the other deescalation procedures that were unsuccessfully utilized prior to resorting to chemical restraint.  Especially in a big city, that hospital would be used to dealing with people who are combative and out of control and would be adept at using other measures to restrain them before moving on to chemicals.  It's unlikely that she would have been sedated unless she was physically assaulting people or assaulting herself with such severity that she could not simply be physically restrained or verbally deescalated.","depth":1,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rain12913","name":"t1_cppm86e","parent_id":"t1_cppdccd","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427241143,"created_utc":1427237543}

I've dealt with a lot of hospitals, clinics, organizations etc.. in my many years as a medic. Is there some crap that happens from time to time? Sure.. We're humans and completely fallible.

The whole psych system is overburdened to an extent. Psych care has fallen to the wayside for decades. The areas that have exceptional facilities are bombarded by a prison system that is meant for confinement and not mental health. By "overburdened" I'm talking about the system as a whole, and not that a facility may have an open bed. Facilities that deal in psych care prefer to have "long term" residents that their bills are footed by John Q. Taxpayer, and not Suzie Q. Homemaker who could easily be charged through outpatient services. (This is purely from my own experience.

But if I have to risk something and I have nothing to go on but the fact of their profession, then I'm going to make an inferential judgement based on my personal experience, even knowing full well that I could be completely wrong.

{"body":"You could also write, if you wanted to, "In my experience", or  "There is a trend, historically, that this field attracts individuals who may feel entitled to...", or could go into specificity on burnout. There is no obligation to use any of these obviously. 		 Location and types of institutionalization also affects how an individual is treated; support of your statement could also come from "in hospitals" or "in non-hospice type settings" or "with these specific illnesses (Bipolar, schizophrenic, Borderline, gender identity and sexuality as well, tend to get the shaft, IIRC, more than most other mental illnesses or conditions in terms of correct and proper treatment).  		   I'd say "some people" would probably come off different and less across-the-board than "The people" or "most people", which implies the majority who gointo a huge and diverse field that is structurally layered with psychiatrists, therapists, medical doctors, and social workers, as well as laypersons with no training who are accepted into these settings ("staff" members).  		  To say "most people" implies that "most people" are "sick sadistic narcissists and power tripping" going into this field, which would be a lot more difficult to prove or support than "There are a large amount of unsavory and unethical persons in this field currently". 		 I'm not trying to be inflammatory or disrespectful, and I apologize if my initial comment was either of those. I definitely don't want to invalidate anyone's experience in the mental health field, especially negative ones; these are prime reasons to alter the current methods of practice.		But I'm also not going to say that because a generalization can be made that it should never be called out as possibly too sweeping, which was my initial intent. 		 It is, to me, too widely sweeping to assume individuals who are not even practicing in the mental health field currently contain the same elements as those employed in the field, especially considering the fact that most going into the field will not be active in it until 4-8 years after they've started their studies, minimum.

Also, it's actually unconstitutional the current drug laws and enforcing those are what's actually "illegal". That's basically half the problem that people think government has that type of power without an amendment, and even then it's dubious. People follow corporate law, not constitutional law. Back when the country was founded, the biggest part of government was basically the post office. No states have "decriminalized" marijuana anyway. A few have slightly eased restrictions on it and if you don't follow x y z arbitrary rules, felony. Being a psychopath isn't a felony though. Keep in mind you get in trouble because "it could be bad" it's not like you only get in trouble after doing something.		So basically:	- "Illegal" drug users (including weak calming herbs) = screened for privately and publicly with massive funding, illegal by itself with 0 legitimate science (for pot anyway). Crimes committed in-conjunction with it often carry harsher penalties.		- Psychopathic people = not typically screened for, little  funding targeted against it, not illegal by itself nor do you get into MORE trouble while committing crimes while having that condition, unlike drugs. Countless scientific studies linking that condition with violent crime and willingness to commit fraud.		Think real hard about how the two groups of "law breakers" are treated. People sometimes end up in prison (for pot) for longer sentences than violent people with brain damage. One is CLEARLY deemed more of a threat by the state.		Here's a RL example of a whistleblower vs. psychopath, just research these 2 names and how both were treated (while incarcerated) despite wildly different crimes.	Pvt. Manning and Sgt. Bales. 	It's obvious who writes the laws and they're not like me. I also laugh (quite often) at countries that supposedly hate the US who basically model their legal system after it, especially on drugs.

{"body":"I'm an adult inpatient psychiatrist at a hospital in Tennessee and have been concerned by many of the comments. It seems there is still an impression that "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" represents the standard of care in psychiatry; this is an absolutely false conception. In contemporary psychiatry, there is a high regard for patient autonomy and coercion is forbidden. As per court precedence, we involuntarily commit only those patients who are a clear and present danger to themselves or others. Laws vary by state, however short emergency detainment is permitted; longer stays must be approved by a judge (the patient is present and "gets his day in court"). Examples of reasonable involuntary hospitalizations would be for someone who is running into traffic in an effort to suicide, someone walking around the city nude responding to auditory hallucinations, or someone in an acute manic episode who is disinhibited to the degree that he is at high risk for self harm. We do not involuntarily commit people for personal financial gain or at the behest of hospital administrators (do this and you will and should lose your license). Also in contemporary psychiatry we typically treat patients on an inpatient basis no more than 5-7 days. The idea that patients are routinely locked away for months to years at a time is false and often is used by the anti-psychiatry movements to polarize the public.		It's difficult to comment on this specific case, and I won't speculate. However, in general, manic patients often have a multitude of grandiose delusions and are unable to reality test. The psychiatrist's job is to determine if there is true delusional thinking present. That someone says Obama follows them on Twitter does not give a psychiatrist any reason to hospitalize someone involuntarily; this is something that truly happens in the world. In the same way, I would not involuntarily commit someone who tells me they own a Lear Jet. Also, there have to be associated symptoms that put the patient at imminent risk (such as severe agitation, aggression or assaultiveness) in order to administer a sedative such as lorazepam involuntarily.

{"body":"Eh, to be fair to people, the Obama account is done out to be the president, even though its not and probably has very little current connection with his whitehouse. Its not some random person, its his old election crew. And they make a very believable case.		Plenty of people who follow, and are followed by, the Obama twitter think it is real, because you are supposed to think its real. And there are celebs and cultural heros that do respond to fans via twitter, so to the average person, particularly someone who uses but is not well versed in the internet, its an easy and understandable mistake to make. None of them are insane, they are simply misinformed. 		However, you dont get thrown in a psych ward for saying someone follows you on twitter, even if no such account exists (and in this case, the account does exist, though its not the person she thought was behind it). There is something even your previous Washington Post article isnt getting. There has to be more to this. Someone would need to report her, the system, which may be shit but probably gets hundreds of prank or vindictive calls a day and filters out most of them, would have then evaluated her and found her ill, and then she would have been taken to the psych ward. Or some set of events that ended up in the same outcome. 		In short, believing that it is really Obama that runs the twitter account, given that it is run professionally and by people once close to him, isnt insane. Its actually fairly normal. He is known for that account after all, even if he doesnt use it. He is known as the president that uses social media around the world. But even if it was obviously a spoof account, or even if it never existed, that alone is not enough to get you in a psych ward so frankly we are missing part of the story here.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"albions-angel","name":"t1_cppjmse","parent_id":"t1_cppity1","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427236772,"created_utc":1427233172}

Obviously my reddit comments wouldn't be of the same objective language I would use when I write shift reports.

I know this isn't accurate science, but these are conditions that can produce(as far as I have been told by med. prof. staff) an augmented perception of the reality. 		I have yet to meet a person who claims to be Jesus Christ, but take that example: Acknowledge the feeling, question the actuality.

You are none of the above.*italics*		You are questioning my ethics in this, if you have worked in a profession like this you would know that the staff need a blowout amongst themselves every other while.	I can tell you that getting death treats and harassed from people who are seriously ill can strain the best of us. Even if its regularly or occasionally. "Debriefing" we like to call it, which basically goes like "this happened because N/A has this diagnosis". Sometimes, sadly it can't be connected to a diagnosis and could have something to do with behavior patterns. These debriefings would, taken out of context for an outsider seem highly unethical. But it never goes outside the staff room and helps us treat all patients equally and according to the treatment plant no matter how you feel towards that certain individual.

{"body":"Disclosure: The article is currently being hugged to death so I am only commenting on the headline and speculating a lot while peppering in personal experience.		I have a hard time understanding how something like this can happen. I've worked in a psych unit and, barring talk of aliens, I typically gave my patients the benefit of the doubt when it came to their alleged "delusions." Usually the people performing the evaluations before the patient even reached us were capable enough to determine when something that sounded crazy was actually true. You usually just have to call one of their family members and ask what's up. Man who said the FBI is after him? They were; they needed him to appear as a witness and he didn't want to. Woman who said she was a friend of Warren Buffet and Bill Gates? Yup; "friend" was a stretch but they were associates. Woman who said people were trying to steal her baby? Her English wasn't great and all she meant was that she was stressed about a custody hearing.		Thing is, generally these people had something else wrong with them. Their "delusion" was usually just falsely interpreted as such because of other genuine psychiatric/behavioral issues. It'd get cleared up fast when someone would ask "well, are they telling the truth?" but it usually wasn't enough to give them a clean bill of health (except that lady who didn't speak English. Many apologies were given, but she was only there for 2 hours not 8 days.)		So if the woman in this article was stating that the president followed her on Twitter, but doing so in a way that she thought conveyed some level of authority or that her and the president were tight? That's still kind of evidence that she isn't quite right.		I saw another comment that she had to admit the president didn't follow her on Twitter though. That's not gonna help anyone.

{"body":"Ok, so you're a moron; at first I thought you just failed to read my comment. Let me spell it out for you. It's not about whether he has a twitter account or not, that's totally immaterial. Why would that matter _at all_ when we can already verify that he doesn't follow her, Twitter account or no Twitter account? Because we're talking about _plausibility_. Is she _crazy_ for being mistaken in her belief that he was following her. Well, let's think this through. He could not have a twitter account and yet it would take him all of 20 extra seconds to sign up and start following someone than if he already had one. The sentence which I refer to as being nonsensical is being used as if it affects the _plausibility_ of him following someone on Twitter. Saying he doesn't have a twitter account is effectively no different than saying that he doesn't follow anyone, but since the topic is whether or not it's _plausible_ for him to have followed _this particular woman_, the fact of him not following anyone is no more meaningful than the plain fact that he doesn't follow _this particular woman_, which has already been established. So the sentence "Obama couldn't follow Brock on Twitter for the simple fact that Obama doesn't use Twitter" is just a convoluted tautology, it says nothing more about the plausibility in question than the already established fact that he simply isn't following her. It's like saying "it couldn't have been me running for the simple fact that I don't run". Saying you don't run has no bearing on the possibility of you running, and so has no bearing on the plausibility of you having run. If you replace _don't_ with _can't_ then it makes sense.

The fact that you seem incapable of grasping this, and that you feel the need to continue to reiterate a fact I acknowledged ages ago doesn't bode well for any further understanding on your part.			>Yes it's POSSIBLE he might get a twitter account in the future and its PLAUSIBLE he COULD follow this woman at some point in the future but that has NO relevance to the here and now		Wrong! It's the only thing that _is_ relevant here. I don't give a shit if Obama has a Twitter account or not, for fucks sake. Nothing could be _less_ relevant than his actual Twitter status. The difference between being wrong by happenstance and being horribly, fundamentally, irrevocably wrong even just in principle is the difference between what can be used as an indicator of **psychosis** and what cannot. The whole fucking point of this stupid article is that her freedom was made contingent on her admission that Obama wasn't following her on Twitter, without anyone actually checking to see if he was. So clearly their assumption was that it was _implausible_. Therefore the point of contention, obviously, is that _HE COULD HAVE BEEN_. That's what makes the whole thing fundamentally different from if she were claiming to be a pink unicorn. GET IT?! Or are you going to tell me again that Obama doesn't have a twitter account?			>FYI tautology is saying the same thing twice in the same sentence. "couldn't follow on twitter" isn't the same as "doesn't use twitter".		Actually, in common language a tautology is saying the same thing twice _in different words_. "couldn't follow on twitter" isn't a thing. Merely not having a Twitter account is no more an obstacle to following someone than simply not having followed them already, since anyone can sign up at any time in less than a minute using the same device they would use to follow someone. And following people is pretty much the point of having a twitter account at all. So the sentence is _no more meaningful_ than the tautology "he couldn't follow her because he doesn't follow her", which isn't exactly a tautology in meaning unless "couldn't" doesn't actually represent an obstacle, which it doesn't. "couldn't" in this instance just means "doesn't".","depth":7,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hOprah_Winfree-carr","name":"t1_cpr46ew","parent_id":"t1_cpqonyf","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1427352054,"created_utc":1427348454}
