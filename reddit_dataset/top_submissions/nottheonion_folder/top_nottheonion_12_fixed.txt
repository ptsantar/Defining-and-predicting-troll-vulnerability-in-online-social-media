{"body":"In Australia, most of the Baby Boomers have gotten into negative meth'ing for investment purposes. Over the years, this has greatly increased the overall production costs. Linking this with overseas investors,  there is little room for new cooks or lab runner families; children are frequently working in numerous labs as they grow up and can't really call their lab their home. It tends to push the less wealthy and more sober population to the outer suburbs to keep up with the flow, not to mention leased labs are comparable to a full purchase price. These days, the middle class and media are clamouring to the local governments to act and reign in the profit-driven market. The federal treasurer most recently recommended to grant the public access to their superannuation funds, as long as it would be used to set up or buy new labs. Many have frowned on this motion, however as it would inevitably drive up the meth production costs. Some also suspect the Treasurer has ties to large-scale dealer families, or that he is even a pure consumer instead.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ovidsec","name":"t1_cpekxxq","parent_id":"t1_cpdst1u","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1426336664,"created_utc":1426333064}
