{"body":"They've calmed down on Obama, but mainly because they know they can't really do anything to him anymore.  For the last year or so Fox News and talk radio has focused their attention on smearing Clinton.  One invented scandal after another, successfully lowering her approval rating among Republican's from 29% to around 7%.  		It is probably the most annoying tactic employed by Republican media, because they did the same exact things to Obama.  Instead of talking about policy, or even pretending to try to make the country better they focus on high school drama and theories that /r/conspiracy would laugh it.  		That sad thing is that the attacks against the top Democratic challengers are completely transparent to those outside the echo chamber, or simply ignored.  Hell, most of /r/politics probably neither knows or cares about the imaginary email scandal they've started up.  		The goal isn't to convince anyone but the crazies (who honestly will believe anything).  Instead, they want to build up enough negative whispers that they drown out other discussion, particularly for casual voters.  It is a sick, un-Democratic abuse of the press that IMHO should be a punishable felony for the way it hampers any attempt for sanity in our political system.  		Sorry for ranting, but I listen to a fair amount of conservative talk radio (zero independent or liberal news sources for hundreds of miles) to get an understanding of current political events and the stuff I hear everyday is absolutely mind-blowing. 		It is sad that the party of Nixon, Teddy, and Lincoln has moved so far to the right.  Where have the progressive Republicans gone, the ones most capable of taking combined a conservative viewpoint (looking back in time) and a progressive viewpoint (looking forward) to actually fix the countries issues?  		We've replaced a sane political party that used to have an actual plan for the country's future with a party whose main tenets are:		* Americana - "The greatest country in the world," a cult of tradition.	* Action for Action's Sake - See 9/11.  We needed to invade the Middle East, not because it was right because we needed to do something. 	* Disagreement is treason - NSA.  Don't like government spying?  Obviously you aren't American enough.  	* Fear of difference - Those black people are just broken, they just love to riot and destroy (is it all a libruh plot?).  Gays want to attack family values.  Muslims are in your neighborhood, planning to take over the world.	* Appeal to frustrated middle class workers - It isn't the corporations fault you take home less each year!  Blame these greedy, grubby poor people that take all your taxes (and those are minorities, because white people are never poor).  	* Obsession with plots - Obama plotted to secretly hide his birth nation.  Clinton is plotting to cover up her international funds.  Muslims are plotting to take over the US and instill Shariah law.  	* Pacificism is treason - Don't like a police state?  You obviously aren't American.  Don't like international intervention?  You just want the Muslims to win.  	* Contempt for the weak - The poor are poor because they are worse.  They obviously aren't poor because they grew up in a poor neighborhood, they are poor because they are morally bankrupt, even evil.	* Selective Populism - They speak for the "people," especially targeting the government.  The government IS the problem you see, and the democratically elected government doesn't represent the interests of the "real" people like the Tea Party.	* Newspeak - They redefine words all the time.  Hillary Clinton answers accusations?  She's running a "smear campaign," even though the Republicans are the ones doing the smearing.  The Patriot Act, the Clean Water proposal, the clear skies initiative, etc.  	* Non-truths & Lying/Spread of Propaganda - Constant smear campaigns against the top democrats, 99% of which are blatant lies or propaganda. 		I mention these points because they read as a very literal list of fascist ideology, taken from 11 of 14  points used by Umberto Eco in his 1995 essay "Eternal Fascism."  Every time I hear a conservative radio host push "populist" candidates like Scott Walker while pushing the need to "take back our country" I'm reminded of Robert Griffin's description:		>[F]ascism is best defined as a revolutionary form of nationalism, one that sets out to be a political, social and ethical revolution, welding the ???people??? into a dynamic national community under new elites infused with heroic values. The core myth that inspires this project is that only a populist, trans-class movement of purifying, cathartic national rebirth (palingenesis) can stem the tide of decadence		Any, sorry for ranting but I guess I went off on a tangent.  I see attacks against Clinton every day by people that are nationally considered more sane than guys like Glenn Beck, and I feel most Redditors should listen to conservative talk radio just to get an idea of how far the Republican party has gone in just the past few years.","depth":3,"score":46,"ups":46,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ManBearScientist","name":"t1_cr28cxl","parent_id":"t1_cr2216i","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431063027,"created_utc":1431059427}

{"body":"Several reasons.		1.  Conservative media is simply FAR more dominant.  Fox News has the top five cable news programs, and has triple the number of viewers of the next best liberal channels (CNN, MSNBC).  Just the top 10 conservative talk radio channels reach 80 million people, and there are hundreds of smaller channels with virtually no liberal equivalent.

Republicans do it [more persistently](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2011/02/selection_bias_politifact_rate.php) with far more strategy.   ]		In simple terms, here is a list of a few conservative conspiracies involving just Hillary Clinton; there is no Democratic equivalent for any Republican candidate:		* From Fox News correspondent Monica Crowley:  Clinton faked the flu and a concession to avoid testifying to Congress about Benghazi in 2012.	* From Glenn Beck:  Same thing, but faking a blood clot instead.	* From Karl Rove:  Glenn Beck's blood clot was real, and caused serious brain damage that should prevent Clinton from taking office.	* Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind), Reed Irvine, Anne Coulter:  White House Chief of Staff Vince Foster didn't commit suicide, he was murdered by the Clintons because he had an affair with Hillary.	* Various:  Congressmen Ron Brown and 34 others were killed in a plane crash sabotaged by the Clintons to prevent them from talking about selling seats on trade missions.	* Rush Limbaugh and others:  Whitewater partner James McDougal's death in prison was the result of Clinton henchmen	* Former aide Kathleen Willey:  Clinton killed her cats after a suspicious jogger told her to watch what she said.	* Edward Klein:  Hillary was/is a lesbian, married Clinton as a sham and continues to has an affair with a classmate.	* Former Clinton mistress Jennifer Flowers:  Bill confided that Clinton was bisexual and "had eaten more pussy than he had."	* Robert Morrow, web conspiracy guy:  Associate attorney general Webb Hubbell was Chelsea Clinton's father, and Vince Foster was killed because he knew.	* Edward Klein again:  Chelsea was actually conceived when Bill raped Hillary during a vacation to Bermuda	* David Brock:  Hillary helped Bill use Arkansas state troopers to set-up sexual liasons with hundreds of women.	* Robert McIntosh:  Hillary covered up the fact that Bill fathered a black son with a prostitute after a luring her into a cocaine-fueled orgy.	* Gary Aldrich:  Hillary decorated the White House tree with condoms, cock rings, and statues with erect penises.	* Southern Evangelical seminary President Richard Land:  Hillary is a "sexual pagan."	* Reverend Jerry Falwell:  Hillary covered up a massive drug-smuggling operation in Mena, Arkansas while Bill was governor.  	* Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Calif):  17yo Danny Ives and Don Henry were brutally murdered after seeing a Clinton-assisted drug drop, not hit by a train.	* Rush Limbaugh:  Reporter LJ Davis was roughed up by Clinton goons after asking too many questions, not unconscious from having a few too many drinks.	* Richard Poe:  Hillary has her own secret police force positioned around the CIA, FBA, etc.	* Virginia Congressional Candidate Barbara Comstock:  Hillary set up a system of kickbacks for an Arkansas airline helmed by a childhood friend of Bill's.	* Samuel Blumenfield:  Hillary Clinton is part of a Marxist plot to take over the country, inspired by Antonio Gramsci. Largely because of her healthcare plan.	* Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah):  Classified FBI files were requested and misused by Hillary to target her enemies.  Craig Livingston took the fall when Republicans caught wind.	* Peter Paul:  Hillary forced Paul to spend 2 years in a Brazilian prison for filing a lawsuit against them for illegal campaign finance dealings.	* Fox News contributor K.T. McFarland:  Hillary used helicopters to keep McFarland's home under surveillance while he was running for Senate.	* Richard Poe again:  Clinton set up Rush Limbaugh's 2006 drug bust.	* Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Bachmann:  Hillary and aide/lover Huma Abedin are in cahoots with the Musim Brotherhood and plot to bring Shariah Law to the US.	* Larry Klayman:  Hillary has Islamofascist sympathies because of a bribe from Iran.	* Kamal Saleem:  Hillary worked with Muslims to shut down churches before she left office.	* Alexander Cockburn:  Hillary worked a law firm in the 1970s that funneled money to Contra.	* Poe again:  Clinton got off on all her crimes because the man investigating her was a Clinton crony himself.	* Former Clinton aide Dick Morris:  Hillary pushed for a UN takeover of the internet paid by a secret tax on American billionaires.	* Rush Limbaugh:  Hillary hired a mentally ill women to throw a shoe at her while she gave a speech.	* Montana Republican congressional candidate Ryan Zinke:  Hillary is a tool of the Dark Lord Lucifer sent to oppose Jesus Christ in the Last Days.	* Fox News host Howie Kurtz, along with Michael Goldfarb and Andrew Ross Sorkin:  Chelsea Clinton was forced to become pregnant by Hillary, believing it will make her more popular to have grandkids	* Lynne Cheney, children's author:  Clinton arranged for Monica Lewinsky's essay to be published two and a half years before the 2016 election so that people would forget it.  		Democrats may occasionally lie or cheat, but they don't create endless strings of conspiracies about top Republican candidates.  A lot of these are created by crazed attention seekers, but look how many come straight from the top of Republican media, or even elected officials.  There is no Democratic equivalent; you don't see Paul Krugman, Jon Stewart, or Rachel Maddow warning their viewers of massive, institutional conspiracies.		The key point is that conservative conspiracies are **mainstream**.  The official conservative stance on several issues is **it is a conspiracy,** namely global warming but also including issues like planned parenthood.  The mainstream way to attack non-conservative news?  Liberal conspiracy.  The mainstream way to attack liberal candidates?  Conspiracy.  US Military in Texas?  Conspiracy.

As people notice divisiveness and gridlock in Washington, those people might also turn away from the GOP because the GOP refuses to compromise.

That's ironic considering how you're completely ignoring simple sentences that I've said over and over and over again.		***THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE CRITICIZING IS ONE THAT I NEVER MADE***		I have told you this again, and again, and again, and you just refuse to acknowledge it. Your "100% a fallacy" is a strawman - it does not exist. You misread my comment, I explained it further, you ignored me, I explained it again, you ignored me, etc. 		At this point I think you're just hallucinating.		Regarding bias: if every article on the site is biased except that one (and every single article I read on there had some conservative bias in it) then it's just basic, grade school logic that there is a POSSIBILITY (you'd better google that word just to make sure you understand it) that the author MIGHT POSSIBLY be biased. I never at any time claimed that the author is biased. Not even once. And yet you base your entire argument on that claim, no matter how many times I tell you that you made it up.		Regarding the GOP and compromise: you say that if COLA is the best policy then it's not a compromise. That's just revisionist. The GOP has been refusing to budge on the issue. If they change their tune due to figuring out that it's the best policy, then that's a compromise from the point of view of EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED. Just like colours don't stop existing when a colourblind guy walks into the room.		That's why compromise is important to whether COLA is the best policy for the GOP.		>all you are saying here is that you (and America) dislike GOP policies so they should surrender in order to win		No, I'm saying COMPROMISE.

{"body":"Look I haven't studied economics, nor do I plan to. But I am sick of what this system has allowed to go down. And it's not about what can happen, but what NEEDS to happen. There are tons of smart people in this country. If we really worked to find away to take ever dollar form those assholes, while giving incentives for people to invest, we could do it. On top of that we bailed out the banks and gave those who fucked us bonuses, while letting the middle and bottom class suffer in the rubble of the destruction left in the wake. The true reality of why the world is so insanely fucked up, is that, we have at some point allowed money to be considered and accepted as more valuable than life. It is the corner stone of modern day depravity and immortality. It is why 40%(not absolutely sure this is the right amount but I think it is right) of the food sold in the U.S. Goes bad while people starve all over the world. Cuz it is about profits. It is why the healthcare industry was seeing people in loss gain ratios rather then humans with thoughts, feeling, and ACTUALLY   Fucking lives. Cuz there was more money to be made that way. And the most fucked up thing about it all is, it is by very fact a completely imaginary concept that we have used to give justifaction to all of this fucking evil. Money is nothing more then what we make it to be. And right now we are making it to be the literal standard of judgement of how much value a person has.... And I'll leave on this, if humanity keeps in such a path it will only lead to the absolute destruction of human life as we know it. So maybe it seems like a hard idea to really get implemented, but at the end of the day it's not cuz it is what should happen.

They won't be given this loan because no one in their right mind would trust a new investor with that kind of money, so investment grinds to a trickle. This means gdp plummets, which means America becomes a lot poorer in respect to the world's leading nations.
