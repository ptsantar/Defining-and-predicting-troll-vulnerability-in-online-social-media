That's why it's *qualified* immunity.			http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity		Qualified immunity is necessary for government to function. You have to give officials *some* protection from being sued for violating people's rights, because every single person who gets arrested wants to sue the cops. Obviously the cops have to be able to physically grab people and throw them in a cage without being liable the way just some normal guy would be liable if they did that. 		It wouldn't cover perjury because that has nothing to do with the rights of the guy who was arrested. Perjury is fucking perjury.

{"body":"The difference is that qualified immunity (normally) protects *individuals*, not institutions (like the TSA or police departments).  Police departments and certain government organizations *do* have qualified immunity for certain things but they're usually backed up with automatic compensation.  For example, you can't sue the police department for knocking down your fence while a suspect was being pursued *but* there's *usually* a program (or laws/rules) in place that allow people to file for compensation for such things and the police department will usually just pay for a new fence without much fuss (unless they think it is unreasonable in which case you *can* start a lawsuit to appeal such decisions).		Note:  I say "usually a program" because it varies on a state-by-state basis and each city can have different systems for filing claims.		I am not a lawyer but I don't see how this guy could win in court against the police since they were just acting upon the testimony of the TSA.  So unless he was mistreated while in the custody of the police I don't think that kind of lawsuit would go anywhere.		He most certainly has a case against the TSA.  An *easy* case since the TSA agent was caught lying under oath.  So even though you usually can't sue for merely being arrested (especially if no charges were filed) in this situation this guy most certainly *can*:  He was arrested under what appears to be *intentionally false* pretenses.		So basically the TSA's lawyers will probably sit down with this guy's lawyer and say, "OK, what do you want?" and they'll just write the check unless it's extreme.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"riskable","name":"t1_coc0wft","parent_id":"t1_coby9gk","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423147770,"created_utc":1423147770}

{"body":"While I'm deeply troubled by the TSA supervisor's actions, I have to correct you [Sorry :(]		Evidence of perjury was not "presented to the court" because the matter before the court was the State charging Vanderklok with a crime.  Even if the defense showed the video to impeach the TSA employee, convicting that employee of perjury would be the subject of another, separate matter before the court.  Charges would be filed, a new case number would be assigned, he would be entitled to counsel, etc.		Importantly, the article states: 	>At trial, Kieser was the first and only witness to testify. 		Since he testified, his statements would be under oath and penalty of perjury.  Therefore, the trial court can't be said to have been trying to make it easy on the TSA.  If that was their motive, the charges would've been dismissed before a witness was called, and the TSA employee would never have gotten on the stand to create a perjury issue in the first place.  		As it is now, the TSA employee has opened himself up to perjury charges.  As others ITT have pointed out, perjury requires intent.  While proving intent is difficult, I have to agree with  /u/grundlesmoocher that the case is pretty clear.  There's such a big disparity between the testimony and the video - granted, according to the article - that the difficulty will be *avoiding* a conviction for perjury, should the DA/SAO file charges (which I hope they do).		[Edit]		Now that I re-read your post, by 'presented to the court' you could very reasonably have just meant 'brought up' in the colloquial sense.  In which case, forget my first paragraph and please accept my apologies :).  I interpreted it in light of the second sentence, implying evasion, but you could have meant it on its own and stated things appropriately.","depth":3,"score":62,"ups":62,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"arjuous","name":"t1_cobfqn5","parent_id":"t1_cobam3e","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423092678,"created_utc":1423092678}

I think it is a fairly conservative statement to say that the government is not on the swift side of prosecuting itself.  Such prosecutions - most would admit - can often be politically and opportunistically motivated, even where elected officials are not directly involved in the decision.		Given that, I'd say low; absent a public outcry.  Everyone hates the TSA.  A trial ostensibly about the TSA, with such a combustible set of facts, has the potential to sink the agency (marathon runner detained and harassed for hours for having a power bar, government official then lies under oath to attack him further; it's pitch-fork inducing).  I could be wrong.  They could file charges. I hope they do and prove me wrong.  It might go without saying, but there's a very strong public policy interest in prosecuting agents of the government who lie under oath, especially where fundamental rights are involved (i.e., right to travel, right to due process).  In lieu of them filing, I think a likely scenario might be the charging agency leaks that it is "considering" filing charges, the employee is then publicly fired, and the charges are later dropped.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"arjuous","name":"t1_cobpw4y","parent_id":"t1_cobnerb","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423110834,"created_utc":1423110834}

What you would need is something like a recorded conversation, maybe if we had a recording of the TSA agent talking to another saying: "In order to get this guy in trouble, I am going to claim that he made threats." You might also be able to find an e-mail or something, that also shows a plan to perjure.

But the reality is that, based on my experience listening to an attorney who worked for the AG, we would need more evidence for a conviction. Otherwise no self-respecting DA will try the case. 		Here is a good example of when an officer is convicted of perjury:		The trial ended abruptly when a defense attorney produced the video that showed the drug search took more than 20 minutes and that it was Ortiz who discovered the black key box stuffed with cocaine.		**"Be creative in your writing," one officer tells another.**		**"Oh yeah, don't worry, sin duda [no doubt]."**		Officers laugh and then someone else says, "Come on, this is a man who put a case on somebody who has no dope. And he's doing time ??? two years."		In that case they had evidence that there was intention to commit perjury on the part of the officers.

I invite anyone to show some case law where someone was convicted of perjury that would be similar to this TSA case.

She signed out a warrant on me. I was arrested and name in the paper. Stay in jail for a week having severe mental trauma because first they wouldn't give me my medication for depression I was on and sticking me into a big open room with other violent offenders. Lost my job. Could only get a public defender they shuffled me around to different ones until the court day. They say I should just plea guilty. I ask if they got her medical records and they said they aren't needing those yet. She shows the pictures. Judge sends it to grand jury because I wouldn't budge on making a deal.

The police deparment wouldn't let me file a report because it would be considered retaliation or something.

{"body":"Roughly speaking, it's because these groups incorporate and thus the individuals can't be sued, only the entity that employs them can be. I'll give an example of the alternative. A family member of mine works in government, directing a number of state properties. What this position really is is a buffer between the people who are his superiors and the people who would sue them. This department that he works in is not incorporated, and people in it can be sued personally for stuff that goes on in their work. 		So my family member gets emails from the higher ups to send letters to people who were injured in the parks (which he oversees, but isn't involved in the majority of the day to day operations of). Because he's the one who is officially handling and directing these issues, even if it's just to forward already written emails that his superiors write, under his name, he's the one who's liable to be sued. He could just not send the letters, but he'd just get fired. 		The end of this is that he personally knows several people who have been in the same position as him who have been personally sued for operations at the parks they've been directing. These people lost tens of thousands of dollars/go through hell, basically to protect the people who are higher than they are, who are ultimately in charge of the departments, whom the sort of planning and budgeting that would actually be relevant to injuries in parks is at the level of. 		I don't really have a solution to this system. He's trying to retire as soon as he can. I hope he doesnt get scapegoated before then. But his department makes a lot of money that the government uses to fund other activities. They don't put anywhere near what they make from the estates he manages back in to them, and statistically, there will be injuries/accidents, given the sheer number of people who go to these properties (in the hundreds of thousands to millions per year). I've heard the idea of linking injuries against police to police retirement funds. I think that's interesting, as it'd cause policing within their own ranks out of self interest.

So, knowing that people generally become aggravated with air travel, and some people become violent and say inflammatory things when they are aggravated, and knowing that a federal employee working airport security isn't likely to go out of his way to make something up, it's reasonable to conclude that his sworn statement is truthful and that probable cause exists for an arrest.

{"body":"Despite your perception, we hardly live in a police state. A police state has no method of accountability. The fact that you can sue this officer with no fear for your personal or political safety is the very definition of rule of law.		Edit: I'm going to explain myself a bit. The definition of a "police state" is pretty fluid, but it has a couple of generally accepted principles:		1. Government exercises totalitarian control, i.e. "over the social, economic, and political life of the people."		2. Suppression of conflict, especially through a police force (and especially through a secret police force)		To call the United States a police state is practically an insult to true police states (there are many levels of bad! A police state is pretty darned severe). We have freedoms that are guaranteed to, at the very least, citizens of our nation. These guarantees are, by and large, followed through on by the government.		Does the government exercise some totalitarian controls? Undoubtedly.		Do some people fear the government, especially police forces? Yes.		Does this translate into an appropriate use of the word 'police state?' No.		Abuses of authority are investigated and dealt with, both in courts and internally. Those types of controls are not present in police states. In fact, abuse is encouraged. It is the very reason for the police force in question to exist.  A police state is not something a government suddenly finds itself in - it is a state of operation that is intentional. Just to give a few examples: It is the government choosing to control social norms through protest suppression. Instead of allowing a rally in Washington, the organizers are captured and any attendees immediately dispersed. It is a government which exercises economic control by blackmailing or otherwise threatening influential business-people who may be a problem to their control. It is sentencing political dissidents to prison, for no reason other than being in the opposition party. It is a *systematic* and *purposeful* (on the part of the higher ups) form of abuse.		The government does not exercise control through a national policing force. The FBI, CIA, Secret Service etc all have very specific jurisdictions. Most people can go through their entire life without meeting a federal law enforcement official. Local police forces, despite following federal law, are not controlled by the federal government, or even through state government. A police state is one in which totalitarian control is exercised through a national police force, secret or otherwise. The very structure of our government predicates that these different law enforcement groups are not controlled uniformly, and are indeed often in conflict with one another.		Is our system perfect, or even subjectively good? Definitely not perfect. Probably not good. But a "police state" has plenty of additional baggage that our country does absolutely not have. Police states are dictatorships. Failed states. Those without freedoms which we all enjoy. You are belittling the struggles of those citizens by comparing our situation, as bad as it is and as much improvement as there should be, to theirs. Mass data collection, for example, is one *element* of what a police state would do; that does not, however, mean we live in one.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IdBangSouthparkSatan","name":"t1_cob7mwc","parent_id":"t1_cob4dag","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423079820,"created_utc":1423079820}

Of course, in this country (United States) you are guilty until proven innocent, so since he's a cop and I'm a drunk, he wins automatically. I have ZERO chance of proving otherwise.		In fact, I didn't even know why I was in jail until after my paperwork was complete. I didn't even realize it was a DUI until I was already in a cell.

{"body":">How did the judge dismiss all the charges against him before the defense lawyer even has a chance to ask a question?		The state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the acts he is charged with. Therefore, the state presents their case first, and has to at least produce what is called "prima facie" evidence that the defendant is guilty. That means if we look at the evidence presented in a light most favorable to the state, they will have met their burden of proof. Then the defense can present their case.		If the judge looks at the evidence produced by the state and determines that it doesn't rise to that minimum level of proof, they can then end the trial and enter a verdict of acquittal in favor of the defendant. Usually this is in response to a motion by the defense attorney.		Here, the state produced the TSA agent's testimony as their only evidence a crime was committed. The judge likely considered that testimony insufficient to even make a prima facie case that the defendant was guilty, and as such entered a verdict of not guilty and ended the trial. It's a bit unusual to do so without the defense requesting it, but is within the judge's power.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"maestro876","name":"t1_cobchdt","parent_id":"t1_cob7vtl","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423087247,"created_utc":1423087247}

{"body":"Not really. A grand jury, if it happens at all, takes place much earlier in the process, after arrest and arraignment but before trial. The purpose is to determine if there is sufficient probable cause to bring the defendant to trial. Probable cause is a much lower burden of proof than is required for a conviction. Most states don't require a grand jury, and most prosecutors prefer to use a preliminary hearing.		The burden of proof at trial to obtain a conviction is "beyond a reasonable doubt", and it is the highest burden required in american jurisprudence. It does not mean all doubt, but any reasonable doubt. The prosecution is required to produce evidence during their case to meet their burden, while the defense isn't actually required to do anything. After the state is finished, the defense can simply stand up, assert that the state has failed to meet their burden, and request a directed verdict. If the judge agrees, it is within his power to do so. Usually the state won't go to trial unless they can at least meet their minimum burden, so it's pretty rare to see directed verdicts.		Here, the TSA agent's testimony was so weak that it seems like the judge didn't even wait for the defense, but on his own initiative determined that the state failed to meet their burden and entered a directed verdict.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"maestro876","name":"t1_cobfj5j","parent_id":"t1_cobezk9","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423092321,"created_utc":1423092321}
