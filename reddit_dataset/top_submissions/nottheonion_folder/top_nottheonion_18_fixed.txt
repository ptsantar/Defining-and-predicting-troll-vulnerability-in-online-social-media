{"body":"Again, changes a lot depending on specific species. Best way to approximate age is to.  But if you're in a watery area and see one looking at you, you can make a rough guess. I know there's a way to get a more accurate reading of their age by measuring the rings of their.... teeth? Something like that, I don't remember. 			They also grow a lot slower after a certain point. So the first few years they grow a foot per year, and then it will be a little less, and then a little less, and then maybe it grows a foot in 3 years and keeps slowing down, etc. Most wild crocodiles (except in areas with little human contact) won't live to be very old at all. So it's good for guessing the wild ones. But if you're looking at one in captivity, it may be something like 80 years old but only 30 feet long. Again, depending on the specific species and gender of the croc and available food sources throughout its life. 		I feel like my explanation is suffering from me being shitty at explaining shit. Here's a better version:		>"Compared with many other animals, crocodilians grow rapidly. Many species increase in length at least 20 to 30 times from hatchlings, and increase in weight by at least 1,000 times within 10 to 20 years. However, growth rate varies significantly between species, and also between individuals of each species. Key factors including temperature, frequency of feeding, quality of food and even social factors can result in major differences in growth rates and hence maximum size. Poor growth rates can often indicate problems with husbandry, but it is not so simple. Even a group of individuals kept in identical conditions will exhibit a certain degree of variation. 		>Despite this variation, all crocodilians show a fairly typical growth pattern: initial growth rates are rapid, often for several years, but slowly begin to decline as the animal matures. It takes many years for growth to cease entirely and many larger crocodilians appear to grow continuously over their lives, albeit very slowly in later life. 		>Larger species such as American alligators or saltwater crocodiles can initially grow at least a foot a year, and a few individuals can achieve sizes of nearly 4 feet after only 12 months. Smaller species usually grow more slowly. The following table is a very rough guide to growth rate in the spectacled caiman, Caiman crocodilus, assuming it is kept under normal conditions. Variation from these figures is not unusual.

Other crocodiles raised their heads in respect when he passes, and when National Geographic did their documentary on him he was actually filmed ~~killing a Hippo~~ intimidating an entire herd of Hippo's by himself (with claims made he has killed Hippo's in the past).
