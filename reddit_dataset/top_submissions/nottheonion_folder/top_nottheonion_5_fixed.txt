There's another guy below who is talking about these places being to expensive, however the times this situation comes to my mind (where an awesome restaurant I stumbled on was closed after lack of business) I never particularly found price to be the issue.

{"body":"Corruption is only a part of my feeling embarrassed to be an American, albeit a large part. I have no doubt things are worse in plenty of other places.  It is a result of everything that is going on around here, and around me. I grew up more or less apathetic, didn't vote or care about politics, before 9/11. For a while after that I was all gung-ho about my country, I had a little flag on my car, I waved at police if I saw them.		But today I live in a country where I've become almost afraid of police; I'm aware how many innocent citizens are killed by cops because it's all over the news. I'm aware that after voting for 'Obomba' in '08, largely because of his promises to do things differently than Bush, I am disgusted that he's only expanded the drone strikes targeting terrorists that actually kill hundreds of innocents including children. He's expanded government surveillance laws and capabilities to the point NSA directors have lied to Congress about blatantly breaking the law, only to be proven wrong later. 		But beyond the political world, I honestly feel our culture is in decline in a sense. All the shit I see on tv, the mindlessness people are being trained with (intentionally), the pop culture fads. The biggest news item for weeks has been one person's sex change. Nobody seems to care much about things that actually matter, they just want the newest fad fed to them, electronically, 24/7.

I enjoy discussions like this once in a while.		In some ways yes, things are better now, but I would say it depends somewhat on your perspective, and what aspect of society you're talking about.		Technologically speaking, we are obviously far more advanced now than ever, and there's no stopping that uphill train. America's practically the center of the universe in that regard (and others).		Culturally we're more diverse. Gay rights are expanding, we have a black president, the stars and bars are finally being phased out in the south, although that took yet another senseless massacre to finally be considered important. (I believe the goddamn confederate flag should be outlawed personally).		Life is easier in many ways. We take for granted now so many things like electricity, social services, and vaccines and medicine that enhance life. But government is far far too big today. There are so many laws and rules and restrictions imposed on almost every aspect of life it's become completely insane. I strongly believe religion is hugely responsible, and with time people will realize they don't need it, and how poisonous it actually is. 		On the other hand, as recently as a few decades ago it was unfathomable how far police powers have been expanded, under the guise of "national security". After 9/11, my father (who worked on Capitol Hill at the time) told me when he went to work every day there were police on every street corner with automatic weapons. Even today, I was there last month (on the Mall), and just while walking around the tidal basin I saw at least five different agency vehicles speeding around with sirens for whatever happened to be going on. I live 40 mins from DC so I see Marine One (a group of 3 helicopters) fly overhead whenever the president goes to Camp David. This morning, for whatever reason, I heard and saw at least 9 green helicopters that looked like gunships fly right over my house.

{"body":"If discrimination against women, minorities, and the mentally ill - characteristics people take everywhere they go and are immediately obvious - still takes place every day, then how much harder will it be to conclusively prove discrimination is taking place on something that is less obvious?		You're still assuming that it'll be blatant and obvious, but the fact is these things are *always* difficult to pin down and prove.  With secret voting, if things don't go the bosses way they may be furious but they can't fire everybody because they have no idea who voted for what.		The case you mentioned doesn't ring a bell to me, but I don't know how they knew they were "fake" votes as the ballots aren't tied to individuals.		But lets not forget the biggest point against public ballots:  the reason you feel they are preferable is because secret ballot is too easy to manipulate, this assumes that the government is corrupt and actively trying to (or is interested in) manipulating votes.  Your proposal is then to give this inherently corrupt, powerful group detailed information on who doesn't support them, not just individuals but which types of people aren't voting for them.		There is already a concern that some groups attempt to draw riding boundaries and set up transportation and voting in such a way as to marginalize people who tend to vote against them.  It's difficult to prove because it's very indirect and subtle.  Giving them this very detailed information won't make them any more obvious in their efforts, if anything it'll just allow them to target them more carefully and precisely.		Even though the ballots are secret, people generally know when they've been had, it's not as if people are voting in a vacuum.  As you say any fraud large enough to make a difference would get noticed, well it's no different with secret ballot. Do you really think people would fail to notice if the election swung completely for a hated party that they know had almost no support?  Making the ballots public wouldn't really give much new firepower to the voters but definitely *would* provide a lot of extra ammo to the government.","depth":13,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lemmox","name":"t1_csfvf2o","parent_id":"t1_csfv2a9","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1435070872,"created_utc":1435067272}

As a result, you find a large number of people in the far-left tail of the Gaussian distribution for all manner of oddities. Additionally, countries so old as China and India have a fair amount of cultural lag; where adopting new policies and changing past traditions takes time given 1) the expansive history that built those traditions, 2) the huge populations the government is trying to enforce, and 3) the offense taken that their traditions are inhuman stood against those of another country. 		I'm not advocating for any of the actions or traditions listed above, but at least consider the logic in each:		Beating cats and boiling them alive - tradition.		Girl run over - high populations lead to hive mentalities; ever seen a mob in action; people just stop caring.		Forcibly removing organs - overcrowded citizens in a country that traditionally would not opt for organ donation; needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.		Falun Gong - This is a threat to the current Chinese government. It's an independent organization that advocates spirituality in a tyrannically atheist country.		In no way do I support the Chinese government - they're terribly corrupt, but it is important to reflect on WHY a country and it's people behave a certain way. Simple knee-jerk reactions to singular stories doesn't help to nuance, change, or overhaul a given problem. I don't want to dive to far into anthropology and sympathetic magic and incentives, but there are ways to change traditional practices through substitutions:		Mock cats and dogs for instance, or state issued incentives for the rescue of injured individuals, or changing the rhetoric regarding voluntary post-mortem organ donation.		...that said, I'm scratching my head about how one might go about reversing the subjugation of a religious organization in an anti-religious country.","depth":5,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"xnoybis","name":"t1_csfrdti","parent_id":"t1_csfoyfb","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1435059516,"created_utc":1435055916}

{"body":">'excuse' is defined as to defend or justify'		Exactly, as you say and as I stated originally so we'd avoid arguing over definitions, an excuse is a (relevant moral) justification for an action. And given your definition, an excuse is distinct from an attempted justification. An attempted justification is not a justification.		>I understand that you implied 'that every set of possible options is encompassed in these two mutually exclusive sets.' which is why I called it a false dichotomy as every set of possible options where not included in those two sets.		They are, though. Any definition or interpretation falls into the two categories. I have at no stage disputed any interpretation of acceptability, nor made any positive claims towards what is and isn't sufficient for an excuse to be an excuse.		Either you meant that the explanation given was 'not good enough' to be an excuse, i.e. the second option of the dichotomy - again, this is for any kind of criteria for sufficiency/acceptibility - or you meant that it was a 'not good enough excuse', i.e. the first option.		If you meant the second option, which you imply you meant in the reply before last, then you have claimed that this is not an excuse. So subsequently claiming it's an excuse, is contradictory.		Think of it like this: if your definition of excuse is 'inadequate justification for X', then when you say 'this is not a good enough excuse for X' you're saying 'this is not good enough to be an inadequate justification for X'. In this specific case, you've done that, and then you've also said 'this is an inadequate justification ' afterwards. This is contradictory - you can't claim something is an insufficient justification, and also that it's insufficient to be an insufficient justification. I mean it's just semantics at this stage, but I guess in future it's useful to use logically coherent language for sake of clarity.","depth":17,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"googlyeyespy","name":"t1_csgy06z","parent_id":"t1_csgo2k5","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1435149498,"created_utc":1435145898}

Additionally, countries so old as China and India have a fair amount of cultural lag; where adopting new policies and changing past traditions takes time given 1) the expansive history that built those traditions, 2) the huge populations the government is trying to enforce, and 3) the offense taken that their traditions are inhuman stood against those of another country.			I'm not advocating for any of the actions or traditions listed above, but at least consider the logic in each:	Beating cats and boiling them alive - tradition.		Girl run over - high populations lead to hive mentalities; ever seen a mob in action; people just stop caring.	Forcibly removing organs - overcrowded citizens in a country that traditionally would not opt for organ donation; needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.		Falun Gong - This is a threat to the current Chinese government. It's an independent organization that advocates spirituality in a tyrannically atheist country.		In no way do I support the Chinese government - they're terribly corrupt, but it is important to reflect on WHY a country and it's people behave a certain way. Simple knee-jerk reactions to singular stories doesn't help to nuance, change, or overhaul a given problem. I don't want to dive to far into anthropology and sympathetic magic and incentives, but there are ways to change traditional practices through substitutions:		Mock cats and dogs for instance, or state issued incentives for the rescue of injured individuals, or changing the rhetoric regarding voluntary post-mortem organ donation.		...that said, I'm scratching my head about how one might go about reversing the subjugation of a religious organization in an anti-religious country.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"xnoybis","name":"t1_csfrnvg","parent_id":"t1_csfonk1","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1435060672,"created_utc":1435057072}

Of course there is the issue of popular vote not being perfectly aligned with electoral vote so you get things coming up like Bush the second being elected despite losing the popular vote.		My own greatest dismay is with the current campaign finance system. Money is gonna find a way to politics inevitably, but in many countries our 'free speech' is known technically as criminal bribery.

Crowd, reddit, whatever, it's paranoid to think Bernie's paying these people, especially when the article basically says they're the only company to do this, for only 1 major candidate, and it's likely Clinton or Jeb using them. Bernie has raised a minimal 10 mill from hundreds of thousands of people, 40 bucks at a time. These are the types of people that go to rallies when one comes to their city.   		Like I said elsewhere, Clinton's relaunch event last week; the press was kept separate from supporters. Seem weird?   		What OP *could* have said, was that IF Bernie turned out to be paying crowds, he THINKS reddit would ignore it. But he just said that Bernie uses them too. So who's making bias, unfounded claims?
