{"body":"Hmm... Okay, I think I understand your perspective.		Science lives on the best available evidence. And I can appreciate how at times that can be problematic. I don't think they made any claims on the show that weren't based directly on the best available evidence they had. But I also recognize the fallibility of current evidence, when we may still be lacking significant chunks of information about any given subject.		Some people laugh at the original Cosmos, presented by Carl Sagan in 1980. They got a lot wrong, at least in terms of our current understanding of the subjects covered. In 30 years, it wouldn't surprise me if we looked back on the current series and chucked about the things we knew they had gotten wrong.		But that said, science always has been and always is going to be about doing the best you can with the information you have. One thing that frustrates me more than just about anything else is that instead of having conversations about good science vs. bad science, we get relegated to having conversations about science vs. religion or science vs. politics, in part because it means bad science doesn't get the proper scrutiny that it should.		Overall, what I'd say is, while you have to continue questioning ideas presented, to outright assume most of the things presented by the show are false is wildly ignorant. Ideas will change over time, sure, but it's not as though they are making stab in the dark assumptions about the vast majority of the things they are talking about.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sosuhme","name":"t1_cnkj4mo","parent_id":"t1_cnkiuuw","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1420903855,"created_utc":1420903855}

{"body":"just to get things started, why don't you speculate on why every one of his "adventures" lasts exactly 7 days?		I will say that Les is a much better outdoor educator than Bear, but both are monitored and directed by their shows producers.		But off the top of my head here are a few of my grievances with SM:		...drink water directly from a jungle stream.   No boiling, no filter, he just stuck his head in and drank his fill. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. But then again, Les KNOWS he's going to get rescued at the end of his stay, right? 		...eat a wild mushroom in a field in the Canadian mountains.  This is a great way to DIE, and for what? A mushroom has almost ZERO calories or vitamins. They are 99% air and water. Most are poisonous. Mushrooms are NOT WORTH IT! Even if Les is an expert on mushrooms, he should have edited this scene out! Les was simply showing off for the camera. And he was doing so at the possible expense of the lives of any viewer who tries to imitate him.		...build what would otherwise be decent shelters, except that he stops piling on brush after a few inches of cover. Not enough to shield from rain or wind, never mind hold in any body heat. I think Les is worried about killing plants.		...wander into a jungle or forest to "find his way out" of places he entered by water. Gee Les, why not just follow the river or coastline back the way you came? Is it that it wouldn't make for good TV? It's fine to be entertaining, but not at the expense of giving bad advice.		...waste hours making the shittiest slingshot I've ever seen.  Why not emphasize simple hunting tools that actually work?  		...waste hours making the worst figure 4 trap I've ever seen only to forget to bait it. Was this an oversight? or just Les showing you how to make it. Regardless, wasting energy can be fatal.		...opine about not hurting plants and animals, gee really. its nice to hug trees and all but you will have to use your environment to support you.		There was also the big deal about him staying in a hotel at night while filming the lost at sea episodes. seems it went from having videos and pics of him but they are eluding me.		Bear is fake as shit, but gives SOME "ok" advice. mostly just fun to have a drinking game based on how many times he gets naked to jump into some frozen body of water or does something like swim through an underground river. bear isn't really giving good advice, he's just fun to watch and go WTF!! while watching Les i spend most of my time wondering why the fuck didn't he do this instead.		Les is a notch or two better than Bear, IMO, (a touch more validity to his situation and a touch better instruction???but drinking untreated water from a jungle stream come on)  but they are both TV program personalities that are marketed to two complete different demographics. The success of their program depends on the amount of viewers and for that alone they will do whatever needs doing to get consumers to watch.		Whenever money is involved truth and reality seem to be pushed to the side to make room for the anticipated truckloads of cash.		EDITED TO ADD: IMO, in neither show have they emphasized the rules of 3 enough, it always seems to be about building something elaborate, eating drinking something gross and then miraculously finding civilization at the end of the program. ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING about wilderness survival knows the rules:		3 seconds to get out of immediate danger	3 minutes without air	3 hours of exposure before exposure can harm you	3 days without water	3 weeks without food 	3 months before any possibility of rescue","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"knotafan","name":"t1_cnmgbm9","parent_id":"t1_cnkk7iw","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421070793,"created_utc":1421070793}

{"body":"Years ago there was a fishery quota where everyone started at the same time and fished until the quota was gone. If you filled the boat faster you got more money. Now each boat is guaranteed a quota and you can wait a few days to catch it. Fishing in bad weather is unneccessary. When I was crab fishing in 2000, we encountered 50 foot waves and hurricane winds mid season and the fishery was put on hold mid season for 24 hours, meaning nobody could fish during that time. Even when it was a real race to catch as much as you could nobody fished if 50 foot waves, it's ludicrous. Back then the season only lasted 5 days, because poorly enforced regulations devastated the fishery. These guys would be in such a hurry to fill the boat there would be piles of crushed and killed crab on the deck that they would shovel overboard because they were in such a rush to fill the boat they were sloppy and waste thousands of pounds of crab.

{"body":"I use to be the same way when I had cable. I would flip through History, Discovery, Nat Geo, etc for quality programing. I would watch ESPN for coverage of ALL sports highlights and light commentary. I would watch CartoonNetwork and ComedyCentral for a quick laugh. I would watch SciFi for a technology drama. I dumped cable when I realized that History, Discovery, TLC, A&E, and NatGeo had all become essentially the same channel showing shitty "reality" shows. ESPN had turned into "The View for men" with them only covering the 3 major sports and only for the 4 major cities (Boston, NY, Chicago, LA). CartoonNetwork got weird, ComedyCentral got not funny. SciFi turned into an abomination.		I remember I had been seriously contemplating cutting off cable for a few months because I was questioning why I was spending $1,500 a year on this dribble for. I remember the day I spent flipping through channels for a couple hours with literally nothing worth watching on.

They made "Houdini" and "Hatfields and McCoys" plus the two docudramas "The Men Who Built America" and "The World Wars". I appreciate the effort and I always watch these shows but they just don't compare to other programming. Period pieces like Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, Rome, or John Adams always blow History Channel's efforts out of the water in terms of production value and scale (not to mention entertainment value) and as for documentaries I would rather watch a straight documentary that is factually correct and engaging (like a Ken Burns documentary) rather than History Channel's docudramas which are cheesy and so unfactual they're hard to get through. I think channels like Discovery Channel and History Channel should just try to make educational material that is engaging, offers new perspectives not told before, and is factually correct.
