I once had a really strange dream, it was about a space-swapping device.

Everybody who could put together a computer could make one at little expense.  	Someone developed this Box with a display and a keyboard. He shared this idea on the internet, because he knew   it would be considered top-secret if he'd try to patent it.    	You put something into the box and enter an integer and it will swap all matter (and Space) with any another box which was tuned to the same "frequency", with very small delay and in a safe manner.

Space exploration could be a 9to5 job, Asteroid mining, distribution of goods, disposal of   hazardous material - no problem, send it to space, travel in general, you name it - you got it.  	Due to the quantum mechanics involved you could not intercept it, or jam it.   			A new era of limitless wealth consumption was on the horizon!  		But what could have been the biggest invention since fire actually managed to destroy society as we know it,	the changes came way to fast:    			The countless people employed in transportation and distribution became obsolete.    	The people who managed and build cars, planes were out of jobs. (people who build Forklifts were making hands   over fist, on the contrary)       	The value of land went into a slope, never to recover.  	And who needs hotels in this world anymore (but people who cheat in their spouse)?   	Taxation of goods and services was pretty was nearly impossible at this point.   	Shopping malls went bankrupt.     	Roads started to decay because nobody used them, and countless people working in construction weren't needed anymore.   	The sky was nearly empty because nobody used planes anymore, but for recreational purposes.

He can't decide for the ball where it goes, so it goes over the fence, bounces on the sidewalk, then on the roof of one the cars parked along the street. Chris is fast though. In his mind, almost like Ibrahimovic. Before the ball has even come to rest under the parked car on the other side of the street, he's out the gate, eyes locked on his ball. Run and get it before mom sees. 		Marcus Hansen also thinks Chris is fast. He has only seen him for half a second, but that's enough. He wasn't there a moment ago, but now he is. Almost late for work already, and the first thought that pops up in Marcus head is something like "I'm going to be very late today." And a deep regret. For what he is about to do, and for the fact that he was concerned with being late, not with killing a child.		Marcus' car doesn't think Chris is fast. It doesn't think at all. It registers Chris' speed, which is tiny, especially compared to the velocities it is used to registering. Not that being used to anything means anything to it. But it is a low speed. Not like Ibrahimovic at all, even if even the footballer's pace wouldn't impress the car either. It registers and then follows the only instinct it knows: it's programming. Braking. Evading four degrees to the left so the obstruction(motive, first-priority) isn't wedged between it and the cars lining the street. Sending an emergency braking-alert to other cars so they know what to do.		Chris doesn't see the car until a second after the car and it's passenger has seen him. He freezes in the middle of the street. His ball is still on the other side, resting between the street and a car door. He should have been quicker.		Marcus swears. It's not really words though. It's angry sounds that come out all weird when he's pushed into the loveless seat belt embrace by his car's braking. He drops his phone on the floor and it disappears under the seat.		The car already knows what will happen. It will come to a stop 1.2m from the obstruction (motive, stationary, first-priority), the car behind will come to a stop 8 meters behind it and the car behind that will stop 16m further away. They will all be standing still in 1.3 seconds.		They are all standing still. Chris looks at the car. "SAAB" it says on the grill. In the car is a man. He looks at Chris with a face like some kind of fish Chris has seen in a cartoon. All eyes and mouth. He looks scared and angry at the same time and Chris hopes the man isn't going to tell his mom.		Marcus swallows. It's the first time since he got the car that it had to do something like this. A flashing red button on the dashboard and a soft bell-like dinging from hidden speakers tell him the car has made a emergency evasion and will require a manual assessment and restart. Apparently not all emergency evasions require them, but the ones where the car thinks a human might be involved are. Marcus has to see for himself that no one got hurt, even though the car knows it didn't hit anything, before pressing the button and get going again.		Chris takes his ball and runs back to the front yard, behind the safety of the fence. The man in the car follows him with his eyes but he doesn't come out to yell at him.		Marcus presses the button. The car gets going and tells the other cars that everything is fine. Data and footage is logged, archived and also sent to both SAAB and the Traffic Network Agency so that they get to know what happened, what the car did and how it all turned out. Everything went as expected. It does that when machines are running the show.		Chris and Marcus won't recognise each other the next time they meet. The memories of this day will fade and eventually the only trace left will be a row in a table in the depths of a what will by then be an obsolete archive of early-AI traffic data.

{"body":"Let's see... most of these can be done with environmental settings.		> Robot that can mow lawn properly accounting for rocks.		IR (or las) mowers can already do this, though you do have to set it up to some degree.  If you, say, have a gravel driveway and kick new rocks into your grass, you can change the blade type and it'd work.  As far as obstacles such as children, why not just run it at night?  Lots of things can be detected/pushed/ignored, from time to time, and if it runs fairly regularly, it'll keep the grass short enough it's not a concern.  Most robotics, at this point, will fail without *some* human intervention, if we're talking about end-user sort of stuff...		> Take out the garbage, as well as clean up all the mess the garbage men threw all over the alley		Garbage being relocated to the curb is as easy as a scooter-type robot, and cleaning the mess up after sounds like poor packaging of said trash (which a compactor and similar could help fix), or something you could do with a pressure washer... easily viable.		> Clean my room/house/garage/backyard/maybe even the garden		Lots of cleaning robots, and can work if the space is well organized.  Garages/tools can be done this way, and drone "clean up" kits have had more than a few people working on them.  I saw a test drone at a hackspace a couple years ago, cleaning up RFID chipped wrenches.

Probably more viable than a room-cleaner.		> Do the laundry,		Got robots for that, too~		>  fold and put it all back		Willow Garage, if you hadn't heard of it, has done some work on a helper-bot that can do this (and a great many other minor tasks).  Might be worth some research.  There's a few products that do clothes folding, and sorting by color/shape might be viable for some people/households, but again, Image Processing isn't there yet, so unless you wanna chip your shirts (which would make this viable, from a tech standpoint)...		> complete with a clothes library so it knows who clothes is who's and puts them back in the right people's rooms.

See, this is the thing that I really wish I could help with... all of these things, done at home, would take about a year and a half of work/study, work 80+% of the time (current standard for a lot of home automation stuff), and cost maybe two grand, or so.

We are a very rare breed, and most people just can't believe we exist. 		https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/364lps/first_largescale_graphene_fabrication/crayppp		PS, I got banned for that post, best not to egg on the 9-5 working stiff mods		Just discovered they deleted hundreds of posts across like 5 of my many throwaways. Wow, very sad. Here's the posts, unedited:	In a nutshell, I started buying and selling real estate with 3 rich friends of mine. Mainly rental properties, smaller houses. As time passed we amassed a large inventory of properties that either had renters or we just couldn't/too lazy to sell. One of them was a larger welding shop that went bankrupt sadly. I sat down and decided I was done with real estate and wanted to try something else. So I renovated the welding shop into a 3 floor laboratory of sorts. 50ish random high end computers, all the tools, welding, metal working and forging area, 3 different 3d printing machines and several robot kit arms and whatnot for no reason. Then I sleuthed around the hallways of a high end tech college near me and prentended to be a student for a couple weeks. Met some neat people. One guy in particular was a guy with a 180 IQ living in his mom's basement, always talking about graphene this and that. Showed him my shiny secret useless lab, and we started playing with graphene. Fast forward 2 years, we have a functional replacement battery for a RC helicopter that has about 5 times the energy density of a similar LiPo battery. And a kind of cool side effect of our layering method is that most of these graphene batteries can recharge directly from sunlight if they are designed a certain way. Basically if your battery died in the middle of nowhere, youd put it on a rock in the sun for a few hours and you'd get a charge. Will admit, took 3 months just to make a shitty little battery that melted itself. Lots of research around needs to be done. We now have 4 college kids playing around with graphene in between doing homework and whatnot. Also since the whole place is on a VPN to italy, I tell them to pirate to their hearts content. Always the latest shows waiting for me when I login to the network. Anyways I wanted to give you a decent answer, but I'm a secretive guy and won't supply pictures, sorry.	Edit: Only -4? Comon reddit, you can do so much better	Edit: -17 is a little more acceptable, I can go to sleep now.	Edit 3: Who am I kidding, its reddit, there's no sleep. -42, wow. I have a couple reddit accounts that must be like -5000 or more. This post is almost worthy. Comon guys, lets get it to -100 at least.			And the OP replied with:	That sounds pretty cool. I'm hoping I can end up in an R&D shop like yours once I get all of my education paid for. I'm definitely a Jack of all trades, master of some (but better than a master of one). I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering, studying for a BS in Computer science, I have some Microsoft and CompTIA certs I got or my previous career before college, I plan on getting an MS in Robotics, and lastly I think I might try to get associates degrees in welding and machining, but those would be as much for the networking as it would be the degree. Holy run on sentences Batman! So yeah, that seems a lot crazier when written than it does in my head.	Anyway, I wish you the best of luck! Hopefully this all pans out.			And My reply was:	You are definately on the right track. Alot of the students I know are similar to yourself, with a long list of specialized interests and rooms full of half built robots and whatnot. But most of you have the same problem, is you are genius, but not in the ways of how the rich and corrupt think. Most of you end up trapped in crappy companies under poorly educated nepotized mangement, and become bitter and unhappy because they end up designing wheels when they could be designing jet engines. If nothing else, to get that godmode freedom you need to design and become amazing all revolves around money, and your ability to summon it. And out of all my business ventures, I learned the hard way. Real Estate. Almost any real estate in a city (except detroit). Keep this on your mind, forever. Its the easiest, fastest way, with the least work in the longrun.		 It saddens me that so many people are convinced that this has to be absolute bullshit. I could care less, infact I find it kind of humorous, because this happens all the time, even in real life. Even though I'm a millionaire and most of my friends, try telling someone in a tim hortons you built a tiny lab for yourself, eat pizza, play call of duty with a group of kids. They call bullshit as well. The ones who don't are the other people I've met exactly like me. I'm not the only person in my group of friends with a personal little play lab. I only really do this because my wife and kids are gone (car accident), and I have no friends that arn't in my pocketbook. I allow these new friends of mine to try anything their heart desires. Each of them went from depressed students, scared of their futures, to seizing the future. I showed them what mentality it takes to be successful, to win. And I made a bunch of friends in the process. I wish you much luck in life. And to the downvoters, all I have to say is: Buy real estate, but only honestly and ethically, so you don't end up stealing from others.		I seriously was hoping my posts would inspire people.

{"body":"> a decrease in personal car ownership (if you can't drive it why own it?)		I strongly disagree with this. Most people *like* owning their own things. They don't like communal stuff. There are *tons* of people out there (myself included) that could take public transportation but prefer not to. Why drive in a dirty bus or sit in a dirty taxi when I can have my own car which is much nicer? Why rent a small apartment when I can own my own large house with land? Why share things and risk them being damaged or dirtied when I can own my own stuff and keep it the way I like it?		When autonomous cars come out, people will want to own them. They will not want other people using their car, much like they don't now.		I really believe that most of the posts in threads like this are merely people trying to superimpose their personal wishes onto the future. Many of them are very vocal "urban planner" types who have always pushed for public transportation and communal use of property. But they've always been in the minority. The vast majority of the country has always disagreed with this philosophy and they will continue to do so. 		So no, autonomous cars will *not* bankrupt the insurance industry because the concept of insurance has remained the same- rates will reflect risk and providing insurance will still remain profitable. And no, car makers will *not* stop advertizing because people will want to purchase their own cars. And no, the aftermarket for car accessories will *not* vanish because people will still like to personalize their car.		TL:DR- You can't accurately predict the changes in the future if you don't understand people's desires or the effort they'll put in to satisfy these desires.

{"body":"> Yeah, for me at least I think these cars are probably pretty safe and they seem to be developing the technology very quickly and impressively.		Actually I think they are inherently LESS safe than people (at least ITT) think or believe -- and in no small part BECAUSE of the so called "uber-safe" mentality that goes into their design & how they behave/drive.		Take for example -- again -- this idea that the google car is NOT the "cause" of the accidents.		First of all that's a rather subjective claim -- drivers CAN in fact be the "cause" of an accident (or a series of accidents) without *technically* being in violation of any traffic laws.  Just as one (what ought to be fairly obvious) example -- some elderly "slow" human driver on an interstate, can easily create a "bottleneck" situation that inherently (i.e. needlessly) **causes** an accident around them via their driving behavior -- even though they are NOT necessarily in violation of any specific traffic laws; and they ARE in fact seen as a "problem" driver.		I think as I have noted -- there is a similar problem PATTERN that is becoming apparent in these "minor accidents" where Google **asserts** (or "claims") that it is not the "cause" (i.e. "at fault") -- especially given the VERY LOW SPEEDS (10 mph).  That practice -- driving at UNDER 10mph is in and of itself **a safety hazard** -- claiming (hiding behind the fact) that "no law has been violated" is really NOT germane (especially given that the laws are really set up based on HUMAN drivers and HUMAN tendencies, and emphatically not the specific foibles likely to result from an algorithm driven vehicle).		BTW I've worked with machinery, computers and programming, etc. my entire life -- and I find Google's position to be fatuous. Computers & computerized systems do not make the same KINDS of errors that humans do -- but that does not mean they are inherently "safe" or "error free" -- far from it, computers because they operate in a different fashion, based on different assumptions, make significantly DIFFERENT types of errors; ones that can often be at least if not far MORE problematic than the errors humans make.		Just as a banal example -- consider the manifold errors (yet different than human typos) that computers/smartphones make in terms of spelling/word "corrections" to text messages -- and as complex as language is, it is arguably a vastly simpler (several orders of magnitude simpler) and far less "dirty" (i.e. more amenable to algorithmic definition) task than driving.  Imagine "Ode to a Spellchecker" but in terms of a multiple thousand pound powered vehicle bashing itself around in your neighborhood -- Google's "assurances" just don't pass muster (especially given how non-transparent they are being about it).		**Edit: I just thought of another (IMO pertinent) example to illustrate the problem.** To wit, prior to in-vehicle-GPS (especially the modern/recent "turn left here" kind) the incidents of people blindly driving into some river, or a dozen other similar inanities -- were so rare as to be virtually unheard of, or at least the people who did, didn't blame "the map" - the assumption that the "system" knows what it is doing, and in essence turning the human drivers into a sort of *"mindless automaton"* is a good indication of the KINDS of (unanticipated) mistakes that these vehicles will make (i.e. NO ONE *predicted* that people would blindly/stupidly follow GPS instructions and drive straight into a lake, but they do it anyway; and that's not just "human stupidity" it's an "oops" inherent in the system design.)  Likewise there WILL be a host of other *unforeseen* problems that will happen with these automated vehicles -- and very likely they are things that will NOT show up in the (rather carefully constrained, heavily monitored) "test programs", not even the ones that are *ostensibly* being done in the "real world".		---		> But I don't understand why most this thread seem so willing to throw the journalists under the bus for showing any skepticism when they are not allowed to independently verify. 		In part it's because this is Reddit and the hivemind is VERY gullible to certain behavior patterns; especially around specific issues, and with certain well-loved companies (to wit, Google, Tesla, etc) -- and or likewise with popular "meme" issues (to wit there are "circle jerks" over any number of fad/fashionable things -- nor is that really anything new or unique, humans especially in mass/mob form have always engaged in such things... and then a short time later, switched to the opposite -- the ephemeral/flakiness of the "masses" is so well known that it's a cliche).		I also think in part it is because of the **specific** way this particular thread and linked article are portraying the issue: in a highly LEADING fashion. (Indeed I would say highly *misleading* fashion -- note that TITLE as phrased, contains 	several\*\*	 rather blatant lies just within the short phrase: "1 million miles with 0 accidents" -- and of course most of Reddit doesn't actually READ an article so much as reply to the title of a thread.)		It's rhetorical demagoguery at it's finest (or worst depending on your perspective).		I think one could just as easily craft a DIFFERENT article, with the opposite bias -- i.e. something like **"Self-driving cars involved in XX accidents in just XX,XXX miles, TWICE as many as the average human driver; but Google pressures/coerces police to collude in keeping details secret: What is Google hiding?"** -- and post it in a different subreddit (or even this one a month from now) ... and probably get an entirely different set of upvoted responses.		**And then of course there is also the thing we haven't mentioned.** Although you certainly "hinted" at it in your list: Google has a MASSIVE vested interest in this project (and in maintaining "goodwill" and "positive PR" around it, etc -- all in part not so much for NPV profit, but in terms of maintaining it's corporate "image" as being innovative, etc). I would not at all be surprised to find that they are (literally) employing both humans AND "bots" relative to online forums -- i.e. shill commenters, and/or scripts to "game" the perceptions. While that is "tinfoil hat" stuff, there is plenty of evidence that far stranger things have been done in the past (and Google is hardly some saint or "virgin" when it comes to corrupt manipulation of things).		\*\* I say "several" lies, because it isn't just the "zero accident" thing that is blatantly false; the "million miles" is a cumulative/aggregate total for the *research program* across a whole series of different iterations of vehicles: this is nothing like the track record of a specific configuration (not even in the gross sense of a "engineered" major-version configuration across multiple vehicles) that has done a million miles; and of course in terms of a "test program" it is far-removed from any industry standard of durability/reliability testing on a set of semi-final "pre-production" machines.  The plain truth of the matter is that probably no one major configuration/iteration has had more than 200,000 miles on it without some MAJOR "back to the drawing board" aspect.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Absinthe99","name":"t1_crd0788","parent_id":"t1_crcvmwu","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431966553,"created_utc":1431962953}

A subscription model would fix that. People in cities would opt for subscriptions where they don't have the same car each time as they'd still have very low average wait times, and reassignment of vehicles would allow companies to maintain fewer cars for the same number of people.		People in remote/rural areas might want to own though I agree.		> cost of renting one can be more expensive than owning it outright.		Unlikely once economies of scale kicks in - look at how hardware subscriptions for phones work.

This is a real issue that needs solving but it won't be a big issue. Most likely customers will be ranked on whether they are good or bad depending on their in-vehicle behaviour. Automated sanitary checks on cars will be a thing. The car companies just need to ensure that cars don't turn up looking or smelling dirty, and penalizing customers who have caused that. That can be automated even though its not simple.

There is not a single person working on self-driving car who would say this. Total batshit stupid comment. 		Somebody already posted this great, simple to understand write up so I will do it again:		http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530276/hidden-obstacles-for-googles-self-driving-cars/		The technology not only does not exist it is not even CLOSE to being able to exist. 		I will copy and paste what I already posted to somebody else to make it point-by-point clear for you:	 		The BEST self driving cars are	A) Only able to drive in areas that have been mapped in so much detail it would blow your mind. Many specialized cars have to drive thru the area and teams of Google people have to go thru and organize this map. An even subtle change in mapped out area and the car freezes.	So these self driving cars require a team of cars to map out the roads in insane detail. They need to get the location of each traffic light down to inches. THEN you need a few very smart tech guys go thru all this and make it useful so the car can actually drive in this area. Any change in the landscape and they have to go do it again.	Put the car in an area that is not mapped in this INSANE detail and it literally does not work. At all. It can't do shit.	Mapping the entire road system even weekly would require sensors everywhere and more computer power that exist on the entire planet.	So right off the bat these things are useless.	B) It can only drive on easy roads. Put it on difficult roads like ones with sharp turns and it can't do shit.	C) It can't drive in snow or rain. Even high wind pretty much shuts it down. Sensor technology is LONG way from that. A LONG WAY. There are ZERO sensors that can get past rain/snow/ice/wind.	D) It can't drive above 25 fucking miles an hour and the faster it goes the more it fucks up. It usually stays around 10 mph because at higher speed the thing falls apart.	E) It can't work in parking lots or garages or drive ways	F) It can't operate in even moderate traffic.	G) On intimate roads which require large amounts of overt and subtle visual cues---the car does not work. At all. Can't do shit.	H) Even driving at a snail's pace, in perfect weather, in the little 'zone' that has took many other cars and humans to map out in insane detail----it still fucks up and has to have a human correct it. They always leave that part out.	I) Put it on a bumpy road or a road with debris or construction and AGAIN the car pretty much falls apart.

Many specialized cars have to drive thru the area and teams of Google people have to go thru and organize this map. An even subtle change in mapped out area and the car freezes.	So these self driving cars require a team of cars to map out the roads in insane detail. They need to get the location of each traffic light down to inches.

Put the car in an area that is not mapped in this INSANE detail and it literally does not work. At all. It can't do shit.	Mapping the entire road system even weekly would require sensors everywhere and more computer power that exist on the entire planet.	So right off the bat these things are useless.	B) It can only drive on easy roads. Put it on difficult roads like ones with sharp turns and it can't do shit.	C) It can't drive in snow or rain. Even high wind pretty much shuts it down. Sensor technology is LONG way from that. A LONG WAY. There are ZERO sensors that can get past rain/snow/ice/wind. You are WAY over stating the improvements in this area. We are a longgggg way from being able to fix this huge problem	D) It can't drive above 25 fucking miles an hour and the faster it goes the more it fucks up. It usually stays around 10 mph because at higher speed the thing falls apart.	E) It can't work in parking lots or garages or drive ways	F) It can't operate in even moderate traffic.	G) On intimate roads which require large amounts of overt and subtle visual cues---the car does not work. At all. Can't do shit.	H) Even driving at a snail's pace, in perfect weather, in the little 'zone' that has took many other cars and humans to map out in insane detail----it still fucks up and has to have a human correct it.

People have spent almost 50 years and poured well over $100 billion into finding a vaccine for HIV yet nothing. Just because some smart people are working on self-driving cars it will magically work?

There are way more people, working way harder, for a lot longer, with a lot more money to find a HIV vaccine and an HIV vaccine is a fruit fly to Godzilla compared to a self-driving car ----yet we still can't slay the fruit fly.		Sorry but you are going to be very disappointed in the future. Self driving cars still have way more problems and honestly you keep making the solutions seem way simpler than they are and you sound like a moron. 		I mean 'There's teams and teams or researchers developing different solutions to these problems."	So the fuck what? A lot of smart people working on something does not mean results. A VAST majority of times science fails and fails badly. 		"Saying that it'll take that long to figure out how to adapt to rain and snow is needlessly pessimistic."		Telling somebody in 1969 that in 55 years we still could not go to Mars would seem batshit crazy to them too.

They would say in 25 years we went from airplanes that used huge, clunky combustion engines that could go a few hundred miles an hour TOPS to sending a manned craft traveling at just under 20000 fucking miles an hour to the moon, landed them on the surface, picked them back up and landed back. You mean in 55 years you idiots will make about 0.1% the progress we just made in 25??"		That is how it goes. Science and technology always hit plateaus. While the advancements in computing look great they are slowing down. We are reaching the physical limits of computers. It is a well established fact that is not up for debate. Dennard Scaling is dead. Clock Speed progress died around 2005. 	The true crux of 'computer power' is transistor density. We are near the limits of that. Limits set by the Laws of Physics which no matter how hard we try---we can't break. A few more generations of that and computer advancement hits an era or every increasing diminishing returns. This has already begun. The Laws of Physics always shit on everybody's parade. They did for nuclear energy, they did for flight, they did for space travel, they are now doing it to computers. 		Now add in the fact the current self-driving cars are basically expensive dignified RC cars that really LOOk cool to an uninformed person like yourself but in reality---are not very ground breaking at all.

These things really fucking suck. They are just expensive RC cars that can only operate in very simple, ideal, near perfect conditions at VERY low speeds and it can ONLY drive in areas that a team of humans with high tech mapping and sensor equipment has combed thru and EVEN WHEN this car gets to play in this little sandbox built for it---it still fucks up. 		The technology for cars to track the cars around it is very old. The ability for car mounted cameras to 'read' speed limit signs and traffic lights has taken over 25 years to get to THIS POINT (ie can only work in idea conditions, has to be mapped out beforehand, and just generally still does not work as well as a 5 year old still).		It is a over-hyped PR stunt that Google has yet to show it can do anything that is surprisingly. Honestly with the growth of sensors in the last 20 years it is amazing that even in the ideal conditions and super low speeds how much the car still sucks. 		>autonomous cars that I've interacted with are significantly more optimistic about the timeline than you are		As has ever single scientist working on a 'big project' in history.

Barrier for entry is much lower.		>HIV vaccine is a much simpler task		How in the world are you making that comparison? I don't have the background to say anything meaningful about the difficulty of creating an HIV vaccine, but it's certainly had more research and time put into it.		> It is a over-hyped PR stunt that Google has yet to show it can do anything that is surprising		While it's certainly overhyped, what they are _already_ doing is impressive from a robotics standpoint, as are the strides made by teams from Stanford, MIT, CMU, and others during the DARPA challenges in 2004-2007.

Why is a self-driving car any different?       	   	Because cell phones and computers generally can't kill you if they break down? There's a reason the automobile industry is very heavily regulated.    	   	>Things will change quickly as soon as the first generation is on the market       	   	No it won't, look at cell phones for instance:    	http://mobilephones.umwblogs.org/invention/     	   	The first real mobile phone arrived in *1973*, it took decades to perfect the technology and get widespread adoption, there were only ~[340,000](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0933563.html) cell phone users in the US 12 years later in 1985, and cell phones aren't anywhere near as difficult to do as cars and the advances on them would not have been possible if the cellular provides hadn't been subsidizing the purchase prices of the phones in exchange for carrier contracts with consumers.    	Automobile technology moves fairly slowly because it takes years and millions of units to recoup the initial manufacturing costs of new technology and meeting the government's standards. Google's little car is basically molded polypropylene and tubing, none of it is ready for mass production yet and the vehicles are built in situ and not on an assembly line. Here's a video:   	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqSDWoAhvLU   	You can clearly see the chassis is a welded structure of box and round tubing and plating, much the same as a [kit car](http://www.gt40s.com/forum/paddock/25444-amx-3-reproductions.html) or [race car](http://s1322.photobucket.com/user/David_Dusterberg/media/chassis2_zps9cb0b68f.jpg.html) and is impractical for large scale production, even with automation, because of the number of pieces and the complexity of the welded structure. This type of chassis is used for a few thousand cars a year tops, not the hundreds of thousands a year you need to get anywhere close to widespread adoption.     	Tesla's electric car is about the freshest thing out there right now, new manufacturer, new engineering, state of the art assembly line production facility, the whole package, and he's only looking at 100,000 a year by the end of this year and he's been losing millions of dollars every quarter.      	Cell phones had no competition, Ford alone makes over 300,000 trucks a year at a single plant and BMW sells ~350,000 cars a year in the US. Electrics and self driving cars, these related technologies, are likely a large part of the future but it's going to take them decades to get there, not a few years.     	   	Oh, and that 25 MPH thing?  I'm guessing you either don't drive much or haven't really thought it through, that's in downtown areas and residential side streets, most of the roads that tie those areas together in most cities are 35-45 MPH roads.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ItIsOneCrazyWorld","name":"t1_crbwadv","parent_id":"t1_crbu1yu","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431872821,"created_utc":1431869221}

{"body":"That several hundred truck drivers had a one million *stretch* is completely meaningless without information on the number of drivers they had and the cumulative distance they travelled (or preferably a list with all drivers and #miles driver). The steep dropoff in the two million club suggests a lot too. 		So let's math a bit!		If you assume that driver accident-proneness can be correctly modeled by the driver-specific chance that a driver 'x' doesn't have an accident in as 'p_x', the chance that a driver 'x' drives *n* miles without accident (from the start) is (p_x)^n. Assuming moreover that Werner employees have some 'p_w' as chance that there is no accident for one mile, we can actually estimate p_w. (So we're saying Werner has only identical copies as drivers that perform similarly.)		There are 585 'one million club' members and 96 'two million club' members. Let N be the total number of truckers in Werner's employment. So for 'n' accident-free miles, we expect N * p_w^n drivers to achieve the distance. Then we have (powers are for convenience in million units, 'm'):		     p_w^1m = p_w^(2m - 1m) = N p_w^2m / N p_w^1m = 96/585 = 32/195		    p_w = (32/195)^(1/1000000)		So the chance that Google's car would reach 1m miles if they were as adequate as a professional trucker is 32/195 (=.164). Based on this, you'd expect (on average) that Google was *significantly* better than Werner. Honestly performing as well as professional truckers would suffice too. However, Google's 1m miles is the number of miles they driven now. The actual distance before an error attributable to the AI can possibly be much larger. On the flip side, we're comparing a single data point from Google to an average from Werner, so the variation on Google's part is so large it is meaningless.		Some further assumptions: we model Werner as a collection of similar drivers that stop driving the moment they cause an accident. Conversely, a driver continues until an accident. Clearly the drivers with accidents actually continue driving trucks at Werner. Also the 2m and 1m club comparison relies on the fact that the groups are the same, but there probably drivers with the 1m club membership that haven't driven 2m yet.		Of course, beside that the assumptions are inaccurate reflections of the data this is based on, there are other differences. Google didn't drive in more accident-prone situations. Google drove a car, not a truck. Google drove through a specific part of America. Google probably drove far less on the highway than truckers. Also Werner's 'preventable accident' is probably less strict than Google's, which is 'accidents in which it was not at fault'.		tl;dr there are so many caveats in each party's favour that a conclusion is meaningless.

{"body":"While I'm actually very much in favour of further trials and development of the technology, I do feel that the article is every bit as biased and disingenuous as those it critiques. My first point would be that a million accident free (or 'non fault' accident) miles is actually not that impressive. Most professional HGV drivers could boast a better record than that, I know I certainly can and I would not class myself as that great a driver. Secondly, one of the key phrases here for me was 'the accident rate comparison between man and machine is skewed because every incident is reported in the test program, but people often do not report minor accidents'. This is undeniably true, however it's also undeniably true to say that few, if any, reports are made of near misses between drivers and pedestrians. So the point made by some that querying how the car might/did perform in hypothetical scenarios in which, for example, a child might run into the street as little more than scare mongering is not a particularly scientific response, since we do not appear to have a great deal of (non-anecdotal) data to show how well, we as humans, respond against which to make any reasonable comparison.

Because of that, I'm afraid that for me, as exciting a prospect (not least for the less abled, or sight impaired among us) as this is, I'd say we are still decades, at least, from this being a commercially viable proposition.","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hungerfordhero","name":"t1_crbs699","parent_id":"t3_3677zf","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431854634,"created_utc":1431851034}

Daimler's approach (and Nissan's as well) is likely to be what we have for the next 20 years, as it does not remove liability from the driver and does not require artificisl intelligence.  Machines break, software issues happen. The time lag to re-engage a driver who is not participating at all (the Google approach) is a *huge* hurdle that we are still quite a ways away from being able to solve.  It would be great if Google or any of the automotive OEM's would be able to bring a true self driving car to market soon but it just doesn't seem like its possible.

There are around 30,000 roadway fatalities and another 100,000 injuries (of all kinds and degrees) on top of that *every year* in the US. SDCs only need to beat that, and it's a very low bar to beat. It's extremely unlikely that a single crash will have the effect you predict. Though there are plenty of panicky, hysterical people, the majority of citizens will see the obvious benefits and rationally accept that nothing is ever going to be perfect in the world -- especially against the already horrifying imperfections of human operators. More to the point, as I said above, not everyone's view is weighed equally. Insurers and regulators already understand the enormous public safety advantages of SDCs, and their views are worth much more than yours in this analysis.		You focus on Google, which perhaps reveals your deeper ignorance about all this. Google is very good at self-promotion, which is why we hear about them so much. But they are not the first or only company working on this, not even slightly. Every company involved in auto manufacture and operation is interested, and many are involved in this ongoing development to different degrees. While there will be a Google car, there will also be others.		You say 5-10 years, but they've already had them for years. Again, you're operating from inadequate knowledge and information. Google drove four SD trucks across Eurasia a few years ago. There have been SDCs operating experimentally in the Southwest for over a decade now. There are many other examples. You're just not aware of them, that's all. It's not very important what *Google* delivers or when, as they're not the only player.		Flying cars are science fiction, and a very stupid idea, for many obvious reasons. Real life is not like the Jetsons and never will be. There have been so-called 'flying cars' demonstrated and available for many years, but they are, without exception, exactly what you'd expect -- planes that you can drive like a car when they're on the ground (as long as the wings don't bother you, but of course that makes them very impractical anywhere except in the air). No one but a qualified pilot has ever been allowed to fly one or ever will be, so if you're not a pilot, then forget about it.		You call yourself a realist, but I call you a pessimist. This is coming a lot sooner than you expect.

{"body":"I've worked in media, either non-profit or 'non-profitable' (technically commercial, but broke as a joke) on and off for many years, and brushed shoulders and occasionally darked the doors of some shinier commercial media outlets (and some shiner 'boutique' non-commercial media).		What I've surmised is that 'media' (here meaning commercial media focused on profits) *does* have a bias, but it's not what most people think. Except for a small proportion of politically focused outlets (you know who they are, probably), most commercial media is driven by what I call a '*media* bias': They are very interested in *what's good for* ***them***.		Case in point: In the mid-'90s, there was substantial public debate in Providence, Rhode Island over a proposed mall. That mall eventually got built. If you go back over the coverage in the paper of record, *The Providence Journal,* you'll see some mention of dissent and doubt about the project, but the majority of the coverage will see generally favourable and positive. But I was there at the time, and I can testify that public opinion was largely negative, not positive.		So what gives? Was ProJo bribed? Well, no, not really. But the motive was still money. ProJo stood to gain a lot of advertising revenue from tenants of the mall, and the mall itself. That was enough to put them in the tank in favour of the mall, and to hell with public dissent on the matter. To be fair, the paper is not beholden to the public, and can do what they want, and presumably the public can respond with their dollars. But my point is not about that.		My point is that the paper's bias was driven by self-interest, not public or political interest, or ideology, or anything like that, or even bribery. And that's what drives *most* choices made by commercial media. We will see that here, too. As the SDC story develops in the coming years, media will make such choices with an eye to their future earnings as much as to whatever there is to report and the relative merits of different viewpoints on it. They may be critical right now, especially since they still get lots of ad revenue from traditional auto sellers. But as soon as they sight ad revenue on the horizon from SDCs, I assure you they'll change their tune.","depth":1,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sylban","name":"t1_crbv27c","parent_id":"t1_crbrvy6","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431868532,"created_utc":1431864932}

The google cars are probably the best maintained on the road, and travel the same bit of miles to hit that 1m mark. So, if 2 cars get into an accident, who's to blame? No one? No, it would just shift the liability to the manufacturer. 		Now considering a lot of people don't change their oil as often as they should. I am not for every 3k, but 4 to 5 is within the range of most vehicles, if not longer. But I have seen some go 10, 20 or more, tires, and other things that need changed replaced. All of these things can have an impact on your chances of getting into an accident, or the car failing at some point which would cause you, or someone else to file a claim. Everyone does not have the money to make minor/major repairs, and still need to use the car. If the car just shut down, and  said "no way Jose am I going to drive you to work when you haven't changed my oil, hello, we are going on 3,001 miles". You wouldn't sell as many cars unless that could be turned off or disabled. As such, I believe there will still be insurance, but it will be a little bit different. If you can show service records, and things where you kept prior cars in good working order, you would likely get a better rate, than someone that couldn't. Any accident scene investigation would then have to switch from just indicating which car's driver was at fault, but whether it was the car, or the owner, of it. Say they had a tire with low air pressure, and that can be traced as a contributing factor, the car warned them of it, they ignored, and kept on going, thus the owner is at fault, and the owners insurance would cover it. 		Now with that said.... Just look at all the recalls, and things of that nature, and think, do you honestly think there will be no insurance what so ever? 		One last thing... Shit happens when you are not even in the car, or it's not powered on. Say for instance you have a newer car, and have collision insurance, not the lowest one you can get.

{"body":">And people say "But it's computer controlled. Computers can't make mistakes if they're programmed correctly"		Computers don't make mistakes, I am not sure why you added "if they're programmed correctly". That just makes it a bit more difficult to explain. If a computer is programmed to do x, when input with y, it will do it, and do it without error, unless there is a hardware malfunction not allowing it to do x. A hardware error like the processor overheating. The problem with automating cars, is that you have multiple points that are possible to fail, instead of overheating, you have the possibility of a rock coming off a truck hitting a sensor and damaging it. Or a tree limb, or whatever. If those sensors are not redundant, then the car would have to be programmed to stop in the middle of the road, or to the last known safe position it spotted. 		As for programming something correctly, no program is full proof, no program is perfect unless it's really really simple, like the previous example. That's why almost every moderately complex program has a series of development cycles, alpha, beta, etc. Even final releases are not really "finished", as they need updating occasionally. If they were perfect then no updates would ever be necessary. 		>One fault at 70 miles an hour might be all you get.		I would assume that the manufacturers employing said technology would have a simple redundant system built in, in case of such a failure. Like your devices that "crashed", they did so in a controllable way. Or at least one where the device suffered the least amount of damage. The device turns off in case of serious faults, or overheating. If said system did this, another system could come online, and say ok, the last information we recieved showed us that there is a place we could pull over to the right, the surface is grass and level. So it turns right, turns on hazards, and alerts the driver, and or calls for help. 		The main instances I can think of that it would be an issues is the time it would take for the backup to come online. If you are in the middle of a turn, a split second switch could allow the car to lose steering, the car would go forward, and if another car is coming the other way, it would be a head on collision.  Even if the other car was automated, it wouldn't stop the accident from happening, as there would be latency issues with any type of communication.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lxlqlxl","name":"t1_crc957k","parent_id":"t1_crbtaoh","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431899195,"created_utc":1431895595}

If there is a huge rush to put these things out there, it will not end as well as it could if done properly. 		I don't see driverless cars in our future, for at least a few decades.

For instance, say on a long trip, or one where the system can work really well, allow the driver to do other things, and take their eyes off the road, and if need be, the car alerts the driver to take over. If the driver is incapable, the car plans ahead and pulls over to a safe place until the driver will be able to.		>Right now, you car can be hacked to take off without you		My car can't...

I'm interested in learning more about the accidents that Google Car has been involved in so far (of course none of which are Google Car's fault and the data for which is proprietary). For one thing, simply following the rules is not enough. For example, if the speed limit is 100mph and you consistently drive below the speed limit (as per Redditors who've actually seen Google Car in action), you are making the road more dangerous by forcing the driver behind you to go crazy and attempt dangerous takeover maneuvers. If an accident happens, you are off the hook because you were just "following the law"... right. 		Artificial Intelligence is simply not at the level of a human being yet and driving a car like an expert human driver is not possible. Google seems to be claiming this with its PR stunts on Reddit. If Google Car is truly capably of driving like a decent human driver over 1 million miles then all those immensely bright engineers working on deep learning algorithms are wasting their time because Google apparently has the closest thing to artificial intelligence (Skynet if you will) with 1 million accident-free miles as proof.		Just the processing power it would take to drive well on a busy highway (with all the random events that can happen) will make Google Car infeasible.

I really expected your post to be more technically sound.   			I agree with the point that the collisions or incidents that the google cars have been involved with should be released. Although there are provably laws against them doing this , it would improve credibility drasticyally.   			Your point on following the rules of the road making the road more dangerous for other drivers since they will go crazy and attempt dangerous maneuvers to pass is a bit dramatic. It is easy and expected behavior to pass a driver. This is the very basics of driving.

About ten years ago, I started telling people in the field that whether anyone liked to admit it or not, traditional business models were based on the inherent technical limitations of the medium. And because those limitations no longer applied to the revenue end of the business -- listeners -- it was now necessary for stations that had been cruising along with their foot on the clutch to actually start working for their money. Those that didn't, I promised, would inevitably fail financially.		I was mocked and called a doomsayer, and worse. Ever since I started saying that, noncoms have been failing left and right. I don't feel sorry for them. Stations willing to actually fulfil their statutory obligation to serve their listeners have not suffered that fate; the ones that failed were those who felt it was too much to ask, and I won't miss them.		In the '80s, I predicted that audio media that relied on moving components (discs, etc.) would give way to file-based media, and was mocked for it. Now look. In the early '90s, I predicted that we'd just buy digital media online instead of buying it and uploading it to our computers and players, and was mocked for that, too. Now look. Later on, I said that it would all go mobile. You get the idea.		I don't mind being mocked for saying things that people find hard to imagine. What bothers me is when they keep doing after I've been right so many times before.		I read a guy like Ray Kurzwiel and some of what he says sounds crazy.

At it's base, it lays out a standardized procedure of prosecuting those complicit in misleading entries.  	  	In the interest of reform rather than punishment, it will only name one party responsible per entry. That party will have to produce credible sources for their statements.   	  	Statements are brought individually, not as a whole; A small aside putting a misleading paragraph or title in perspective does not protect it.  	  	If the statement is found baseless and contrary to evidence, the guilty party receives an inunction against employment or involvement with informational media that is arbitrary, though not usually permanent.  	  	The onus of bringing a case against a producer is with any subject mentioned in the entry, and no one else. This is to discourage malicious and frivolous prosecution.  	  	It's intended that simply the presence of the threat of having a claim brought against one will discourage misleading production; Entries are not, as in the DMCA, censored while under review, but they are if the party named is punished for them. There should also be limits on use, to discourage people expressing their animousity through the system.  	  	Some will mention that there is a free speech issue here and they are correct, as this will be censoring speech. However, there's a problem with claiming to be dispersing information and facts to the public at large and using it to spew rhetoric and editorial opinion.
