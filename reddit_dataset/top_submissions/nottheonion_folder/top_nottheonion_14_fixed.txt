{"body":"Corn went down, beef prices went way up.  While most other meat animals (pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits) have a breeding population that produces the animals that are then grown for consumption, reproduction rates for cattle are such that you can't do this. Though they do artificial insemination so there is a small breeding population of bulls.		This creates a one year inversion between feed prices and beef prices. When corn goes up, farmers can make more money growing beef, but to increase their herd size, they need to impregnate more cows. The steers still go off to processing, the cows stay behind, and the overall supply drops. Beef prices go up.		However, unless corn prices see a big price increase this fall, beef prices will start to fall as there are now larger herds and the backlog from last year will be ready for market.		A good company would hedge or vertically invest in their supplier to be able to ride out variations in commodity prices. McD's either didn't or did so poorly and are now fully exposed to rapid commodity price changes.

McDonalds burgers are frozen and thrown onto a really hot press to cook in minimal time which reduces quality, and then is thrown into a heating drawer until it's ordered.

{"body":"I don't think the grill press has much to do with it (it really only allows both sides to cook at the same time - much like a George Foreman).		What kills McD is the heating trays.		In theory, corporate has everything timed out so an item should never taste stale (i.e after X minutes in the heating tray, this isn't allowed to be sold).

{"body":"Cost cutting, traditionally, means that they're lowing their input costs. In this case that would be meat, bread, etc. Think Heinz going from sugar to corn syrup in Ketchup, or something like that. That's a mistake quite a few companies make, especially food companies when they need to tighten the belt. The cost cutting I assume your talking about is with regards to labor costs, which is one of McD's biggest costs. McD's, because of their purchasing power, is able to demand fairly high standards for their food. I have read nothing that points to lowering their food costs by skimping on quality. 		The current [100m "cost cutting"] (http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241629) is about labor, some middle management is getting laid off and you will probably start seeing more kiosks. The latter are something that should have come in 8 years ago. 		What you're doing wrong in your analysis is looking at just the last 2 years. The preceding 13 before that were boom years where McD's outperformed their competition by leaps and bounds. They up'd their revenue by a third, which for a mature company is huge. The reason this two year dips is so newsworthy is that it came after 13 years of solid growth. 		What you're seeing now is the result of 3 things. First their last CEO (Don Thompson) was bad. They tried to bring in a guy who "worked his way up" and he was just terrible. He is gone. Second as you said, there is a trend in the burger market towards "better" burgers which are often more unhealthy with higher calories. The health aspect is already tough for McD's so this trend is tough for them to weather. The third is that their attempt to get into this market, with specific higher quality burgers failed. They didn't miss the trend, they just couldn't capitalize on it after their first attempt. Doesn't mean they are all out of ideas. 		Their last two years have been bad but they are not in any kind of real danger. They are always trying to cater to their clientele. Admittedly the last one didn't work.

He ends up working at a 'MgRonalds' for money for food/rent as an hourly worker and decides that he will conquer the world by working his way up through the MgRonalds corporate chain.

{"body":"The sizes haven't changed but maybe the quality has. 		McDs had a great market share so successive "marketing" teams would have probably focused on lowering costs to increase profitability. For example, maybe they find that using a different sort of milk in the cheese would save them 0.2 cents per burger unit. That's a huge saving across a lot of burgers. Will consumers like it though?		So this small small change gets tested. Original cheese vs slightly cheaper cheese. 500 people are tested. Perhaps some prefer new cheese but they're close that people don't know the difference. McDs implement this change and the product quality slightly and imperceptibly lowers. 		The team behind this are big heroes now, they confidently tell the board that this change has made McDs an extra (0.2 cents x number of burgers) per year. "What else can we change?"		Jump forward 20 years. Hundreds of imperceptible changes have happened and each time the test groups couldn't tell the difference between versions....		But I don't think that's the reason for their decline. Millennials don't like McDonalds.		Some people have pointed at their preference for customisable good options but I think that's bunk. I've been to custom burger joints and the first time you choose your fillings, you try something new and it tastes like crap cos the flavours don't mesh well together.		Some people say that Millennials like convenience. I think they'd sell more if they were on Eat24, Seamless or Just Eat with delivery options... But that's just a symptom.		McDonalds allowed their brand to become dated by chasing a family market share that is ashamed to eat there because it's perceived as being unhealthy. Think of Star Wars. They say that the prequel trilogy screwed up by targeting the films at a younger audience whereas the original three targeted adults (with kids often liking what adults like).		A lot of our purchase decisions are based on perceptions. People think Nike shoes are just better. One of the most important ones is "cool" (sophisticated, exclusive, energetic).		Some brands are perceived as cool - although not for everyone. Some people think Red Bull is cool, some people think Ray Bans are cool, some people think that Apple are cool - but it's rare that someone will think all 3 are cool.		What are your perceptions of McDonald's? What are your perceptions of Microsoft? Both brands are screwed.		I ain't a marketing historian but surely McDonalds traditionally targeted teenagers in the 60s/70s although it might have been indirectly (pricing, choice of menu).		Either way they were once perceived as being wholesome, American and cool in a market that didn't have many alternatives.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"deyterkourjerbs","name":"t1_crnfiir","parent_id":"t1_crn3n5j","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1432802082,"created_utc":1432798482}

People want to eat better food. The issue is an expensive burger costs McD's almost as much as the Emerging burger joints. So when you see a meal at McD's for 7 or one at a place you 'consider' better for 9, most people go for the $9 burger. Much of this has to do with how McD's marketing affected you as a child. You think happy meals and french fries. Kids food. McD's still has a powerful effect on the childrens market, most kids I know want to go there and play and eat fries. 		So now they have a problem. Half their market wants better, more expensive food. The other half wants shitty cheap food. It is a losing situation for them, as they cannot serve two masters at once successfully.

A major difference, though, is labor costs.

My guess is that McDonald's is doing worse because it now has new competition on the high end, like Five Guys and In-N-Out, that is willing to prepare food fresh on site. McDonald's has had a multi-decade push to keep labor costs in their products down, and that push caused a decrease in food quality.

That wasn't the worst part though... That burger went through me like a runaway cargo train. I'll never forget how McD gave me the shits for trusting them again.		I'd rather go hungry than order something there again.		Also it was one of worst customer experiences I have ever had. When I pulled up to the window (after ordering) I waited forever for someone to show up. I actually thought they had forgotten I had even ordered and was waiting. I had more than enough time to notice how dirty the window was and all the chipped paint around it. 		Finally someone showed up and told me I had to pay in cash as the credit machines weren't working. At which point they gave me only my coin change and forgot the $2 until I asked them where it was. They apologized but it was just weird. I also then had to repeat my order as they had apparently forgot and the manager relayed it to whoever was making it.

Those three parties fight over money and can never have enough.  Their greed is destroying the golden goose.		In-N-Out is a privately held company.  They own all of their stores.  Sure, corporate wants to turn a profit, but they don't have shareholders and franchisees to fight over money with.  In-N-Out is smart to prize quality - they know the customers won't keep coming if the food turns to shit.		Further, In-N-Out strictly promotes from within and takes care of its employees.  Start out there slingling burgers, and you can eventually manage a store and work up into corporate.		Where I live, McDonald's and In-N-Out cost almost exactly the same.  In-N-Out does tremendous business while McDonald's keeps dropping off.  The reason why is because In-N-Out has a good, effective, and efficient structure.  McDonald's is a nightmare.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Uncle_Erik","name":"t1_crncfd3","parent_id":"t1_crn5ov5","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1432791710,"created_utc":1432788110}

That's not always the case at every restaurant, but McDonalds is unwise in that way.		It is very, very bad for them when their franchisees are struggling.

{"body":"Agreed and well said. They've changed their chicken so that it's nasty, the burgers are dry, the fries are disgusting even when still hot. The apple pies were far better when they were fried instead of baked (I know, plenty unhealthy but so very good) and not even a Big Mac tastes right now. You've tried so much innovation which is pretty cool but you've changed the base ingredients so much that people don't want it anymore. A pickle is a pickle and the lettuce, etc is pretty hard to screw up so that pretty much leaves the meat and how it's prepared. It used to be more meat and less filler and cooked almost about the time it was needed. Now you fry it on both sides at once which is faster but takes all the taste out of and any meat juice that's left serves as a disgusting marinade that the burgers sit in as they wait in holding cabinets. 		Then you pay so low that no one who will ever care will never work there. That's not to say that they're not nice people. I've met plenty of nice people taking my order but it's my order gets screwed up or I have to wait so long that it's not worth it. 		The shakes are nasty compared to what they used to be. I don't want some kind of masterpiece with frills. I just want my cold, flavored frozen sugar-milk. Your coffee is better than Starbucks but it's still not really worth it anymore especially when you try to make it so that there's so much variation.		Your chicken nuggets are dry. The "original" chicken sandwich patty is nothing like the original. The original used to have real breading and now it's some kind of dusting that says "Yup, I came from a freezer." It's dry and flavorless except that it now has some kind of spice in it that just doesn't work.		Your biscuits fall apart. The eggs are dry and smooshed. The cheese isn't cheese and it just turns into a pile of somewhat bitter goo that slides off of anything you put it in.		The fries either have no salt or way too much and they coat your mouth with something disgusting. 		I can go to Walmart and get buns, a tube of ground beef, and a $1.25 bag of frozen fries and make something better at home, spend less, and spend less net time cooking it than going to you local store, wait in line, climb back in my car, and drive back. And that's saying something since I live about 5 minutes from a McDonald's. 		Go back to what made you great. I know a lot of people might not agree but those burgers back in the day... you know what made them great? They were somewhat greasy. The cheese was thicker. Your fries were tasty. You paid more, gave more. You worked your employees more than 20 hours a week so that they could actually take home a paycheck and get something to eat and pay at least some bills. Back then, you had an image that you cared and so the people working for you cared. And when they cared, it showed and people enjoyed themselves. Any more, you have managers yelling at workers, workers hanging their heads in shame, degreaser in the kitchen, window cleaner behind the front counter, mold in the ice bins, messy tables, understaff and overworked stores. 		Trust us, it's not the *look*. It's the food, the staff, the cleanliness, the pride. If I could go back to the 70s, I would probably live on your food. Anymore, it makes me sick, literally.

{"body":"> Couldn't it be that your perception of what was tasty back then is different than it is now?		I wondered the same thing.		But I don't think that's the case with McDonald's.  I'm 42 and have eaten at a lot of restaurants over the years.  I remember McDonald's, since we'd go there every month or two as a treat.  I still enjoyed McDonald's 20 years ago.  But I think the food is terrible now.		Thing is, there are other places I've eaten at for nearly a lifetime.  If you're in Los Angeles, you're probably familiar with Tommy's.  It's a hangout for USC students and alumni.  My dad is an alum, so my sister and I were taken to Tommy's from a very early age.  Today, I'm also a USC alum and have been having Tommy's for close to 40 years.  The prices have gone up, but eating at Tommy's is as good as it ever was.

{"body":"The comments: "their food is disgusting, up the quality"   	"The food is to disgusting, lower the prices"   	As a McDonald's employee I can tell you, that the customers we have are loyal. As much as so many people complain, they come back. Even after orders are wrong, they come back. Some people come by every day, and order the exact same thing (oddly enough, a good portion of people just get a L Drink and that's it).  	I think what's wrong is that people are expecting to much of a place that sells Chz Burgers for $1. Also, them trying to make "Premium sandwich's". The Sirloin Third Pounder cost $4.99 + tax = $5.29(VA tax). I could go to Boardwalk across the street, or Five Guys for a better burger cheaper then that.  	Also things like the Big Mac. A Big Mac is $3.99($4.23 w/ tax), with a Medium meal it's $5.99($6.35 w/ tax). A Mcdouble is $1.29($1.37 w/ tax).  They have the same amount of meat, but the Big Mac has Lettuce, Tomato, 3rd Bun, and Mac Sauce. Just add some Mac Sauce to the Mcdouble if you don't want the veggies, and if you do, get the Daily Double($1.99[$2.11 w/ tax]) and add the Mac Sauce instead of Mayo. Mac sauce is $.30 cents, which is the main part of the Big Mac.  I will admit, the pay is sad, one of the employees worked there 3 YEARS, and his pay was $8.55/per hour. Went to Target, where he started at $10/per hour. Reasons like that is why McDonald's is considered a shit job.  For $7.65, you have to handle people's orders, make food, clean filthy bathrooms, deal with some of the worst people(some customers are absolute trash, and believe they can treat us like shit).

{"body":"I love McDonald's and I make a liveable wage, but McDonald's(and fast food in general) is just too expensive.		Let's compare some of the prices over the years:		- 10 years ago, I got a super-size meal with a double quarter pounder with cheese and bacon, fries and a drink for over $5. It was a great deal and it was tasty so I went often.		- After the 2008 crash, I was able to get two tiny dollar menu bacon cheeseburgers and large fries(no supersize) without a drink for under $5. Fine, it's filling and not too expensive. The quality had declined at this point with the "get rid of saturated fat" food craze.		- In 2013/2014, I was able to get two tiny dollar menu cheeseburgers(no bacon) and large fries(no drink) for a little over $5. Okay, it's still filling, but I'm reaching my price limit here.		- Now in 2015, to get my two tiny double cheeseburgers and large fries without a drink, it costs me over $6. It's not cost effective and the portions aren't enough.		McDonald's has given me less and less food and just priced me out. I have no idea who McDonald's is trying to appeal to or what they are thinking at this point. McDonald's, no matter what they do, is always going to be seen as low-class unhealthy garbage. They aren't going to attract the wealthier crowds as those people are going to Subway, Chipotle, Panera Bread and Five Guys(Cost me $15 for two burgers only and no fries/drink, way too expensive). They also can't attract the poorer crowds because it is just too expensive. It's also getting to the point now where going to a restaurant like a Chili's or Denny's is cheaper and gives you more, which is absolutely ridiculous. In no world should a restaurant like Chili's be able to price out a fast food restaurant. I also think places like Little Caeser's are winning the pricing war as I get a pizza which will last me four meals for only $5. Maybe the quality isn't as great, but four meals is well worth it.		McDonald's has to lower their prices, it's the only way.

This is what drives the corporate culture of trading the long term for short term gains: raising prices, cutting quality, reducing labor: we've seen how over time the brand of McDonald's has eroded, it's not a sudden shift but a slow degradation over time.

{"body":"I worked for McDonald's in the UK at a management and corporate level.

All they come up with is slapping a piece of cheese on some fancy new bun, create some bastardized new sauce, and put the same crappy meat on the burger and call it something fancy. The big wigs truly believed that this strategy would get the market share back.		Back then we had no real rivals, burger king wasn't everywhere like it is now, and McDonald's saw huge growth in the UK at least. I've been in America for 15 years now, even worked at McDonald's here for a short time. There is just too much competition here, and McDonald's and Wendy's and the like think their customers want salads and fancy wraps. McDonald's and other burger joints like them just need to go back to basics, lower their prices and just give up on trying to accommodate healthy eaters. The only thing they've done right is their McCafe brand of coffee's, Frappe's, and smoothies. 		It's just not cheap anymore to eat at most places, even for two people two medium meals are almost $16, I know from my experience that big macs cost about $0.64 cents to make, that's about the most expensive cost to McDonald's.

The managers avoided the customers because the practices and regulations were setup in a way where the manager was supposed to be bringing down local costs, but by doing that they would have to hurt the satisfaction of the customer - AND all do it by proxy through their lowest employees.

{"body":"Alright, McDonald's, I'm going to give you my uneducated, inexperienced, but target-market member turnaround plan to guarantee your suvival and growth for the next few decades at least:		1. Start offering grassfed beef, free-range chicken/eggs, and additive-free buns. This isn't the ideal, because people really want organic, but that's expensive, so go as natural as possible without it becoming untenable. People will view it as a treat, so if you make these few changes at least, you're going to win-over a lot more hipster hearts. Also, start cooking your fries in tallow again. 		2. All-day breakfast, including McGriddles. I understand that there are issues with the grills or whatever logistical processes you have, but you've gotta get over that. Dunkin Donuts and others are encroaching on your lunch territory. It's time to put them in their place and win back breakfast--besides, the Egg McMuffin is better anyway.		3. Pay your employees just slightly more than minimum wage. People will still be angry that you aren't paying them $10-12/hr, but there will be less of those voices. And if you come out with a statement saying you'll tie your wages to inflation, it will, again, make the Millenials happy enough to get over whatever moral issues they've got with you.		4. Re-Outline the design/decor requirements for franchises. You can go a lot of different ways here--either retro or hip and modern--but you need to get away from the dirty 1980s/90s look that most places have. The brown and off-white tiles, the crappy booths, these have got to go. Maybe re-think the play palaces too to catch the eyes of Gen-Y mommies.		5. Hire an entirely new team of advertising people that know the New Media world. You need to start producing ridiculously clever ad campaigns that attack your competitors and re-brand McDs as an all-natural, quick, convenient alternative for the on-the-go hipster. "Sure, you could go home and spend an hour cooking your gluten-free organic curry souffl??, or you could come here and grab a free-range Big Mac on a gluten-free bun. Doesn't that sound better?"
