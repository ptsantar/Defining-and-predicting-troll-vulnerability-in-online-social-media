They cleared my entire street and rather than resurface they simply did a large patching job - because there was budget for patching holes but not for a proper resurfacing. The patches starting failing within a couple of months and within 2 years the street looks just as bad as before they started. It is a low traffic road, a proper fix would likely have lasted 15+ years, but now they are back patching holes again.			The British road network has been falling behind on maintenance for decades now and a couple of bad winters a few years back seriously damaged roads over the whole country.
