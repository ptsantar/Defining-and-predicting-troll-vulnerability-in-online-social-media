The military commander requested Portuguese dictator Salazar for more men, but got turned down as Portugal was already spending most of the GDP fighting the Colonial War.

As for Macau, Portugal experienced a very quick and poorly handled process of decolonization that was brought out mostly out of international pressure and from a country that was very poor and coming out of a 40- some year old dicatorial regime which had delayed the country plenty.  If I'm not mistaken, China actually requested Portugal not to abandon Macao as it did other regions, and later the agreement was reached.		As for the Chinese lack of desire to follow the agreement...it's not surprising, but the end result is the same. China never said that these territories would be democratic forever. The hope was that China would respect the agreement, and in the meanwhile 50 years might be enough for China's government to change for the better.

China has, in time of history, been divided into long periods of small warring kingdoms.  But the current of its history always flows toward unification.  [The heaven mandates it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven).  It does not matter if you were not born of royal blood.  If you can unify China, you have the mandate to govern.  A few centuries of not having total territorial control does not diminish an aspiring emperor/dynasty's claim to what is "China".		You don't even have to be Han Chinese (though you have to make a harder argument).  The Manchu were a nomad minority that lived in the mountain of the North East.  They managed to conquer the central China in 1644, establishing the [Qing Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty).  One of the first thing they did? Launch campaign to take back Taiwan by force, which they succeeded in 1683.  In the intervening time, they lay claim to an island the Manchurian never set foot on before.  They *have* to make that claim, or they risk losing legitimacy as the emperor of China.		One can make that argument that this is not how modern international diplomacy works any more. And I would agree.  I am saying that a typical Chinese person is not going to think highly of your few-century old legalistic system when he has >2000 years of cultural identity (or >5000 also counting the mythical time) to fall back on.","depth":2,"score":70,"ups":70,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vimsical","name":"t1_coi5t54","parent_id":"t1_coi29jg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423667415,"created_utc":1423667415}

I don't think that's really a correct characterization of history.  The Qing took control of Beijing in 1644, but Ming loyalists crowned an emperor in the south, establishing a "[Southern Ming] 	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ming)" government that held court in Nanjing, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and Anlong over the next few decades, and also fleeing to Taiwan.		Taiwan at that time was not a part of Ming China, it was a Dutch colony, and it was only under the leadership of a Ming loyalist, [Koxinga] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koxinga), that the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan.  After the Southern Ming was defeated on the mainland, Koxinga's army in Taiwan was the last of the Ming resistance, so it made sense for the Qing to go and conquer them.		But it's not correct to say that the Qing felt that they *had* to take Taiwan by force to legitimately rule China.  The Ming Dynasty had left Taiwan to European colonists, and no previous Chinese dynasty every laid claim to Taiwan.  It was only because Ming loyalists fled to Taiwan that the Qing felt compelled to conquer the island.  In some ways, the situation is the same today with the PRC feeling the need to control Taiwan because the ROC fled there.","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DjTj81","name":"t1_coia2z5","parent_id":"t1_coi5t54","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423674945,"created_utc":1423674945}

{"body":"I agree with the other poster pointing out some of the pretty massive holes in this narrative, and I'm also going to add something that a Vietnamese professor told me while I was studying for a history degree:		Any time a Westerner uses the "Mandate of Heaven" to justify or explain how Asian peoples are behaving, take it with a massive grain of salt.  That particular complex philosophical concept has been latched onto by westerners seeking to frame their own narratives of Asian thought in many different situations throughout the years, rarely with much accuracy. 		 The actual nuance is difficult for me to portray accurately so I'm not going to try, but I can tell you what it is not: a fatalistic acceptance that might makes right and whoever manages to gain control has a divine mandate to govern.  If anything, it's the opposite - that if a ruler is behaving poorly enough, it is not necessarily a bad thing to depose them.  It has more to do with the idea of a right to rebel than the idea that if you are successful conquering then you automatically have the right to govern.  		The mandate of heaven represents the a divine explanation for a social contract between the government and the governed, and the idea that the government only deserved to rule if they upheld that contract.  It is *definitely* not chinese manifest destiny.

{"body":"There's a clear, indisputable difference between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China.		From my understanding, the Republic of China (now recognized as Taiwan and some other nearby islands) used to control the mainland and thus received diplomatic status as the ruling government of China.		But the Republic lost the Chinese Civil War, and eventually its UN seat, to the (Communist) People's Republic of China.		As a result, most diplomatic relations with Taiwan and the rest of the Republic are still in existence, and the government there still believes it should control all of China.		The people of Taiwan, however, don't usually give a single fuck about controlling all of China. They just want to be recognized as their own nation, which is pretty reasonable. They already have some very distinct traits - language, for example. In Taiwan, they speak Mandarin Chinese (which is unusual for somewhere in southeastern China) but still use traditional characters in their writing. Taiwan also has a distinct culture, with its own unique mix of foods/clothing/traditions.		TL;DR: The post-1950 (?) Taiwanese government used to control all of China, so they want it back.

{"body":"As a Taiwanese-American, I'm loving the hilarity of this thread! :)		Taiwan has a really interesting and complicated history; perhaps the best way to understand it, is through the lens of successive colonization. There have been more than a dozen aboriginal tribes living in Taiwan for perhaps six thousand years. Dutch traders established shipping ports and operations in the 17th century, and brought over the first substantial wave of Han settlers from southeastern China (I am descended from these colonists, as are the vast majority of people living in Taiwan today). The Dutch were ejected by a Ming dynasty loyalist named Koxinga. His son established a short-lived independent kingdom. That was then defeated by Qing dynasty forces, and Taiwan came under official Chinese imperial rule for the first and only time in its history (for nearly 200 years). But in 1895, the Qings lost a war to the Japanese and ceded Taiwan 'in perpetuity' to them under the Treaty of Shimonoseki. 		The Japanese colonial period lasted for approximately fifty years, until the victory of the Allied forces in World War II. The Chinese Nationalists who fled to the island in 1949, after the defeat of their party in the Chinese Civil War, numbered approximately two million. But Taiwan already had a population of more than six million. 		The Nationalists imposed the government of the 'Republic of China' on a populace that had nothing to do with the Chinese Civil War and had never been consulted about their post-war fate, and who had mostly only known Japanese rule. It is the ROC constitutional platform (again, a document written for early 20th century mainland China, that was simply imported to Taiwan) that describes the party as the true government of China. As V_the_Victim says below, the people of Taiwan (even most of the descendants of mid-century mainland arrivals) have absolutely no desire to 'take back China'. Successive polls show that a very large majority favor either the status quo of de facto independence or de iure independence. 		I think this is really important - the grandchildren of mid-century Nationalist refugees, today's high schoolers and college students in Taiwan, also mostly think of themselves as Taiwanese. Migration and settlement will do that to you. Taiwan and a Taiwanese identity should belong to anyone, whatever their ancestry and family history, who lives on the island, respects its diverse and multicultural society, and wants to keep it free and democratic.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"allyschild","name":"t1_coi8sh4","parent_id":"t1_coi4k2i","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423672765,"created_utc":1423672765}

{"body":"I think the disconnect in POV's both sides is adding to the problem.  Please understand that nothing I'm about say is personal, but I'm just trying to illustrate the POV from mainlanders.  The fact that you say Taiwanese people feel like they're not part of China would probably get you into a shouting match or a fist-fight on the streets of most Chinese cities.  This sentiment is very strong in Chinese of my parent's generation and for the mainlanders that grew up in the political indoctrination.  We saw a very similar disconnect between POV's during the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong.  To mainlanders, it looked like HK'ers didn't want to be Chinese anymore and wanted special treatment, where as to most HK'ers and western media, it was a matter of freedom of speech and democracy.  As I said a lot of this stems from post-colonial times and the idea that China should not be partitioned by foreign meddling powers.  So, it's a general idea that Chinese everywhere should stick together and work for the good for the nation and all Chinese, not just enriching or looking out for themselves.  Sure China's not perfect, but we have to stick together and work through it, so everybody can reap the rewards, and not just some people.  For many mainlanders, the very success and economic progress that was made by China as an emerging power is seen as vindication of this collectivist ideal.  Sure the CCP isn't perfect, and there's a lot of corruption, but compared to where China was in the colonial era, it's not even a question of what's better.  There's also another popular sentiment that the only reason Taiwanese Repatriation hasn't already happened is because western powers (mainly USA) has been blocking it.  So, there is a very prevalent (though wrong) belief that whenever Taiwan is sticking up for its independence, it's only being a mouthpiece for western colonial powers.		Now, having said, as a Chinese living in America, I often get the same treatment by mainlanders who would probably call me a banana (white on the inside) and say that I've abandoned the homeland.  You're right that Taiwan has it's own separate government, distinctive culture, language, and history.  I can only imagine that if Taiwanese Repatriation ever happens, it would be a long and rocky road, judging by the problems that Hong Kong is having.  Baring serious political upheavals, I don't see mainland China ever letting the matter rest, though, until it actually happens.  For people like Xi Jinping, Taiwanese Repatriation would be a patriotic wet-dream, and a sure ticket to a place in Chinese history.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sylkworm","name":"t1_coid6um","parent_id":"t1_coiai7q","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423679996,"created_utc":1423679996}

The speaker was mildly interesting, said a lot about how there is still real oppression and real tyranny in the world, basically stuff anybody who reads the news knows. Then he says "In countries like China, like Iran, like North Korea, the people don't have a say, they are not free." The Chinese students *flipped out*. As one they all stood up and just walked out. This is like 2000 Chinese students just freaking leaving.

I'm in the Treaty of Tordesillas 1494, which is much smaller than Legal. IIRC (I've never been in a Legal but I've heard they're fun) Legal are pretty big. So I'll give you the same tips I gave my club today (I'm one of the three club heads). 		1. Make sure you cited your sources for your position paper. The people at NAIMUN grade them on a scale of 1-5 and at least 1 point is including a bibliography.		2. Its a little late for this, but make sure you understand parliamentary procedure! [Here](https://sites.google.com/site/hismun/guide-to-parliamentary-procedure) is a short guide to the basics. Your club has probably been practicing this all year, and if you haven't don't worry! It's pretty easy, our freshmen usually get the hang of it within two or three of our once a week half hour lunch meetings.		3. Print your position paper out beforehand! Assume that you will have access to precisely nothing that is not already inside your room. The staff of the hotel are absolutely swamped by the 3-5000 high school students and, I say this with only mild hyperbole, you would have to sell your left nut to get a rollaway bed. This includes the coffee shop in the lobby, every morning it is swamped by something like 2-300 people. 		4. Beware of power delegates. These are the scummy types of people who will steal working papers, flash drives, and generally stab you in the back if they even think for a moment it will give them an edge. Generally speaking they come from Horace-Mann and Miracosta, but they can come from any school. Don't be overly friendly with people you don't know. No harm in being polite, but sadly you do have to be aware that not everyone is nice at these conferences.		5. Speak up! Don't be intimidated by the number of people in your committee. You're only going to see them for the next three days, and then probably never again in your life. So stand up and speak! The Chair(s) tend to take notice if you speak more rather than less.		6. Don't drink/do drugs at NAIMUN. The people who run it are all college students. They know every trick in the book. It really just isn't worth it. Every year some group of stupid kids gets caught by either the hotel staff or the conference staff. Just wait until next weekend.		7. If you can, go on some of the tours! DC is an absolutely amazing city (love living here) and NAIMUN gets some really good tours, including one of the DoD and the Pentagon last year.		Have fun! It's an absolute blast, I've been going for four years and I'm really sad this is my last year.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jalapenyobuisness","name":"t1_coir7vk","parent_id":"t1_coikzpr","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423703520,"created_utc":1423703520}

Taiwan is recognized by many as an independent country, and even those who officially don't recognize it are obviously doing so for political reasons. Hell, the US doesn't recognize Taiwan as a country but still sent it's military to protect Taiwan from China because they behave like 2 different countries and the US knows they should. In doing so, China took it as a sign of disrespect and broke maritime law refusing a safe port to a ship of the US fleet sent to protect Taiwan from China. In retaliation the US fleet sailed through the straight of Taiwan, crossing what the Chinese consider their waters. You don't just cross into another country's water without permission, it's an act of aggression. They did just to show that the US doesn't respect the view that that water is China's  because Taiwan isn't part of China.		Taiwan and China don't have the same government, they elect their own leaders which China has no control over, they have different legal and tax systems, and they don't even speak the same language.

{"body":"I participated in Harvard's MUN competition about a decade ago in Boston.  'Egotist' doesn't even begin to describe what I saw from a lot of the competitors, but I would say that I still think model UN as a concept on a whole is actually quite enriching to those who take the time to really dig in.		But yes, egotists or at the very least somewhat elitist.  I saw people from Yale change their suits upwards of 6-8 times a day; I saw the same from Westpoint representatives and a lot of the Ivy Leaguers (Dartmouth, Columbia, etc.); they had an Andy Bernard-esque A Capella group perform; they held something called a 'creative black tie' event -- I never realized how much clothing and how many different dress codes I had to prepare for just to bullshit world politics with people.		Interesting note -- Harvard doesn't actually compete in the competition they host -- though, I get the impression that a lot of these kids do the 'Model UN Circuit' and travel a lot, as there was a lot of back-patting from people who were 'regular' competitors.  Some universities from Brazil and Russia were very competitive.  		I would say that my absolute favorite moment of doing this competition, though, were from the school that represented the non-voting member 'The Vatican'.  Since they couldn't vote in any of the committees, they went all out to over-do the whole Vatican thing.  One guy was walking up and down the aisles, sprinkling holy water at people, burning incense and otherwise doing their best to mix it up when it got a little stuffy (I believe they walked away with at least one award for their efforts -- which was well earned).		tl;dr It's not all bad, though there's plenty of ego-fluffing at these things.","depth":1,"score":210,"ups":210,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pucstah","name":"t1_cohy778","parent_id":"t1_cohvugd","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423639672,"created_utc":1423639672}

{"body":"I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents. I'm currently living in Taiwan and I've had the pleasure of learning about the Taiwanese people and their culture. Every time this subject comes up, there are a lot of Western people who've never actually been to China or Taiwan and start making a lot of claims. The general consensus here in Taiwan is that Taiwan is an independent country and not part of China. They are aware of their shared history and consanguinity with China. Nevertheless, they feel fully independent and wholly different from the Chinese. In fact, I've noticed that it is a point of pride for the Taiwanese.	&nbsp;    		Taiwanese people are very polite and friendly and their culture dictates that controversial or uncomfortable subjects such as these shouldn't be discussed often, especially not in public. But once you become close with them they start to open up more about their opinions of China. Unfortunately, the truth is that Taiwanese do not like the Chinese very much. They considered them to be different in terms of behavior, culture and general attitudes. Whenever I am out drinking/eating/whatever with Taiwanese friends they often times play a game I would call "spot the Chinese person". Whenever someone is being loud in public, not queueing correctly, or just generally being an ass they'll say things like "lol that's probably a Chinese person visiting Taiwan". If you call Taiwanese people Chinese or say Taiwan is part of China, they take offense to a small extent. It's not major, but they'll let you know they do not feel like they are part of China.	&nbsp;    		I want to make it clear that these are not my opinions, I'm just an observer. These are the general trends that I've seen amongst both the older and younger generations and among the business community in Taiwan. I enjoy learning about their culture and these are just some general observations that I've noticed. Also, they speak Traditional Mandarin in Taiwan, whereas they speak Simplified Mandarin on the Chinese mainland. They are similar, but not the same language. Basically, from what I've seen, most Taiwanese do not hate the Chinese. But they do not really like them either and they do not want to be part of China.	&nbsp;		EDIT: So a lot of people are taking issue with the differences I stated between Traditional and Simplified Mandarin. Admittedly, I'm not very good at Chinese. I work a lot (I'm not an English teacher) so I don't have time to study in an official capacity. I've picked up some basic conversational skills from friends but I don't really read it. From what I've been told, what is spoken in Taiwan is significantly different. This is just what I've been told. I haven't had much exposure to Chinese people. I do know that there are many different dialects spoken here in Taiwan. I've noticed the MRT announces each station is 4 different dialects, from what I can surmise. The older generations especially can speak something that is much different than what the younger generation speaks. Some younger people tell me they can barely understand what is being said, if at all. I suppose it is a complicated subject. However, I think it's apparent that there is a significant difference to what is spoken in China compared to Taiwan. If I had to take a guess from what Taiwanese people have told me, the difference is much larger than the differences in English between Americans and British people. I cannot say for sure though.","depth":0,"score":280,"ups":280,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"omegav2","name":"t1_cohxsaj","parent_id":"t3_2vhuxn","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423638239,"created_utc":1423638239}

As a Taiwanese-American who lived in China for a period of time, mainland Chinese feel very strongly about Taiwan being part of China. People I talked to could tell from my accent that I wasn't from the mainland, and would wax poetic about how we're all the same family and that we should be reunited.

It's never been about Taiwan being a "part of China." That was never the argument until recently when China became a world power. The Kuomintang felt they were the rightful rulers of China. The Taiwanese governments claim to rule got a bit more silly as time went on.		Here in China, Taiwan is considered a province of China. I've traveled to Taiwan and lived in China for over a year. Honestly, I don't get the "hate" thing. It's a dispute between governments but I don't really see it as hate. Taiwanese culture is wildly popular in the mainland. A ton of the music, food, and fashion stems from that island. The view in Taiwan on those from the mainland are not so different from those views expressed by those in Hong Kong. I think given time and more exposure to the wider world, those in the mainland will be viewed in a kinder light.

{"body":"I was very aware of the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong. Followed it quite closely before it sort of dissolved. It is a pretty upsetting situation but it's a very complex one (as most issues related to China are.) If there's one thing I've learned in my time in China it's that nothing is ever black and white, but shades of grey. You'll never get a direct answer. Hong Kong was naive to think the central government would ever actually grant them full suffrage. However, that same naivety is what can inspire a movement like Occupy Central. I'd argue that naivety is necessary. The central government didn't want a repeat of the Tiananmen incident and I felt they showed a lot of restraint given their past history. Protests on that scale would never fly in the mainland. Why did they show restraint? Western/Chinese investment in the financial hub? An independent media that was free to report whatever it wanted? Myriad reasons. Hong Kong have a lot of very valid concerns regarding policies from the central government. Suffrage, influx of mainland money, rising housing costs, weak job market... it's a place to watch for sure in the next ten years. 		The root issue I see is that China has had a very tumultuous recent history. Going back to the Cultural Revolution is probably not going back far enough. There were the Opium Wars, losing Hong Kong to British rule, and Japanese invasion and humiliation in the next century. Then decades of civil war, ideological movements leading to millions of deaths, and then finally the modern period post 1989. It's a very, very young nation. 		I can see why Taiwan, especially the younger generation of Taiwanese, don't identify themselves with the mainland. They've grown apart in a separate culture, it's only in the last decade even that regular travel between Taiwan and the mainland without a stopover in Hong Kong or elsewhere could happen. The ideologies of the two sides are so different. One side believing in a democratic society and the other staunchly opposed to it. On an individual level, I think things will change in the coming years. Young people in China, my generation or the next one, will be much more traveled and be bigger participants in the world. This sort of negative view of the "mainlander" will with time go. On the issue of hostility, I'd say it goes both ways. Imagine it from the Chinese perspective... Taiwan, a province occupied by a rival government that once laid claim to all of China, also has a military arsenal. Taiwan regularly buys arms from the US (or did, as China and the US have gotten closer over the years.)		I'm no PRC apologist. There are a ton of things that are wrong with this place and so many improvements that can and should be made. Political, social, cultural, environmental, etc. But with that being said, I'm just so tired of the west picking out all the issues with this place while completely ignoring the history, ignoring the events that have brought us to this day.

{"body":"I agree things are never black and white, but you have to take a stand. "Money for living" or "culture and freedom"?

Taiwan regularly buys arms from the US (or did, as China and the US have gotten closer over the years.)		That's a typical PRC apologist's point of view, which is outdated and biased. 		The *rival government* is now more of a political party (KMT) in Taiwan, more than half of people do not agree with KMT, which is clearly shown in the Taipei mayor election last November. Most people don't even consider or interest if China would ever be under Taiwanese government's ruling, most people are happy with peaceful relationship between China and Taiwan. 		On purchasing arms, with Chinese government currently having missiles aiming at Taiwan, it's reasonable for Taiwan to attempt to build defense against possible invasion from China. (Pretty sure no one in right mind on the small island of Taiwan would consider invading China.) 		Perhaps this is a chicken and egg thing, but I would say the hostility restarted from Chinese government's doing in the recent years. China can not be friendly to Taiwan, why would **people** in Taiwan be willing to join the people who threaten them?

{"body":"I think people under age of 40 in Taiwan generally stopped caring about that part of history of ruling China, my grandfather had a dream of be able to go back to Mainland before he passed to visit his parents graves which he couldn't do so, ironically he fought against the Japanese yet it was the communists that killed his parents, he was one of the last few that escaped to Taiwan in 1950, so he had very strong feeling about the communists, when I was in school we were still taught that we'll reunite the mainland, BUT as we got older we kinda go..... yeaaa...... it's ok, Taiwan is home, and we are happy with our islands.		Military is a funny thing on the island, many guys have fond memories of their services, so no matter how you cut it, we will always have a romantic idea of military presence, the time you spent with your friends (or male cousins).

As far as this incident, meh, idiots will be idiots, I've met plenty of Chinese from mainland who were pleasant and polite, they realize the difference between the two places, life is too short to be bickering about these type of things, grab a Taiwanese Beer and eat some Beijing/Peking Duck while watching Korean movies.","depth":6,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DewyCox","name":"t1_coifn9g","parent_id":"t1_coib2ct","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423683930,"created_utc":1423683930}

{"body":"Not trying to downvote you at all; I agree with a lot of what you say.

I wouldn't say most of them (us) had any sense of a 'unified China', of which they were some inseparable and inviolate part (especially not after the successive governments of European colonists, Konxinga, the Qing dynasty, Japanese imperialists).		b) The modern, 20th and 21st century version of a 'unified China' was imported to Taiwan by the ROC government, which outlawed the use of Hokkien and Hakka in schools and many other public places. There was a deliberate process of mainland/Mandarin-centric Sinicization, involving monetary fines, legal repression, and outright violence to undo the influence of Japanese colonization, as well as what the Nationalists perceived to be the 'less-civilized', 'less evolved' native culture of the pre-existing inhabitants, both Han and aboriginal.		c) All of which is to say, yes people in Taiwan today speak Mandarin, and many of the young know no other language fluently. But this is not because some pure form of Chinese culture (which obviously doesn't even exist) has been passed down to them intact over 4000 years, or because their 'blood' somehow automatically makes them culturally Chinese. There is a rather terrible history of repression and erasure (as well as more modern currents of globalization) behind the shared language/culture that is presented today.  		d) I am all for friendly relations between Chinese and Taiwanese people!

Are you talking about culture? if so then I suppose KMT ROC did nothing during the 40 odd year of emergency rule to adress that? then again who isn't watching Attaching Attack on titans these days on Crunchyroll.  		with regard to Holland, i'm sure your beloved symbol Koxinga did something to those Dutch settlers... something about gtfo...what was it...sry 300 years is a very long time ago for such a small span of history (less than 38 years)?		And the natives today account for ~500k on an island with +23mill people, yup.. significant influence. wouldn't Indonesia also have significant influence on taiwan also with ~150k then? 		4. how did the ROC map go again....? you know about conquering and all.... and Mongolia....sorry my memory is just failing me today. 		5. it was a civil fucking war not a rebellion, both sides wanted the whole god damn pie, 1 side is acting like a sore winner, and the other one a sore loser.

{"body":"Actually, the conditions that created the two situations aren't completely dissimilar. China/Taiwan relations are rocky because there were two revolutions on the mainland, but only one on Taiwan. Before the revolutions, Taiwan had been under the control of the Japanese, but the largest ethno-cultural group was Han Chinese. After the nationalist revolution succeeded in china and after Japan was defeated in World War 2, Taiwan was given to the Republic of China. At the time (1945) the communists were revolting in china, and trying to establish a communist state, when they won, the nationalist government escaped to Taiwan and continued to claim sovereignty over the mainland. Now most people in Taiwan aren't trying to claim the mainland, but are trying to remain separate from it, while mainland, now communist, china claims it has a right over Taiwan. Both sides at first claimed the whole of China as it was before the Communist revolution in china, so it made sense for countries to recognize one or the other.		Now on to Korea. Like Taiwan, Korea was controlled by Japan right before the end of World War 2.  When Japan was defeated, the plan was to restore Korea to unified independence. However, the commissions set up by the Soviet Union and United States couldn't come to an agreement on the formation of the future government of Korea. The US had been presiding over the south side of the 38th parallel and the USSR the north side. When talks broke down the UN decided to recognize only the Republic of Korea (the south Korean government) as the rightful ruler of a unified Korea. However, the northern side invaded two year later, sparking the Korean War, which continues to this day. Most countries still don't recognize the DPRK (North Korea) as having a right to rule, but as a de facto ruler who happens to have nuclear weapons due to Chinese communists not thinking clearly.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Taisaw","name":"t1_cohzcl6","parent_id":"t1_cohyl59","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423644338,"created_utc":1423644338}

Taiwan's value would be totally destroyed if it were invaded -- it's like Hong Kong. There are no natural resources here, it's just a trade hub, which partially exists BECAUSE of the PRC.

As an aside, the two major political parties in the country of Taiwan are divided on the issue of whether to get closer or farther from China politically -- and the major trend seems to be that the two countries have become more and more deeply economically tied.

In my opinion, if the familial connection really mattered to those who were split they would have found a way to reunite by now. Any attempt by the chinese government to intervine is shameful of Chinese, the same goes for Taiwan, just I have no reason to believe Taiwanese would do such... in fact would likely use china as an example of why not to do such.		Alternatively there were families who wanted to split and saw their opportunity to do so conveniently.
