Tyranny is not a nation where critics of the government are not only allowed, but televised and celebrated.  Tyranny is not a nation where you can buy a full meal for less than an hour's worth of work. Tyranny is not a nation ostensibly at peace, where even its poorest citizens can be assured of food and water.		Are there serious problems with US government? Yes.  Are there resounding issues with law enforcement, regulations, policies, and courts? Yes. But please, this is still a nation of free people.

If, at any time, the senator does not represent his state with maximum ferocity, or makes a deal that is not in the best interest of his state, the people of that state can recall him via the legislature.

The problem is, there's no vehicle for enforcement of promises.  If a senator promises he'll do 50 things once elected, and then does none of them, there is no penalty, there is no enforcement body,  there are very few repercussions.		By eliminating the 17th amendment and restoring the constitution to its original functionality when it comes to senators, suddenly the state legislature (a direct extension of the will of the people) will have recall ability as well as an ability to give senators exact missions instead of broad guidelines.  		We drastically changed who a senator answers to with the 17th amendment.  We did it under the guise of "increasing democracy" but the effects have been disastrous.  		People get elected, then fail to deliver on any of their promises, and there's not much we can do about it.  My proposed change keeps them honest and on-mission.

{"body":"So this is a common misconception. There is no such thing as secret laws. The reason those judges decisions are secret is because it's a warrant/subpoena court. (it's not a trial court. It's not a court that creates or decides on laws. The court does not rule on a law's interpretation either, only how it applies in a **specific case**).		Think about that for a second. If you issue a warrant in your court as a judge. Would you want your ruling to be public? No. You wouldn't. If the public knows you issued a warrant, then so does the criminal for whom you issued a warrant or subpoena. 		It would defeat the purpose of a subpoena or warrant. Rulings are warrants and subpoenas should never be made public except when the police are already at the door saying "warrraaaaant". That's the only time anyone needs to be informed of a warrant.  Otherwise you will destroy the evidence and run away as soon as you hear "the public ruling of a judge issuing a warrant."		Say that FISA court, the secret court, rules that Google must turn over accounts of such and such. Those guys will delete everything and leave the country. That's why there are gag orders and such laws. Because if the company tells its users that such and such was revealed, **it defeats the purpose** of a warrant/subpoena. 		You might as well never investigate anything. Criminals will always be aware you are coming after them and will destroy evidence by the time you get permission to get the evidence in the first place. You can't catch a criminal if the criminal knows you're after him.		**In reddit's Utopia: if court rulings on subpoenas/warrants are always public information as some redditors want. Then law enforcement might as well never seek a warrant/subpoena, because it's completely useless. Your argument to want more honesty/transparency will essentially make it a useless tool for law enforcement. It's self-defeating.**		**edit:** Guys, with all due respect, if you have a warrant court and its warrants are publicly announced, then those warrants will NOT be useful ever.

Yes, and that's why nobody's restricting the public from reading the bill once it's a final document that is actually being presented as a potential law.

I don't need to 		>The State Department legislating by keeping congress in the dark		The State Department is literally not keeping Congress in the dark, they're allowing Senators and aides with clearance to view the drafts, they're only taking measures to ensure the Senators don't leak the drafts to the public, which they absolutely would, as it is there are Senators who are disclosing information that really shouldn't be disclosed until the treaty is made available to the public, despite the treaty remaining secret until it is actually made available. 		I'm not a huge free trade guy myself, and I won't form a solid opinion on the bill until I've read the document myself, but the objections to the treaty seem to be all about the procedural issues, which are: 		-The fact that the actual trade negotiations are classified.		-The fast tracking of the bill prohibiting amendments from being appended to the treaty. 		-The fast tracking of the bill forcing Senators to either vote for or against the bill after only having access to it for a month. 		So, to clarify my argument, I am in favor of trade negotiations being secret in order to maximize the State Department's flexibility which ideally secures the best possible terms for the United States. I am in favor to the fast tracking of the treaty in order to allow a treaty to be passed or rejected as it is and not to saddle it down with special terms and conditions added by Senators that are not acceptable to any other signatories to the treaty, rendering it meaningless.

And with GITMO's technically legal detention of accused terrorists (...foreover?) we can see how it can be gamed procedurally (sorry, you aren't technically in the U.S., so you are not afforded Constitutional protections).* 		Classifying drafts of a trade agreement, as if their contents were nuclear secrets is an abuse. 		>National security secrecy may be appropriate to protect us from our enemies; it should not be used to protect our politicians from us. For an administration that paints itself as dedicated to transparency and public input, the insistence on extensive secrecy in trade is disappointing and disingenuous. And the secrecy of trade negotiations does not just hide information from the public. It creates a funnel where powerful interests congregate, absent the checks, balances and necessary hurdles of the democratic process.		http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/opinion/dont-keep-trade-talks-secret.html?_r=0		If it is to become the "procedure" of the U.S. government to classify talks which would wither under public scrutiny, then the "procedure" has gone wrong. **There is a BIG difference between holding talks in private and invoking the power of state secrets to make it a felony to be a whistle-blower.** 		As for lack of ability to mend, this does not, by itself, make me lose my cookies, but it is a significant aspect, in context. This is an "all in" move by the Obama Administration. Take it or leave it. Period. This is a strategic removal of any possible middle ground. 		As for time pressure, one again this is pressure. *"Just trust us, it's a good thing, it will create all those jobs, sign here."*  		And while I am glad that you think we should only need to spend a month deliberating over a massive trade deal that has ramifications for national sovereignty, intellectual property, the environment, and global economy, I submit that we would be fools not to take all necessary time to deliberate, especially when secretly negotiated legislation is rammed down our throats. 		And stop blaming the victims here. *"Well, if Senators were literate, they could figure it out."* Understanding hundred of pages of complex jargon-laden text is a challenge for even the most literate person. Deciding on this legislation is not the only task they will have during this time period. To unpack this thing, to understand it's ramifications, to tease out the caveats, they need time. So stop being an ass and suggesting that the Senate is too stupid to do their job.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tisias","name":"t1_crbbfvv","parent_id":"t1_crayd5y","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431811425,"created_utc":1431807825}

{"body":"[Fascism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism) - a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.		  That is what we need to be looking at here. Look at the definition of fascism. The US government is clearly not fascist. As for that stupid list everyone keeps arguing about, I think it's mostly a load of crap. Here's why:		1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" This totally applies to the US, but not in the way the list wants you to think. American patriotism is not sinister like the list suggests. For the most part, Nationalism is not force fed to citizens. What government in the world doesn't want its citizens to be supportive of it? Where are all of these flags? There is a flag at each government building, and that's about it. We aren't forced to wave flags around.		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights"... "The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc." Really? Do you honestly think this applies to the US? Yes, there have been and are situations where the US has ignored human rights. HOWEVER, the list says there is "disdain for the recognition of human rights" Disdain means to despise or scorn. You have to be a fool to think the US despises human rights. The list says that citizens ignore it. We all know that's a blatant lie if you think this applies to the US.		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" On the surface, maybe this applies to the US, but personally, I don't agree. Yes Communism and terrorism have been used as justifications for wars, but we don't blame every single problem on terrorists or communists. Also, who in their right mind wouldn't be opposed to terrorists? Are you trying to tell me it's bad for people, or a nation to stand up to terrorists? That's a load of crap.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" This is probably the most accurate point on this list. However, There are not "widespread domestic problems" as the list states. Obviously there are huge problems in the US, but average Americans are WAY better off than pretty much every oppressed person in a fascist state. Our citizens have food, industry, jobs, and plenty of opportunities for education. On top of that, the economy is still pretty strong, and has been since the 40's. Yes, there have been downturns, but not Great Depression level issues. The military gets so much funding because for better or for worse, the US is a big target for attack and is also the primary source of global security. 		5. "Rampant Sexism" Please. Open your eyes. There is sexism, but NOTHING like the list states.		6. "Controlled Mass Media" No. Our media is almost completely uncensored by the government. Nearly every media outlet in the US has a political agenda, but if the media was controlled by the government, all of the outlets would only be spewing a constant stream of support for the government and our politicians. We all know the media is not controlled by the government. It's also not just what we see on TV. There is almost no censorship of media on the internet. This point on the list is true of a fascist state, but in no way applies to the US.		7. " Obsession with National Security" My argument for this is very similar to point number 4. The US is a target. We need good national security. I agree that the methods are, at times, flawed, but we can't pretend like there isn't a need for national security.		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" This one is in the constitution. Check out the 1st Amendment. Politicians use religion to try to appeal to voters, and at times follow their religion when making policy. The first part of that doesn't matter. The second part can be an issue, but if it annoys the people it affects, the law is usually overturned by the judicial branch. 		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" Businesses don't put people in office. Voters do that. The legal protections and breaks for businesses are due to  political ideologies. Politicians cannot legally directly make laws to benefit specific businesses they are involved with.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Ha. Labor unions still have a lot of power. The government is not afraid of organized workers. Look at how the minimum wag is increasing around the country right now. This is because of pressure from workers.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" This does not apply in any way whatsoever to the US. I have not even the slightest idea how people think this point applies to the US. Look at FAFSA. That is the government directly funding higher education. Government buildings are filled with art and murals. Each branch of the military has a band. The US has no disdain for Intellectuals and arts.		12. " Obsession with Crime and Punishment" From the list, "The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism." Have you been hiding under a rock for the past year, and especially the last few months? The list talks about a national police force with limitless power. If that were the case, all of you goons touting this stupid list would be in jail by now.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" It's rare to hear about politicians in the US stealing tax money, or doing other corrupt things. Leadership positions are not just handed out by a dictator, we vote for nearly every important position in government. The positions citizens don't vote on are almost always required to be approved by congress. Few positions can just be handed out.		14. " Fraudulent Elections" I'm not going to waste my time refuting this point because it so obviously does not apply to the United States.","depth":5,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MadeAccounToComment","name":"t1_cracbob","parent_id":"t1_cra8mh8","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431723010,"created_utc":1431719410}
{"body":"1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" Nationalism is force fed to people, not as adults but definitely as students in middle and high school, if you read many modern textbooks they are bordering on propaganda. Do you know the origins of labor day? Did you get a glimpse on the bullshit we've been pulling in south America and Africa for decades? Compare [this](http://www.dol.gov/laborday/history.htm) to the [actual history](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/business-july-dec01-labor_day_9-2/)		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights" we have the worlds highest [incarceration rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) coupled with [secret police](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/28/activists-protest-alleged-chicago-police-black-sites/24180197/) coupled with [active torture programs](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/12/cia-torture-report-released%20) on both american and foreign citizens. You can not argue that we view prison rape (on men at least) as an acceptable thing within our culture and do not view solitary confinement as the torture that it is like the rest of the world. 		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" Because terrorism is a [*REALLY SERIOUS OH MY GOD HOLY SHIT*](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818) threat in the united states... If that doesn't fit the exact definition of a scapegoat I don't know what does. Terrorism is a problem, I'm not arguing it isn't but we are spending *billions* of dollars fighting a *miniscule* problem and not only spending money, but creating bills like the patriot act, the NSA, expanding public forfeiture to include potential for terrorism.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" well yeah a little [obvious](http://nation.time.com/2012/09/25/comparing-defense-budgets-apples-to-apples/)... As far as domestic problems it depends on what you define as "widespread domestic problems" and so I'm not going to debade that unless it is clarified further. but "the US is a big target for attack" is ridiculous. We have enough firepower to obliterate the next six top military nations, it would take most of the world in order to attack the united states on top of it being difficult to attack due to having an entire ocean on either side of it separating it from the rest of the world. We are not likely to be attacked anytime in the near future due primarily to location and that we are one of the primary sources of global *stability* due to our large economic power (which has been dwindling for decades).		5. "Rampant Sexism" I actually agree with you...		6. "Controlled Mass Media" not government... [corporations](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) and that is one of the very large reasons that net nutrality needs to remain in place and bills like the TPP absolutely *can not be passed* because if they do then the internet will be able to be censored along with traditional news sources, it's not North Korea and only just verging on Russia.		7. "Obsession with National Security" The US is *not* a primary target for an international conflict please provide sources showing otherwise(you make a claim you support it). We do need national security but when you create concepts like ["secret evidence"](http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=clevstlrev) to " supports the use of secrecy, particularly in cases involving Arabs and Muslims suspected of terrorism or association with terrorist groups."(pg 9) then you are obsessed with national security in a *very* bad way...		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" It is in the constitution but the constitution is not being followed. This is one of the biggest arguments about having "God" in the pledge of alegience, it's not that there is anything wrong with "God" but that it is a direct violation of the 1st amendment. In addition to creating textbooks with [religious leanings](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/us-usa-texas-textbooks-idUSKCN0J51NU20141121) or [look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress) what happens when you use a book other than the bible to swear into congress by. You are right, we are not a secular state yet, but we are heading down a slippery slope leading to christian fundamentalism.		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" people may put our government into office but it doesn't matter, only within the top 10% [do your votes make any difference on the policies which are enacted](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html) or [in a nice video fromat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig) this guarantees that corporate power is protected as there is no way for the american population to enact change.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Labor unions don't have a lot of power unless they have a lot of money(see point 9) and minimum wage is not increasing but [rather decreasing](http://www.dol.gov/minwage/minwage-gdp-history.htm). If they were powerful [this](http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/) would not be the case as the power of labor would be increasing... not decreasing.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" We don't have an open disdain but we are certainly harming our education system big time with [standardized testing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/22/11-problems-created-by-the-standardized-testing-obsession/) increases in [college tuition](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html) and [unforgivable outrageous student loans](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/surprising-reasons-for-the-student-debt-crisis/) which is seriously impacting our [standing](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/12/03/248329823/u-s-high-school-students-slide-in-math-reading-science) in math, science and reading.		12. "Obsession with Crime and Punishment" highest incarceration rate in the world(linked above), willing to overlook police abuses, [yes](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/is-stop-and-frisk-worth-it/358644/), [yes](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-kill-citizens-70-times-rate-first-world-nations/) and [yes](ww.google.com). Our police are known to [take any and all of your posessions](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/american-shakedown-police-won-t-charge-you-but-they-ll-grab-your-money-1.2760736), immunity to first-degree murder while on the job, immunity to planting evidence and lying in court, immunity to assault and battery charges and immunity to breaking and entering(I feel I don't need to link to all of the above... unless you've been living under a rock...). I would be willing to bet several of us have been put onto a no-fly list at one point in time or another due to political activism. The united state police have unlimited power and this category is one of the scariest and fastest moving in this entire list.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" Corruption is legal in america, we only vote for a few of our national level politicians(congress, senate and president) and local level elections can vary rather widely. Go back to the video I linked above detailing how corruption is legal in america and tell me it isn't. 		14. "Fraudulent Elections" Yes actually we use a first past the post voting system which has a host of [problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) this is coupled with extreme cases of [gerymandering](http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2010/11/11/the-top-ten-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts-in-the-united-states/) plus anyone with a felony can not vote [which is a large portion of the population](https://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/what-percentage-of-us-adult-population-that-has-a-felony-conviction/) disenfranchises many people from getting their voices heard. That coupled with the problems in 13. means that you have no say over the political process and as such you are left with puppet elections, in other words your vote doesn't count...		Do I think we are a fascist state... no... but we sure as hell are headed in that direction and rather quickly, however the american fascist state will be interesting as the state will be run by large corporations running puppet governments rather than the other way around.		For future reference I recommend you try to follow up every claim with evidence to support said claim. I am far from perfect but it goes a long way into helping people realize if you are being accurate or shitting smoke out of your ass, currently I feel like I am in a very bad smelling hot box.

{"body":"[Fascism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism) - a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.		  That is what we need to be looking at here. Look at the definition of fascism. The US government is clearly not fascist. As for that stupid list everyone keeps arguing about, I think it's mostly a load of crap. Here's why:		1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" This totally applies to the US, but not in the way the list wants you to think. American patriotism is not sinister like the list suggests. For the most part, Nationalism is not force fed to citizens. What government in the world doesn't want its citizens to be supportive of it? Where are all of these flags? There is a flag at each government building, and that's about it. We aren't forced to wave flags around.		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights"... "The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc." Really? Do you honestly think this applies to the US? Yes, there have been and are situations where the US has ignored human rights. HOWEVER, the list says there is "disdain for the recognition of human rights" Disdain means to despise or scorn. You have to be a fool to think the US despises human rights. The list says that citizens ignore it. We all know that's a blatant lie if you think this applies to the US.		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" On the surface, maybe this applies to the US, but personally, I don't agree. Yes Communism and terrorism have been used as justifications for wars, but we don't blame every single problem on terrorists or communists. Also, who in their right mind wouldn't be opposed to terrorists? Are you trying to tell me it's bad for people, or a nation to stand up to terrorists? That's a load of crap.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" This is probably the most accurate point on this list. However, There are not "widespread domestic problems" as the list states. Obviously there are huge problems in the US, but average Americans are WAY better off than pretty much every oppressed person in a fascist state. Our citizens have food, industry, jobs, and plenty of opportunities for education. On top of that, the economy is still pretty strong, and has been since the 40's. Yes, there have been downturns, but not Great Depression level issues. The military gets so much funding because for better or for worse, the US is a big target for attack and is also the primary source of global security. 		5. "Rampant Sexism" Please. Open your eyes. There is sexism, but NOTHING like the list states.		6. "Controlled Mass Media" No. Our media is almost completely uncensored by the government. Nearly every media outlet in the US has a political agenda, but if the media was controlled by the government, all of the outlets would only be spewing a constant stream of support for the government and our politicians. We all know the media is not controlled by the government. It's also not just what we see on TV. There is almost no censorship of media on the internet. This point on the list is true of a fascist state, but in no way applies to the US.		7. " Obsession with National Security" My argument for this is very similar to point number 4. The US is a target. We need good national security. I agree that the methods are, at times, flawed, but we can't pretend like there isn't a need for national security.		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" This one is in the constitution. Check out the 1st Amendment. Politicians use religion to try to appeal to voters, and at times follow their religion when making policy. The first part of that doesn't matter. The second part can be an issue, but if it annoys the people it affects, the law is usually overturned by the judicial branch. 		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" Businesses don't put people in office. Voters do that. The legal protections and breaks for businesses are due to  political ideologies. Politicians cannot legally directly make laws to benefit specific businesses they are involved with.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Ha. Labor unions still have a lot of power. The government is not afraid of organized workers. Look at how the minimum wag is increasing around the country right now. This is because of pressure from workers.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" This does not apply in any way whatsoever to the US. I have not even the slightest idea how people think this point applies to the US. Look at FAFSA. That is the government directly funding higher education. Government buildings are filled with art and murals. Each branch of the military has a band. The US has no disdain for Intellectuals and arts.		12. " Obsession with Crime and Punishment" From the list, "The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism." Have you been hiding under a rock for the past year, and especially the last few months? The list talks about a national police force with limitless power. If that were the case, all of you goons touting this stupid list would be in jail by now.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" It's rare to hear about politicians in the US stealing tax money, or doing other corrupt things. Leadership positions are not just handed out by a dictator, we vote for nearly every important position in government. The positions citizens don't vote on are almost always required to be approved by congress. Few positions can just be handed out.		14. " Fraudulent Elections" I'm not going to waste my time refuting this point because it so obviously does not apply to the United States.","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MadeAccounToComment","name":"t1_crac8gs","parent_id":"t1_cra77rt","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431722864,"created_utc":1431719264}
{"body":"1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" Nationalism is force fed to people, not as adults but definitely as students in middle and high school, if you read many modern textbooks they are bordering on propaganda. Do you know the origins of labor day? Did you get a glimpse on the bullshit we've been pulling in south America and Africa for decades? Compare [this](http://www.dol.gov/laborday/history.htm) to the [actual history](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/business-july-dec01-labor_day_9-2/)		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights" we have the worlds highest [incarceration rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) coupled with [secret police](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/28/activists-protest-alleged-chicago-police-black-sites/24180197/) coupled with [active torture programs](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/12/cia-torture-report-released%20) on both american and foreign citizens. You can not argue that we view prison rape (on men at least) as an acceptable thing within our culture and do not view solitary confinement as the torture that it is like the rest of the world. 		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" Because terrorism is a [*REALLY SERIOUS OH MY GOD HOLY SHIT*](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818) threat in the united states... If that doesn't fit the exact definition of a scapegoat I don't know what does. Terrorism is a problem, I'm not arguing it isn't but we are spending *billions* of dollars fighting a *miniscule* problem and not only spending money, but creating bills like the patriot act, the NSA, expanding public forfeiture to include potential for terrorism.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" well yeah a little [obvious](http://nation.time.com/2012/09/25/comparing-defense-budgets-apples-to-apples/)... As far as domestic problems it depends on what you define as "widespread domestic problems" and so I'm not going to debade that unless it is clarified further. but "the US is a big target for attack" is ridiculous. We have enough firepower to obliterate the next six top military nations, it would take most of the world in order to attack the united states on top of it being difficult to attack due to having an entire ocean on either side of it separating it from the rest of the world. We are not likely to be attacked anytime in the near future due primarily to location and that we are one of the primary sources of global *stability* due to our large economic power (which has been dwindling for decades).		5. "Rampant Sexism" I actually agree with you...		6. "Controlled Mass Media" not government... [corporations](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) and that is one of the very large reasons that net nutrality needs to remain in place and bills like the TPP absolutely *can not be passed* because if they do then the internet will be able to be censored along with traditional news sources, it's not North Korea and only just verging on Russia.		7. "Obsession with National Security" The US is *not* a primary target for an international conflict please provide sources showing otherwise(you make a claim you support it). We do need national security but when you create concepts like ["secret evidence"](http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=clevstlrev) to " supports the use of secrecy, particularly in cases involving Arabs and Muslims suspected of terrorism or association with terrorist groups."(pg 9) then you are obsessed with national security in a *very* bad way...		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" It is in the constitution but the constitution is not being followed. This is one of the biggest arguments about having "God" in the pledge of alegience, it's not that there is anything wrong with "God" but that it is a direct violation of the 1st amendment. In addition to creating textbooks with [religious leanings](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/us-usa-texas-textbooks-idUSKCN0J51NU20141121) or [look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress) what happens when you use a book other than the bible to swear into congress by. You are right, we are not a secular state yet, but we are heading down a slippery slope leading to christian fundamentalism.		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" people may put our government into office but it doesn't matter, only within the top 10% [do your votes make any difference on the policies which are enacted](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html) or [in a nice video fromat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig) this guarantees that corporate power is protected as there is no way for the american population to enact change.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Labor unions don't have a lot of power unless they have a lot of money(see point 9) and minimum wage is not increasing but [rather decreasing](http://www.dol.gov/minwage/minwage-gdp-history.htm). If they were powerful [this](http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/) would not be the case as the power of labor would be increasing... not decreasing.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" We don't have an open disdain but we are certainly harming our education system big time with [standardized testing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/22/11-problems-created-by-the-standardized-testing-obsession/) increases in [college tuition](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html) and [unforgivable outrageous student loans](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/surprising-reasons-for-the-student-debt-crisis/) which is seriously impacting our [standing](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/12/03/248329823/u-s-high-school-students-slide-in-math-reading-science) in math, science and reading.		12. "Obsession with Crime and Punishment" highest incarceration rate in the world(linked above), willing to overlook police abuses, [yes](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/is-stop-and-frisk-worth-it/358644/), [yes](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-kill-citizens-70-times-rate-first-world-nations/) and [yes](ww.google.com). Our police are known to [take any and all of your posessions](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/american-shakedown-police-won-t-charge-you-but-they-ll-grab-your-money-1.2760736), immunity to first-degree murder while on the job, immunity to planting evidence and lying in court, immunity to assault and battery charges and immunity to breaking and entering(I feel I don't need to link to all of the above... unless you've been living under a rock...). I would be willing to bet several of us have been put onto a no-fly list at one point in time or another due to political activism. The united state police have unlimited power and this category is one of the scariest and fastest moving in this entire list.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" Corruption is legal in america, we only vote for a few of our national level politicians(congress, senate and president) and local level elections can vary rather widely. Go back to the video I linked above detailing how corruption is legal in america and tell me it isn't. 		14. "Fraudulent Elections" Yes actually we use a first past the post voting system which has a host of [problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) this is coupled with extreme cases of [gerymandering](http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2010/11/11/the-top-ten-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts-in-the-united-states/) plus anyone with a felony can not vote [which is a large portion of the population](https://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/what-percentage-of-us-adult-population-that-has-a-felony-conviction/) disenfranchises many people from getting their voices heard. That coupled with the problems in 13. means that you have no say over the political process and as such you are left with puppet elections, in other words your vote doesn't count...		Do I think we are a fascist state... no... but we sure as hell are headed in that direction and rather quickly, however the american fascist state will be interesting as the state will be run by large corporations running puppet governments rather than the other way around.		For future reference I recommend you try to follow up every claim with evidence to support said claim. I am far from perfect but it goes a long way into helping people realize if you are being accurate or shitting smoke out of your ass, currently I feel like I am in a very bad smelling hot box.

{"body":">1\. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.		>2\. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.		>3\. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.		>4\. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.		>6\. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.		>9\. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.		>10\. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. 		>12\. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. 		>13\. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

{"body":"[Fascism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism) - a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.		  That is what we need to be looking at here. Look at the definition of fascism. The US government is clearly not fascist. As for that stupid list everyone keeps arguing about, I think it's mostly a load of crap. Here's why:		1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" This totally applies to the US, but not in the way the list wants you to think. American patriotism is not sinister like the list suggests. For the most part, Nationalism is not force fed to citizens. What government in the world doesn't want its citizens to be supportive of it? Where are all of these flags? There is a flag at each government building, and that's about it. We aren't forced to wave flags around.		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights"... "The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc." Really? Do you honestly think this applies to the US? Yes, there have been and are situations where the US has ignored human rights. HOWEVER, the list says there is "disdain for the recognition of human rights" Disdain means to despise or scorn. You have to be a fool to think the US despises human rights. The list says that citizens ignore it. We all know that's a blatant lie if you think this applies to the US.		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" On the surface, maybe this applies to the US, but personally, I don't agree. Yes Communism and terrorism have been used as justifications for wars, but we don't blame every single problem on terrorists or communists. Also, who in their right mind wouldn't be opposed to terrorists? Are you trying to tell me it's bad for people, or a nation to stand up to terrorists? That's a load of crap.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" This is probably the most accurate point on this list. However, There are not "widespread domestic problems" as the list states. Obviously there are huge problems in the US, but average Americans are WAY better off than pretty much every oppressed person in a fascist state. Our citizens have food, industry, jobs, and plenty of opportunities for education. On top of that, the economy is still pretty strong, and has been since the 40's. Yes, there have been downturns, but not Great Depression level issues. The military gets so much funding because for better or for worse, the US is a big target for attack and is also the primary source of global security. 		5. "Rampant Sexism" Please. Open your eyes. There is sexism, but NOTHING like the list states.		6. "Controlled Mass Media" No. Our media is almost completely uncensored by the government. Nearly every media outlet in the US has a political agenda, but if the media was controlled by the government, all of the outlets would only be spewing a constant stream of support for the government and our politicians. We all know the media is not controlled by the government. It's also not just what we see on TV. There is almost no censorship of media on the internet. This point on the list is true of a fascist state, but in no way applies to the US.		7. " Obsession with National Security" My argument for this is very similar to point number 4. The US is a target. We need good national security. I agree that the methods are, at times, flawed, but we can't pretend like there isn't a need for national security.		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" This one is in the constitution. Check out the 1st Amendment. Politicians use religion to try to appeal to voters, and at times follow their religion when making policy. The first part of that doesn't matter. The second part can be an issue, but if it annoys the people it affects, the law is usually overturned by the judicial branch. 		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" Businesses don't put people in office. Voters do that. The legal protections and breaks for businesses are due to  political ideologies. Politicians cannot legally directly make laws to benefit specific businesses they are involved with.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Ha. Labor unions still have a lot of power. The government is not afraid of organized workers. Look at how the minimum wag is increasing around the country right now. This is because of pressure from workers.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" This does not apply in any way whatsoever to the US. I have not even the slightest idea how people think this point applies to the US. Look at FAFSA. That is the government directly funding higher education. Government buildings are filled with art and murals. Each branch of the military has a band. The US has no disdain for Intellectuals and arts.		12. " Obsession with Crime and Punishment" From the list, "The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism." Have you been hiding under a rock for the past year, and especially the last few months? The list talks about a national police force with limitless power. If that were the case, all of you goons touting this stupid list would be in jail by now.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" It's rare to hear about politicians in the US stealing tax money, or doing other corrupt things. Leadership positions are not just handed out by a dictator, we vote for nearly every important position in government. The positions citizens don't vote on are almost always required to be approved by congress. Few positions can just be handed out.		14. " Fraudulent Elections" I'm not going to waste my time refuting this point because it so obviously does not apply to the United States.","depth":7,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MadeAccounToComment","name":"t1_crace52","parent_id":"t1_cra7d1a","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431723123,"created_utc":1431719523}
{"body":"1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" Nationalism is force fed to people, not as adults but definitely as students in middle and high school, if you read many modern textbooks they are bordering on propaganda. Do you know the origins of labor day? Did you get a glimpse on the bullshit we've been pulling in south America and Africa for decades? Compare [this](http://www.dol.gov/laborday/history.htm) to the [actual history](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/business-july-dec01-labor_day_9-2/)		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights" we have the worlds highest [incarceration rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) coupled with [secret police](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/28/activists-protest-alleged-chicago-police-black-sites/24180197/) coupled with [active torture programs](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/12/cia-torture-report-released%20) on both american and foreign citizens. You can not argue that we view prison rape (on men at least) as an acceptable thing within our culture and do not view solitary confinement as the torture that it is like the rest of the world. 		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" Because terrorism is a [*REALLY SERIOUS OH MY GOD HOLY SHIT*](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818) threat in the united states... If that doesn't fit the exact definition of a scapegoat I don't know what does. Terrorism is a problem, I'm not arguing it isn't but we are spending *billions* of dollars fighting a *miniscule* problem and not only spending money, but creating bills like the patriot act, the NSA, expanding public forfeiture to include potential for terrorism.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" well yeah a little [obvious](http://nation.time.com/2012/09/25/comparing-defense-budgets-apples-to-apples/)... As far as domestic problems it depends on what you define as "widespread domestic problems" and so I'm not going to debade that unless it is clarified further. but "the US is a big target for attack" is ridiculous. We have enough firepower to obliterate the next six top military nations, it would take most of the world in order to attack the united states on top of it being difficult to attack due to having an entire ocean on either side of it separating it from the rest of the world. We are not likely to be attacked anytime in the near future due primarily to location and that we are one of the primary sources of global *stability* due to our large economic power (which has been dwindling for decades).		5. "Rampant Sexism" I actually agree with you...		6. "Controlled Mass Media" not government... [corporations](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) and that is one of the very large reasons that net nutrality needs to remain in place and bills like the TPP absolutely *can not be passed* because if they do then the internet will be able to be censored along with traditional news sources, it's not North Korea and only just verging on Russia.		7. "Obsession with National Security" The US is *not* a primary target for an international conflict please provide sources showing otherwise(you make a claim you support it). We do need national security but when you create concepts like ["secret evidence"](http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=clevstlrev) to " supports the use of secrecy, particularly in cases involving Arabs and Muslims suspected of terrorism or association with terrorist groups."(pg 9) then you are obsessed with national security in a *very* bad way...		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" It is in the constitution but the constitution is not being followed. This is one of the biggest arguments about having "God" in the pledge of alegience, it's not that there is anything wrong with "God" but that it is a direct violation of the 1st amendment. In addition to creating textbooks with [religious leanings](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/us-usa-texas-textbooks-idUSKCN0J51NU20141121) or [look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress) what happens when you use a book other than the bible to swear into congress by. You are right, we are not a secular state yet, but we are heading down a slippery slope leading to christian fundamentalism.		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" people may put our government into office but it doesn't matter, only within the top 10% [do your votes make any difference on the policies which are enacted](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html) or [in a nice video fromat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig) this guarantees that corporate power is protected as there is no way for the american population to enact change.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Labor unions don't have a lot of power unless they have a lot of money(see point 9) and minimum wage is not increasing but [rather decreasing](http://www.dol.gov/minwage/minwage-gdp-history.htm). If they were powerful [this](http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/) would not be the case as the power of labor would be increasing... not decreasing.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" We don't have an open disdain but we are certainly harming our education system big time with [standardized testing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/22/11-problems-created-by-the-standardized-testing-obsession/) increases in [college tuition](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html) and [unforgivable outrageous student loans](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/surprising-reasons-for-the-student-debt-crisis/) which is seriously impacting our [standing](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/12/03/248329823/u-s-high-school-students-slide-in-math-reading-science) in math, science and reading.		12. "Obsession with Crime and Punishment" highest incarceration rate in the world(linked above), willing to overlook police abuses, [yes](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/is-stop-and-frisk-worth-it/358644/), [yes](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-kill-citizens-70-times-rate-first-world-nations/) and [yes](ww.google.com). Our police are known to [take any and all of your posessions](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/american-shakedown-police-won-t-charge-you-but-they-ll-grab-your-money-1.2760736), immunity to first-degree murder while on the job, immunity to planting evidence and lying in court, immunity to assault and battery charges and immunity to breaking and entering(I feel I don't need to link to all of the above... unless you've been living under a rock...). I would be willing to bet several of us have been put onto a no-fly list at one point in time or another due to political activism. The united state police have unlimited power and this category is one of the scariest and fastest moving in this entire list.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" Corruption is legal in america, we only vote for a few of our national level politicians(congress, senate and president) and local level elections can vary rather widely. Go back to the video I linked above detailing how corruption is legal in america and tell me it isn't. 		14. "Fraudulent Elections" Yes actually we use a first past the post voting system which has a host of [problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) this is coupled with extreme cases of [gerymandering](http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2010/11/11/the-top-ten-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts-in-the-united-states/) plus anyone with a felony can not vote [which is a large portion of the population](https://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/what-percentage-of-us-adult-population-that-has-a-felony-conviction/) disenfranchises many people from getting their voices heard. That coupled with the problems in 13. means that you have no say over the political process and as such you are left with puppet elections, in other words your vote doesn't count...		Do I think we are a fascist state... no... but we sure as hell are headed in that direction and rather quickly, however the american fascist state will be interesting as the state will be run by large corporations running puppet governments rather than the other way around.		For future reference I recommend you try to follow up every claim with evidence to support said claim. I am far from perfect but it goes a long way into helping people realize if you are being accurate or shitting smoke out of your ass, currently I feel like I am in a very bad smelling hot box. Prove me wrong :)		edit: formatting","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jmerzian","name":"t1_cragbb2","parent_id":"t1_crace52","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1431729988,"created_utc":1431726388}

"Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights" we have the worlds highest [incarceration rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) coupled with [secret police](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/28/activists-protest-alleged-chicago-police-black-sites/24180197/) coupled with [active torture programs](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/12/cia-torture-report-released%20) on both american and foreign citizens. You can not argue that we view prison rape (on men at least) as an acceptable thing within our culture and do not view solitary confinement as the torture that it is like the rest of the world. 		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" Because terrorism is a [*REALLY SERIOUS OH MY GOD HOLY SHIT*](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818) threat in the united states... If that doesn't fit the exact definition of a scapegoat I don't know what does. Terrorism is a problem, I'm not arguing it isn't but we are spending *billions* of dollars fighting a *miniscule* problem and not only spending money, but creating bills like the patriot act, the NSA, expanding public forfeiture to include potential for terrorism.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" well yeah a little [obvious](http://nation.time.com/2012/09/25/comparing-defense-budgets-apples-to-apples/)... As far as domestic problems it depends on what you define as "widespread domestic problems" and so I'm not going to debade that unless it is clarified further. but "the US is a big target for attack" is ridiculous. We have enough firepower to obliterate the next six top military nations, it would take most of the world in order to attack the united states on top of it being difficult to attack due to having an entire ocean on either side of it separating it from the rest of the world. We are not likely to be attacked anytime in the near future due primarily to location and that we are one of the primary sources of global *stability* due to our large economic power (which has been dwindling for decades).		5. "Rampant Sexism" I actually agree with you...		6. "Controlled Mass Media" not government... [corporations](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) and that is one of the very large reasons that net nutrality needs to remain in place and bills like the TPP absolutely *can not be passed* because if they do then the internet will be able to be censored along with traditional news sources, it's not North Korea and only just verging on Russia.		7. "Obsession with National Security" The US is *not* a primary target for an international conflict please provide sources showing otherwise(you make a claim you support it). We do need national security but when you create concepts like ["secret evidence"](http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=clevstlrev) to " supports the use of secrecy, particularly in cases involving Arabs and Muslims suspected of terrorism or association with terrorist groups."(pg 9) then you are obsessed with national security in a *very* bad way...		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" It is in the constitution but the constitution is not being followed. This is one of the biggest arguments about having "God" in the pledge of alegience, it's not that there is anything wrong with "God" but that it is a direct violation of the 1st amendment. In addition to creating textbooks with [religious leanings](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/us-usa-texas-textbooks-idUSKCN0J51NU20141121) or [look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress) what happens when you use a book other than the bible to swear into congress by. You are right, we are not a secular state yet, but we are heading down a slippery slope leading to christian fundamentalism.		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" people may put our government into office but it doesn't matter, only within the top 10% [do your votes make any difference on the policies which are enacted](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9836.html) or [in a nice video fromat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig) this guarantees that corporate power is protected as there is no way for the american population to enact change.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Labor unions don't have a lot of power unless they have a lot of money(see point 9) and minimum wage is not increasing but [rather decreasing](http://www.dol.gov/minwage/minwage-gdp-history.htm). If they were powerful [this](http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/) would not be the case as the power of labor would be increasing... not decreasing.		11.

I would be willing to bet several of us have been put onto a no-fly list at one point in time or another due to political activism.

{"body":"[Fascism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism) - a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.		  That is what we need to be looking at here. Look at the definition of fascism. The US government is clearly not fascist. As for that stupid list everyone keeps arguing about, I think it's mostly a load of crap. Here's why:		1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" This totally applies to the US, but not in the way the list wants you to think. American patriotism is not sinister like the list suggests. For the most part, Nationalism is not force fed to citizens. What government in the world doesn't want its citizens to be supportive of it? Where are all of these flags? There is a flag at each government building, and that's about it. We aren't forced to wave flags around.		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights"... "The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc." Really? Do you honestly think this applies to the US? Yes, there have been and are situations where the US has ignored human rights. HOWEVER, the list says there is "disdain for the recognition of human rights" Disdain means to despise or scorn. You have to be a fool to think the US despises human rights. The list says that citizens ignore it. We all know that's a blatant lie if you think this applies to the US.		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" On the surface, maybe this applies to the US, but personally, I don't agree. Yes Communism and terrorism have been used as justifications for wars, but we don't blame every single problem on terrorists or communists. Also, who in their right mind wouldn't be opposed to terrorists? Are you trying to tell me it's bad for people, or a nation to stand up to terrorists? That's a load of crap.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" This is probably the most accurate point on this list. However, There are not "widespread domestic problems" as the list states. Obviously there are huge problems in the US, but average Americans are WAY better off than pretty much every oppressed person in a fascist state. Our citizens have food, industry, jobs, and plenty of opportunities for education. On top of that, the economy is still pretty strong, and has been since the 40's. Yes, there have been downturns, but not Great Depression level issues. The military gets so much funding because for better or for worse, the US is a big target for attack and is also the primary source of global security. 		5. "Rampant Sexism" Please. Open your eyes. There is sexism, but NOTHING like the list states.		6. "Controlled Mass Media" No. Our media is almost completely uncensored by the government. Nearly every media outlet in the US has a political agenda, but if the media was controlled by the government, all of the outlets would only be spewing a constant stream of support for the government and our politicians. We all know the media is not controlled by the government. It's also not just what we see on TV. There is almost no censorship of media on the internet. This point on the list is true of a fascist state, but in no way applies to the US.		7. " Obsession with National Security" My argument for this is very similar to point number 4. The US is a target. We need good national security. I agree that the methods are, at times, flawed, but we can't pretend like there isn't a need for national security.		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" This one is in the constitution. Check out the 1st Amendment. Politicians use religion to try to appeal to voters, and at times follow their religion when making policy. The first part of that doesn't matter. The second part can be an issue, but if it annoys the people it affects, the law is usually overturned by the judicial branch. 		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" Businesses don't put people in office. Voters do that. The legal protections and breaks for businesses are due to  political ideologies. Politicians cannot legally directly make laws to benefit specific businesses they are involved with.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Ha. Labor unions still have a lot of power. The government is not afraid of organized workers. Look at how the minimum wag is increasing around the country right now. This is because of pressure from workers.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" This does not apply in any way whatsoever to the US. I have not even the slightest idea how people think this point applies to the US. Look at FAFSA. That is the government directly funding higher education. Government buildings are filled with art and murals. Each branch of the military has a band. The US has no disdain for Intellectuals and arts.		12. " Obsession with Crime and Punishment" From the list, "The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism." Have you been hiding under a rock for the past year, and especially the last few months? The list talks about a national police force with limitless power. If that were the case, all of you goons touting this stupid list would be in jail by now.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" It's rare to hear about politicians in the US stealing tax money, or doing other corrupt things. Leadership positions are not just handed out by a dictator, we vote for nearly every important position in government. The positions citizens don't vote on are almost always required to be approved by congress. Few positions can just be handed out.		14.

Politicians cannot legally directly make laws to benefit specific businesses they are involved with.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Ha. Labor unions still have a lot of power. The government is not afraid of organized workers. Look at how the minimum wag is increasing around the country right now. This is because of pressure from workers.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" This does not apply in any way whatsoever to the US. I have not even the slightest idea how people think this point applies to the US. Look at FAFSA.

The US has no disdain for Intellectuals and arts.		12. " Obsession with Crime and Punishment" From the list, "The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism."

If that were the case, all of you goons touting this stupid list would be in jail by now.		13. "Rampant Cronyism and Corruption" It's rare to hear about politicians in the US stealing tax money, or doing other corrupt things.

You can not argue that we view prison rape (on men at least) as an acceptable thing within our culture and do not view solitary confinement as the torture that it is like the rest of the world. 		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" Because terrorism is a [*REALLY SERIOUS OH MY GOD HOLY SHIT*](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818) threat in the united states... If that doesn't fit the exact definition of a scapegoat I don't know what does.

As far as domestic problems it depends on what you define as "widespread domestic problems" and so I'm not going to debade that unless it is clarified further. but "the US is a big target for attack" is ridiculous. We have enough firepower to obliterate the next six top military nations, it would take most of the world in order to attack the united states on top of it being difficult to attack due to having an entire ocean on either side of it separating it from the rest of the world. We are not likely to be attacked anytime in the near future due primarily to location and that we are one of the primary sources of global *stability* due to our large economic power (which has been dwindling for decades).		5.

{"body":"[Fascism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fascism) - a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.		  That is what we need to be looking at here. Look at the definition of fascism. The US government is clearly not fascist. As for that stupid list everyone keeps arguing about, I think it's mostly a load of crap. Here's why:		1. "Powerful and Continuing Nationalism" This totally applies to the US, but not in the way the list wants you to think. American patriotism is not sinister like the list suggests. For the most part, Nationalism is not force fed to citizens. What government in the world doesn't want its citizens to be supportive of it? Where are all of these flags? There is a flag at each government building, and that's about it. We aren't forced to wave flags around.		2. "Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights"... "The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc." Really? Do you honestly think this applies to the US? Yes, there have been and are situations where the US has ignored human rights. HOWEVER, the list says there is "disdain for the recognition of human rights" Disdain means to despise or scorn. You have to be a fool to think the US despises human rights. The list says that citizens ignore it. We all know that's a blatant lie if you think this applies to the US.		3. "Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause" On the surface, maybe this applies to the US, but personally, I don't agree. Yes Communism and terrorism have been used as justifications for wars, but we don't blame every single problem on terrorists or communists. Also, who in their right mind wouldn't be opposed to terrorists? Are you trying to tell me it's bad for people, or a nation to stand up to terrorists? That's a load of crap.		4. "Supremacy of the Military" This is probably the most accurate point on this list. However, There are not "widespread domestic problems" as the list states. Obviously there are huge problems in the US, but average Americans are WAY better off than pretty much every oppressed person in a fascist state. Our citizens have food, industry, jobs, and plenty of opportunities for education. On top of that, the economy is still pretty strong, and has been since the 40's. Yes, there have been downturns, but not Great Depression level issues. The military gets so much funding because for better or for worse, the US is a big target for attack and is also the primary source of global security. 		5. "Rampant Sexism" Please. Open your eyes. There is sexism, but NOTHING like the list states.		6. "Controlled Mass Media" No. Our media is almost completely uncensored by the government. Nearly every media outlet in the US has a political agenda, but if the media was controlled by the government, all of the outlets would only be spewing a constant stream of support for the government and our politicians. We all know the media is not controlled by the government. It's also not just what we see on TV. There is almost no censorship of media on the internet. This point on the list is true of a fascist state, but in no way applies to the US.		7. " Obsession with National Security" My argument for this is very similar to point number 4. The US is a target. We need good national security. I agree that the methods are, at times, flawed, but we can't pretend like there isn't a need for national security.		8. "Religion and Government are Intertwined" This one is in the constitution. Check out the 1st Amendment. Politicians use religion to try to appeal to voters, and at times follow their religion when making policy. The first part of that doesn't matter. The second part can be an issue, but if it annoys the people it affects, the law is usually overturned by the judicial branch. 		9. "Corporate Power is Protected" Businesses don't put people in office. Voters do that. The legal protections and breaks for businesses are due to  political ideologies. Politicians cannot legally directly make laws to benefit specific businesses they are involved with.		10. "Labor Power is Suppressed" Ha. Labor unions still have a lot of power. The government is not afraid of organized workers. Look at how the minimum wag is increasing around the country right now. This is because of pressure from workers.		11. "Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts" This does not apply in any way whatsoever to the US. I have not even the slightest idea how people think this point applies to the US. Look at FAFSA. That is the government directly funding higher education. Government buildings are filled with art and murals. Each branch of the military has a band.

People are being exposed to the ideas, people are learning that others question what was and is going on. This is a purely anecdotal and personal case, so keep in mind some bias; I have changed my viewpoints on many issues on reddit, not necessarily jumping in on something because it's popular and part of the hive mind nature of the site, but because it invoked a response in me that led me to question my long standing beliefs and views. This may not be the case for all or even many people exposed to the site, however I feel I could make a fairly safe wager that a good proportion of people have had similar shifts in thought, or at least in the way they digest material.		The Internet has enabled many recent changes (I will note that the Internet is not the SOLE driver of these changes, rather it has enabled a great deal more freedom in expression of ideas and mobility of thought). Look to the questioning of the war on drugs, the legalization of marijuana, the questioning of the DEA, the NSA, congress and the TPP. Police brutality, systematic corruption, gerrymandering... In waking life, in "normal" work and play situations, many people simply would not have been exposed to this. Before forums began to consolidate and become well known and frequented (at least in my experience, I wasn't truly active until about 2008), people were quite limited in what they may speak about or inquire. Many of these discussions, I can't have with family, with coworkers, for fear of offending or retaliation. On the Internet, I drop a few lines of text on a comment and people can respond as they see fit, with reasonable (but not complete) peace of mind and some assurance that my viewpoints will not garner me any unwanted aggression or bodily harm. 		I truly do understand the viewpoint of just talking about it, the apathy that comes with it; I've shared it for some years.
