{"body":"Similar story. 		When we first toured the house we bought, our nosy future neighbors were standing in their lawn. They saw me, my fiance, our roommate/friend, our realtor, and my fiance's mom, drive up in 4 cars. 		They stopped talking and glared at us. As our realtor entered the code on the lockbox for the door, the ultra-nosy helicopter mom on the lawn gallumphed over and demanded to know what we were doing there.		Ultra-sanguine, I told her we were interested in the house and were getting a tour. 		She demanded to see our realtor. I pointed at her. 		She asked who we all were. Wanting to keep things super civil, I introduced all of us.		She eyed us all suspiciously for about a minute, then her whole face lit up and she acted super happy to meet us. 		"Wow! Great! This house was rented for a while, and the bank's owned it for a year! It'd be great to have neighbors again who actually care about the place!"		The house was a fucking steal -- $30k under market value, gorgeous place, huuuuge yard, fantastic neighborhood. I instantly knew why it hadn't been sold for such a long while: Mrs. Nosy McSuspiciouston.		She 100% seemed like the type to call the police on people viewing a house, if she weren't standing on the lawn when we pulled up. She later admitted that she does "daily" checks for sexual predators living in the area, and assured me that she was pleased to say every neighbor on the cul de sac had clear criminal records (which means she looked us up ...).		We fell in love with the house and bought it, deciding to brave the possibility that the neighbors were insane.		They *are* kinda insane -- and nosy as fuck -- but also extremely friendly (so far) and we've had zero problems. Semi-dodged a bullet. 		But people can be so freaking strange.","depth":1,"score":225,"ups":225,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"VenetiaMacGyver","name":"t1_cry1xec","parent_id":"t1_crxss98","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1433645399,"created_utc":1433641799}

{"body":"Apparently The Independent took it upon themselves to paint the picture in quite a different light. According to the commenter AZTHAL:		> This article is wrong on almost every single point, apart from that there was a kid who wanted to be carried in a bag. There was no "raid", there was no "arrest". It was not even the home of the man himself, but of his friend (who is a neighbour).		> The true story from Swedish newspaper: http://www.dn.se/sthlm/barn-lag-i-kasse-granne-larmade-polisen/		> Man with a new beard picks up his kids from day-care, and bring them to visit his neighbour. The kid asks to be carried in a bag from the car to the door of the friend they are planning to visit. Another neighbour sees a man that they do not recognize, walking in on a neighbours plot, carring a child in a bag. Believing this is decidedly odd, and call the police.	Police show up, knock on the door, ask what is going on. Get this story told to them, have a bit of a laugh, says thank you very much and go back on their business.		> Everyone involved agrees that it was a good thing the neighbour did (I assume that these people all know each other, and look out for each others houses). No harm done, except for possibly some wasted time for the police men when they could have been eating donuts.		The original article has a [photo of the kid in the bag](http://d2.dn-static.se/UploadedImages/2015/6/2/c2fd0224-cad6-4f1c-a6bc-0b887c1c89a6/original.jpg) and it is truly adorable!

If the anti-male group and people in favor of women having more rights than men want to call themselves feminists, they can do that, but if society views these people as feminists, then feminism is not at all about equality and women/people who want equality shouldn't call themselves feminists as it would mean they don't actually want equality.

{"body":"I know you're joking, but I just want to put in a little (edit: American version of "little") note that you really ought to look into this more.		The idea that America is a particularly litigious society is largely manufactured. It's the result of a lot of very clever astroturfing by large businesses looking to limit their liability by turning the public against the idea of civil lawsuits (whether they have merit or not).		Civil law is supposed to offer people a recourse when they've been wronged. There shouldn't be anything wrong with that idea. The way they make it sound bad is by making it sound like there is a tremendous, incredible number of frivolous lawsuits, and that many of them win anyway.		That's a complete fiction. There is not, and never has been, an epidemic of frivolous lawsuits. When they are brought, there are clear mechanisms to get them dismissed quickly and these mechanisms largely work.		If you want a nice example of how profoundly you have probably been mislead, look more deeply into the classic "woman who sued McDonald's because she got burned by coffee". This was the butt of every joke (and remains the common reference for America's supposedly litigious society) - but in actuality she suffered horrific burns and could never walk again until she died. Because McDonald's kept their coffer hotter than their regulations suggested and the regulations themselves were dangerously hot by pretty much any estimation. She was not driving the car or being unsafe in any way - she was sitting in a parked car and spilled some coffee when she tried to get the lid off. On top of that, her suit was only requesting the medical expenses be paid.		But did you hear any of that? No. Instead it got turned into a convenient fiction to drive average people further from ever seeking recompense from large corporations like McDonald's by making it less socially acceptable.		I highly recommend the documentary Hot Coffee if you'd like to learn more.
