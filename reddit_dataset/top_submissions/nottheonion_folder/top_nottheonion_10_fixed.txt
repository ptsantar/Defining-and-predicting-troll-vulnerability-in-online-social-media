{"body":"I like that idea but it requires one to define music.		Just using google quickly I get "vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion."		But how do we define beauty? That's a subjective experience. 		I don't think "noise" or even what one would call "noise music" has much want for definition and even more so the point is to break out of traditional/pre-existing definitions of what "music" can be. It does exist in an area between 'performance art' and 'music'.		When it comes to japanese noise Merzbow is the most accessible. I saw Merzbow at the French embassy in DC back in 2010 and it feels like the wild experimentation is removed and has been place in control setting labs.		Looking back at artists like Eye and Hanatarash really bring perspective on what noise is. 		I think you're joking but I used to have an electric word processor that would cause small fluctuation ins the tuning of a boombox I had as a kid. I was maybe in my early teens, 10-11, and I would sit and play the radio static with my word processor. I made little rhythms and things without.		That experimentation is the whole point I think you'll agree. Especially since so many of the performers are inspired by Dada. Mind you I will concede that noise music needn't be loud or even chaotic. Microsound projects can sometimes have a structure to them and people I've often heard refer to that as 'glitch'. It's still great noise.		Ryoji Ikeda is a great representation of the evolution of that sound. If you get a chance to see The Transfinite live, do so.		Also, if you like noise and I mean just noise, I recommend [Masonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aS-ktA5phY&spfreload=10).","depth":14,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"transceiverfreq","name":"t1_cmuipit","parent_id":"t1_cmuibye","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1418566597,"created_utc":1418566597}

It's kind of like the difference between a [fine Monet painting](http://i.imgur.com/fVJ95Ue.jpg) and [glitch art](http://i.imgur.com/vrtJhHX.jpg). Both have their art but have to be looked at differently. You can't go in expecting to judge them on equal terms. Just like that, "noisier" music is listened to primarily for its ability to create a certain atmosphere. As the song plays, the listener's mind is almost sucked into an imaginary environment, where they can be with their own thoughts. Generally, the longer you study them for, the more their artistic values begin to surface which is why the first time you listen to them you think "how the fuck do people listen to this shit", then a year later you're at their concert.

{"body":"You're so full of shit. WOW.		First of all, The Process is by far their most accessible album before the 2004 one. It sounds more like a pop album than anything else.		Second of all, Skinny Puppy touring with VNV Nation makes absolute perfect sense if you heard their 2004 album and ohGr's solo work, which is EBM or "electronic body music", and sounds nearly identical to VNV Nation. Recent Skinny Puppy sounds pretty much exactly like VNV Nation.		Skinny Puppy had three albums in the 90s. The first two were great, the second good. However their 80s albums don't sound very different *at all*, so this bullshit of:		>Their music from the 1980s, though? It was mostly noodling on synthesizers with some dialogue clips from cheesy horror movies thrown in as background ambience.		is something that the vast majority of industrial fans would disagree with you for. Because what you are describing is only a few tracks from that era, and most of them are ambient pieces which fit well with the album even though I personally skip them. They are not simply "noodling on synthesizers". Have you ever picked up a synthesizer yourself? Especially something from the 1980s?		It's a dead giveaway that you never actually listened to any of those albums. Their classic albums are generally considered to be Bites (1985), Mind (1986), Cleanse Fold & Manipulate (1987), Vivisect VI (1988). This goes beyond having an opinion I disagree with - you're talking about music you haven't actually listened to! Save your know-it-all attitude for things you actually know instead of bullshitting about a band solely because they're on the front page of reddit.

You're wrong, but I appreciate the passion with which you're erroneously calling me a liar.  I've been a fan of Skinny Puppy for over 20 years.

Their best song from the 80s was "deep down TRAUMA HOUNDS", which was so good that they released it twice (on *Cleanse, Fold and Manipulate* and *Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse*).

Any competent person would, because you could easily invest that 10 million into a safe investment that would generate more than 1% interest each year.  Even though you're technically in debt 10 million and technically paying 1% interest on a loan...you'd earn a great deal of money.

{"body":"The phrasing of my first comment does make it seem like they should feel guilty, but that wasn't really my intent. Imagine that as them just receiving the bad news from somebody and not my personal statement of malice towards them or anything. I have edited that section of the comment to include quotation marks, reflecting my intent.			I think the difference between RATM and gun manufacturers is the original intent of their product and the way they connect with that intent. Gun manufacturers make guns for people to shoot, no real political agenda behind it just shoot them at things. People obviously use them for purposes hey never intended, but  those people never misused the guns to deliberately spite the gun manufacturers. Chances are RATM's music was used specifically for the fact that it's original intent was the opposite of what it was being used to accomplished. 			RATM have a very stong personal and political motive behind their songs, and a connection to their art as creative works.Gun manufacturers obviously take pride in their craftmanship and likely have a personal connection to what they created in a similar artistic sense, but the connection isn't really based on the message they're sending out, if that makes any sense. RATM have a connection not only  with their music but also a connection with the message they intended for it to send out. 		Using their music as an instrument of torture goes that message and perverts the connection between what the music is accomplishing and what they intended. Knowing that their music would hurt people in this way would likely make them fairly upset and seems like something that would linger with them.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FizzardLizardWizard","name":"t1_cmutmib","parent_id":"t1_cmuqx0z","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1418590525,"created_utc":1418590525}
