What I really don't agree is how both countries are managing the situation. From Mexico there is implicitly a demand for continuing the flow of people into the U.S. and ignoring the reason of why they are fleeing. Mexican politics and even the society are consumed by so much corruption that has built a really poor educational system and the entire government is more concerned about their interests, than those of the Mexican people, at least every week you can hear on the news a new political scandal, a decision to increment the government's salary or a decision to increment the price for public services. Also, as you said, Mexican government demands justice for the illegal aliens but treat all the people coming from the southern countries even worse, and there's been documented cases about it. From the U.S. I believe the whole anti-immigrant speech is a fuel for the xenophobic hate that is still present in parts of the society, because it speaks on a very blurry line that is often confused with the latter. On the other hand its a really "gut" solution, not well thought out and insensitive to build a wall in the border, the efforts of the U.S. should be in working along Mexico to solve the problem not breaking the relationship apart.

If you are so desperate that you are willing to risk everything to move to the neighbouring country, it means that you are poor, probably uneducated and because of those two things, a bit more likely to be involved in criminal activities. The people who immigrate from Mexico to the United-States legally are decent people. Those who immigrate illegally want a better life that is true, but they are coming from a bad background and are likely to bring that bad background with them and ending up, instead of getting a better life, making it worse for everyone.		There should be a zero tolerance policy when it comes to illegal immigration. You are caught as an illegal immigrant? You get deported in a matter of days. You had kids born in the US afterward? You either leave them to an adoption family or you bring them back with you and they lose the possibility to apply for citizenship.

{"body":"I am biggot because I think that saying that only criminals and scum come to America from Mexico...man I never knew...		I've never been to Tumblr so why don't you go there in my stead and take your bs with you. Criticism would have been talking about Mexico's policies or about their economy, maybe mentioning the strength of their cartels and the weakness of their police force. Calling immigrants from there names is not criticism. It saddens me that this is American schools at work. Maybe we have failed our young people.		Don't get me wrong, I know Trump is just being inflammatory to be inflammatory, we all know he doesn't want to actually be president but to keep his five minutes of fame going so that he can in some way monetize it; I'm betting he's looking for a radio show deal or maybe a Fox News show, but to say that he was being critical is just stupid that misses the point.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LupineShadow","name":"t1_csmnht0","parent_id":"t1_csm7mni","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1435606797,"created_utc":1435603197}
