{"body":"> BTW the reason Christopher Dorner was killing cops was because he said they were crooked and fucked him over for being an honest cop.		Dorner also said that he was killing people in an attempt to "get his name back".  Because if you're trying to prove your moral rectitude, there's nothing like the cold-blooded murder of your lawyer's daughter and her boyfriend to make that point.		In the same document where Dorner said he was being fucked over for being an honest cop, he also said that he wanted either Chris Christie or Hillary Clinton in office in 2016, because Chris Christie was "America's no shit taking uncle" and Hillary raised Chelsea to be "one hell of an attractive woman"-- no offense to Chelsea's husband, of course.  Oh, and he told his "friend" Tim Tebow that he had faith in him.		Also, it's important to note that Dorner's allegations of police brutality weren't filed for *weeks* after the incident... but *were* filed the *very next day* after he got a negative performance review from the officer he accused.  Dorner's purported moral rectitude only manifested after his self-interest popped in to say hello.  Crazy how that happens.		I'm not trying to say that Dorner's allegations of police abuse are untrue, by the way.  I find it perfectly possible that his officer kicked a handcuffed man on the ground *in the face* out of pure spite.  Cops have certainly done such things before-- and gotten away with it.		What I *am* trying to say is that Chris Dorner's claims of being a persecuted whistleblower *ought* to be taken with a grain (or a fucking truckload) of salt.  If Dorner really *was* the moral pillar he claimed to be, why didn't he report the brutality *immediately*?  I submit that he didn't report it immediately because he was *just as dirty a cop as the rest of the LAPD*, and his eventual report of misconduct was simply a Hail-Mary play to keep his job.		I'm also not defending the LAPD's actions during the Dorner debacle. They acted reprehensibly and faced ZERO consequences for it.  That's fucking unacceptable, and pretty much par for the course these days.  They put, what, 100+ bullets into that fucking truck that was a different make, model, and color than Dorner's truck-- "because it was a truck!"-- and called themselves *heroes* because they didn't fatally injure the women inside.  Thank God for the LAPD's shitty marksmanship, or their utter lack of situational awareness could have turned into a real disaster-- a little less incompetence, *and somebody could have died*.		But the LAPD's actions in *no way* make Dorner a good guy.  The enemy of my enemy is *not* my friend.		*Please* don't try to hold up Dorner as an example of what happens to cops who "cross the blue line".  He was a mentally unhinged asshole who **killed innocent people**.  Monica Quan and Keith Lawrence (a cop for the University of Southern California) had *nothing to do* with his firing from the LAPD, but he killed them for revenge on his lawyer, Randal Quan-- Monica Quan's father.  In his attempts to evade arrest, he ambushed (and killed) Michael Crain, a cop from a different police department who also had *nothing to do* with Dorner's firing.  He also killed a Fish and Game officer who was pursuing him to that infamous cabin.		Now, there are some who say that he didn't shoot himself in the cabin.  I don't particularly have any reason to buy that argument, but let's just assume the didn't kill himself for the sake of argument.  That means Dorner killed FOUR people.  Three of them were cops, but *not ONE* of them was from the LAPD, the department he swore vengeance against.  The first two of his victims were killed purely for *revenge against somebody else*; the last two of his victims were killed as he attempted to evade capture.  Exactly how are his actions noble, or proper, or even *remotely fucking justified*?		Dorner was a shitbag, not a hero.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"primehound","name":"t1_cosgmyr","parent_id":"t1_coq4e9w","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424527182,"created_utc":1424527182}

{"body":"That was doctrine for a hostage situation back then. The thinking was that the hostage taker had the upper hand, so the best course of action was appeasement. Give him anything he wanted so he wouldn't kill anyone. Police arriving at the scene of a hostage situation were expected to establish a perimeter to lock down the scene, and call in a heavily armed SWAT team and the hostage negotiator.     		The police responding to Columbine were following longstanding doctrine. By the standards of the day, they didn't fuck up; the shooters behaved abnormally.		We had a similar doctrine for hijackings until mid morning on 11 Sep 2001. Passengers were expected to remain calm and obey the hijacker's instructions. You weren't supposed to attack the visible hijackers, because there might be a "sleeper" with a bomb hiding among the rest of the passengers, and any resistance might get everyone killed.		Fortunately, that doctrine has been replaced. Today, officers responding to an active shooter are trained to wait only for one other officer to back them up, then immediately engage the shooter with any level of force they can bring to bear. They no longer wait for the overwhelming force a SWAT team can bring to bear, but confront the shooter with whatever level of force they have available.		By mid morning on 11 Sep 2001, the era of hijacker appeasement had ended, and the "Let's Roll" doctrine was established. We're now expected to resist hijackers at all costs, because there is something worse than getting everyone killed. 		This doctrinal change is also the main impetus for the militarization of our police forces.","depth":9,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rivalarrival","name":"t1_coqdwwg","parent_id":"t1_coqa6db","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424360333,"created_utc":1424360333}

During the March on Washington, Martin Luther King would refer to such protests as "the whirlwinds of revolt." In Chicago, blacks rioted through the South Side in late May after a white police officer shot a fourteen year old black boy who was fleeing the scene of a robbery.[83] Violent clashes between black activists and white workers took place in both Philadelphia and Harlem in successful efforts to integrate state construction projects.[84][85] On June 6, over a thousand whites attacked a sit-in in Lexington, North Carolina; blacks fought back and one white man was killed.[86][87] Edwin C. Berry of the National Urban League warned of a complete breakdown in race relations: "My message from the beer gardens and the barbershops all indicate the fact that the Negro is ready for war."[83]		>In Cambridge, Maryland, a working???class city on the Eastern Shore, Gloria Richardson of SNCC led a movement that pressed for desegregation but also demanded low???rent public housing, job???training, public and private jobs, and an end to police brutality. On June 14, struggles between blacks and whites escalated to the point where local authorities declared martial law, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy directly intervened to negotiate a desegregation agreement.[88] Richardson felt that the increasing participation of poor and working-class blacks was expanding both the power and parameters of the movement, asserting that "The people as a whole really do have more intelligence than a few of their leaders.??		>In their deliberations during this wave of protests, the Kennedy administration privately felt that militant demonstrations were ??bad for the country?? and that "Negroes are going to push this thing too far."[89] On May 24, Robert Kennedy had a meeting with prominent black intellectuals to discuss the racial situation. The blacks criticized Kennedy harshly for vacillating on civil rights, and said that the African-American community's thoughts were increasingly turning to violence. The meeting ended with ill will on all sides.[90][91][92] Nonetheless, the Kennedys ultimately decided that new legislation for equal public accommodations was essential to drive activists "into the courts and out of the streets."[89][93]","depth":16,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"memesR2dank","name":"t1_coq71kc","parent_id":"t1_coq6ry8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424337576,"created_utc":1424337576}

{"body":"I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but whatever, fake internet points and all that...		I've seen pretty much two sides to this discussion - apologists and cop-haters. On the one hand, apologists want us to sit on our asses and do nothing. Which is *beyond* stupid. But that does **not** justify the murder that I see so many cop-haters (is there a more common word for this?) advocate.		I don't care what anyone's view on the way cops act is. It doesn't matter. Killing cops is **not** the solution. Killing **anybody** is not the solution. And of course, neither is sitting on our asses.		> Cops feel like they can act with impunity. They assume they're accountable to no one.		This part of your post is part of the problem. You are making a vast, sweeping generalization about all cops, saying that they all act with impunity, they all assume they are not accountable. And yes, there are lots of bad cops, and **no** I'm not going to brush it aside and say "Well, there are more *good* then *bad*, so who *cares*?"		Rather, I'm going to point out that you are looking at this the **wrong way.** Individual cops are *not* the issue. Its the **system** that's fucked, the system is what we need to change. Sure, there are bad cops, but trying to pick them out one by one is curing the *symptom*, not the disease.		This is the issue. Apologists brush it all under the rug, ignoring it all, while those in the anti-cop boat want to put all cops in one light and pretend like they're "doing something about it".		Newsflash - killing individual cops will not solve any problems. What we need to fix is the system itself. We need to get to the root of the problem. We need to make it so that police *are* held accountable, so that they *can't* act with impunity - killing a cop doesn't solve that issue at all.		Now it sounds like you're saying that the goal here would be to get a message across, as if that is the only way we can act on this issue, and I have to say that I vehemently disagree. Violence is not the only way to "get the message across". Solving problems nonviolently is the answer - be the bigger person.		I realize that it might be hard to fix the system nonviolently - after all, a lot of people feel like the system is ignoring them, that their pleas for police to be held accountable are going unnoticed. Perhaps this is correct, but that doesn't mean we should start murdering people. Cops are not the root of the issue, and in fact most of them are ordinary men and women with families and kids. Do you really think killing those people will solve the problem?		I don't have the answer of how to fix it, I just know its not violence.		**tl;dr** Fuck the apologists. Fuck the cop-haters.

This post was not addressed to those individuals.		> Excuse me, but who the fuck are you to tell us what is the "right" vs. "wrong" way to look at something? Oh please, please enlighten us with your wisdom and arrogance. Can we make you king to rule us uneducated peasants?		Did you read my post? Its not out of some sense of superiority that I say its being looked at the wrong way, its a simple matter of analyzing the situation. I went through this already - cure the disease, not the symptoms. The problem is - and this is directed at the people advocating *violence*, nobody else - murdering cops is curing the symptom and not the disease, and that's ignoring the morality of the act. I'm not trying to say I'm better than anybody - anyone can tell you that curing symptoms is never the answer.		> Cop-hater who doesn't advocate killing anyone checking in here.		See, here's a mentality I don't understand. You identify yourself as a cop-hater. This means that you are, in fact, making a sweeping generalization about a group of people. Cops are people - and yet, you are explicitly saying here that you hate cops. You hate a group of people based on their occupation alone. This promotes the idea of curing symptoms and not the disease - if someone is so focused on hating cops rather than the actual underlying issue, nothing is going to get done.		If you said you hated retail workers, or plumbers, or mailmen you'd probably get downvoted to hell, but on Reddit if you say you hate cops, you're going to get a shitton of karma. That's ridiculous, and that mentality exists outside of Reddit too. It seems these days its okay to hate a group of people just for being in that group - as long as they are cops, of course.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"squidgy617","name":"t1_coqgr3u","parent_id":"t1_coq8sk6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424365074,"created_utc":1424365074}

Given the ammount of people that die on the streets, that's an understandable sentiment, and at the very least you should be careful around cars. Especially since the driver doesn't have to want to kill you to run you over with his car.

{"body":"> And a Gun doesn't require you to stab someone 20 times with something that's going to be little sharper than a butter knife.		This is the only technical detail that I'm going to pursue here, since the rest of the points would just be the two of us nit picking. 		With even the simplest of sharpening tools, you can make a spoon much sharper than a butter knife. Whats more, if you're making a shank then you're more interested in making it pointy than making a long cutting edge. Stabbing is more deadly than cutting and penetration has more to do with lethality than sharpness. You'd more than likely just sharpen the spoon handle than the cup. The average knife fight, when it is a fight, lasts about thirty seconds and usually ends with someone dead. Where you are hit, and how deeply is more important than what weapon you're hit with.		And that leads me to something I've been wondering about the Geer incident. After Torres shot, the article says that Geer dropped, grabbed his leg, crawled back in the house and shut the door. So Geer died from bleeding out. I'm assuming that he was hit in the femoral artery. That would have given responders about a minute to tie off the leg and stop the bleeding. I can't imagine that everyone just stood with their thumb up their collective asses in shock for a full forty five to sixty seconds after the shot. 		In other words, there was a slim chance that Geer could have survived this incident. Guns don't guarantee the death of whatever you shoot at. Any more than being stabbed with a six inch blade guarantees that you'll die. This is the main reason why I don't freak out about guns. Guns are no more deadly than many of the things we use regularly on a daily basis.","depth":15,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jscythe","name":"t1_cotrs3n","parent_id":"t1_cotadl6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424641135,"created_utc":1424641135}

{"body":">Uhh, they both took an oath so one is responsible for the other?		I'll clarify what I mean, I guess.  When you belong to a specific system, group, community, etc. you are responsible for the actions made in that system/group/community's name, assuming that they're not being led by a tyrannical dictator or something.  The individual is to be held responsible for the practices/policies/procedures of the whole.  It's called "guilt by association," and while we sometimes wrongly blame an individual for the crimes of those they associate with, there is legitimacy to this idea.  So when we see that there's a severe lack of transparency, accountability, oversight along with a general attitude of "us vs. them," we should be willing to call on the people inside the system to change it.		So, no, the officer in NY is not directly responsible for the actions of the CA officer, but he should be held responsible for the culture of police in our country (and, yes, the cultures are pretty similar across the board here).  I am not saying that the NY officer should personally jail the CA officer, I am saying that he should be willing to advocate for change to combat the corrosive culture we see coming from police today.		>Most cops don't come online and blabber their gums when an official investigation hasn't been completed.  Unlike people here who read a fucking article title and go "zomg police are evil!!!1one"		This has nothing to do with anything else in this thread except to raise police above the people they are charged with helping.  This amounts to ad hominem and I assumed we were having a civil discussion.  Assumption dropped.		>The burden of proof isn't on me. Guilty until proven innocent is what you're suggesting, huh?		You're commanding everyone here to "do some research" and you can't be bothered to come up with anything is what you're saying here.  Here're my sources:		- [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/police-rarely-criminally-charged-for-on-duty-shootings-1416874955):  This is an article about how police rarely get charged for on-duty shootings.  I'm not saying that all or even a majority of police shootings/homicides deserve to go to trial, but the laws of probability tell us that there should be more indictments.  A perfect example of one that should have gone to trial is the officer that killed Eric Garner.  Of course, Mr. Geer's murderer should have seen a trial, as well, and probably prison.		- [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/11/police-killings-hundreds/18818663/): This link tells us about the number of reported homicides (automatically labeled "justified") that the DoD got in 2013, the highest it's been in twenty years.		- [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/):  This is about how we really don't know how many police shootings there are since they're all reported by police organizations, meaning no oversight and guaranteed botched numbers.  We should not depend on the police to report on their own crimes.		I can go on, but I really only need these three points.		All of this leads to a systemic issue within the ranks of police.  Whether or not they *are* getting away with murder (and, obviously, some are) is less of an issue than the fact that they *can* get away with it.		>There's no reason for "reform" because there isn't really a problem.		You just read an article (assuming you didn't just "read the title" and go "zomg, I need to protect these poor cops") where an officer, after killing an unarmed and compliant man, was given no repercussions.  It's not like this is the first and only case of police getting off after fatally wounding an innocent civilian.  How can you possibly say that there isn't a problem with a system that allows that to happen?  How can you not want to pinpoint exactly what is creating these situations?  Essentially, what the fuck is wrong with you?		>Dude, basically everybody that gets a black eye claims police brutality. 99% of the time, the person was trying to fight the cop.		Gonna need a source.  Or do you believe in "guilty until proven innocent?"		The next couple paragraphs are essentially built on this premise, so I will refrain from addressing them until you can prove that 99% of people are somehow terrible liars and 99% of cops are essentially Gandhi.

The wheels of justice often turn slowly, especially if you want to do a case right.  			All of this is independent from a Fairfax PD Internal Affairs investigation, which will not be concluded until after any criminal case has been decided.  		Give it time people.

Also because they are not personally effected. Our civilian population has become somewhat pacified towards these types of things. I think the under reporting issue is perhaps the biggest one though. News reporting was supposed to be one of the most vital mechanisms to maintain a checks and balances on government and more importantly it's duty was to keep us informed.  It seems to have lost it's ability or motivation to do so. I recently heard one explanation that made sense(aside from the more widely cited reason "MSM is all corporate owned now & only serves their interest") which is that reporters often get many of their stories directly from the police, so when they crucify officers in the media they risk severing their sources for countless other stories.

{"body":"Quick rundown of the details of the story:		- Geer (victim) was breaking up with his common law wife, and she was moving out. Geer's wife called police to complain that Geer was angrily throwing some of her possessions onto the lawn.		- Police asked Geer's wife if he had a weapon. She replied that he owned some firearms, that were legally owned and securely stored. She said that he had not been drinking.		- Five officers arrive at the scene, including Barnes (negotiator) and Torres (shooter)		- During the standoff, Geer kept his hands raised and complied with all requests from Barnes, including retrieving his holstered handgun from inside the house and setting it aside in plain view, refraining from using his phone, checking pockets, etc.		- Barnes attempted to coax Geer out onto the porch, but Geer wanted to remain inside as he feared being shot. He specifically pointed out Torres, who repeatedly raised his gun from the "ready" position (aiming at legs) to aim at Geer's chest.		- Geer asked Barnes for permission to scratch his nose. Barnes consented, then Torres fired, fatally wounding Geer.		- While police waited for backup to clear the scene, Geer bled to death without receiving medical attention.		-----		- After the encounter, Torres claimed that Geer dropped his hands suddenly to his waist. Two civilian witnesses and all four of the other officers contradicted this statement when speaking to investigators.		- Torres has not been charged or disciplined, and has stated "I don't feel sorry for shooting the guy at all."		- Torres was involved in an incident five months earlier in which he [became belligerent in a courtroom and went on a cursing tirade when a prosecutor decided to drop a DUI charge](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Family-of-John-Geer-Glad-More-Details-Unraveling-in-Fatal-Shooting-290601401.html)		- The prosecutor in Fairfax has claimed that [his investigation into the incident was blocked by the Fairfax police department](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fairfax-prosecutor-says-fairfax-police-obstructed-his-probe-of-john-geer-killing/2014/12/23/8f7a3fba-8ae5-11e4-9e8d-0c687bc18da4_story.html)		I mean, we've seen some over-the-top incidents lately, but this is pretty bad.

{"body":"[This American Life has a piece](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/548/cops-see-it-differently-part-two#play) about some officer's inability to see things how we non-LEOs see them.		In deliberately modest defense of police with regard to medical treatment, I think this is a matter of training and of liability. While I'm sure some cops have Emergency Medical Responder training, it is minimal, and I doubt it's required. I also suspect a lot of cops are probably told, "Let the medics deal with 'em, that's not your job," which does make a little sense for anything beyond basic airway, breathing or circulatory concerns, as they might do more harm than good without training and expose themselves or the department to damages.		As far as the general lack of "bedside manner", if you will, I think that's probably related to a combination of not wanting to risk having (or at least showing) emotional response to a situation and being perceived as weak by the detainee or peers, and desensitization to constant false claims of discomfort/pain (the cuffs are too tight, I can't feel my hands/I can't breathe/I'm dying).		I'm not saying this makes any of these behaviors right, but there are environmental/social contributing factors to what we're seeing with police that goes beyond just a few bad cops. It's systemic, and I think everyone knows it's a problem.

Greer's dad said that he heard/was told that Greer threatened wife "If cops come I'll shoot them." Officers said Greer announced he was armed and put "something on the ground" just inside his door (he was standing inside his door, at the screen of the door). Police Officers say they couldn't see the gun; also that Greer "never dropped his hands to his waist". He wasn't very cooperative but also was not threatening. Said he wouldn't get handcuffed and that he wouldn't leave the house, "didn't want neighbors to see". Refused to leave the house unless officers "got way back".

{"body":"More cops have been killed by civilians in Fairfax than the other way around.		It's a REALLY nice area. Diverse, upper middle class and maybe even top 1% style rich, and has the best school in the entire country plus a couple others who consistently rank on top 100 lists - and that's just the public schools.		Honestly we've NEVER had trouble with cops here. "Surprised" is an understatement. The coverup doesn't even make sense; it's not like people go around searching for controversy but it's right next to DC and most people around here are big news readers.		I always preach tolerance and calmness whenever one of these kinds of events happen but it's a little bit different when you take a reputable police force in a reputable county in a reputable state. The other incidents happened in pretty okay areas, certainly not THAT shady, not even Ferguson, but Fairfax makes them look like set designs from Slumdog Millionaire by comparison. It's unfathomable that this could have happened.		Hopefully this means something will be done. There's no pussyfooting. There's no ambiguity. There's nothing to discuss. This almost guarantees that it won't make national news, but if we can get it there then I'm certain change is going to happen. :)","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"threwitallawayforyou","name":"t1_coq7ka0","parent_id":"t1_coq67tx","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424340303,"created_utc":1424340303}

{"body":"Obligatory "This Will Get Buried"		This angers me and breaks my heart all over again.  		I left the Northern Virginia area, after living there for many years.  Fairfax/Prince William County.  I saw a number of things happen during the time I lived there.  I will keep this short and narrow it down to two incidents.		My sister was involved in a minor two car fender bender, in our subdivision, two blocks from our house.  The police were called.  The other car was uninsured.  The LEO was flirting with my sister throughout the entire process.  My sister did not reciprocate.  (she was, at the time, in the process of moving in with her boyfriend/fiance)  The LEO was persistent and my sister rebuffed him a number of times.  He tells the uninsured motorist that he is free to go, without taking any of his information.  He then pointed out to my sister that he had access to her information, in any case; that she had clothes, make up, etc in her vehicle; and if he wanted to, could easily come up with a prostitution charge...  		She got his information.  She lodged a complaint.  It was implied that it was not only my sister's fault (that it was instigated by her to curry favor at the accident scene), but also a MISUNDERSTANDING on my sister's part.		Nothing happened to the officer, and apparently, there was no record of the accident.  At ALL.		The second one I am going to tell you about?  I blame them for my sister's death.  Please bear with me, this is hard to type.  It's been many years, but the wound is still fresh.  Forgive me for being vague.  I am afraid of specifics that will identify my family.  I will try to answer questions, should there be any forthcoming.		My sister and her fiance were fighting via cell phone.  It got pretty bad and he called the police (he was at work) and told them she had threatened self harm in a public location. (empty, fairly secluded pull over off the highway)  The police showed up, surrounded my sister's vehicle and showed up at her fiance's work.  The phone call was terminated and he was denied access to both his cell phone and his work phone.  This occurs at approximately 6:00pm.		They go to my parent's house, inquiring about a SON, by my sister's name.  (Her name could be male or female)  My parents tell them they have a child by that name, but no sons.  The LEO asks *"Are you sure."*  My parents confirm once again, and with no further explanation, the LEO leaves.  It is at this point I get a phone call from my parents asking me if I know what is going on.  Other than a panic call I had received from my sister earlier - she wanted to confirm that her fiance was cheating and asked me if I knew how to access his email - no, I had no clue.  We all go into panic mode.  We call her fiance (cell and work).  We are denied access to him.		They have a lot of cars and officers on scene now.  She is refusing to exit the vehicle.  Her car idles until it runs out of gas.  It's very cold.  We plead with the police; all we want is to know exactly where she is and to talk to her.  		*"Absolutely not.  We know what we're doing."*		14 - *FOURTEEN* - hours later - in which she hasn't eaten, gone to the restroom, and has been denied repeated requests to speak to her fiance/family, someone decides that tear gas is a good idea.		A shot is fired.  My sister is killed instantly.		They now decide to go back to my parent's house and tell them their child is dead.  Here's my card, we may contact you for questions later.		Over the course of the next few weeks, I am contacted by 3 (THREE) LEOs that were **on scene**.  They tell me that this situation was FUBARed, and badly.  I reached someone at the station that told me I needed to get a copy of the report, NOW.  That he would fax it to me.  NOW.  Before it was too late.  By the time I got to my office and got the fax machine up and running, it was too late. (about 30 - 45 mins had passed)  He no longer had access to said paperwork.  Two of the LEOs were actually friends of my sisters and one of them pulled me aside at her wake to tell me that "This is not right.  This is not right AT ALL."  He said he would see what, if anything he could do.  The other one became evasive and distant.  SHE got a promotion and we never heard from her again.  She was on of my sister's *close* friends.		We buried my sister.  It was very surreal.  My parents aged twenty years that day.  Everyone that knew her was in shock.  		**How could this have happened?** 		At the end of the day, we were stonewalled.  Either no one knew anything, or they could not speak with us on the matter.  After much insistence, I received a copy of the incident report.  It looked like a public release UFO reporting document.  It was fucking incomprehensible.  It was more blacked out lines than visible text, by a long shot.  I was told, after some time had passed, that this was mishandled, and this case was now a part of the "what NOT to do in a situation" training.  That we were never going to see any resolution, of any kind, **EVER**.  That this had been swept under the rug and would never see the light of day. 		I apologize for the wall of text.  I'm not sure I know how to tl;dr this at all.  I have not looked at this so closely for a long while.  It's been over ten years.  And now, here I sit, weeping like a baby again.  		I apologize.  I guess my point is that this happens, it hurts people, and I'm not sure what to do except encourage the exposure of these incidents and rally support for others that have fallen victim to such horrible, horrible pain.

That my sister's name, hell - my entire FAMILY, would be put under scrutiny to discredit us, and paint us in a very unfavorable light.		3. That this would cost a *considerable* amount of time and money, and at the end of it, we may not find a favorable resolution.		4.  That regardless of the outcome, or even how far it progressed, this would bring unwanted attention that a reasonable person would consider harassment.		5.  That I was challenging *Fairfax County*.  Anyone who has lived in or around the area understands completely.

"Nasty divorce" Why the heck does it so often seem to be this way? My last ex I told her straight out in a calm reasonable way that obviously we were not getting along and we should just quietly annul the marriage and find ways to separate comfortably and peacefully. No way, she went straight to an attorney and filed for divorce that week. Then the long knives came out. 		> That my sister's name, hell - my entire FAMILY, would be put under scrutiny to discredit us, and paint us in a very unfavorable light.		There's that. 		> That this would cost a considerable amount of time and money, and at the end of it, we may not find a favorable resolution.		Of course. Court actions take time and loads of cash. 		> That regardless of the outcome, or even how far it progressed, this would bring unwanted attention that a reasonable person would consider harassment.		In my mind, that wouldn't even be a consideration. All guilty people try to play the victim. 		> That I was challenging Fairfax County.

If they get antsy because someone looks like they might be that psycho, they might look like they're just out for blood and using his "looking suspicious" as an excuse (but in their stressed brain's looking to make it home that night, he really is acting weird). That guy is then targeted and is further alienated by cops. 		Doing nothing in these situations, hiding them from sight, refusing to engage with the people you're supposed to protect and serve will not make the situation better. We need a serious reconciliation between people and cops, otherwise the relationship will never get better and it just makes it harder for the police to do their jobs and harder for people to trust cops enough to call them when they legitimately need their help. 		It's already the case that cops see the scum of the earth and violent crime on a daily basis and thus have a skewed view of what their communities look like; we really don't need to deteriorate this shit any further by engaging in standoffs that create everyone as an enemy. That's a sure way to lose for both sides","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rizzpooch","name":"t1_coqb1vb","parent_id":"t1_coq0f8j","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424354326,"created_utc":1424354326}

We have speed limits because without them a small number of people would act out NASCAR in a traffic jam. We have laws preventing theft because without them a small number of people would take everything they wanted. Now obviously these things all still happen because a law isn't enough to stop every single person from doing wrong.

All I say is that cops should be held to the same standard. Leave the good guys alone, let them do the job that they're already doing well, but stop giving assholes unlimited strikes because they're also cops. Make examples out of the ones like Torres who are murderous sociopaths who feel no remorse for killing innocent people.

Another upsetting aspect about this case is that the family didn't have any of their questions answered for over a YEAR about why he was murdered. The police department wouldn't tell them shit, it took a court order from a judge before they willingly released any information. 		I had a sign that read this: http://i.imgur.com/c8foyhR.jpg	I had a pretty upset police officer approach me aboit it. With an angry tone, he said, "What is it that YOU know about the training a police officer goes through!?" Obviously I can't remember word for word what I said, but something along the lines of, "I don't need to know the exact training routines of every police department across the US to know that if more training were implemented, some of these tragedies probably could have been avoided. Sir, this is a poster board, I really can't fit everything I'd like to say on it, I have to condense my message to make it fit. This is my opinion and I stand by it, more thorough training/background checks and psychiatric evaluations should take place before anyone can become a police officer." He ended up trying to argue with me for a few more minutes, all while being illegally stopped in the road (I was standing on the sidewalk). 		This article makes the following statement about the shooter, "a cop with significant anger issues (he once screamed and cursed at prosecutors in open court) ??? is contradicted by four fellow officers and two civilian witnesses." If police officers were required to receive psych evaluations, perhaps yearly, maybe someone would have seen that this man is a danger to the public and this death could have been avoided. 		One of the other most obvious examples (certainly not the only other example), is of the little boy, Tamir Rice, who was shot on a playground for having a BB gun. The police officer in that case was actually fired from his previous job for being emotionally unstable and not being able to handle stressful situations.

The fact that the police's seemingly violent attempt to quell it was caught on camera and vines posted on twitter, is exactly why the media picked it up instantly. All the news showed after that first night were videos/vines acquired from live stream/twitter. The racial element (white cops on black citizens) in combination with location fueled but was not the sole reason. Then when they got the locals on TV, it really took off.		The cable news networks won't pick something up unless there is an angle to it. That angle can be race but it also can be police tactics (if you recall the hoses on the kids in the civil rights movement created a massive stir because it was caught on film unlike other police action at the time). I'm actually very surprised people who knew him didn't try to use the Ferguson incident to gain attention. Seems it would have sold the "police brutality" narrative much better.		tl;dr, the community that Mike Brown lived in did something about it immediately and THEIR actions gained attention while the community John Geer lived in didn't do enough to being attention to themselves. It's not the media ignoring it, just the community not coming together enough I suppose.		Edit: Just remembered something.

The police unions have immense power, and use it to shield bad cops from accountability. Their power needs to be seriously checked.

{"body":"I'm a mid 30's Brit, and American police officers scare me.  I grew up in an environment were there were simply no guns in circulation, so 80% of the UK police officers were (and still are) habitually not issued with firearms.  They ask these officers fairly regularly whether they think all of them should be armed and the answer persistently comes back as no.  		Those that are trained (ministry of defence police, nuclear constabulary, personal protection officers plus armed response to name but a few) as a result get very high levels of training.  Only twice have people been killed by police officers in the UK since 2010; but - and I happily hold my hands up to point out that the UK police are not immune from controversy either - both are contentious killings; despite being linked to gang crime Mark Duggan was (depending on who you believe) unarmed at the time.  His killing sparked UK riots although arguably there were many mitigating circumstances - economic tensions, political tensions - which meant something could have kicked off the riots anyway.  Anthony Grainger also got shot whilst unarmed, although he was in a car and perhaps reaching for some thing, so the officer fired and killed him with a single bullet from a H&K MP5.		I live in Germany now, where all police officers are armed, and don't feel unsafe at all from a police conduct point of view.  It just seems to me that what you see in the media - amateur youtube's, TV, newspapers etc, that both the UK and US police are becoming ever more aggressive in responding - in the US case militarising in some cases to an extent that it reminds me of South African police back in the apartheid era.  They also used heavy APC's to get around.		Personally, I think the Germans strike a reasonable balance between a lack of intimidation whilst maintaining the need to enforce law and order.  And I apologise to any US police officers who read this and get offended but I'm just going on the considerable US and overseas coverage (plus youtube) of frequent incidents.  The Indian guy who's now paralysed after a takedown by an Alabama cop (who's been fired and will be charged for it).  		Looking from the outside (yes I've been to the US, more than once), it looks like it's a broken system, which puts the whole police force in disrepute, thereby eroding the confidence of the US public that they'll protect them, fairly.  If so, this raises the frequency of risk of encounters between police and public becoming unmanageable, which makes it ever harder for the police officer to control.  That is a potentially very slippery path to go down and bad for all concerned.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fwoggie2","name":"t1_coq4ypo","parent_id":"t3_2wdj8m","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424329129,"created_utc":1424329129}

It is the best example yet that while police often target minorities disproportionately, their basic and overriding demand is total and unquestioning submission to their authority.		Certainly this should frighten everyone.  The focus on "minorities" is a complete distraction from the problem, which is authoritarianism.  I was completely sickened and disgusted reading this story, and did not even know the guy was a "minority" until reading the idiotic conclusion draw by the author.  Unfortunately, this same problem is seen time and time again.  As a New Yorker, I always strongly opposed the unconstitutional "stop and frisk" policy.  This, "papers please" policy of the authorities is completely antithetical to a free society.  Unfortunately, jackasses had to focus on the fact that "stop and frisk" was bad because it had a disparate impact on minorities, rather then the fact that the practice was abhorrent.  The same mistake is being made in regard to police and prosecutor misconduct and malfeasance.  The problem isn't that police and prosecutors are targeting minorities, the problem is that police and prosecutors are total assholes who violate the law and the constitution with impunity no matter who they are going after.  The suggestion that somehow these authoritarian abuses would be okay if they were just evenly dispersed among all races is idiotic, counterproductive, and should be opposed by all thinking people.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jgrofn","name":"t1_coq7v54","parent_id":"t3_2wdj8m","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424341934,"created_utc":1424341934}

I must also add that I have a lot of respect for your right to keep and bear arms, I think it is a very valuable freedom in terms of preventing the rise of totalitarian government but I can't help thinking that this plays a large part in the trigger happy mentality of your police force. The police in the UK could never justify being armed on regular patrols. The public just wouldn't accept it.

They are typically the reason no form of criminal charges are brought against officers who commit acts such as murder, theft, and extortion.  It isn't that the "good" cops do nothing, though that is part of the issue, it is that the police unions protect these people through the guise of "brotherhood" and "duty".  It is nothing more than an assertion of power over civilians, saying "We can do as we wish as police.  We are untouchable."  The job of the police is to maintain control over us.  Disbanding the police union and groups like FOP needs to be a top priority for us as citizens.  Moving from that we can then turn our attention towards individual officers to dethrone.

We need to establish courts for police action whose verdicts are determined entirely by jury--a jury of people selected based on their non-relationship with any police organizations.  		Also, prevent police from carrying guns unless they were called as backup.  That way, when an officer "fears for his life", he'll be forced to call for backup and wait for it to arrive, instead of nonchalantly pulling out the gun on his hip and killing someone.

{"body":"An "accidental" shooting by cop is the standard way the US regime deals with "inconvenient" people these days. The Gestapo does not stage "accidents" or "suicides" anymore, they simply use one of their cops. The cop is sent to the victim's place of residence under some fake premise and shoots the person on sight right there, explaining it later as "accidental discharge". End of story. The cop then receives some sort of make-believe punishment - a slap on the wrist or even a fake jail sentence - and sent to a cozy taxpayer-funded retirement. The number of people the US regime murdered in this (or similar) fashion is estimated by researchers as somewhere between 0.5-1.0 million. This is greater than number of people who suffered from Stalin's repressions (!).		Apparently something went awry in this case. Obviously, the shooter did not expect that sort of witness presence. But at the same time he had strict orders to kill and kill *NOW*. So he just had no other choice but to shoot first and hope that his handlers will somehow get him out of the hot water afterwards. That's exactly what is happening right now. You are asking why there's no media attention directed at this? People in the media understand perfectly well that paying too much attention to this incident will earn them another visit by another cop with propensity to "accidental weapon discharge".

{"body":"First of all, this is pure hypothesis, and I am not trying to smear the police in this case, I am just trying to look at the situation from a different angle. I hope you will read the following with a grain of salt, and make your own perspective on the case.		To be honest the question is not whether or not he's a muderer (which it seems he is), or whether the force hid the data because it would be a scandal.		But why they hid the data. The most obvious reason is that this would have blown out of all proportions, if released and followed up upon, the question we need to ask ourselves, is perhaps why officers choose to go to officer school, why do they want to be a part of the police force? I imagine some of them do so, either because they have limited anger issues, there's a specific group they want to "hit", or they just want to get the option to shoot and kill some "bad guys" (I'm not saying this goes for every officer out there, I imagine a majority just wants to keep the peace). But if such people are in the force, then such a case here, could expose these people, and the case might suddendly become A LOT larger than it is.		When bringing up the case of racism (which was at the very least, the excuse) then we need to think about, is it really what was going on, or was it just the excuse used in those cases, to be honest using racism as an excuse is A. easy, and B. powerful, because people get really riled up with racism, which could be used to bury the story in that area, those cases might be related to other facts the police don't want out in the public.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"opjohnaexe","name":"t1_coqaah2","parent_id":"t3_2wdj8m","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424352256,"created_utc":1424352256}
