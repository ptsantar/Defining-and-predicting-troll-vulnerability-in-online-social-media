{"body":">Its not an investment.  Its a cost.  That's my point.  Don't use the word "investment".		I think you are mistaken. "Cost" and "investment" aren't mutually exclusive. A "good investment" often comes at the price of some "cost". Additionally, the word "investment" isn't restricted to finances. I can "invest" in my children's future by sending them to college. That's a "cost" to me but it also pays rewarding dividends. I can feel good having provided my kids with a college education, they will be better positioned in life, and America will gain more educated individuals. 		Such is the case with welfare. Sure, it has its issues, but at its core welfare is designed to help struggling Americans gain traction. I don't have time to find the statistics right now, but I'll gladly come back and provide them later. Poor people are often less educated than wealthier people. That's a fact. And if there's one thing you and I can agree on it's hopefully that America needs more educated people. 		And so that's what welfare is designed to do. It's designed to help people get the resources they need to at least be able to get educated and help themselves out of their hardship. The program could use a little help, sure. And sure, you could also call it a cost. But if you say that welfare, at its core, isn't an investment in America's future, then you have lost your way.		In a previous post you claimed that liberals don't believe in merit. That statement is egregiously false. To group people together like that is in line with the thought processes that created the Holocaust and racism.

If you put ticket prices quite low, hopefully you could drive a lot of passengers through the system (bare in mind it's only an hour from Washington to NY - throw in decent WiFi and a bar and that's a nice commute). 		Transrapid has good acceleration/deceleration so you can do low headways, hopefully as many as 30 trains an hour. That's ~40,000 people an hour given HSR trains.		So if you can run ~3 hours of full capacity (well, the equivalent to that) and do 120k an hour that's only $6.30 of track costs per person. 		If you sold tickets at $20 you'd have $1.6 million a day for everything else. Staff, electricity, etc. Hopefully you'd also drive strong additional sales (drinks, food, etc). 		Electricity costs aren't to bad. 2 dollars per ride -ish.		Then again, at $20 a ticket I'd think you'd get a lot more than 120,000 rides a day.

If you want to go back, which with permament colony you  probably will, this means another major complication. I also doubt that having access to sand or carbon dioxide is  a big advantage.		I think a lot of people on reddit severely overestimate our technological capabilities with regards to colonies on Mars. The technology to make anything remotely close to a self-sustaining colony just doesn't exist. Any colony on Mars would be very dependent on Earth, just like ISS is. With Mars this would make it much more expensive and complicated (and yes, also risky).		EDIT: Anyway, even bigger problem is that there simply is not any reason for making colony on Mars, apart from it being cool. You could perhaps make an argument for human exploration, though robots would probably be better for that. But what's the point of having colony there?","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rastafak","name":"t1_ct5mxyd","parent_id":"t1_ct5k2o2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1437074930,"created_utc":1437071330}

Most of the hometown fans would just spend their entertainment dollars on other local activities if they didn't have sports, and pay just as much taxes, while supporting a more diverse ecosystem of arts and community activities. Expenditures by visiting team fans are likely balanced by the outflow of local fans spending money traveling to away games.		The best that can be said is that a stadium can bring concentrated economic activity to a particular neighborhood, which can sometimes be a useful way to revitalize a formerly downtrodden area.

{"body":"From the article:		>Economic intuition suggests several of these problems:		>1. The redistributive implication of moving a franchise from one city to  another also applies to the context of moving a stadium from one part of a city to another.  If a new stadium is built in the downtown area to revitalize that section of town, then at least a portion of any such vitality naturally comes from the part of the city around the original stadium. 		>2. Much of the consumer spending associated with professional sports  comes out of the entertainment budgets of local residents.  When a new sports franchise appears in a city, local entertainment spending on sports increases and local entertainment spending on other activities like movies, bowling, etc. decreases.  The effective ???local spending multiplier??? on activities like bowling and attending plays or concerts is higher than the multiplier on professional sporting events because the owners of bowling alleys, theatres, and restaurants, as well as the employees of these establishments, live in the community while the owners and highly paid players (who receive a majority of team???s expenditures) on professional sports teams generally do not.  Since spending on professional sports teams substitutes for other local consumer entertainment spending and has a lower local spending multiplier, professional sports can reduce local income rather than increase it. 		>3. Sports are one of many cultural activities within the city. For every individual who derives enjoyment from the presence of the sports franchises in the community, there are likely to be other individuals who are uninterested in sports or even resent being taxed to subsidize an activity they have no use for. Others argue that sports culture diverts people from more socially beneficial interests and pursuits. Before accepting that sports teams generate external benefits, a careful and thorough look at ???external costs,??? and the alternative uses of resources devoted to subsidies???uses that might also have ???external benefits??????is clearly warranted. Unfortunately, such debate quickly leads public discourse and policymakers into a briar patch of unpriced values that are easily misrepresented. Thus, economists generally urge that society steer away from government sponsorship of cultural activities not related to education. 		>4. Government expenditures on stadium and arena subsidies carry opportunity costs which are never addressed.  Tax collections used to pay stadium debt, for example, could have gone for other public projects with higher social rates of return than a stadium.  One never knows what the returns to alternative uses of the funds might be because alternatives are never discussed.  These alternative uses could be construction or maintenance projects, on highways, mass transit systems, hospitals, or schools. Or, the alternative could be to reduce taxes. 		>5. Whatever inefficiencies might exist in a system without sports subsidies,  economic intuition suggests that government subsidization introduces new distortions and imperfections, including the excess burden and administrative costs of raising and spending tax monies.		It then goes on to admit that why they don't recommend it wasn't part of the survey, so it's not for sure one of these reasons, but does bring up some other stats.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jklharris","name":"t1_ct5nnhr","parent_id":"t1_ct5csf1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1437075938,"created_utc":1437072338}

{"body":"> How do you feel about video games?		I don't play video games as I tend to get too sucked into games and end up wasting far too much time on them. I figured this out in my early 20s (40s now) and have not played much of anything since (the occasional round on a Wii notwithstanding.) **Edit:** I'm not sure I really answered the question. For those who are able to regulate their in-game time to reasonable levels and who don't spend tons of real-world money on in-game crap I feel games are a good form of inexpensive escapist entertainment. Unfortunately many people (myself included) aren't able to do this and games end up being a massive waste of time.		> Romance novels?		It's not a genre I would choose to read myself but if it encourages someone to spend time reading who would otherwise waste it on watching shitty television I think they're fantastic!		> Action figures?		For children? Sure, kids need toys, especially ones that encourage them to play creatively. For adults? It's not something I've ever thought about. It seems like it would quickly grow into a massive time and money sink though.		> Other sports?		As a way to get exercise? Sure, sports are great.		As a form of overpriced spectator entertainment? Not interested.		I do follow F1 from a distance. (Lifelong lover of Ferrari road cars so by extension I have a degree of interest in their F1 team. I don't bother to actually watch more than race highlights though.) I also follow the NHL *very* casually -- I check the stats online a few times a season and *might* watch a few games of the Stanley Cup finals. I've never spent a dime on either though and if I was unable to follow casually for free I would happily give up either or both.		Speaking of spending, there is one thing that I admire about American pro sports: They have perfected the art of separating large numbers of morons from their money. The NFL seems to be particularly skilled at this although the NBA, NHL, and MLB are doing a great job too.		The rich continue to get richer and the sheep happily help make it happen. I freely admit I'm a bit jealous of the people who figured out a way to efficiently shear so much hard earned cash from so many suckers on such a regular basis.		***		Edit: As noted.","depth":5,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"solarpoweredhuman","name":"t1_ct5ixdj","parent_id":"t1_ct59kmi","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1437069206,"created_utc":1437065606}

NASA [spinoff](http://spinoff.nasa.gov/index.html) and [Tech transfer](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/tech_transfer/) programs are very well documented and everything listed is legitimately attributed to advances made by them in lieu with ESA, FKA and others. Deciding to treat them as misinformation or straight up propaganda is on par with denying moon landings or discovery of Higgs boson. 		>Besides, who knows what kind of inventions may have come out of investing that kind of money into proper education in developing countries.		Who knows. But global inequality and other crises are not as simple as throwing money at it and waiting for results. For example in India some 20% of population is hungry or malnourished, but at the same time 40% of produced food is going to waste. Money alone will not solve cultural, political and socioeconomical problems. Money won't end wars or bridge differences accumulated over thousand grievances going back generations.		Thankfully, there are ongoing reforms, along with international development goals and decades of hard political process, often with parties that are corrupt, contempt and fundamentally incapable of working together, already in operation. We are getting there, as slow as progress seems. Gutting space agencies wouldn't make it faster. 		>Who cares about "Video enhancing and analysis systems" and "Solar cells" when all people need is some food and decent education? Thousands of refugees are dying in the mediterranean and half of Yemen is on the move, and we are celebrating Temper foam and LEDs.		Besides the last paragraph, if you are really incapable of seeing all the ways that we have fundamentally changed modern life and continue to do so, alertness and response to global dangers such as climate change and Ozone depletion, advances in medicine or simple awe at how our universe works, there is not much point to this conversation.

I am aware that stadiums are generally built, at least partially, with a city's funding (read LOCAL taxpayer dollars NOT federal) - so the city pays for a stadium, at least partially to incentivize a team to stay within their city in hopes that in turn the city will be enriched by *at least the investment that was put into the stadium*.

With that clarification in mind, they are decidedly *not* paid for by the		>same fucking citizens		as you put it.  I don't pay any taxes in the city where the Falcon's stadium is located, but I do indeed pay federal income taxes.  This is a local government decision, and not something that has anything to do with those who are outside of their few mile radius of government, whereas it is when talking about NASA and the space program, as it is funded by dollars which *every american* (minus the negative payers!!) pays out each year.  Two very different concepts, one you have a rightful say in the use of, the other you do not, unless you live in that 10 square mile radius.  		Of course you are completely ignoring the *real* argument, that which says a local government generally puts a stadium in place hoping to recover *at least that much* financially in return through increased taxes through an increase in tourism and marketing dollars.  It is an investment, and one that is generally quite profitable for the city, whereas this project by NASA is in no way *financially* profitable for anyone.
