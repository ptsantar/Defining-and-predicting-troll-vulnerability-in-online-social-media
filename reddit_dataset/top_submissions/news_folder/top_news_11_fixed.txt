Think the getaway driver is sitting out in the car waiting for a bank robbery, the bank robbery goes south and someone gets shot, in most states that recognize felony murder then the get away driver can be convicted of the murder even though he never intended to kill anyone.		If Florida does recognize attempted felony murder then I imagine that means that you can impute the required mental state of attempted murder onto an actor who didn't commit the attempt. So in the same example, if during the bank robbery the armed robber tries to kill a teller but fails then the getaway driver could be charged with attempted murder even though he again lacked the requisite mens rea.		So while I'm not a Florida lawyer, and don't really know how attempted felony murder works, I don't think it would fly here because there's still no specific intent to kill. I know that felony murder can bump up other homicides to murder even without the mens rea component, but I don't think that's how attempted felony murder would work.

{"body":"Sure! The short version is that it's a GPS-based game you play on your phone, so that you have to physically go to different locations to capture portals. Portals are just GPS markers set at interesting locations, like public art, murals, points of interest, libraries, churches, civic buildings, historical markers, etc. 		There are two teams, Resistance (blue) and Enlightened (Green). You place resonators on portals to capture them for your team, and destroy resonators to liberate portals from enemy influence. After you've captured portals, you link them together. When you make a triangle, it creates a field, and the area under the triangle is captured. Triangles can be just a few meters on a side, or they can [literally cover all of Europe.](https://i.imgur.com/GPQATAL.jpg) When you throw a field, you capture the "Mind Units" in the fielded area, and basically that's how the game is scored. 		There is a lot more to it than that. It's a LOT of fun. It gets you out of the house, helps you explore the world around you, and as you level up, you get to know other players and become part of the team. I've made friends among the Resistance in my area, and even gotten to know some of the Enlightened.

Maybe he committed a crime against humanity because he has the inability to feel empathy, which is an illness -- but he still committed a crime against federal and state law, and he had the full faculties needed to consider the consequences of his actions. 		(As far as I can see) he was not hallucinating or paranoid when he made each diagnosis and he was not mentally retarded in any way. Some heinous crimes -- murder, rape, robbery, etc -- can be excused by specific mental illnesses because the criminal was unable to control her actions or consider the consequences due to delusions about the world around her, crippling paranoia, obsessive thoughts, or a lack of cognitive ability. Sociopaths do not usually suffer from any of these symptoms. And, throwing a sociopath in jail or punishing them in some way that really hurts is truly the only "treatment" that there is; we will never be able to make them understand guilt or make them feel what others feel when they suffer, because they lack the ability. But, they do have the ability to feel their own suffering and pain, and the ability to understand that suffering and pain is the consequence to treating other people badly. Sociopaths that have not committed crimes also have the ability to see others' sociopathic acts being caught and punished and to wish dearly that they themselves not be punished in the same way; even if they feel nothing for the other person being punished. So, while punishing mentally ill criminals is amoral and while for them treatment is more effective, punishing a sociopath for his crimes despite his sociopathy is  not wrong because he has the ability to stop himself.

It was only until he had very reasonable expectations that the humans were going to attack that he hatched his plan, which was meant to protect the apes, not harm them and obviously he was going to be more suspicious than the other apes. He also had reasonable concerns about Caesar's trust in the humans.		Even his assassination of Caesar could be seen as an action he felt he had to take to protect 100s of other apes from death , even though I think that it was his most classically villainous action.		At the end of the film, it celebrates Caesar's victory over Koba in a way that just felt plain wrong.		Other people have felt the same way if you google it. The fucked up thing is in the first film, Caesar uses Koba as a tool to inflict violence on the humans. He is the one who actually encouraged the violence in the first place.		Perhaps the writers meant for the viewers to feel this way as they wanted to portray something more complex about the cause of war.

{"body":"> Millgram and Zimbardo taught us that ordinary people can do quite evil acts when they are put in a situation which normalizes cruelty or indifference and pressures them into conforming to authority.		See that's not quite it, it's not as obvious as you put it. It says that once you are under certain situation you act a certain way. It implies that this circumstance is more powerful than your personality or form of being.		You begin first light. Imagine that Hitler came over and asked you for help fixing his house. You are poor and don't have much money, have to pay loans and to top it all you take care of a three orphans, because you are such a good person. You realize that Hitler's house doesn't really need fixing, but fuck the guy, you make him pay for a lot of repairs and fixes. Sure there's a small, tiny, chance that some damage may happen to the house, but it's generally exaggerated and you won't take it that far.		See even though you live in a society that does not promote fraud and cheating people, you still might justify it. The important thing is that society allows you to find yourself in a situation that you can. No one tells you to cheat someone, but the lenders are asking for their money back and leaving it pretty implicit that if you have to break the laws to pay them, for all they care, you should. Not that the lenders are asking, but they are also in the same thing: that kind of demanding and dehumanizing pays better, and it very rarely would result in something bad. Moreover it's not like you have to deal with the person whose house is destroyed, workers do that and they can fall back on just doing what you said was needed.		The thing is that one won't work, and cheating Hitler works pretty well. So you begin doing it again, you look for another asshole to screw over and you do it. Each time you do it you justify your reason to do it, more and more, and each time you do it there's a risk that the real reason (just plain greed, which is what drives us to survive) will be exposed making all those rules (of not hurting good people, of never abusing it to the point it might hurt other people, etc.) have to be broken and you have to justify why you did it (meaning you can keep breaking it).		See I could see that corrupting me, I could see that corrupting anyone. You and I are in a situation that we can choose to not take the first step, but that choice can be taken away from you. Once that is gone then it's a path.		This man probably went down a similar path. He probably started with conditions that weren't that bad. Since he didn't do the treatment or anything like that he could decouple himself. He might have been desperate initially, but later on couldn't really use that justification, not that it mattered. At first maybe he called for appendix removals that weren't needed, or minor surgeries. Maybe when things were 50-50 chance of it being cancer or not, he'd just jump to treatment instead of making 100% sure, and sometimes it paid off. And each time he'd do it more, and each time he'd do worse and worse and justify it off.		And when you face yourself with that you can't just justify how you are not like him. Instead understand how you could be like him. The only way to not be evil is to constantly question how we are evil.		Wonder: are you putting yourself in a position were your need to pay debts to others put you in a place were you'll be damned if you do or damned if you don't? Are there decisions were you chose the lesser evil, but now claim it was actually a good choice (leading to you being able to do it worse and worse each time)? Do you sometimes do actions that could hurt someone you don't see? How do you deal with glass trash? How often do you think of what your words might make people do? How often do you check that you are not putting someone else in a position that might lead them to evil? Have you judged someone by their actions and dismissed their intentions or simply considered them evil?		And it is a lot to worry. It can lead to inaction (which can be just as bad) so a balance must be struck. I wish I knew were this balance was, or how to avoid it, but I've failed on both sides and am probably one of the worst references for the answer. All I understand is that there's a question, and we must not avoid it.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lookmeat","name":"t1_csvo397","parent_id":"t1_csvagw2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436320687,"created_utc":1436317087}

Now I don't think that the fact that under certain situations I would be evil makes me free of responsibility. Indeed I actually hold myself responsible for the situations that I put myself into and if they lead to evil. Ej. If I get drunk and run over someone, the fact that I wasn't thinking clearly when I did it is still wrong, because I allowed myself to be in a situation were I couldn't prevent it.		The same way I still blame this man for his actions. He took the easy way out and decided not to question it. Even as the need disappeared and it became clear that he was abusing it he still ignored it and went on.		My argument is that it's important not to think of this man as an aberration, but understand that he is a human being like you or me. And that just as he was capable of terrible actions, so are we. The thing is that we must question why we do this.		Your reference to *Einchmann in Jerusalem* is perfect for this. When you dismiss other evil actions as "something wrong with them" and ignore how you could fall part of it, it's easy to justify that your case "is different". But all of this are the same excuses that Einchmann would use.		Not all people are the same, some people will realize in horror what they are doing and refuse to go on. Some people will stop even when their environment would push them to. The difference is that this people realize they are capable of great evil and refuse to do it.

A sociopath isn't nice to someone else because it makes them feel good to make another person feel good. It's an intellectual decision. This makes almost every decision almost a very selfish act. Sociopaths, left to their own devices, will only do good when it benefits them whether it's creating relationships that they desire or getting them rewards they are looking for.		This guy for sure has this problem because I don't see how a normal person who is capable of feeling empathy could do this to 533 other people otherwise.

Intellectually he knew it was wrong as I am sure he is not an idiot and fully aware of the social ramifications of his decisions. Where I said he got addicted was that even though he lacks empathy he can still get spikes of adrenaline from doing something wrong. It's a gamble. In the beginning not only was he financially benefiting from giving chemo to non-cancer patients, he was also risking his life and career on it. It was an adrenaline rush. And yes, you can get addicted to the dopamine and adrenaline that your own body releases during this act. Eventually this wore off and eventually it just became a regular thing in his daily routine. It's where addiction became habit.		So, in a way, he was helpless for a short while because he got caught up in his own sort of gambling addiction. Risk his life and career on hurting others for profit. I don't know if this is how it went down, I have not read further into it.

For the record, my job involves a ton of medical record review, knowing insurance company payment and auditing policy, and generally knowing how to optimize billing (ethically) without committing fraud, even accidentally.

They look for medical necessity (did you attach proof that the patient has the disease you claimed), do the treatments match the illness, etc. 		They also have fraud departments that look for statistical anomalies, like if one doctor seems to have a *lot* more chemo or radiation treatments on average than most comparable physicians, then they do a more thorough audit on a selection of that physician's charts than normal. There's also random audits for the same reason.		Either this guy was really, really good at staying under the radar or someone wasn't doing their job.

At this point in history, most intelligent people are probably just as capable as a doctor of deciding on an appropriate treatment for most common illnesses. So to say all nurses only THINK they know as much as a doctor, is probably incorrect. If a nurse was dedicated and intelligent, what would stop them from learning as much as a doctor. Do you think there is secret information that they only teach doctors in medical school that no one else has access to? The AMA artificially keeps the number of doctors low to increase the pay for physicians by setting limits on how many students a medical school can accept in order to be accredited. This means that there are more people capable of becoming doctors than there are doctors. Isn't it possible that a lot of nurses could have become doctors if not for these artificial limits?

You can call it wild speculation, but if anyone googles the issue, it becomes quite clear that the AMA is not making any effort to increase the number of residencies and are actively fighting that in an effort to increase it's member's salaries. I'm not a nurse nor do I have any horse in the race, but honestly, I wouldn't want someone like you as my doctor. You seem like the type of doctor who is convinced he knows better than everyone. Those are dangerous doctors. I'm sure you are very intelligent, and I'm sure you have worked extremely hard to get where you are. However, to think you know more than ANY nurse out there strictly because you passed a licensing exam makes me think you wouldn't be open to any "lesser" person's opinion about a medical treatment. And also, nurses actually DO have to pass a licensing exam, I figured a soon-to-be doctor would know that. And to your earlier points, nurse practitioner's actually can prescribe drugs, and I'm sure some nurses do read journal articles and do research. But you're the doctor, so I guess you know what every nurse in the world does and thinks. Guess what? I'm a data analyst, and I read medical journals about conditions I, and people I know have. I do research into my own medical treatments. And, I ask my doctor to prescribe drugs that my research has led me to believe will be effective treatments. Just because he is legally the only one allowed to write is his name on the piece of paper, doesn't necessarily mean he's done more research than I have on my conditions. So the public doesn't understand the division of labor, but I don't think you understand the article you are commenting on. The doctor in this case, who passed his licensing exam and specialty boards, was clearly not providing the proper treatments to his patients. Yet, it was his NURSE who first blew the whistle on him.

TLDR; thought he was better than everything and everyone, started a civil war in fucking heaven and after being cast out, successfully got us all to start sinning and cast out of Eden. 		Making him out to be like some philosopher who innocently questioned God on a few finer points and was thrown out for it by an "unquestionable tyrant" shows you know very little of the character.","depth":4,"score":146,"ups":146,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"a_midgets_last_stand","name":"t1_csvdd20","parent_id":"t1_csv8z5d","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436303477,"created_utc":1436299877}

That's the only biblical usage of "Lucifer," and according to the [NET (New English Translation)](https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Isaiah+14:11), it was the name of a celestial body:		> The Hebrew text has ???????????? ??????????????????????

Your quote from Revelation is clearly about the Devil, but Revelation is sort of crazy in general.

Yes it's possible to experience love and happiness without endorsing a god, but that has nothing to do with the story.  Did you expect Lucifer to be an atheist? That makes no sense.  Now, the limitation you mentioned is what is referred to as free will and is simple enough. If God had the amount power you're hinting at, we wouldn't even exist.  In short, God is not a tyrant because he represents love, happiness, positive energy and Satan wanted that power so he challenged him but he's an angel and couldn't defeat god so now he's all contemplating how to mess with mankind because he's butthurt that he didn't beat god and can't get back into heaven... but for real man, it's just a story about good and evil and you're talking about evil as if it's a hero and good as if it's oppressive, wut?","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bananafighter","name":"t1_csvongg","parent_id":"t1_csvgt5m","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436321719,"created_utc":1436318119}

Over a decade later I learned my doctor's mistake, but it's far too late to repair.  As a result I suffer immeasurably and without ceasing.

{"body":"That sounds like a devastating ordeal, I do hope you're doing better now. Misdiagnosis (and misprognosis) led to one of my exes (he was 26 at the time) losing his quality of life almost entirely, although he's alive still and it turns out what they were treating him for was completely benign, but they were sure it was "95%" malignant. 		In just the diagnostic stage, they were so aggressive with their methods obtaining a sample (it was attatched to a major organ) that his heart stopped during the procedure, resulting in stroke, and he 2 years later still has not returned to work. Apart from the shadow on their xray he was getting checked out, he had zero health problems, would jog and eat well, was well loved at work... his life was going really swell. Now, he has just had a trache tube removed after having it in for 8 months straight, simply because the doctors were overzealous and not thorough. The lat 18 months have just been a lot of infections, checkups, disappointments, and on and on. Because of the effects of the stroke he cannot even bathe himself alone anymore, that is the state of his life and he's not even 30. 		And this wasn't a case of an unskilled or low-ranking doctor. The same complication which caused his stroke had started to emerge just a few months earlier when the same process was attempted at a different hospital, and with that information in mind, the head of the department (lots of awards and everything) at a major hospital *still* screwed it up. The head surgeon seemed guilty, he wouldn't even speak directly with his mum although he would chat to me. He helped get the guy into the best rehab he could (a big deal in canada where the waitlists for everything are endless), but at the end of the day his quality of life is shot. Because his rehab progress stagnated so early, there is not much hope he will recover most of his function now as neuro damage is best recovered in the first year, with most of it happening in the first 6 months. I was new to the country and Canadian healthcare really when this happened, and I found out later that its kind of a money-saving tactic to not restart procedures or waste surgery spots. There's no excuse for the medical costs in the US, but here you see the other side of the spectrum, where because doctors aren't incentivized by money, they don't do what's best for you either, they do what's cheapest for them.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KnitterWithAttitude","name":"t1_csvp92g","parent_id":"t1_csvolb5","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436322805,"created_utc":1436319205}

The "human nature" argument (as in, "people suck") is a profoundly conservative argument that masquerades as "realism". It's a way to effectively silence dissent, and has been used that way historically for a long long time. 		Human nature is awesome. People are warm, generous and giving. Even today, when screwing other people over ensures you do better, people volunteer in massive numbers, and the poorer people are, the more they stand up for their fellow man for no other reward than feeling good about helping. 		When people bring up human nature as a defense of capitalism, it's a pretty surefire bet that they have spent no time at all actually pondering the nature of humans. They just use the term as shorthand for "people are evil". Which is frankly nonsensical. 		In an evil system built on competition, people act in evil ways.

To feed everyone who is going hungry on the Earth today, it would cost something like $3 billion a year. So, they have the equivalent of 100 years of food worth of money just sitting around. 		Furthermore, the world is stunningly wasteful today. America alone blows $1.5 *trillion* per year just on the war machine, which is essentially something that exists only to kill humans. Many other countries have militaries too, that exist only to kill humans. All of that is just a massive waste. 		Then, add the waste inherent to capitalism itself - products are made super cheap, which means quality is shit, which means products break almost instantly and need to be rebuilt from scratch and sold... and then they break again. So we're churning out unbelievable quantities of pure waste, which is an inherent part of the system. 		And we then super-charge that waste by creating intentional planned obsolescence where we make the products even worse so they'll break faster. 		It would be easy to take care of everyone if we used a cooperative system where efficiency and sustainability was emphasized. We haven't even begun exploring all our options for food creation, to pick just one thing - it doesn't all have to be done using monocultures in soil.

Prior to the ACA, some insurance policies excluded some aspects of care from counting towards the out of pocket maximum.  For instance, a policy might say that a patient owed 20% of facility fees, regardless of out of pocket maximums.  If a patient is admitted, that can amount to $200/night easily (and may be more).  The ACA ended that insurance company trick.		* The ACA also prohibited cancelling policies for pre-existing conditions.  This was perhaps the dirtiest trick by insurance companies.  If a policy-holder had a serious condition, the insurance company would request years of back records to find something the patient did not disclose when applying for coverage.  You might be 26 and have leukemia, and the insurance company would cancel your policy because you did not report that you had mono in freshman year of college.  The ACA ended that.

Which isn't necessarily FRAUD -- at least not in the blatant "malice" sense that the OP linked doctor committed it.		Keep in mind that -- especially with "cancer screening" tests (i.e. tests administered just as a matter of course during a regular checkup, no patient reported symptoms or anything) -- the rate of "false positive" test results is fairly high. Even additional "testing" via other means will not always reveal ALL of the "false positives", and thus a "false" diagnosis can easily be accepted and the push for treatment begin.		There is in fact a LOT of controversy over nearly every form of cancer "screening" test because of this -- a lot of people are going through entirely unnecessary surgeries & treatments, and in some cases suffering death or other harm -- when they would have been perfectly healthy, and lived at least as long (if not longer) had they never been tested.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Absinthe99","name":"t1_csvq00b","parent_id":"t1_csv5w4p","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436324128,"created_utc":1436320528}

The fact that there can be false positives, even with additional tests such as a PET scan, is exactly why I suggested patients ask questions and get a second opinion before consenting to extreme treatment options.		Yes, but not to put too fine a point on it. Talking about an individual case as a "false diagnosis" is a bit misleading/misinforming.		A better term would be that it was an *incorrect diagnosis* -- and that it was due in part to "false positive" test results.		The latter are not only quite common, but when it comes to *cancer* ***screening*** *tests*, are in fact the overwhelming MAJORITY (i.e. if you have no symptoms, and a "routine" cancer screening test comes back with a reading that is interpreted as "positive", in *nearly every category of cancer* there is still a greater than 50% chance 	with some types of cancer a greater than 90% chance) that the patient does NOT actually have cancer -- that's simply the way the sensitivity/specificity of the tests work out *when they are applied w/o any underlying medical reason to a large population* in which the actual incidence rate of the disease is actually low).		Unfortunately, most doctors DO NOT understand the statistics involved in this; and even those who do, often have a difficult time explaining it to patients.		Alas, the much vaunted "second opinion" -- especially absent an actively "critical" and questioning patient (and/or loved one) who digs into the details themselves -- is often of little value (in fact most often it ends up being of virtually no value, and little better than a cursory "rubber stamp" review; with the second doctor being more of an advocate for some *different* treatment regimen, rather than truly digging into the validity of the diagnosis).  Now in their defense, doctors are given little time, and patients themselves -- having heard the dreaded "C" word -- often overreact in terms of just "wanting it gone" (i.e. some "quick fix" even it is painful/risky), and have little interest in comprehending much less analyzing the merits of the various options (the most common and probably most meritorious of which -- *especially relative to "screening" test results* 	and that DOES need to be emphasized	 -- is the option to "do nothing" and retest 6+ months later; as many false positives are revealed as such, and what are called "incidentalomas" simply *disappear* during that time frame.)		Because despite what the industry claims -- and what the media promotes -- the whole "early detection" meme is essentially false.  		The majority of truly "aggressive" cancers are first of all, likely to kill you REGARDLESS of treatment; and secondly they are highly unlikely to be detected by some "screening test" *in the complete ABSENCE of prior symptoms* (that is symptoms that were reported BEFORE the "positive" test result -- patients who do test "positive" invariably tend to psychosomatically create/report symptoms afterward, based simply off of the fear of having been told they might/probably have cancer).  And just as a final kicker-note, the advocates of screening-tests nearly always ignore the debilitating impact that false positives have in that regard -- the tests themselves arguably cause far more harm than they do any good. (Especially in regard to actual survival rates -- which are almost wholly unaffected even in those who truly have cancer -- when you account for the artifice of [lead-time bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_time_bias); the entire "early detection" theory is essentially fraudulent in nature, at least as implemented.)","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Absinthe99","name":"t1_csw3qo5","parent_id":"t1_csvs98s","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436362052,"created_utc":1436358452}

{"body":"> As an aside, this wasn't discovered as part of a cancer screening or based on markers.		No, but these days the vast majority of people who get a diagnosis of "cancer" are in fact a result of a screening test -- and **that** is what IMHO is really most relevant to the overwhelming majority of people reading this thread.		And it is beyond question that cancer screening (which is STILL being heavily promoted, despite changes in guidelines) creates a LOT of false positives, and it also creates a lot of unnecessary (and expensive, stressful) treatment and as a result of that essentially a vast increase in the number of (arguably "false") cancer "survivors": people who underwent treatment (be it surgery, radiation, chemo, etc) but who probably didn't have to, and who really gained little or no health benefit from it, if not additional problem, even premature death, resulting FROM the treatment (not that most of them or their families will necessarily EVER believe or understand that -- post treatment rationalization 	not the least of which because of co-treatment "positive thinking" psychobabble about "fighting" cancer	 makes it much easier to believe that the intervention was both necessary AND successful -- in fact about the only time someone will question it is if they both survived AND suffered some major disability as a result 	usually meaning significant expenses, and so liability for them causes a revisiting of the diagnosis, including an examination/verification of malignancy	.)	 	One REALLY bothersome complicating result of that -- beyond the false perception out there of all these "survivors" (which is bad enough) -- is that the reported "incidence rate" for certain types of cancers (those being screened for\*) has increased substantially, even though the reality is that the prevalence of what people actually *think of as "cancer"* -- i.e. debilitating malignant cancerous tumors and life threatening metastatized cancers -- has in fact not changed much all (not in general across the population); nor have the survival 	actually death\*	 rates been altered much (again, not when lead-time bias has been properly accounted for).		---		\* To wit: the [advent of screening for thyroid cancer has led to a DRAMATIC rise in the incidence rate](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/health/study-warns-against-overdiagnosis-of-thyroid-cancer.html?_r=0) (doubling in the US in just 20 years, and even higher elsewhere -- ridiculously so in South Korea which went on a "binge" of heavily promoted cancer screening & aggressive treatments) -- even though the death rate remains trivially low (and essentially unchanged).		\*\* On a per 100,000 person basis, the number of cancer deaths is only slightly lower in 2012 compared to 20 years prior -- and it is debatable what the cause of that is, whether it is the result of the decrease in smoking, the improvement in general air quality and other environmental factors, the massive change in workplace safety & environment (especially as regards industrial and mining air-quality, ventilation & worker respiratory PPE), and even the possibility that the 1970's to 1990's uptick was a result of post WWII radiation (the proliferation of initial, poor quality XRay equipment as well as the needless exposure of many GI's and the general population to non-natural ionizing radiation).","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Absinthe99","name":"t1_cswa9wh","parent_id":"t1_csw431t","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436374227,"created_utc":1436370627}

And only if you're having issues with them or engaging in a rough sport and need it. They're also more willing to physically touch patients, so for example, they may become aware of an abscess in your abdomen earlier than an MD because their first reaction when you say your stomach hurts is to feel around to make sure there are no physical abnormalities. They are less quick to prescribe medications, but I've never gone to a DO who didn't prescribe a medication when it was necessary; they just always make sure to try non-medication treatment first. You're depressed?

{"body":"Most people who are worried that they are depressed go directly to their general practitioners. In the US, GPs often treat depression because many, many people are unable to afford psychiatrist or therapist visits. Yay US healthcare!		Anyways, many people who are going through a period of depression (Note: who do not have major depression,) greatly benefit from a workout routine because they aren't chronically depressed. I've known many people who have been on antidepressants at a time in their life when they needed a boost -- most adults experience at least one period of mild to moderate depression in their lifetime. Studies (I'm sorry I can't produce them because I don't remember where I've read it) have shown that a change in routine and exercise -- most importantly because of all the endorphins and dopamine you talked about, and the elimination of cortisol -- is enough to kick them out of the funk. This is a cheaper option than medication, does not cause many of the undesirable side effects of medication, does not cause withdrawals when tapered off, does not incur the stigma that many psychotropics produce from the family members of the patients, and promotes an overall healthier lifestyle. Of course, if someone with serious chronic depression walks into a DO's office and cannot afford / refuses to be referred to a specialist, the first line of defence is an antidepressant. I'm not saying that a chronically depressed person just needs to get up and exercise and that antidepressants are unnecessary or that the DOs I've been treated by believe as such; I've got my own share of mental illnesses, and I take a cocktail of medication for them, and I'm okay with that. I'm privelidged enough to have the money and insurance to visit a great psychiatrist and to attend therapists when its necessary. (I also exercise semi-regularly, cuz you know, health and stuff. :P)  However, many people with a touch of depression don't need medication. My aunt, for instance, took an antidepressant for a little while a few years ago when she was going through a rough patch, and then came off of it when things started looking up. After her mom died a couple years ago, she chose to exercise instead of antidepressants and feels that it was the only thing that go her through the first few months afterward.		Also, in the US at least, DOs are held up to the exact same standards and take the exact same certification exams as MDs. The only difference is that they also must be certified in osteopathy.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alittlegnome","name":"t1_csvucfy","parent_id":"t1_csvrest","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436332124,"created_utc":1436328524}

And 99% of all doctors resoundingly agree with that statement.  Doctors don't get paid for each drug they prescribe.  They get paid through insurance compensation for billable actions like managing a complex medical problem, performing a procedure, reading a MRI, etc. Medicare sets an amount of Relative Value Units for each action and sets what 1 RVU pays.  Private insurance generally follows suit.  So, a doctor could hypothetically get paid more for taking a complicated patient off a few drugs in a complex visit rather than just a quick check up on the same patient.  You don't get paid per Rx. You get paid for the time and skill investment of the actions you do.  The system is far for perfect, and is weighted (some argue) to much to rewarding speciality Tx over primary care.  However, it's absurd to claim generally doctors get paid for each drug.  		This guy is an exception because he not only billed as a doctor, but worked as a businessman and owned the cancer clinics.  So, he got to bill a facility fee and a provider fee.  Most of the time this isn't a problem, since most MDs in private practice can't do that, but the cancer care market is unique in that it requires frequent IV infusions.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AgnosticKierkegaard","name":"t1_csvjz52","parent_id":"t1_csvjpi7","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436313503,"created_utc":1436309903}

Historically you only got insurance for major stuff, and the small Drs. visits were payed out of pocket.  However, healthcare changed, and the average care got more (from a country doctor's visit to routine care involving labwork, imaging etc.) expensive so insurance expanded.  Insurance as America's primary means is antiquated, and really needs to be fixed.  I agree!		>We, as patients, need to know where our money is going in order to have more control over our health care.		Sure!  But that's on the insurance, not the doctors.

Is the $3.3 billion lost in healthcare fraud a large enough sample size? http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-recovers-3-3-billion-in-federal-health-care-fraud-1426737703		If hospitals and doctors offices are fraudulently billing patients for things they aren't supposed to be billing them for, then what makes you think they're above taking bribes from pharmaceutical companies? 		>So, you're saying that the only reasonable conclusion is a conspiracy?		Yes. Of course I can't be 100% positive, but when the doctor is not going out of her way to prescribe to me any medication for problems I complain about (I have to first ask if she can prescribe to me X or Y for this and that problem) but instead prescribes to me and MY WHOLE FAMILY medication that is unnecessary (since I have relatively clear skin except for 3-4 small acne scars that don't need to be medicated with a 6-months regimen of antibiotics that have side effects), I have to ask myself, "What is motivating them to do this even when I insist that I don't want or need acne medication?"		Furthermore, it is no coincidence that the dermatologist works on the same street as the family doctor and both are pushing the same acne medication when it was not asked for and is unnecessary for the patients who have relatively clear skin. Is it so absurd to assume that the drug company is affiliated with doctors in the same commercial area?		If you think it is absurd for me to come to this conclusion, then I don't know what to say to you. I've already stated that I don't view most doctors as immoral. Most doctors genuinely care for their patients. But there needs to be a crackdown on those who are affiliated with drug companies. Doctors should not be prescribing unnecessary medication (and ordering unnecessary procedures) left and right. Sure, perhaps there is some slight skin improvement? But at what cost? Gastrointestinal problems? Depression? Hormonal imbalance? A doctor should be weighing the pros and cons of every procedure and medication and letting the patients know about the side effects.		Instead, when the pharmaceutical companies give the doctors an incentive to prescribe their drug, then the doctor might prescribe the drug when he/she otherwise wouldn't have.		Perhaps I am greatly overestimating the problem based on my limited experiences. But I think greed and corruption are more common than people realize, and things are beginning to surface now (OP) because the government is getting involved.		The whole drug company-bribery thing aside, doctors/hospitals are also over-billing, misbilling, and ordering unnecessary procedures (that they can directly bill to the insurance). So my anecdote regarding the acne medication thing is just one of many shady experiences.		I've had a doctor charge me for four level-3 office visits for a two-step TB test and readings. She charged me a level-3 office visit for a TB test reading (sticking my arm over the counter and letting a nurse run her finger over it)! Of course, when I complained to the billing office, they stated that "that's how we charge all patients". After threatening to report them to my insurance, they finally agreed to "waive" the TB test readings and only charge a level-3 visit for the two TB test administrations...		I should've just went to Rite Aid...		Just think of all the ignorant patients who don't know what a level-3 visit is and who don't know that charging a level-3 visit for a TB test reading is wrong.		Perhaps I just live in an area with corrupt private practices, I don't know. Because the local community clinics all have very kind and honest doctors, who work there for less pay than at the major hospital systems and who try to advise their patients on ways to save money, what procedures/tests are necessary, etc., instead of just pushing procedures and drugs on them left and right.		In any case, take of this what you will. My experience is just n=1, but I doubt it is isolated, as evidenced by the OP, the $3.3 billion in healthcare fraud, and other incidences that are continuing to surface.		>I think you're tilting at windmills.

Edit: Antineoplastons have not been proven to be cancer cure. It's how the FDA went about restricting these treatment methods developed by Dr.Bruzynski that should raise alarm. There are some public documents from the FDA that were shown in the trials and they specifically tell the court to find Bruzynski guilty so he would be forced to stop his research. The FDA then allowed 'Elan Pharmaceuticals' to patent certain Bruzynski's chemical compounds, the same compounds they were taking Bruzynski to trial for, for "Quackery".

{"body":"Also Excellent points.		 I recently got down-voted into oblivion for suggesting that the root cause for the recent Charleston shootings  was not racism. Racism was the motivation, and is indeed a huge problem (more so than most people realize), but even the sickest of criminals are a product of their environment and in many cases mental illness (which can also be a product of the environment). Some rare few are simply defective from birth, but like you said these types of events don't originate in a vacuum. There are always roots to trace back to a catalyst(s).  		Punishing the worst of the worst based on what they "deserve" is not functional to society. Providing an intervention that protects society from that individual and other similar individuals  and occurrences is. 		Now, when you apply this to the average offender and not the murderous or sadistic sociopaths, you start to realize that most inmates do not belong behind bars and that there are many different ways of correcting criminal behavior; and that incarceration is actually counterproductive much of the time. 		But retributive justice and punitive policy are so ingrained and normalized within our culture these days, trying to explain this to people usually opens one up to hostility. So many people can't seem to see the difference between a murderer and a mass murderer, or the complex web of variables that cause these crimes, or less serious ones. They assume when you start listing of possible reasons for a crime, that you are making excuses for the offender instead of trying to understand the "why". Suddenly the offender is less one-dimensional and is harder to hate, but it feels good to hate and people get very upset when you impede their ability to d so. 		 People love to boil criminality down into black and white morality when in reality the concept of good and evil play no role at all. Evil is just sickness or defectiveness. This is a fact that people can't seem to grasp. This of course doesn't mean people like this doctor shouldn't be held accountable or punished, it only means it is important to understand them psychologically instead of label them dichotomously  and write everything else off. Emotional reasoning is really holding humanity back when everybody would prefer to engage important issues emotionally instead of logically. 		And thus the focus is always on punishment instead of holding the true issue accountable. Healthcare being privatized causes many deaths, many instances of fraud, and occasional situations like this.

{"body":"I can totally understand where you're coming from, I feel the same way. I just don't think feelings (especially the victims') should play a part in what needs to be done to make the punishment functional. 		I think the facts and evidence is all that is needed. He's a killer/torturer in a sense = he needs to be locked away for good. Everything else is an appeal to emotion, unless you make the argument that people won't commit these types of crimes if they see it leads to the death penalty. But this has been shown to be false. And either way, life in prison is just as scary a deterrent as death I would think. 		Just because he deserves to suffer or die, does not give any human or government the right or excuse to decide how much he suffers or whether he lives or dies. The court's soul function should be to remove threats and preserve public safety, to ensure the victims receive any sort of reparation possible or required, and to rehabilitate offenders who have the potential to reform their criminal thinking.  		But it really is a matter of opinion. My main beef with the death penalty is nothing is ever known for sure. A guilty conviction is almost never 100% accurate. In this guy's case it's a bit different, but it still sets a dangerous precedent that it's okay to kill people who have killed or committed crimes of a similar scale. Even murderers justify their killings. 		I try to look at justice as what society deserves, not what the offender deserves. In this extreme case, society deserves to be separate from this monster and the victims deserve compensation. But emotions are best left outside the policy of law. Even though they all deserve whatever might repair the emotional damage, that is sadly their burden, the very thing that makes them a victim is that they had something taken from them. The state should not be tasked with killing or making the offender suffer, on behalf of the victim. 		But yeah, I definitely won't shed any tears for the guy if he is given a death sentence.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SublimeInAll","name":"t1_csvchqc","parent_id":"t1_csvb541","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1436302246,"created_utc":1436298646}
