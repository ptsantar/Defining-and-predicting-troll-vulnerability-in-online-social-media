{"body":"The US government will not use net neutrality to censor the Internet.		The US government will not use the patriot act to spy on the Internet on every citizen.		The US government will not use the patriot act to spy on phone calls of everyone.		The US government will not use the IRS to go after their political enemies. 		The US government will not use the threat of terrorism to take away our rights.		The US government will not ban guns and limit their use by fiat every time there is a tragedy. 		The US government will not abuse its power to benefit few select companies over their competition. 		Where have I heard that before? You are right, the US government has no history of abusing its power ALL the time. No we can trust them, the US government is run by angels. 		Essentially its government control of the internet. What has happened is that the big ISP have lobbies state and local governments in the past decade to put in so much regulations and red tape so that small ISP can't properly operate and new ones can't start up. 		Giant obvious example of this is Google, who are no small company, one of the biggest in the world and they can't setup internet properly due to government regulations. If they can't do it, how are small ISP's supposed to open or operate?		So not satisfied with the amount of control they have, the big ISP decided to work with the federal government to get even more monopoly on the internet and allow the federal government to control the internet and surveill people all in one. So they started giving certain websites faster speeds for monetary compensation, normally this wouldn't work, but because they've already lobbied governments in the past decade or so, they've limited competition so much that they have no fears of competition.		This allowed the federal government to use this to once and for all gain control of the internet. They tried with CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, etc... but when it was to "protect the internet from terrorists" or "keep our banks and financial system safe", people saw through the lies, they understood that government is bad news for the internet, so they changed the wrap around government internet control to "net neutrality". What is more hated than government? Big Corporations! So you change the wrap from keeping banks safe and keeping the internet safe from terrorists, to "sticking it to the evil big corporations who want to destroy the internet". even though those those same corporations that actually provide the internet, so destroying it wouldn't be in their best interest at all. 		So now, with the wrap changed, they have converted all those who rallied against CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, etc... government control of the internet to have them support government control of the internet. 		They've used the same tactics they used to pass the "patriot act" and other terrible laws, they give it a good wrap, even though the contents inside are poison. 		So that is what's happened, the federal government has gained control of the internet without laws, without congress, without debate, all through undemocratic, unconstitutional, bureaucratic decision to reclassify it to utility under the 1996 telecommunications act. 		What is going to happen in the next several years is you are going to see internet real ID's, internet taxes, internet censorship, copyright everywhere, corporate control of the internet(MPAA, RIAA, etc...) would control the flow of information and products and internet kill switch.","depth":3,"score":-12,"ups":-12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bing_bot","name":"t1_coymydc","parent_id":"t1_coy5902","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425012005,"created_utc":1425012005}

FCC publishes the ruling, a ISP takes them to court, the court decides if the FCC is correct in their interpretation.

FCC publishes the ruling, there are fatal flaws, and new oppositions starts. This is less likely. The ruling may not be perfect, but it will probably be damn good and Wheeler moved in the right direction over the course of the public input period.		3.

{"body":"The US government will not use net neutrality to censor the Internet.		The US government will not use the patriot act to spy on the Internet on every citizen.		The US government will not use the patriot act to spy on phone calls of everyone.		The US government will not use the IRS to go after their political enemies. 		The US government will not use the threat of terrorism to take away our rights.		The US government will not ban guns and limit their use by fiat every time there is a tragedy. 		The US government will not abuse its power to benefit few select companies over their competition. 		Where have I heard that before? You are right, the US government has no history of abusing its power ALL the time. No we can trust them, the US government is run by angels. 		Essentially its government control of the internet. What has happened is that the big ISP have lobbies state and local governments in the past decade to put in so much regulations and red tape so that small ISP can't properly operate and new ones can't start up. 		Giant obvious example of this is Google, who are no small company, one of the biggest in the world and they can't setup internet properly due to government regulations. If they can't do it, how are small ISP's supposed to open or operate?		So not satisfied with the amount of control they have, the big ISP decided to work with the federal government to get even more monopoly on the internet and allow the federal government to control the internet and surveill people all in one. So they started giving certain websites faster speeds for monetary compensation, normally this wouldn't work, but because they've already lobbied governments in the past decade or so, they've limited competition so much that they have no fears of competition.		This allowed the federal government to use this to once and for all gain control of the internet. They tried with CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, etc... but when it was to "protect the internet from terrorists" or "keep our banks and financial system safe", people saw through the lies, they understood that government is bad news for the internet, so they changed the wrap around government internet control to "net neutrality". What is more hated than government? Big Corporations! So you change the wrap from keeping banks safe and keeping the internet safe from terrorists, to "sticking it to the evil big corporations who want to destroy the internet". even though those those same corporations that actually provide the internet, so destroying it wouldn't be in their best interest at all. 		So now, with the wrap changed, they have converted all those who rallied against CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, etc... government control of the internet to have them support government control of the internet. 		They've used the same tactics they used to pass the "patriot act" and other terrible laws, they give it a good wrap, even though the contents inside are poison. 		So that is what's happened, the federal government has gained control of the internet without laws, without congress, without debate, all through undemocratic, unconstitutional, bureaucratic decision to reclassify it to utility under the 1996 telecommunications act. 		What is going to happen in the next several years is you are going to see internet real ID's, internet taxes, internet censorship, copyright everywhere, corporate control of the internet(MPAA, RIAA, etc...) would control the flow of information and products and internet kill switch.","depth":6,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bing_bot","name":"t1_coymwaq","parent_id":"t1_coydayo","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425011882,"created_utc":1425011882}

[Source](http://recode.net/2014/02/11/netflix-says-verizon-isnt-slowing-down-its-streams/)		Here's the simple fact, Netflix put a metric shit ton of eggs in the Cogent basket. Cogent has had peering disputes with: AOL, Teleglobe, Fance Telcom, Level 3, TeliaSonera, Sprint-Nextel and Verizon. Cogent always seems to be the one major transit provider that continues to have disputes with so many network providers year over year over year.  Maybe it is because they oversell the shit out of their service, while other CDN providers don't (or not at the scale Cogent does.)		~4 years ago, when Netflix was using Level 3, Akamai, and Limelight for 100% of their video delivery, there were no quality issues. Look at their speed ratings form 2012. The reason? Thos CDNs already have servers connected at ISPs like Comcast and have put in all the necessary links, both free and paid, to guarantee, via SLA, that they could deliver Netflix's video. 		Netflix got tired of paying them, and decided to roll its own CDN, and chose Cogent as a delivery partner and decided to lean on them. ISPs have peering policies (you can read [Comcast's here](http://www.comcast.com/peering)), which determines the rules on how networks connect with one another and exchange traffic. ISPs like Comcast will allow transit providers like Cogent to connect to their network, for free, in what is called "Settlement-Free Peering." However, once a transit provider sends more traffic to the ISP then the agreement allows, they have to pay for additional capacity to get additional traffic into the network. 		Netflix is paying Cogent, and Cogent is selling Netflix on the principal that they can get all of Netflix's traffic into ISPs like Comcast. Because of that, Cogent needs to take all the necessary business steps to make sure it has the capacity to pass that traffic into all the ISPs - but Cogent wasn't, and has a long history of not doing that.		Cogent was taking Netflix's money and not providing the service, they were charging Netflix for a service they could not deliver. Netflix doesn't need to go directly to Comcast - not many other major video providers do (MLB Networks, broadcast networks, Hulu etc. - they all use other third party CDNs because they are cheap and offer a guarantee - it works quite well.)		In fact, at the height of the controversy last Feb., people using Apple TV to stream Netflix were not having quality problems - even on Comcast - why? Because Netflix had chosen to use Level 3 and Limelight networks to stream content specifically for Apple TV devices.		Netflix, instead of calling Cogent on their shit and then going back to a better 3rd party CDN, decided to deal with Comcast directly. Netflix servers sit in a third party data centers were connected directly into the Comcast network in the same building via a cross connect that Netflix buys from the Co-Lo provider.  Comcast has a total of ~18 national locations and Netflix and Comcast initially decided to connect about 10 of those. They needed around 300 10GigE ports. Comcast gave Netflix a guaranteed level of service, but as both Comcast and Netflix stated when the deal happened, Netflix got no prioritization in the last mile (that would be "paid prioritization, which Comcast cannot do and does not offer.)		Some reported that the deal would cost Netflix $400M for that interconnect - but that is fucking laughable because why would they pay that much when they could get the same level of service going back to Level 3 and Akamai? Some reported $25-50M a year - which also doesn't make sense.		In 2012, Comcast said they were carrying 4 Tbps of traffic and at current growth rates, when the deal was made last Feb. it would have been around 8 Tbps, based on Sandvine's data, Netflix accounts for roughly 1/3 of that traffic - so they would need around 3 Tbps of capacity from Comcast when the deal was reached. 		The $400M number was from a study by Wedbush Securities that ran their numbers based on per GB delivered model, not per Mbps sustained, saying "Comcast likely sought as much as 0.01/GB transmitted"		They then estimated that each of Netflix's 33M US subscribers consume 100GB of data per month and came up with a total of 3.3B GB of data delivery per month, saying "Netflix would be required to pay approximately $400M per year." While their numbers are not only wrong because they aren't using a per Mbps sustained model, the number they gave out was based on all of Netflix's delivery, across all ISPs. 		That didn't stop outlets like MSNBC, CNN, Fox, CBS, and others from running with it. Getting the uninformed up in arms. In the end, and this got much less press, Wedbush Securities ended up saying they were wrong, and Netflix would have to pay between $25-50M annually - which is still very bloated.		Comcast stated when the deal was announced that 0.1% of their total revenue came from these interconnect agreements across the board. That means for all of 2013, Comcast got paid between $30-60M for those, that includes their deals with Comcast, AOL, Level 3, Cogent, Akami, etc. etc. etc. The idea that Netflix would have chosen to pay more than all of those players combined instead of expanding their use of Level 3 and Akami is laughable, they aren't idiots over there.		The lowest transit pricing at the time, was around $.50 per Mbps - if Netflix needed 3 Tbps of capacity, that would have cost around $1.5M per month - but that is ignoring the fact that they obviously were getting a better rate, or they would have taken that deal instead of paying the wholesale rate Comcast obviously gave them. Also, that gave Netflix an install SLA, a packet loss SLA, and a latency SLA from Comcast - which guaranteed quality - far different than they were getting with the oversold shit transit Cogent was providing because they have a multi-year history (basically throughout their entire existence) of being caught overselling their available capacity and trying to blame ISPs.		Also, let???s play out what might have happened if Comcast gave Cogent all the capacity it wanted for free. Does that mean Netflix would work well into perpetuity and everyone would be happy? No. Netflix switches providers quite frequently. What if Netflix then moved traffic to NTT and Telia, we???d be back where we started, as those providers would then need all the capacity they wanted on Comcast. What if Netflix started making other traffic shifts to extract greater concessions from ISPs and transit vendors? 		Of course Netflix would prefer to not have to pay these fees at all (who wouldn't) so they went on PR press to confuse the issue and they obviously have won a major victory at the price of future Internet Freedoms.  I know that odds are the vast majority will have caught the tone that I'm not happy with today's proceedings and refuse to read or digest this wall of text, but people that don't work as content providers or ISPs (I'm a content provider - I spend around $1,200 a month paying for delivery of my content to a fraction of customers that Netflix has, I'm supposed to be happy about this, I'm supposed to be singing "Ding Dong the Wicked Witch is Dead" and dancing in the street - I'm not) shouldn't hold opinions on that they don't really research.

On the other hand, 6 European countries (out of the 20 listed) have equal or higher percentage of people above 15 Mbps. 15 of them have equal or higher percentage of people above 4 Mbps. It's also worth remembering that some countries (UK and Ireland spring to mind) have less ideal conditions for high speed internet (they're islands).		That said, Akamai's report only contains data from *their own network*. Even though their network is huge, it does not cover all traffic.

Finland, Sweden, and Norway are the [only countries with lower population density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density). That said, I would argue that it's actually more expensive to deploy high-speed internet in a country with low density, since you need to reach further out from cities.

This is on the heels of a decade struggle after the dot-com bubble burst, which bankrupted many companies. I was in the middle of that. It wasn't a happy time.

On the one hand you talk about how the government is regulating business to death, preventing real competition. Then, at the same time you offer an example of an industry thriving in one of the most heavily regulated states in the United States as an example of what can happen with little regulation. It doesn't even pass the laugh test. Do you think California is the largest economy in the country by accident? It just happened here by accident in spite of all the regulation? Give me a break.		We have real world examples all over this country and all over the planet. Countries and states with effective regulations have stronger and larger economies than countries and states that don't.		The US, Europe, Japan, and the Soviet Union all became major world economic powers after WWII when government was heavily involved in regulating industry. Look at the rise of China as an economic power under extreme regulation. Look at the US states with the largest and most robust economies. They're in places like California, New York, and Washington, all states with more regulation than the poorer states. 		Speaking of examples, can you offer an example of any nation with the free market operating as you describe?		> _It improves profit, certainly NOT efficiency._		A monopoly is the pinnacle of efficiency - you can make money with very little investment in development or innovation.

{"body":"> This article says they didn't announce their fiber plan in Austin until December of 2013, when Google had already announced their plans In April of the same year.		So, Google didn't DO anything. Google isn't digging up the roads in Austin. At least not yet (see below). 		The way the *new* FTTH (Fiber to the Home) deployments work is that buried fiber goes to the local node ("neighborhood", though that word really doesn't map properly to the concept of "node") and from there fiber aerials (fiber on poles) runs to the homes. 		AT&T buried all the fiber to the node, Google Fiber and Grande are just provisioning from the node. Most of the cost of deployment is wrapped up in digging up the roads.		> This article also says that the fight was over telephone poles as well, though they were owned by at&t.		I think AT&T is somewhat justifiably pissed off that Google is piggybacking on all the infrastructure they built. However, as long as Google's willing to pay I think the city council's decision was the right one. The big issue was the buried fiber (this also affects the stuff Verizon buried for FiOS). 		The reason this is "bad" is subtle, it discourages AT&T from installing more buried fiber (and thereby increasing the areas where FTTH is available) because they won't have exclusive access. The city council could have delayed "open access" until AT&T completed the fiber rollout, but it's really likely that AT&T would have just "slow walked" the rollout to delay that as long as possible. 		Google realizes this and also is supposedly going to start burying fiber too.

Now what this does do, is allow for that pole access, which could open the door to fiber to the door. Where in that scenario, you could have a cable drop, and a fiber drop to the house.

{"body":">it will allow for competition.		And I said it depends on what you deem competition to be. If you think it will open op "cable" competition, then it wont. Or will not likely do so, as it does not allow for the last mile unbundling. If you deem competition to be between say cable, and fiber, then yeah that would be accurate. 		The key thing to understand about that last mile is that even if say cable ISP, had to lease it's lines on the pole to a different cable ISP, it doesn't mean that the drop from the pole, to the house will be forced to as well. So if say a new cable ISP came into an area, and wanted to "compete", without unbundling they would have to run their own drops. So say you now have 2 cable ISP's both competing equally. In order to do that, say the first ISP pisses you off, and you decide to go with the second. The second ISP will have to run their own cable from the pole to your house. So you will have 2 separate lines coming from the same source. As such it's woefully inefficient, and it provides a barrier to entry to new competition. While it "could happen", it makes it likely that it wont, on that front. Since fiber is something different, they could run it from the pole to your house and now you have a cable drop, and a fiber drop coming from likely somewhat different sources, well depending on where the nodes are and whatnot.		The source you gave, does not disprove anything I said. If you think it does, please point it out. 		Look "pole access", means that another company can attach something to it, for a reasonable fee. It doesn't mean that you can have access to lines going to someone's home. It does mean that say a new fiber company can attach lines to the pole, and run them to someone's house, they just can't fuck with the old cable lines, as they do not own them. Why?

The internet of tubes is an analogy that many people don't like but it kind of works here, but instead of that lets view the internet as a road and data as cars. Currently, many ISPs have either been throttling or just not caring about their networks. In the case of throttling, they are controlling how many cars can be on the road; while the case of not caring, is basically gridlocked roads that crawl sometimes while running smooth other times.		With throttling gone, the roads will become gridlocked on ISPs. If the FCC decides to enforce the "utility" part like say how electricity is done, then ISPs may not be allowed to keep those roads gridlocked. This will force ISPs to have to expand their network to make things move faster.

{"body":">telecoms should probably have said "oh, all right" to net neutrality in the first place. 		Actually, quite a few were *looking forward* to it. Smaller ISPs being the those that benefit most from these changes. I always see ISP hate on reddit, but there are a lot of smaller ISPs that fight *damn hard* to not just give good service, but good customer service. The company I work for has a 20 minute turn around time to *all* customers. Phone down? Give is about 20 minutes. Internet dead? 20 minutes. We will be on site and can trouble shoot whatever, from router issues to inside wiring. If it is an AT&T issue, they usually have a 24 hour turn around time to the copper we rent, so our customers are still limited by that factor. However, since we rent a metric shitload of copper, we have direct access to ticketing AT&T when we have problems. Compare that to NTS, who I have very literally seen leave a business dead in the water with no phone (IE, no CC machine) for over a week. I ended up running CAT5 from the pole to the demarc for a friend because they just *didn't fucking feel like it*. It's a duct tape fix, but at least it works.		Hopefully with USF funds being made available to smaller ISPs, maybe we will start to see fiber building out and completely negating the existing copper network.		End result? Smaller ISPs will get better compliance from cablecos and telecos in regards to utilizing existing networks. Less bitching, moaning and dragging feet in regards to building out new networks. And the ability for smaller companies to go after smaller markets that other companies would just ignore. 		The lack of rate regulation is because they expect the market to balance the price, to my understanding. With more people in the game delivering service (hopefully better service), price wars ought to rage.		So, for us, it just means that ILECs have to play ball, or possibly lose their network to break ups.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dildologist","name":"t1_coya034","parent_id":"t1_coy1me2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424988475,"created_utc":1424988475}

Have you ever thought that streaming video quality was insufficient or just plain old *bad?* With more easily affordable high-speed connections, streaming services will not have to limit the bitrate on their media. Media is already headed in this direction, and internet speeds/hark disk space are the only real barriers to matching the quality of physically owned media. Whether or not you like streaming is another issue altogether, but I speak as a person who works for a large streaming company, that we constantly tweak and debate just how high we can reasonably push the bitrates in order to deliver a quality product under reasonable constraints imposed by ISPs. Trust me, the company I work for has *money*, but they know that they simply cannot deliver higher bitrates as things are.

{"body":"To clarify a bit, an ISP would be unlikely to *block* Netflix traffic or similar. It would however be likely to degrade the quality of that traffic or rate-limit it, with the intent being to push users to their own video on demand service.		This is where the disconnect sits for the "free market good, regulation bad" crowd. If an ISP flat-out blocked a service that their customers wanted, those customers would vote with their wallets (or at least, those with multiple broadband providers in their area). However if an ISP were to throttle Netflix traffic for odd-numbered IP addresses from 8pm to 11pm on a Friday, it would be difficult for a non-tech (and many techs for that matter) to determine if it was the ISP or the Netflix that was at fault. The reason an ISP would do that is so they can get more revenue for their VOD service by stacking the deck against their competitors, without suffering the backlash they'd get if they just blocked them.		This isn't booga-booga paranoia or a what-if scenario; ISP's have been caught red-handed doing exactly this. And when Netflix put up a web page where they showed which ISP's have good connection stats to them and which ones don't, Verizon sued them. That's why regulation is necessary, because the industry refuses to police itself and because normal free market rules don't apply.

If that little guy starts to cut into the customer base of the company hosting the network, then they simply don't renew the rental agreement the next time it's due and the new "competitor" is gone.  Or they raise the rates and squeeze them out.  Ultimately, whoever owns the very expensive and hard to place infrastructure has monopolistic control of its turf and any company that would like to pay to use it.  This is where government regulation, like that under Title II, steps in and prevents the owners of infrastructure for services that other businesses are helplessly dependent on from bullying their renters and having the unopposed power to simply decide which start ups will fail and which will be allowed to succeed at tolerable levels.  It's literally the worst case scenario for the big guy, but a huge win for consumers and gives start ups at least the hope of viability.

{"body":">There's a huge difference between wireless number portability and the FCC running the internet.		The reason I use WLNP as a comparison is because it's a clear-cut case of a problem that stifled competition ("I'd leave my provider but I don't want to lose my number") where the oligarchy of providers had neither desire nor incentive to solve the problem on their own. And this happened before widespread adoption of the Internet and email, when cell phones were quickly becoming a dominant communication method. As an academic exercise I invite you to take any anti-NN argument and replace "the Internet" with "cell phones" and see if you couldn't imagine Ted Cruz or Rand Paul  bouncing such statements around the echo chamber.		>ISPs have been caught downgrading traffic? What has been the follow up to this?		Quite honestly the follow up is that they've gotten better at doing it without getting caught. The first verifiable case I know of was a cable ISP in 2007. Granted it was with bittorrent traffic which isn't always going to be "lawful traffic", but then again it isn't always going to be unlawful either and the ISP wasn't discriminating. Another has announced that they'd block Facetime over their mobile data network for subscribers who hadn't upgraded to a new and more expensive data plan, even though you'd have to rack up over a dozen hours of Facetime traffic to max out their pre-upgrade data plans.		So how do I know they've gotten better at doing it without getting caught? Because there are cases of traffic to a service being slow on a given ISP, until the user in question connects to a VPN and connects to the same service over an encrypted tunnel. And you could say that VPN's are a case of the market correcting themselves, but a) not everyone who uses the Internet knows how to use a VPN, and b) they shouldn't have to.		>You said yourself that they fear blowback. Sounds like the market correcting itself.		Here's where it helps to understand how networks and network equipment work. The reason there has been blowback is because the ISP's weren't smart about it at first. It's easier to apply the same filtering policy all the time, and it's easier to block traffic rather than throttle it. But a network engineer who knows what (s)he is doing can, on modern routers and switches, configure a filtering policy that reduces bandwidth to a given web service for odd-numbered IP addresses on Fridays, Sundays, and Thursdays from 7pm to 10pm. Even numbered IP's could get rate limited on the remaining days of the week. The experience you'd have is that sometimes the service in question just wouldn't work well, and it would leave most people thinking that (for example) Netflix doesn't work sometimes while (for example) Verizon On Demand works great all the time. It'd be like Ford buying up a stretch of Interstate and making Toyota cars run slow when driving on it.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HalLogan","name":"t1_cp4q4wo","parent_id":"t1_cp437sr","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425520447,"created_utc":1425520447}

Not saying that would or wouldn't, just saying that I don't see any reason why they can't have plenty of incentive to want to have control when they want.		Why can't it be, effectively, as simple as: no one gets to control what goes on there or what happens with different content.

You do need it; that's the entire point.  The fact that you don't think you need insurance simply reveals ignorance on your part.

Prior to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the employer's paid for healthcare as a benefit to their employees. It was not an institutionalized system before that.		As for employers putting profits ahead of employee welfare, that argument could be stretched as far as one wants, but it is only applicable when employers put employees in danger for the sake of profit (OSHA stuff).

{"body":"> Again, if the system is set up to allow a vast majority of employers to do this practice, and if employees expect it, then I would argue it is institutionalized		I was using the term "institutionalized" in its more formal sense of being dictated by an official institution.		Healthcare paid by employers came about as something that employers did during WW2 in order to attract employees during the government mandated wage controls. At this time and for many years after, it was a relatively small expense. Healthcare has generally been looked at as a benefit to attract employees ever since. There is a difference between a benefit and a right or something you should expect at any job.		While the pay rate at Walmart can be related, you are over-broadening the discussion. If you try to include every worker issue under one umbrella, the problem is too large to address. If you want to fix minimum wage and FT/PT status, great, but it is a different discussion.		The reason I mentioned the history of employer funded healthcare was to show how we got to the convoluted system we have now. It is kind of like a city road system based on old walking paths versus a planned street system. The needs have outgrown what the old system can supply. Employers cannot control healthcare prices and many cannot make any profit and still pay for healthcare. Remember that most employers are not Walmart, Exxon, or Google. Most are barely making it. This will only be more exaggerated as healthcare costs continue to skyrocket at many times the rate of inflation due to an aging population and improved, but expensive new treatments.		Asking employers to fund all healthcare is, to me, backwards and a lazy solution. It is doing something because that is how it was done rather than looking at how it should be done. It adds too many middlemen into the mix and raises the already bloated costs, does nothing to control costs, and makes doing business in this country more difficult. It would make much more sense (to me) to shift that burden to the government as other countries have successfully done. Unfortunately there is a lot of money being spent to convince people that socialized medicine will result in them being unplugged to save money or something. However, I think that for some, the real concern is that they may have to sit next to a poor person in a waiting room for a few minutes.

For example, even if I wanted to take you at your word, your comment, strictly speaking, doesn't make sense.  Whether or not you receive assistance for paying your premiums has nothing to do with living in a red or blue state, since the distribution of the subsidies are handled by the federal government through the IRS.  It is true, however, that many red states have rejected the expansion of Medicaid, a program offering free health coverage to low-income people, but that's a separate issue that would only affect you if you fall into the gap between where old-style Medicaid eligibility ends and private healthcare premium subsidies begin.  Perhaps that's what you meant, but I don't know.  If it is, then all I can say is I'm sorry about your terrible state government.		With all of that said, if you really are too poor to qualify for any subsidy then you should know that you are also exempt from the penalty for being uninsured.  I don't know how much you actually use your insurance, but if 63/month coverage was good enough for you then I suspect the answer is "rarely" and you might be better off just paying out of pocket until your state government gets its act together.

No.  It's a natural consequence of the stated purpose of the law: to provide *affordable* healthcare coverage for all.  Older people are statistically much more expensive to insure.  In the past, health insurance companies mitigated this cost by either charging older people exorbitant rates or simply refusing to insure people with "pre-existing conditions" (therefore keeping only the healthiest of the aging population on their roles).		In order to expand coverage, refusing coverage for "pre-existing conditions" was banned, but this alone might threaten to tank the insurance industry.  More healthy (primarily young) people needed to buy into the system in order to make up the difference, so insurance was made mandatory.  Further, in order to prevent insurance companies from implementing de facto bans on older people through unreasonably high rates, the ratio limit was introduced in order to force insurance companies to keep rates within a reasonable range for everyone (lest they push those coveted young people off their roles).		What you're missing is that the ACA is not just another regulatory bill.  It's a comprehensive reform.		> Why should a 21 year old pay the rates of a 35 year old?		See above.

I'm amazed at some of the things that have been developed on the lossy side of compression such as VOIP codecs like [G.729](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.729). It is designed specifically for transmitting the human voice and cuts off ranges above and below a normal human voice could produce to save bandwidth. Also other techniques such as detecting and suppressing the transmission of silence over the line.

Almost certainly they're going to win on the interconnect issue (that's the peering disputes with Netflix that caused these rules to be created).

The FCC is arguing that because commercial ISPs provision consumer broadband ISPs they "count" as consumer ISPs. That will be for the courts to decide, and likely they will rule with the ISPs (the law is pretty clear). 		Another thing that is likely to come up forbearance (that is, excluding ISPs from a bunch of Title II rules). The ISPs will likely argue that the FCC has overreached and will ask the courts to explicitly ban these provisions (since the FCC could apply them at any time). This is effectively asking the courts to craft brand new law and will likely fail. 		Most of the other rules hinge on the enforcement mechanisms. It's likely that if the rules require the ISPs to install equipment/software to monitor connections and transmit reports to the FCC directly that will be struck down as that is a huge burden. If it's based solely on complaints (a site complains to the FCC that they are being throttled and the FCC investigates), they may not be.

You could be killed for checking out a neighbor's wife and no police or law enforcement of any kind would try to prevent it because it didn't exist. It was every man for himself with no accountability. Even remote tribal villages have a system of governing that makes progress possible. The government we have, while far from perfect, allows us to have common utilities like drinking water, electricity, healthcare, and national defense. Some form of government is NECESSARY for the progress of humanity and the safety of the individual. Of course no system is perfect and some laws are too restrictive but in this case, all that has happened is that we took the regulatory power out of the hands of those who financially benefit from screwing us (and had active plans to screw us) and put it in the hands of a government department not directly tied to internet profits at all. They haven't screwed up telephone lines, they haven't screwed up other utilities, why is it that you are certain they are going to takeover and screw up the internet? It is fine to think that they might, of course, but there is no evidence to support that theory at all. Honestly, there is no legal framework available for the FCC to censor the internet or filter its content. However, the FBI and the NSA can block anything they so choose, with or without this ruling, that has been the case and will remain as such until we disband the NSA and pass legislature to prevent such activity.","depth":2,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"twistedgrit","name":"t1_coy6hhg","parent_id":"t1_coy3ep1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424983132,"created_utc":1424983132}

T-Mobile's Music Freedom is probably still legal under reclassification since they aren't receiving consideration from the exempted services. Wikipedia Zero is the other prominent example of prioritized data. I'm willing to say that both cases are actually strong arguments for why data prioritization being permitted is a good thing; companies are finding that there is value they can offer their customers by permitting conditional metering bypass is disproportionate favorable compared to the loss they incur as a result. Both services are very good for consumers. You're right, of course, that it offers a competitive advantage to the existing players, but it definitely doesn't prevent entry into the market, and since there is no consideration given to T-Mobile for the metering bypass, it's not like you would be financially precluded from being a viable option for that service if your app proved to be popular enough that enough of T-Mobile's customers asked for it to be included.		On the other hand, I can't think of a single case of paid prioritization actually having been a problem in recent history.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cheald","name":"t1_coyoslg","parent_id":"t1_coyfh5o","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425016258,"created_utc":1425016258}

{"body":"Yup! This is one of the biggest misunderstandings in the whole thing. Netflix wasn't being throttled! That sounds like crazysauce, but let me explain. (For the record, I have no connection with any ISP, I have no intent to defend Comcast being horrible, but it drives me crazy that this is so misunderstood.)		tl;dr:		Netflix wasn't being throttled, the connection they used to serve data to Comcast customers was full. *All* data served over that connection suffered congestion issues, not just Netflix. Using a VPN would alleviate the issue because it changed the request routing and effectively proxied around the congested interlink (causing packets to be routed over a longer, less efficient route across the internet, but one which happened to avoid the congested interlink), not because it hid the origin from Comcast's throttle. The new rules do exactly nothing to fix the things that were a problem in that case.		Long version:		Netflix was serving their data to Comcast customers by purchasing "transit" from a company called Cogent. Cogent and Comcast are "peers", meaning they have hooked their networks together. In this case, they operate on what's called a "settlement-free peering agreement", which is where they say "we aren't going to charge each other to move data for each other, as long as the inbound and outbounds are roughly symmetrical". These agreements also include symmetric interconnect buildout requirements.		Now, consumer broadband is a very consumption-heavy service, and over the last few decades, so the big transit providers have been at war with the last mile providers, with the last-mile providers saying  that the transit providers are in violation of their SFI agreements because the data interconnect is asymmetric, so they want a "paid peering" arrangement instead, where the party that places the larger load on the peering arrangement pays for the difference. The transit folks have been saying "we have these SFI agreements in place and you should really consider the number of miles we carry your data instead of just bytes exchanged", and have refused to negotiate paid peering agreements. The parties are at odds for who is responsible for the cost of building out more interconnect, so Comcast has refused to add more capacity until Cogent paid them for the cost of it, and Cogent has refused to pay for it citing their SFI. Peering disagreements are not a new thing; it's been happening for decades. Check out the "notable examples" in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering#Depeering		In the meantime, along comes Netflix, and they buy transit from Cogent. They start serving their bytes, then they start serving so much traffic that these interlinks between Cogent and Comcast fill up. The pipes are full; only some traffic can get through, the rest ends up getting dropped. Some portion of this is Netflix traffic, but any other traffic served to Comcast customers over Cogent's interconnect suffered as well. Things were bad.		As Cogent and Comcast failed to negotiate how they would build out more interlink, Cogent was in breach of their SLA with Netflix due to their failure to deliver the traffic Netflix had bought. Netflix jumped into the PR game, and attempted to ratchet up pressure on Comcast to get them to fold and pay for the buildout. When they failed to do so, they decided to just drop Cogent and engage a [paid peering agreement](http://www.comcast.com/dedicatedinternet) directly with Comcast. Paid peering isn't a new thing by any means, but Netflix ran a great PR game and managed to spin it as extortion, when really, their ISP (Cogent) just sucked and couldn't deliver what they'd promised, so Netflix dropped them and bought a different connection instead.		Now, Netflix directly peers with Comcast (and quite a few other folks - see http://bgp.he.net/AS2906#_peers), and so they don't have to send their Comcast-bound packets over an interconnect that is full, so they don't have to worry about an intermediate party's ability or inability to negotiate interlink capacity affecting their ability to reach the Comcast last-mile network. The same thing happened with Cogent and Level3 WRT Verizon.		The new Title II regulations give the FCC authority to administer rates on paid peering agreements, but they will almost certainly do *nothing* to resolve the issue at play here - the peering dispute between Comcast and Cogent. Even with Title II classification, Netflix's connection to Comcast would have continued to suck. Their traffic wasn't being deprioritized - it was being treated the same as all the other traffic on that interconnect link, and suffered the same degradation.		Netflix spun the PR and managed to convince people that they were being extorted, and won't someone please enact Net Neutrality to save them from it, but the reality of the situation is that the network *was already* behaving neutrally - all Cogent-Comcast traffic got the same equal, shitty, congested treatment. Netflix didn't pay for prioritization, they just switched who they buy their bandwidth from.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cheald","name":"t1_coz7civ","parent_id":"t1_coywlvt","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425064969,"created_utc":1425064969}

I had shit to do today so I didn't have the chance to dig until now but I found a bunch of articles written from the other side who think it's going to have a bad effect on the economy. 		The following articles discuss the economic consequences of an FCC-driven network neutrality policy.

Still, it's information I didn't have earlier today.		High-Speed Internet Rules Might Prove Costly	http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/technology/content/jun2010/tc20100616_751009.htm	This report describes a New York University School of Law study of the expected cost of an FCC net neutrality policy. The report concludes enforced net neutrality would cost the U.S. economy $62 billion and eliminate 502,000 jobs over the next five years.		Net Neutrality: Impact on the Consumer and Economic Growth	http://internetinnovation.org/files/special-reports/Impact_of_Net_Neutrality_on_Consumers_and_Economic_Growth.pdf	This report on network neutrality finds the policy could pass on an upcharge of as much as $55 per month to the consumer, in addition to current charges. The author finds a ???policy which seeks to manage competition by influencing the investment decisions of operators could have a significantly negative impact on consumers, job growth and the economy generally.???		Unintended Consequences of Net Neutrality Regulation	http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=942043	Robert E. Litan and Hal J. Singer find an FCC mandate on network neutrality ???would be detrimental to the objectives that all Americans seemingly should want???namely, the accelerated construction of next-generation networks, and benefits of lower prices, broader consumer choices, and innovations these networks would bring.???		Network Neutrality or Internet Innovation	http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv33n1/regv33n1-6.pdf	Christopher S. Yoo identifies the inherent price and quality tradeoff in regulations on network neutrality. He concludes, ???Social welfare would be maximized if the network provider could price discriminate on both sides of the two-sided market.??? Yoo suggests the FCC does not understand the economic complexity of the market and uses an ahistoric and simplistic model to view complex and ever-changing problems.		The Economics of Net Neutrality	https://server1.tepper.cmu.edu/ecommerce/economics%20of%20net%20neutrality.pdf	Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute finds, ??????Hands off the Internet??? was good policy when the Internet was brand new, and it???s good policy now.??? Noting several attempts at regulation that currently prohibit competition and stifle innovation, Hahn views additional regulation as directed toward a nonexistent problem. If competition should decline, current antitrust law would solve any problems, he observes.

{"body":"That's actually the main point, it would have completely destroyed the internet and anyone else's ability to create their own webpages and content that people might want over what major established corperations want.		But to increase competition they also struck down the ability for states to restrict the creation of municipal city level internet access.  Due to the way building network infrastructure works, laying all of that cable, the reason why you only have one choice in ISP service in most cases deal with the fact that they made a deal with the city to be the only guys who can lay that cable at all.  		Some cities, who have traditionally also put down their own telephone line (which is one way to get the internet via a technology called DSL, but fiber optic cables can also be involved which is another better way to get the internet), also provide a internet service which is one of the few ways you have a decent shot at non-ATT/Verizon/Comcast/Time-Warner internet access.  This competition with a solid, and often cheap due to it being funded partially by tax payers, product pushed ISP lobbyists to get some states to ban cities from doing this.  These new FCC rules say that they can't do that, and must allow cities the choice to build their own internet infrastructure if they so wish.		Which is great, because you can go down to your local city hall and support (or even start if you know people with the knowhow and have some of the capital to jump start the project) a city owned ISP and bring some real competition to the table.  Plus they now have the freedom to open up room for infrastructure to allow more private competition to come into the mix giving you more choices in ISPs.		Which means that this is probably one of the best things for free-market supporters, as ISPs were coming dangeriously close to what is known as a natural monopoly through what is called market failure in economics.  These are really really bad things, and we have such a batshit political situation that the party that's seen and pushes itself out there as the free market party now finds itself opposed to legistlation that has been seen as vital to keeping it alive (and was first put into real big action by Teddy Roosavelt, a Republican who busted Rail and Steel trusts poised in a similar fashion that ISPs are today).","depth":5,"score":90,"ups":90,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ztfreeman","name":"t1_coy3u62","parent_id":"t1_coy2hjd","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424979125,"created_utc":1424979125}

{"body":"It's pretty much the biggest part. ISPs won't be allowed to structure a tiered Internet. Giving in to Comcast and Verizon would mean that only the most powerful corporate entities would control the content you can access online, at a price they get to arbitrarily set because in this alternate version of the Internet, there's no competition. Only big name players can participate, and smaller firms, sites, and services would be starved out to make way for content creators and hosts with deeper pockets. 		Furthermore, the reclassification of the Internet under Title II means cable companies are now considered common carriers, further limiting their legal ability to block out competition unfairly. Existing infrastructure for data transfer can't be monopolized by the most powerful providers - the companies that built most of these networks are irked because now they can't charge ungodly rates for other entities to rideshare on that infrastructure.		Companies like Verizon and Comcast, obviously opposed to net neutrality because $$$, argued that imposing rules on how they can control the Internet will stifle innovation and the loss of additional revenue that would hypothetically have been brought in by a tiered data system would have gone to expanding broadband networks. Basically, a handful of billionaires at some of the largest corporations in the world are going to say "well, now we don't have enough money to give more citizens access to quality Internet." 		Big boys like Comcast and Verizon can't decide how consumers will get their Internet. It was alarmingly easy for them to push expensive and limited packages on users because those users had no alternative. The Internet isn't a commodity in the first world anymore, it's essential for exchange of information and ideas as well as 21st century commerce. The monolith ISPs were getting away with these unfavorable designs for their vision of the Internet because people had no choice but to bend over and take it, and then the ISPs could point to how well their packages were selling and say "see? The market is fine with this." Now, they have to play nice, and while data caps and throttling and idiotic content packages probably won't go away any time soon, the precedent has been set that this push over the last decade or two by ISPs to fully control the Internet won't work. That is, of course, barring an inevitable fusillade of lawsuits from Verizon and Comcast and other entities.","depth":5,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mr_Kinton","name":"t1_coy3mot","parent_id":"t1_coy2hjd","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424978809,"created_utc":1424978809}

{"body":"I have mixed views on net neutrality, so I'll try to describe some of the potential negatives. Please don't downvote me just because you disagree. I'm trying to further a constructive conversation.		I don't like the idea that oligopolists can essentially hold their customers hostage and extort ransoms from content providers trying to reach those customers -- all because the customers have nowhere else to go. I'm a free-market libertarian; but for the market to function properly, consumers have to have choices.  Without choice, there is no competition.  Without competition, there is little incentive for companies to provide the best service at the lowest cost.		Under normal circumstances (i.e. a functioning market), if a company started arbitrarily ruining a customer's experience to extract payments from some other company, customers would flee en masse.  Yet, according to the FCC, 30% of Americans have only *one* option for not-even-that-fast 10 Mbps broadband, while another 50% have only two options. At higher speeds, the choices are even fewer (see [chart](http://regmedia.co.uk/2014/09/04/us_broadband_speed.jpg)). That is the definition of oligopoly.		Given the lack of competition, people are looking to the FCC to do what competition should have done: prevent bad behavior. I completely understand that. But it doesn't address the root cause of the problem, which is lack of competition. Further, we have to consider that reclassification of ISPs -- basically treating them like public utilities -- may have some unintended consequences.		In Europe, ISPs are regulated in a manner similar to how phone companies are regulated in the United States (under Title II of the Telecommunications Act).  This model of regulation emphasizes "service-based competition", where a company that builds out a communications network is required to share its infrastructure with competitors so that consumers have more options on that network.  In the United States, there is an emphasis on "facilities-based competition", where a company that builds out a network isn't required to share it.		Which works best?  Well, a University of Pennsylvania study that came out last summer found the following ([press release](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/4786-new-university-of-pennsylvania-analysis-finds-us); [abstract](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2510854)):		* "The U.S. broadband industry has invested more than two times more capital per household than the European broadband industry every year from 2007 to 2012.  In 2012, for example, the US industry invested $562 per household, while EU providers invested only $244 per household."	* As a result, a "far greater percentage of US households had access to Next Generation Access (NGA) networks ([defined as connections with speeds greater than] 25 Mbps) than in Europe. This was true whether one considered coverage for the entire nation (82% vs. 54%) or for rural areas (48% vs. 12%)."		It is clear that allowing companies to maintain full control over the networks they own does encourage greater investment.  Europe might have more choices on existing infrastructure, but there's far less investment in new infrastructure.		So, what's the solution? In my mind, it's more competition. One of the biggest reasons we have so little competition is that cities and states granted monopolies to big ISPs in exchange for building out networks in their backyards.

Google, for instance, can do it with Google Fiber because they're Google and they practically print money. They lay new wire, maintain that wire, etc. Very few ISP start ups are going to have the capital to build all that infrastructure from scratch before they even have a consumer base.		Having more choices means enabling more businesses to get into the game. Wouldn't that mean we actually would be better served by a system more like Europe's, just so ISP's could get off the ground?

{"body":"One of the big problems with that idea though is that it's costly to provide some services, so much so that in some industries only a few major providers will ever exist due to the amount of capital required to start up.  The most likely competition we would see as far as internet is concerned would be new providers which are built around using the major providers' backbones.  In effect, while yes there would technically be more providers, the new providers would be limited to the speeds provided by the old providers.		Now the old providers have been stuck providing the exact same speeds for quite some time now.  Yes, the internet is a lot faster than it may have been 20 years ago.  At the same time, running a network on fiber isn't exactly new.  Speeds could have continued to increase, particularly as networks are upgraded - unfortunately the larger ISPs feel no need to upgrade their networks, partially due to lack of competition.  Why upgrade a network when people are paying $75 per month for speeds much lower than could be provided?  Maintaining that cap will realistically allow these ISPs to provide a "brand new technological breakthrough" that allows them to create another $100 tier which allows for another 10mbps.  The *most likely* competition would not solve this issue since they are still relying on the original backbone.  Therefore, in reality though you might be receiving different branding, you will still be receiving the exact same service from a single provider - just like with many other utilities.		Despite the claims by these companies that their innovation will be hampered, the majority of innovation done by ISPs up until recently has been finding new ways to charge more for their services.  10/100 hardware has come and gone.  Almost all new hardware is gigabit.  Out of every place I've lived (including large cities) the "best" speed I've seen offered is 50mbps, and is typically accompanied by atrocious service (particularly in the case of Comcast - and this is coming from one of their former technical support reps), and technical support that generally has no clue how their own system even works.		Net Neutrality addresses *some* of these issues, and lays the groundwork for other people to bring something more to the game.  Striking laws preventing competition in cities allows for a city to say enough is enough, and bring in any number of other providers to service them if the incumbent isn't doing enough.  Although we might not see as many carriers bringing their own lines, it does remove restrictions on others, such as Google, from coming to a city and providing fiber - which provides that much needed competition.  If you've got the choice between two vastly different speeds at even relatively similar prices people will go with the faster one.  That requires the other companies to either step up their game, or disappear in the long run.  When that happens, everyone wins except for the companies who would prefer to continue to create artificial tiers to charge ridiculous prices rather than to "innovate."","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chip_ninja","name":"t1_coydzvn","parent_id":"t1_coy3527","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424995227,"created_utc":1424995227}

I'm also hoping that more people will agree with you regarding this monopoly situation that is present.		I'm going to have to look more closely at that study. Given the fact that the broadband providers have invested that much capital, I'm curious to find out in what definition the study used for "broadband industry" investment. As ISPs like Comcast and Time Warner sell edge users access to the "last mile", they are able to build out their networks fairly localized and then utilize interconnection services to get them hooked up to the rest of the 'net. But do the interconnection services (which both alone and tied in with the ISP interface tend to determine no small part in the transfer speed of the service) count as part of the broadband industry? Or does the study focus solely on edge providers as the only measure of investment? (perhaps they should, as they single out internet pricing as a measure of comparison to European providers)		I think it is difficult to tell as the big ISPs don't usually disclose network improvements as part of their financial results.

This should help anyone with little to nil understanding of the situation, enjoy!	***	### History		ISP's (Comcast/TWC/Verizon/AT&T) wanted to make Netflix pay more money for their content as videos used up a lot of broadband. AKA a fast lane. Netflix refused, ISP's throttled the speed, Netflix caved and paid. 		This set a precedent of ISP's controlling internet traffic. If continued it would have prohibited small businesses/individuals from running Apps on the internet due to an inability to pay for a fast lane. Content distributor costs would rise, and ISP/content distributor mixes (ex=Comcast owns NBC) would have an unfair advantage. Net Neutrality refers to the opposition of this process, or to continue the operation of the net as it has always been.		In 2010 the FCC passed some laws supporting Net Neutrality. Verizon challenged and won in 2014: it was found the FCC did not have the authority as the FCC had classified broadband in a way that prevented them from being regulated like a "common carrier."		### Current Legislation		Now the FCC has given itself the authority it needs by reclassifying broadband as a public utility. This is great!! The internet as we know it was at risk.		But wait, there's more! Previously cities had been outlawed from creating competing fiber optic lines (like they do phone lines) to prevent unfair competition. Unfortunately, due to the high cost of laying cable and large profits (and thus lobbying groups) of the industry, instead of competition the US has gotten geographical monopolies. Thus cities may be able to compete. Also, ISP competitors like Google Fiber will no longer have laws blocking them at the state level, and will not have to fight to use public infrastructure.		You never know how it's going to turn out, but this looks like a very good thing!	***	### Arguments Against & Rebuttals		1. Government Competition is Bad -By being funded through taxes, municipalities could afford artificially low prices and push out private providers. Which is the reason it was outlawed in the first place. That's bad as it may remove jobs, hurt the economy, and lead to a lower quality of service. Municipal ISPs could also lead to higher taxes.		     0. Unfair Competition: I believe most cities do not have the infrastructure or desire to initiate and run their very own ISP utility. Instead, the biggest change will be allowing the current public infrastructure to be used by any private ISP, which will help competition. And in the cities that do want to do this, jobs would switch from 	the private to the public sector and the economy would remain unfettered. But, prices would decrease and there would be increased motivation for improved service (Monopolies owe allegiance to investors, a public utility is beholden to tax payers).	     1. Service: ISPs are currently geographical monopolies. Service (speed and customer relations) are already bad, and the cost is very high. In the very worst case it'd at least be cheaper, and by creating competition everything would improve.	     3. Higher taxes: ISPs are very profitable, and should not lead to higher taxes. I'm not sure how the situation is with other public utilities, so I can't say much about this.		2. Municipal ISP could lead to greater governmental spying		     1. This is kind of depressing, but the government already has all your information. The only rebuttal I can think of against increased spying is that the NSA already knows everything about you, they may not even use the *potential* assistance.	 	3. Partisanship - Obama and liberal media outlets have been attempting to get this passed for years now. And the idea of government competition is inherently un-Republican. So although this is a good thing, people will still hate it because it was supported by the Democrats.		***	Another friend brought up the point that AT&T was broken up using the same Title II of the Telecommunications law. So, in ending, I expect we will see similar results (competitors can leverage shared infrastructure, more competition, better service, lower prices)		***		### Sources		[Netflix throttling](http://www.extremetech.com/.../186576-verizon-caught...)

{"body":"Personally, I'm less concerned about content and information control as I am about simple privacy and holding on to as much of my meager wages as I can. Although you point out very valid concerns of other possible abuses or attempts to manipulate information and opinion, I believe this is mostly a first step toward taxation. I would predict the first major realization of the government's agenda (all parties) will be instituting a federal sales tax on all online transactions, whether it be buying a pair of shoes or subscribing to a gaming service, etc.		The Internet has been a massive honeypot of tax-free transactions for quite some time now and I believe the government (all parties since all parties would benefit) has been working towards the objective of getting a piece of that pie. It chose Net Neutrality because it's an easy sell that aligns with biases and corporate distrust that is already in place. It's been a "Save the Kittens" style campaign that few would oppose, while looking down the road to a time when enough regulatory control can be implemented to obtain it's real goal; money, and lots of it.		One could argue that that massive increase in government revenue will be a good thing and we should all give our fair share toward funding government programs. That we've just been fortunate to have had this time to make our purchases mostly tax-free. That is a debate worth having. But my objection lies in the manner which the government is sneaking in through the back door to get there because it knows "Give Us More of Your Money" isn't going to sell as easily as "Save the Kittens." That lack of honesty (and the fact that it won't let us view the rules before it votes to implement them) makes me very uneasy. I've seen a few too many instances where hidden agendas reveal themselves only after the pathways to counter them have been blocked.		Am I paranoid? I don't think so. I simply have more faith in the individual rather than the government to behave honestly and responsibly. I've enjoyed this "Wild West" free market of ideas for a long time and I've been proud that WE built it and WE control it. More accurately, no one controls it and it's become what it is through an evolution of competition and innovation.

{"body":"For people who are asking:	The regulations will help prevent unfair practices from stifling competition. It prohibits telecommunications companies from creating paid prioritization for companies that can afford it and pushing companies that can't into a 'slow lane' connection. This is beneficial to you as the consumer because it ensures that when you go to ANY (legal) website, your path to the site will not be blocked, rate limited, or impeded in any way. This also removes the restrictions enacted on a state level that has restricted competition. There are state laws that block municipal broadband because bigger telcos have the money to fill the coffers of local officials enough to vote in their favor. So the next Google Fiber site or local community can now vote for municipal broadband without worrying about a state law that prevents them from building their own.	I say this after having worked for some of the biggest ISP's in the world for over 12 years. We make money, LOTS of money. Interconnect fees are cheap in comparison to the profit generated per customer (residential or commercial). We have emails floating back and forth literally gloating how much profit we'd made. I've also been part of projects that throttle traffic, not because we didn't have the infrastructure or bandwidth to support the hub site, but because we wanted to squeeze more out of the customer.	As someone who has a lot of experience in the industry, this is a long time coming.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sxehoneybadger","name":"t1_coy6ke4","parent_id":"t3_2x97i8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424983250,"created_utc":1424983250}

{"body":"*can somebody please pick apart the following metaphor? I just came up with it after a few older colleagues made disparaging comments about the ruling and "increased regulation" being not good, and how I might educate them if they ask for an explanation in the future. So I'd like to get a good idea about how it stands up to peer review.*		Think of the Internet as a mall. There are lots of stores like Amazon and Etsy to buy things. You can go to a movie theater like Netflix.  There are arcades where you can play games with your friends. There is a bank there too. There are hobby shops and offices and lots of other destinations in this Internet mall.  It is a very big mall.		Say that whenever you arrive at the mall (log in), your ISP gives you a scooter and you travel between all the places in this mall on that scooter.  How fast your ISP sends data to and from your computer determines how fast you can get to Amazon and from there to Facebook, just like if you were traveling between stores and places in the mall.		Say you are using a Comcast scooter and you wanted to go watch a movie at the Netflix theater. But Comcast wants you to watch movies at its Xfinity OnDemand theater (which is owned by Comcast), and Netflix hasn't paid its fee to speed up its service. So your scooter slows down, or is so much faster if you decide to go to the Xfinity theater instead.  You are incentivized to go to the faster option, because its more of a hassle to wait for the slower travel to get to the Netflix theater.		Now suppose instead that a new store wants to open up in the mall. Its a small business that doesn't sell anything, they just show photos and videos of cute puppies.  Anybody can walk in for free, and the store makes money from advertisements placed around the store.  The more people who come in to look at the pictures, the more money the business recieves from the advertisers.  That sounds like a fun place to go in the Internet mall; it is free and they have new pictures every day (I'd make that my first stop every time I went to the AFK mall btw!).		But the small puppy picture business can't pay for a speed increase to the ISP. So instead of it taking 1 minute to get to this brand new store on your ISP scooter, it may take 10 minutes (magic number example, not indicative of real world situation). Does this sound like a such an easy option when you can get to the Google shop in 1 minute and find puppy pictures in their search kiosk? In this way, small businesses and start-ups are disadvantaged because they don't have the capital to spend on upgrades, whereas the bigger companies who are already established (Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc.) can afford to pay for faster speeds to their customers. This is also a detriment to competition: even if the puppy picture store has much better pictures and is easier to use than Google (for the purpose of viewing cute dogs), it is unable to compete on an even field if their access to customers (i.e. the speed of the ISP scooter) is not equal. So the better content has a higher hurdle to clear to rise to the top.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"strikerjacen","name":"t1_coyb30b","parent_id":"t3_2x97i8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424990240,"created_utc":1424990240}

Add in industry strategies like metered billing (heavy Internet users pay more than light users) and the government steps in to try to force "equality" onto the entities that run this quiltwork of ISPs, content providers, online commerce, etc. 		In theory all this is good BUT it requires enforcement power to see that it is done the way the government wishes it to be done.

A benign dictator is still a dictator. As long as it limits itself to just that small aspect of the Internet, all is good. But it's a leap of faith in that if it decides other aspects of the US-accessed Internet are not in the public interest (piracy, certain types of porn, tax-free purchasing, what it deems hate speech), there will be little anyone can do as it starts taking little bites out of freedoms we've all enjoyed since the beginning of the Internet.		The danger lies in the worst-case scenario when the dictator is no longer benevolent and it wants to allow you access to only opinions it approves, or stop piracy, or keep a record of your online interactions to make sure you're not planning a crime, etc., and it reaches in your pocket to pay for the enforcement bureaucracy needed to protect you from yourself.

{"body":"This is the argument against net neutrality.		It violates two individual rights, property rights and freedom of association.		The basic infrastructure of the Internet is owned and operated by privately owned companies.  They own things like routers, switches, and fiber optic lines.		These companies negotiate business agreements with each other to carry network traffic.		They are businesses, and they are using their own property to make money and provide a service.		Telling them how they have to use their property is a violation of their property rights.  The government shouldn't be doing that.  It's wrong.		Also, forcing these companies to enter into a certain type of relationship with other companies or individuals is a violation of the right to freedom of association.		Freedom of association means a company or individual is free to have or not have any type of relationship (within reason) with any other company or individual at the mutual choosing of the two parties.		The government forcing a company to carry network traffic for a different company (at all or in the manner the government chooses) is a violation of rights, the right to freedom of association.

{"body":"https://www.fcc.gov/document/summary-commissioner-pais-oral-dissent-internet-regulation		For twenty years, there???s been a bipartisan consensus in favor of a free and open Internet???one unfettered by government regulation. So why is the FCC turning its back on Internet freedom? It is flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone. President Obama told it to do so.			The Commission???s decision to adopt President Obama???s plan marks a monumental shift toward government control of the Internet. It gives the FCC the power to micromanage virtually every aspect of how the Internet works. It???s an overreach that will let a Washington bureaucracy, and not the American people, decide the future of the online world.			One facet of that control is rate regulation. For the first time, the FCC will regulate the rates that Internet service providers may charge and will set a price of zero for certain commercial agreements.		The Commission can also outlaw pro-consumer service plans.If you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan. The FCC shouldn???t take it away from you.			Consumers should expect their broadband bills to go up. The plan explicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband. One estimate puts the total at $11 billion a year.		Consumers??? broadband speeds will be slower. Compare the broadband market in the U.S. to that in Europe, where broadband is generally regulated as a public utility. Today, 82% of Americans have access to 25 Mbps broadband speeds. Only 54% of Europeans do. Moreover, in the U.S., average mobile speeds are 30% faster than they are in Western Europe.			This plan will reduce competition and drive smaller broadband providers out of business.		That???s why the plan is opposed by the country???s smallest private competitors and many municipal broadband providers. Monopoly rules from a monopoly era will move us toward a monopoly.			The Internet is not broken. We do not need President Obama???s plan to ???fix it.???			The plan in front of us today was not formulated at the FCC through a transparent notice-and-comment rulemaking process. As The Wall Street Journal reports, it was developed through ???an unusual, secretive effort inside the White House.??? Indeed, White House officials, according to the Journal, functioned as a ???parallel version of the FCC.??? Their work led to the President???s announcement in November of his plan for Internet regulation, a plan which ???blindsided??? the FCC and ???swept aside . . . months of work by [Chairman] Wheeler toward a compromise.???			The plan has glaring legal flaws that are sure to keep the Commission mired in litigation for a long, long time.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"arxief","name":"t1_coyqcmo","parent_id":"t1_coyq73k","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425020542,"created_utc":1425020542}

The US government will not use the patriot act to spy on phone calls of everyone.		The US government will not use the IRS to go after their political enemies. 		The US government will not use the threat of terrorism to take away our rights.		The US government will not ban guns and limit their use by fiat every time there is a tragedy. 		The US government will not abuse its power to benefit few select companies over their competition. 		Where have I heard that before? You are right, the US government has no history of abusing its power ALL the time. No we can trust them, the US government is run by angels. 		Essentially its government control of the internet. What has happened is that the big ISP have lobbies state and local governments in the past decade to put in so much regulations and red tape so that small ISP can't properly operate and new ones can't start up. 		Giant obvious example of this is Google, who are no small company, one of the biggest in the world and they can't setup internet properly due to government regulations. If they can't do it, how are small ISP's supposed to open or operate?		So not satisfied with the amount of control they have, the big ISP decided to work with the federal government to get even more monopoly on the internet and allow the federal government to control the internet and surveill people all in one. So they started giving certain websites faster speeds for monetary compensation, normally this wouldn't work, but because they've already lobbied governments in the past decade or so, they've limited competition so much that they have no fears of competition.		This allowed the federal government to use this to once and for all gain control of the internet. They tried with CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, etc... but when it was to "protect the internet from terrorists" or "keep our banks and financial system safe", people saw through the lies, they understood that government is bad news for the internet, so they changed the wrap around government internet control to "net neutrality". What is more hated than government? Big Corporations! So you change the wrap from keeping banks safe and keeping the internet safe from terrorists, to "sticking it to the evil big corporations who want to destroy the internet". even though those those same corporations that actually provide the internet, so destroying it wouldn't be in their best interest at all. 		So now, with the wrap changed, they have converted all those who rallied against CISPA, SOPA, ACTA, etc... government control of the internet to have them support government control of the internet. 		They've used the same tactics they used to pass the "patriot act" and other terrible laws, they give it a good wrap, even though the contents inside are poison. 		So that is what's happened, the federal government has gained control of the internet without laws, without congress, without debate, all through undemocratic, unconstitutional, bureaucratic decision to reclassify it to utility under the 1996 telecommunications act. 		What is going to happen in the next several years is you are going to see internet real ID's, internet taxes, internet censorship, copyright everywhere, corporate control of the internet(MPAA, RIAA, etc...) would control the flow of information and products and internet kill switch.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bing_bot","name":"t1_coymwts","parent_id":"t3_2x97i8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425011912,"created_utc":1425011912}

You can only get access via a Internet Provider(Gatekeeper), so in a free economy they hold the supply and there is quite the demand for that supply considering that 277,436,130 people had internet access in the US in 2014.

{"body":"I am happy for the new regulations, but I have a few reservations. 		First of all, the wording hinted at by Wheeler previously is concerning. He indicated that all ISPs are barred from blocking or throttling *legal* content. But what constitutes legal content? How is that defined and who defines it? Will this become an excuse to crack down on file sharing and sites that occasionally host nebulously illegal content (like Reddit)? 		Secondly, the regulations use forbearance far too aggressively. The lack of rate regulations and last mile unbundling ensure that, realistically, not much is going to change in the way of competition. I understand not imposing taxes, and I can even get behind forbearing rate regulations. But last mile unbundling really would have been the linchpin for increased competition and ISP diversity. Without that, this is really only serving to solidify the cable monopoly. On the other hand, the reversal of municipal infrastructure limits could be a big boon, but it will require small municipalities to actually get on board, and will realistically do little to nothing for the large percentage of the population in (sub)urban areas. 		But, on the bright side, at least the content discrimination has been regulated, and applying it to mobile is a huge boost for a large part of the population. Overall, I'm happy about the new regulations, I just worry that they don't go far enough in some areas and too far in others. Custom legislation would be better, but I don't trust any of the cronies in Congress to do the right thing. 		Besides, this could all be reversed in two years anyway if the GOP takes back the White House.

{"body":"For people questioning the legal authority of this move and what Republicans or Congress will try to do in response: The good news is the FCC has absolute authority to classify the internet as they see fit, and the fact that it has taken this long is not any indicator that there was a question regarding their ability to.  The reluctance to reclassify the internet is similar to when cable television came into common use and the FCC relied on Title I ancillary authority to regulate it until Congress eventually created Title VI in 1984 to add cable television to the act and give the FCC explicit authority over it that way.  The internet has gone unregulated for as long as it has at least to some extent because of an assumption by the FCC that Congress would pass a bill to bring the internet into the fold more directly for the FCC.  However, this obviously has not happened.  Furthermore there has been more problems with relying on Title I of the Act for the internet than there was for cable television, because cable television was similar enough to broadcast television that there was evidence of what their congressional mandate was for regulating television and therefore their ancillary authority actually had meaning.  The internet is too unlike any other communication service for ancillary authority to really have anything to go off of, leaving the FCC largely impotent until now.		The FCC has always had authority to classify the internet as a telecommunications service though, but because of these earlier assumptions on their part, they actually elected to classify it as an "information service" to deliberately bring it under the weaker Title I authority.  However, the courts have laid out the framework for the FCC to assert Title II authority very clearly in recent opinions.		???Given the Commission's still-binding decision to classify broadband providers not as providers of "telecommunications services" but instead as providers of "information services," . . . such treatment would run afoul of section 153(51)??? Verizon, 740 F.3d at 650.		That's the DC Court of Appeals just last year refusing to enforce the FCC's regulations on Verizon while quite pointedly placing the blame entirely on the FCC for taking away their own authority.  There's been a growing frustrating with the courts that the FCC has been able to use Title II to do everything they have wanted to do for a long time now, and I think the Verizon decision is really the culmination of it.  That was very likely the decision that convinced Obama to join the fray, and is why we are where we are today.		Now this means that the FCC has unquestioned authority to do what they have done, so it is very unlikely that any lawsuits fighting this will be successful.  The FCC has clear statutory authority for it, and any constitutional arguments would be pretty far fetched given how similar the regulations generally are to other communications services that have been in place for a very long time.  However as a mere Agency, the FCC derives power from Congress so this means Congress will always have the power to pass legislation that could usurp the FCC's authority here.  The only serious threat here is likely that Republicans would pass a new bill to amend the communications act and deliberately remove this type of regulation from the FCC's authority.  This becomes a question of politics more than legal authority, so my guess is as good as yours about it happening or not, but that's likely the only real threat to this.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SkiAMonkey","name":"t1_coy7ko8","parent_id":"t3_2x97i8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424984780,"created_utc":1424984780}

{"body":"> saying you can't charge for the amount of space you use isn't free market it hinders free market.		No one said that. All ISPs can still charge for any connection they offer. And the big players already are paying more for using more ressources. the problem is that the ISPs want to charge certain sites selectively under thread of throttling them down - which happened with Netflix until they agreed to pay. That's unfair competition - the very enemy of a free market.		I am a capitalist at heart, but I think that that doesn't mean that every corporation should be able to do whatever they want, but that we should foster competition and a fair market.		> what happened to free speech		The ruling _protects_ free speech, because it ensures that every voice can be heard equally - the ISPs can't throttle sites at will just because they disagree with them for some reason.		> All this will do is have everyone throttled down like communism.		Why? Aside from the fact that I don't know where you suddenly pulled the communism card from I also don't know why you'd think that. There is no acute ressource limitation on the site of the content providers. The only limitations that are a problem are on some (mostly rural) user endpoints. Which is a completely different problem. The reason ISPs wanted to double dip wasn't that they were trying to allocate dwindling ressources (and even if that was the case, they received enough public funding to extend their infrastructure), but simply the fact that they wanted to extort more money and give themselves (as content providers) an advantage.		Sure, any ISP could decide to just throttle everyone, but that's where competition comes in. And making sure that competition isn't banned due to some agreement with cities or entire states - like we saw more and more of recently - is one of the reasons for the new regulations.","depth":3,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Timguin","name":"t1_coydj7u","parent_id":"t1_coybmuv","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424994402,"created_utc":1424994402}

This is not theory but fact - otherwise hackers wouldn't use Denial of Service attacks. That is their main purpose to overload the bandwidth so much a companies servers shut down so yes servers and pipelines DO HAVE LIMITATIONS - You are ignorant to think otherwise.  		So when Netflix takes up 35% of an ISP's bandwidth they should pay more the company only taking up 2% of the bandwidth the ISP is providing.  The Internet is NOT limitless. 		>think about this - when TWC/Comcast offer faster packages, do >you see them out there updating the wiring and redoing their >infrastructure to your house to give you faster speeds? The same >cabling that's always been there works with slow internet the >same as it does with fast internet.		Broadband networks are 'contended' networks a bit like the road network???this means that there isn't enough capacity for every user to use the service at full capacity, at the same time. This contention helps to ensure prices remain low as generally speaking demand varies. However at peak times, you may find your broadband slows down. Remember that 'peak' in broadband terms can be in the evening, although this may vary by where you live and who your broadband provider is. Also, it's more likely you will see congestion during major events.   When they give you faster speeds they are giving more bandwidth compared to other customers and a higher priority on the server.  Which is just fine because the is why you pay more.  If they aren't able to do this to companies providing content or users who use a lot of data then either the cost of the plans will go up all together or they will throttle everyone's speeds down so they can get more customers on the same network.   		Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  It applies to government regulations as well as to physics. 			>And now you're saying well that money doesn't just grow on trees >to update the hardware -- matter of fact they actually have plenty >of money to update - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce->kushnick/time-warner-cables-high-s_b_6642210.html -- TWC >operates at a 97% profit margin already.

{"body":"I will concede a point if presenting with solid rationale. What I see is a lot of perfect-world free market theory and baseless assumptions.		Netflix pushing large amounts of data over Comcasts network was *at the request of Comcast customers*.  This was not broadcast indiscriminately.  I, Joe Customer, have paid Comcast to fetch me this data.   Comcast was just as happy to let Netflix wither.  They have their own services to push. The stunt where Comcast throttled Netflix into the ground is not allowed anymore.  So yes, it will resolve that issue.  		Exactly how could my power and water be better?  Maybe cheaper?  Maybe.  My power is stable and clean, I have all of it I need.  What else do I want?  As I mentioned elsewhere, do you want the streets dug up every time a new water company comes to town?  What kind of inefficiency does that introduce?  I can assure you its more than the system we have. Three power grids, same story.    Some services do not work well with pure market solutions because they are so large an undertaking.  Communications networks are becoming one of them, like water and power have been for years.  		As far as whats keeping the FCC from regulating content:  Whats keeping purple elephants from taking over the moon?  There is no law denying them that ability, just as there is not law denying purple elephants from taking over the moon.  There is also no law giving them that ability.  The issue hasn't come up.  This is just hypothetical hand-wringing.  		The government is regulating a transport problem.  It is regulating what a service provider may and may-not do to alter priority over data that passes through its network.  it is inaccurate to say that, as a whole, 'the internet' is being regulated.  It is like saying that someone with a pacemaker is being 'regulated' by the device.  No, an important  specific part of the whole system is being regulated to ensure continued overall functioning.  	You seem to think that the FCC is going to start censoring news articles or somesuch.  There simply is no provision for this in the law.

I understand the fear of the government getting involved, but really all they're doing here is protecting consumers. The companies wanted to charge for "fast lanes" which would have made small-business competition on the internet impossible, and would have given us as consumers fewer choices on where to conduct our business. 		And by not allowing them to charge access to utility poles anymore, they can't stop companies like Google from expanding Fiber, or cities from creating their own broadband networks, by charging prohibitive fees. 		I promise you, doing away with net neutrality would have resulted in a less-free market, even fewer options than we already have, even more expensive internet and services, and slower speeds.

{"body":"I know that's the argument, and at first glance it's compelling. I'm just very fearful that the results won't match the intentions.		To some extent the ISP's do "own the Internet". Those companies put up capital and take on risk to build out the infrastructure, which is a limited resource, and deliver the Internet to homes. Nobody is entitled to the labor and resources required to do that for free. Consumers may well even demand certain types of content at faster, prioritized speeds given that bandwidth is scarce. Prices are a reflection of the demand in comparison to the supply, and they help coordinate distributed knowledge into some kind of order. This isn't possible by dictate, which is why price fixing is detrimental.		However, that isn't happening en masse anyway sans so-called net neutrality. The problem is mostly an imagined one.		The real problems are market entry restrictions that the ISP's are *presently* using to prevent competition. A quick Google search yields tons of information about how this really is happening. Commonly, governments require that companies obtain "franchise licenses" from them (it's very mafia-esque) before they can build, and many times dictate that the initial phase must be of a certain scale. Often times startups can't afford this arbitrary level of investment. The existing companies have an interest in purchasing the legislators to morph those laws in ways that benefit themselves against new, riskier ventures that may offer better value to consumers if they were allowed to compete.		Additionally, sometimes public funds -- that is, money acquired independent of free choice -- are used to subsidize certain ISPs' infrastructures, "for the greater good", naturally. These also unfairly advantage certain providers over other typically newer ones. This drives competition and quality with it down, and prices up.		All of these laws lead to lawsuits which big, established corporations can afford and their less established competition can't. The expense can easily make a venture not worth it, and consumers suffer.		Have you ever wondered why there are only 2-3 providers in a given area? This is why. It's all predicated on some well-intentioned idea being put on the books.		If the companies weren't using the government against the little guy, new competition would push the market towards efficiency. Companies have more incentive to offer a product that consumers want most. If ISP's did decide to unfairly gouge customers, disgruntled customers would jump to a competing service, and the one which provided better value would prosper. Instead of the incentive being purchasing the laws, it's delivering a valuable service so customers continue choosing it.		More federal government oversight of the Internet is more of the same. The law is limited for now, but will only grow as companies pressure more for changes in their favor.		The world is so much more complicated, and knowledge so much more distributed, than one-size-fits-all forceful mandates could possibly accurately capture.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goggimoggi","name":"t1_coyzfy4","parent_id":"t1_coyxdt8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425051588,"created_utc":1425051588}

This means that the biggest companies with the deepest pockets in which the bureaucrats make their comfy homes will be getting waivers, while smaller, less favored companies will be squeezed out of an already difficult market (in fact, CEOs have probably already been personally "invited" to submit waivers).		Second, said large and small companies for various reasons will sue the bejeezus out of anyone they can find to get around this.  Technically the Federal Government cannot be sued unless it "agrees" to be sued, but the process is still long and arduous and expensive.  Aside from sucking resources out of both the Treasury and the economy, there will be a lot of uncertainty in the markets for the foreseeable future.		Third, being a C3 utility requires de facto, if not explicitly, that companies cater to the lowest common denominator.  If some municipality or the Justice Department gets a wild hair up their ass that some community is being discriminated against because they don't get the same level of service as San Francisco, the easy remedy is to reduce service for everyone.  This would never be accepted by a court.  However, a remedy will be demanded, then the company will say that they need 3 years to implement.  They will then proceed to reduce service while "trying" to meet the remedy.  When the timeline is up, the company will say, "LOOK!  Everyone gets the same service now.  Yay, us!"		Just wanted to say a few things that apparently no one ever thinks about.  This proposition has me worried much more than it has me excited.  I would rather net neutrality be passed via the legislative branch after due deliberation with a simple statement of remedy, rather than the kind of "fourth branch" of the government solving the problem by foisting upon it the gobs and gobs of rules and regulations they use for utilities.  I'd like the Internet to change only a very little - namely, stop trying to screw people out of their Netflix or private video blog channels.  Leave the rest alone.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Moon_Yagami","name":"t1_coy6if8","parent_id":"t3_2x97i8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1424983170,"created_utc":1424983170}

For example, Comcast could block or slow access to Netflix in favor of their own on-demand video service.  Or they could, and did, make providers like Netflix pay more to guarantee access to users.  Basically it gave your ISP a lot of authority to shape how you use the Internet.		What the FCC is doing is basically taking control of the delivery system and saying you can't filter content and to guarantee the access is as it is advertised.  Each and every user and service has equal access to networks and nothing can be throttled or blocked based on what it is. Because this was the regulation for many years, it has allowed the Internet to become what it is today.  		Much like how your phone line is regulated, the FCC doesn't care who or what you're calling, nor does the phone company.

{"body":"Can't possibly disagree with the hive right?  You've all been fooled.		We need to stop the poor analogies about net neutrality. Neil Irwin, in The New York Times, says it is like deciding whether Internet connections should be like electricity or cable television. His idea is that we all get the same electric service (net neutrality), but can pay for different levels of cable tv. Yet, in many places people pay for different electric service. In California (and other places), customers can get a lower rate if they agree to let the electric utility turn off their air conditioner during peak usage hours.	That is actually the exactly the sort of thing net neutrality supporters want to prevent. Yet, both parties win: the customer saves money in exchange for a short period of discomfort and the utility saves money by avoiding increases in peak generating capacity. Why would the government allow such an option in the more tightly regulated electricity market where there is almost always a single choice of service provider, yet not allow the same thing for Internet access where most people have multiple providers from which to choose?		More choices are good for consumers. We win from having multiple flavors of ice cream in the store. We benefit from the large variety of cars available for purchase. The fact that most people cannot afford some of those models does not mean they should be removed from sale. Similarly, the fact that some businesses or consumers may choose to pay for better access to the Internet is not a bad thing. Some people pay more to fly first class, but they do not interfere with my travel in coach.		As long as the government enforces the antitrust laws and ensures that consumers can choose among methods and providers for how they connect to the Internet, consumers can pick winners and losers by voting with their time, their eyeballs, and their dollars.

For people like me, women who want to go into writing for screen, Netflix has become an inroad- proof not only that everyone wants to see shows made by and about women and non binary genders, but also a means to bypass the massive wall of dicks that still dominates the film and television industry.

{"body":"It's not COMPLETELY true- there are actually a fair number of female writers out there, but they're mostly in television. There are female screenwriters for Game of Thrones. Buffy has Jane Espenson, Marti Noxon and others. But in the wider world, yeah, there's not much in the way of recognition. People know Diablo Cody's name, but few others. And in fairness there is a larger problem with recognition for the art in general. The only screenwriter people can mention off hand is Charlie Kaufman, and he's probably the only screenwriter whose films are associated with him and not a particular director. In television the writers get more credit because they stick around while directors are sort of hired on as contract traffic cops.		Either way, having the internet remain open, and having precedents like The Killing and Orange is the New Black can only do good things for the industry. There's this stupid worry that women writing and directing means more "women's interest" genre pieces (I don't know, Downton Abbey- except hey, mostly written by dudes!) but clearly that isn't the case when you look at Kathryn Bigelow's work. 		So really it isn't to say that women can't write for men or vice versa, it's that an entire half of the human experience is being excluded when it has wonderful innovation and perspective to add. There is zero reason to assume that compelling stories can't come from all quarters, and wherever the means of communication and interaction are free to all, the better it is for anyone who is underrepresented.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dual_citizen_kane","name":"t1_cozgsrk","parent_id":"t1_coyggjg","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1425081620,"created_utc":1425081620}

Roosevelt busted them up and instituted regulations to make it so that rail lines couldn't "tier" their services and had to handle all freight from anyone equally, charging everyone (even their friends and enemies) the same rate).

The fact is that two corporations -    It's just the opposite, in the Orwellian way that government language often is. 		False. This is not about "free use". Netflix was already paying their bills before they were throttled and extorted. You're using a lot of words you don't understand, and talking about a lot of things you don't understand. I can tell you have no absolutely and utterly no educational background in technology or internet infrastructure.		>Verizon and Netflix - are in a dispute over who should have to pay for sending Netflix traffic over Verizon's network.		No. Netflix is already paying.		>"Net Neutrality" just means that the government comes in and assigns the right to free use of Verizon's network to Netflix.		No. Netflix is already paying their (very) large bills. They were being extorted on top of that on the basis of the traffic that they use. This is not an ethical business practice, and affected tens of millions of people.		>There's nothing "neutral" about it.		Yes it is. It's not about "government intervention in the internet"; that's technologically illiterate inbred hick Fox news watcher nonsense. The government isn't touching the internet. It's setting rules so that megacorporations can't abuse it and making sure that no specific kind of internet content can be discriminated against.		>The government is picking a winner (Netflix) and a loser (Verizon). This couldn't be less neutral. 		No. The government is telling these megacorporations to play fair and not arbitrarily throttle or restrict access to certain things to see if they can extort money and/or promote their business interests (such as putting Google on a "slow lane" for all users and keeping the Time Warner search engine on a "fast lane").		>And the Oatmeal's graphic proves the opposite of what you think it does. No government intervention was necessary. Netflix and Verizon negotiated an agreement, and everything went back to normal. What's the problem?		Are you trolling right now? It went back to normal **after Netflix was extorted**. The Oatmeal graphic proved exactly what it set out to do; a thorough debunking of "daaa gubbermint" types (usually middle-aged men who know nothing about the internet, but oppose everything Fox News tells them to), a factual reality check, and a dosage of how utterly important this is to every citizen alive who wants the internet to continue to be free and open.		>The Democratic party has a terrible position 		No. The Democratic party isn't against net neutrality. Republicans are, not because of legitimate reasons, but because they're in the pockets of telecom giants.		>that puts Netflix's corporate greedy dick		Netflix isn't the one throttling traffic, and the Netflix isn't lobbying for the Democratic party or associated with them. The position of the Democratic party isn't about Netflix it's about all individuals and organizations, world-wide, who want to continue to use an internet free from monopoly abuse.		I'm sorry, but the only reason you're even trying to fight a losing argument here is because you're an angry Republican that puts his emotions over the issue here. It's very telling about the contents of your character; accept that the Republicans have a shitty position on this one solely because they're in the pockets of these megacorporations, and move on.

I first became aware of it, during the physical act of love. Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred.  Women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women.

The FCC can make recommendations based on complaints they receive if they think the law is too relaxed or too restrictive, but they do not make the decisions themselves as to what is ok and what is not.
