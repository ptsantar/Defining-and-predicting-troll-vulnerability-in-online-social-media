None of these stable animals or crops were found in other (hotter) parts of the world, giving Europe a huge advantage.

Once Europeans colonized the world, hot tropical regions were exploited for their slaves and resources, but North America (and importantly South Africa and the East coast of Australia) were actually settled by Europeans because they had similar climates to Europe that could easily support the same crops and domesticated animals.		Hot climates (minus vacation destinations) have yet to catch up from being export dependent and have only recently relatively recently been able to support this kind of agriculture due to fertilizers and advanced irrigation.

For example, they documented that spikes in temperature increased violent crime in the United States and Australia, that years of low rainfall increased domestic violence and ethnic conflict in South Asia, that extreme rainfall events increased land invasions in Brazil and that warmer temperatures increased civil conflict throughout the tropics.

Cohn and Rotton:		* They ultimately concluded that violence rose with temperature, but only to a point. Around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, assault rates started to fall, a trend that dovetailed with a hypothetical explanation for heat-induced violence in which being uncomfortable provokes competing tendencies of both aggression and escape. At low to moderate levels of discomfort, people lash out, but at high levels they just want to flee. -[Source](http://www.wired.com/2011/07/hot-weather-violence/)		* But the results also fit with a sociological rather than psychological explanation. According to so-called Routine Activities Theory, many forms of violent crime are functions of social opportunity, and increase when more people spend more time outside. When it becomes so hot that people retreat inside, crime falls. -[Source](http://www.wired.com/2011/07/hot-weather-violence/)		However, Anderson, who felt they hadn???t fully accounted for time-of-day effects, found that:		> On hot weather, the body exhibits changes ??? increased heart rate, blood circulation and sweating, and metabolic changes ??? associated with sympathetic nervous system activity, which in turn is linked to fight-or-flight responses.

I grew up in more working class Miami as just your average Latino boy, a little too scrawny to get recruited into that stuff and just a decade ago, most kids wanted to be in gangs and act all tough.

It's why I never bring it up to them, just treating them like normal kids means a lot more than pity as I've seen, but that's an aside. It's why I've somewhat adopted that community as my own. The place gives me definite looks from friends of mine, but I've never felt like I was in danger outside of being there after dark (but that's anywhere in Miami really, city senses).

I think just seeing it first-hand and living it is usually a great way to change people's view when it comes to that stuff, and that might be a contributor to the drop in violence.

{"body":"One thing that does get thrown around a lot on reddit and that does have a lot evidence to support it is that the legalization of abortion in 1973 (Roe v Wade) helped reduced unwanted babies. Since children raised in terrible homes is a big factor in how they turn out as teens and adults, you would have a lot less crime some 18+ years later. 		That makes sense that it would apply to these situations we are discussing --- *The kids don't want to "Be Ghetto" and the parents become more involved in their children and cops become more vocal parts of a community*".  With fewer kids raised by bad parents, you start having more teens that want to live and experience life. You also start to have fewer adults that don't care about their children and more adults that are actively involved in their kid's lives. 		I also grew up with in a mostly latino neighborhood. My school, IIRC, was about 45% latino, 25%white, 25% black, and 5% others. Perhaps similar to your nieghborhood, most of the latino kids were children of immigrants (first generation parents, 2nd generation for children).  These latino immigrants move to a new country, move into bad neighborhoods, and often work long hours. They are also uninformed on certain parental issues --- they may not know how to spot troubled kids, where to seek help or if they could even afford it, etc. So many of these kids fall into gangs. Many of those outgrow that stage and then end up having better jobs than their parents --- and they move to better neighborhoods. Many others when they become adults have more information about parenting available to them.  There's a bunch of factors here that basically lead to these 2nd generation adults are better off than their first generation parents and thus can make sure their children (3rd generation) don't repeat their mistakes.			There's a whole different set of factors that go into the violence in black communities though. For them, it's more about a generation of slavery, followed by jim crow laws that discriminated, and higher levels of racism that exist against blacks than other groups. This has a major influence on the black culture. 			>If anything, I think part of me wants to say the one big thing that's changed is communication.

They haven't been doing that because of people hiding bodies in them like the wire, they've been doing it for the same reason they've been removing abandoned cars from the side of roads, it reduces crime because people who see that the place they live in is being looked after are less likely to commit crimes that might make the place worse.		The reason I mentioned the abandoned cars is because that's how this discovery was made, I don't have the reference, but several years back a new mayor was elected in a high crime area and surveyed what people wanted him to do, and the answer that came back was to remove the abandoned cars that tended to get vandalised and set on fire.		After they did this, the vandalism and arson of the cars obviously stopped, but seemingly unrelated crimes also suddenly dropped. It turned out that a lot of people were less willing to commit crimes in the area when they could see that the place was being looked after, some speculations on the actual causation include that visible public services imply that the area might be being policed more heavily, and that people might just have seen more value in the area after efforts were made to improve it, and that it's harder to justify things with the logic of "if no-one else cares about it, why should I" if you can see people making positive improvements to the area.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"faceplanted","name":"t1_cojfu00","parent_id":"t1_cojafuq","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1423764960,"created_utc":1423764960}

Some people think it looks depressing, but it's better than abandoned buildings, imo.  		But certainly there are quite a few reasons for bulldozing the buildings.  As I said in my post, crime tends not to happen in empty lots.  The police and neighbors can see what's going on.  I think it's easy for illegal activity to happen behind the walls of an abandoned building.  And you raise other good points, apart from that.

The trend holds true in other large cities as well, so it's obviously not due to any particular leadership in those cities.","depth":1,"score":18,"ups":18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cojcevq","parent_id":"t1_coj9vld","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1423759330,"created_utc":1423759330}

{"body":"If abortion rates remained constant, I don't think your argument holds. Let's say the prime age for murder is 18-24 (which is what the Freaknomics study said was the age where males are most likely to commit crimes. 			Abortion was legalized in 1973. Let's assume the rate remained constant  from 1974 (the first full year) through the present. 			The first time we will see an affect is going to 1992 (1974+18). So in 1992 you have 19-24yr olds that were not aborted but your 18 yr olds are now missing kids that were aborted. In 1993, you now have 20-24yr olds that aren't aborted but 18-19 yr olds that are missing due to abortion. You continue that until 1998, at which point now all 18-24 yr olds are part of the post abortion world. So 1999 should have no influence on murderers in the 18-24 group.  			Assuming the abortion rates remained constant, drops since 1998 would be due to other factors. 		[Lo and behold](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/images/murderrate.png), there was a 6yr period 1993 to 1999 that murder rates dropped FAST. Then in 2000 it was a small drop and then in 2001, it actually increased. It was mostly constant from 1999 to 2008 before falling fast since 2008. 		I had actually looked into it in the past and though it was constant from 1999 to 2008, more people were shot so it indicated that more people were surviving firearm violence.  One can argue that murder rates would have increased during that period if not for advancement in medicine and surgery.","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"daimposter","name":"t1_cojkycs","parent_id":"t1_cojkcwt","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1423774339,"created_utc":1423774339}

There is real fear in knowing that there is the *potential* for an officer to kill you and suffer no other consequence than a suspension / leave with pay. 		Not all police act this way, not all of America's police force would respond excessively; however these particular issues can not be ignored and should not be trivialized. 		Many people are hurting, suffering financially, and in many cases it has not a damn thing to do with poor money management or responsibility. People can't get time off to care for their families / loved ones before jumping through hoops. Sick leave is not guaranteed. You have to be employed for over a year continuously before FMLA can begin to protect you, and even then you have to deal with coworker resentment. It's completely fucked, it's a needlessly stressful existence. Many of our elected officials promise one thing, then act to undermine that very same promise. Maybe the police state thing is just a little bit more reactive, but isn't it reasonable that people react that way given the daily stress exposure?

{"body":"Average murder rate in 2014 for NYC was 4.0 per 100,000.  If we figure that each person murdered was the only person the murderer murdered, then that means the rate of murderers is 4.0/100,000 as well.		Which means the probability of someone not killing anyone is 99,996/100,000 = 99.996%.  Now that's in a *year*, not in a day.  So the probability of a random NYC citizen *not* murdering someone on any particular day would be described by *x* such that (1-x)^365 = 0.99996.  This yields 365 ln(1-x) = ln(0.99996), of course, which is converted into 1-x = exp(ln(0.99996)/365), such that x = 1-exp(ln(0.99996)/365) ~ 1.1e-7.  Now the probability that someone would not murder anyone for 10 consecutive days is simply (1-x)^10 = 0.9999989 = 99.9999%.		Phrased differently, the probability that someone would be *unable* to do this is 0.0001%.  Which is only 1 in 1,000,000.  For the other 999,999 of us, we can do this.		TL;DR: In a city the size of NY, we'd expect that 8.4 of its residents will fail to abstain from murder in any given 10 day period.","depth":1,"score":16,"ups":16,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tangerinelion","name":"t1_cojk2lm","parent_id":"t1_cojemzi","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1423772834,"created_utc":1423772834}

{"body":"I think this is a rather interesting topic, especially since people have tried to attach it to so many different policies, like Zero Tolerance or stop and frisk and what not.		Interestingly these sort of headline news is happening all over the world, with completely different police practices. In my home country Norway we had a low crime rate in the 60s and then it kept increasing until it reached 55 murders in 1986 (Norway had about 4.5 million people then). Today the number of murders is down to 30 murders and the population is over 5 million.		So the development in Norway is very similar to that one experienced in cities such as New York or America as a whole. But this has happened with completely opposite police practices from the US. Norway maintains low incarceration rates and the justice system has in general gotten more lenient towards criminals not tougher. The police has not changed the tactic much. I can remove there every being a debate about trying zero tolerance.		I suspect this means that police policy doesn't matter all that much. It is society which matters. So it is more relevant to look for in what ways say Norwegian and American society has developed in the same direction.		My hypothesis is that in most western societies today, parents are a lot more involved with their children than was the case in the 1980s. The helicopter parent is likely a global phenomenon. The generational gap is also a lot smaller. I play computer games with my kids and watch star wars. We grew up with much the same pop culture. Music isn't that different. Heavy rock of the 80s must have sounded horrible and offensive to my parents, but music today hasn't gotten any more agressive. Almost the opposite. And I think parents and children understand each other better than before.		I think it is harder to go down a criminal path when your parents know a lot more about what is going on in your life and is a lot more capable of helping you.		Also I think we that the internet age for all its ill with less active and less social kids, it also brings about a less violent lifestyle. When kids are home playing playstation or clicking on their friends at facebook, that also means you are taking away an opportunity to be outside plotting mischief with the gang.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lusion","name":"t1_cojg8l9","parent_id":"t3_2vnd8v","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1423765612,"created_utc":1423765612}
