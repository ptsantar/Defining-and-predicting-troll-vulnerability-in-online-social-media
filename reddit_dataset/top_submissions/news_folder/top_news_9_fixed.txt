Sure, you can pay top dollar for some national counsel or whatever, but there's really nothing that a private attorney is going to be able to do that a public defender can't do as (or more) competently. 		I've seen people drop the pd's office and throw their money at whatever attorney they could afford, who then turned around and helped them get literally the exact same result the pd's would have.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"norinmhx","name":"t1_cpzf9sb","parent_id":"t1_cpzev84","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1428020937,"created_utc":1428017337}

We have science for this! You can't just look at statistics and say "My conclusion is X". That's not how this works! You have to look at how the data was obtained, for what purpose it was obtained, how it's presented, what variables and controls are accounted for in the acquisition of that data. Then you have to look at cultural, social, and economic factors that lead to any conclusion the data may support. After that, you still have to pluck data from multiple unbiased sources to verify and **finally** you have to do a sanity check to make sure that you didn't mess something up prior to that point. You've done exactly 0 of that. If you had, you would know that the data does not support that conclusion.

We're already answering questions about causes and what we can do to fix things. One thing is to not, in blanket fashion, declare that an entire ethnicity is composed of criminals, because (and if you'd bothered to do a shred of thinking or exploratory work into the subject) that declaration leads to greater arrest and incarceration rates for that particular ethnicity **REGARDLESS OF COMPARABLE CRIME RATES**. Read that again if you need to. You probably need to.

The fact that you somehow think you're a special and unique snowflake that singularly has the clarity of mind, wealth of information, and great skill at correctly interpreting it **ON ALL OF THE INTERNET** when this subject and interrelated subjects are not only the professional purview of some of us, but perhaps even the main subject of our academic studies **should fucking bother you**, but it doesn't.

{"body":"ELI5: (and keep in mind that there are a lot of intricacies here and things change depending on jurisdiction) 		Assault is creating the apprehension or fear of imminent harmful or offensive contact. If I tell you I'm going to punch you in the face, and make a fist and wave it at you, I have committed the act of assault against you. 		Battery (tort) is any contact that is offensive, unwanted, or harmful.  If I grab your shoulder, even if I don't hurt you, I have committed the act of battery against you. 		Simple battery (crime) does not require intent, but is really hard to prove in court. It is typically a misdemeanor. If I grab your shoulder, and I hurt you in doing so, I have committed simple battery even though I didn't intent to hurt your shoulder when I grabbed you (maybe I was attempting to balance myself.) in most places, this would be a tortious (meaning wrongful) act. You could sue me for the tort of battery against you, but I am not likely to be charged with a crime (although I could be in some jurisdictions.) 		Most jurisdictions follow the reasonable person standard. Meaning that for it to be a crime, a reasonable person would know, or should have known that their actions would result in *harmful, or offensive* contact. For example, if I touched your back while trying to get some debris off your shirt for you, and you found that offensive, you could sue me for the tort of battery, but I would not be charged with the crime of simple battery because that doesn't meet the reasonable person standard. 		Aggravated assault is a crime and is typically a felony. For me to have committed aggravated assault against you, I must have intended to grab your shoulder, AND intended to do physical harm by grabbing your shoulder. 		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		To answer your question specifically, the under the reasonable person standard, the cop used a reasonable amount of force to detain and control the driver when she stepped out of the vehicle (assuming there was a miscommunication and he wasn't expecting her to attempt to exit the vehicle.) This reasonable amount of force is protected by his office as a law enforcement officer. He did not commit the crime of simple battery, even though he meets the basic definition I described above, because his actions were reasonable in the performance of his duties. But if she found that use of force offensive or harmful, she could sue him in civil court for the tort of battery because his actions resulted in contact that she found offensive or harmful. It would then be her (her lawyers duty) duty to prove via the preponderance of the evidence that this did happen, and there was contact, and that his contact was offensive or harmful, AND that it was indefensible (that he has no valid defense to the tort of battery.) The cop (his lawyer) would merely have to prove that his actions were reasonable in the performance of his duties as a qualified defense to the tort of battery (basically, that even though he did commit the act of battery, he was reasonable in doing so in trying to do his job.)		She would likely lose that suit. 		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		In most places, detaining a suspecting using reasonable force in the performance of your official duties as a law enforcement officer does not constitute battery so long as the force is reasonable. Pushing a suspect against an object (a wall, the car, etc) to control them to apply handcuffs to them is a reasonable use of force. If they would have beaten her with a baton to force compliance without provocation on her part would be unreasonable and would constitute battery. 			Now before people get out their pitchforks, the poster who told the story said his sister was shoved against the car. That is very subjective. What you consider a shove I might consider a push. 		Also, let's step back for a second, if there's a miscommunication and the cop didn't mean to get out right now and take a look at it, and the driver suddenly makes a move to get out of the vehicle, in the side of the road, at night, I think shoving them up against a car and cuffing them until you figure out what's going on is a pretty reasonable response. 		Or the cop was just being a dick. I don't know. I'm not necessarily defending the cop, I'm merely pointing out that the posters description of the events is inherently subjective in nature and there's no way to know for sure what was going on.","depth":7,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RammerJammerYlwHamr","name":"t1_cpzn3us","parent_id":"t1_cpzkphx","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1428035976,"created_utc":1428032376}

Your example is tricky, since the cop would have to hand over the drugs, making him part of the crime that was committed.

Once the dashed centerline started, I passed the RV, the cop (whom I didn't see) and another pickup. This was wrong on my part since in WA you can pass only one vehicle at a time.		I pulled over as soon as he lit up. He asks me if I know why he pulled me over and I tell him yes, it's because I passed 3 cars at once.		I swear I'm telling the truth here.		He tells me no. It's because I passed in a no passing zone. He says that there was a "no passing for one mile" sign half a mile back and that I should've waited until a mile has passed. I tell him that I passed when the dashed line started which means I can pass.		He replies by saying that it doesn't matter about the dashed line. The sign says no passing for 1 mile and the mile was not done yet. I told him he is wrong. That the sign was posted for the 1 mile where there was the double solid line.		At that point he tells me that I can turn around after we are done and take a look. He takes my info, goes back to his car, comes back with a ticket for illegal passing. As soon as he walks away, I bust a u-turn and go to see where that sign is. There weren't any other cars on the road when I turned around.		He goes after me and pulls me over again. I ask him why this time and he says its illegal to turn around on the highway. I tell him that he told me to and that's when he tells me he meant to turn around on the next street. 		Then he tells me to get out, cuffs me and puts me in the back of his car. I didn't make it to that sign. After he searched my car, he tells me that he will "let me off" with only a criminal citation (still had to go before a judge) instead of booking me at the local jail.

Kids soak up anything, so it's important to tell them the right stuff lest they accumulate generally unfavorable ideals. So you can see why I'm talking about the toys and other tools of amusement they get access to, because those are what they're going to be spending much of their time with.		As for homelessness, though women are less likely to be accepted for a job, they do tend to have more job security. I'd speculate this is because women are seen as "weak" and are taken pity on, or they've simply been found to be dependable and don't want to risk losing that. Or possibly a combination of both, among other qualities. 		Also, I said women were more likely to be raped. In prison, intentionally isolated from civilization as is due to punishment, it's hard to judge this sort of thing on people who very well could be in there for a decent reason. Sure, not all of them are, but we're talking about prison rapists. (and I do think replacing prisons with proper rehabilitation facilities would be more beneficial for the prisoners)","depth":12,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AMasonJar","name":"t1_cpz8jfm","parent_id":"t1_cpz4e6r","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1428009559,"created_utc":1428005959}

But like I said in my original post, this cop was being Mr. Badass; most times once they realize you're a cop (or a "friend"; ever noticed those Fraternal Order of Police stars clamped awkwardly to some vehicle's license plates?

And me, if I go to the next city over I'm on my own like anyone else. Most cops, when pulled over anywhere in the country, will hand over their license, registration and their local PD ID without saying a word; wink wink nudge nudge. 		Is it a shitty system? Yup.

Now first, I hadn't lived here long and didn't actually know the speed limit, granted I should have, but still. Second, during the day, probably 98% of people drove 60 mph down the road EVERY day. At night it's fewer, but that night, I was following behind a line of maybe 3-4 other cars who were going exact same speed as me. I was just going with the flow of traffic, really. Cop gave me a ticket anyway. I even still had a flimsy temporary paper license while I waited for my real one to come in. If that cop had been a reasonable cop, he would have just given me a warning. That would have worked. Instead, I get the welcome of 90 buck ticket to my new state when I was going the same speed as everyone else.

Thus, you are suing on grounds the DA has abused their office, and thus caused you undue personal harm.  You can rule out incompetence once you prove the DA has the mental faculty to discern that there was no evidence, and that the charges were brought against you anyway.		Baseless charges against civilians who have no active criminal investigations against them serve zero purpose to a prosecutor's office.  They do nothing to uphold the law and I believe you could argue that this is an abuse of office.  Once you prove it was an abuse of office, you can argue that because it was not a charge brought on in the interests of the office, the protections of that office should not apply.		Even if the legal precedent says you can not sue them personally and the case gets thrown out, you can appeal and hope to change the law itself.  It only takes on SCOTUS ruling to change precedent.  If a judge rules that a prosecutor is not protected when they charge innocents *with zero evidence of criminal activity*, then you will stop seeing prosecutors charge people without a shred of evidence because they would be subject to the same possible scrutiny.		In fact it's arguably people's civic duty to sue a prosecutor personally when they are charged for a crime and there is no reasonable prior investigation or evidence.

{"body":"There's no reason you should be down voted and I'm gonna pull the quote you posted because it makes damn good sense			The myth I see the most of reddit is that when officers get in trouble, they just get "paid vacation."		When an accusation of misconduct comes up, especially criminal misconduct, the officer is placed on Administrative Leave with pay. This is NOT the punishment. This is to get them off the streets while the investigation is being conducted, while at the same time, not punishing them (financially at least) until the accusations are investigated and proven. 		When an accusation of Police Misconduct is investigated, there are TWO separate investigations. One is an Administrative Investigation, the other is a Criminal Investigation. They have to be separate because of Garrity		Garrity is like the evil twin of Miranda for government employees, mostly police. After the Garrity admonitions are read to us, we MUST answer all questions, and MUST answer them truthfully. If we refuse to answer, or lie, we can be fired just for lying or refusing to answer.		That completely violates our 5th Amendment Right against self incrimination. Because of that, nothing said after Garrity can be used against us in criminal court. It can only be used in administrative actions against our employment.		Therefore, two separate investigations are conducted. An Administrative Investigation where they read us Garrity, and a Criminal Investigation where they read us Miranda. Nothing found in the administrative investigation can be used against us in the criminal, but things found in the criminal CAN be used against us in the administrative. So the criminal is usually done first, then the administrative afterwards. 		Because the administrative is usually done after the criminal, that's why it often takes time for the firing to happen, because the firing won't happen until after the Administrative. While that seem strange to the lamen, if the Administrative was done first, and officer could say "Yeah I stole the money" under Garrity and it couldn't be used against him in court. But if the criminal is done first, and he says "Yeah I stole the money" after miranda, it can be used to prosecute him AND to fire him. 		Once the two investigations are complete, THEN the punishment is handed down if the charges are sustained. Media articles don't always follow up on the case, so all people read in papers is "officer got in trouble, is on paid leave." Administrative Leave is just the beginning, not the end of the story. 		Even then, the Administrative Leave isn't fun. The take your badge and gun and you are basically on house arrest between the hours of 8am and 5pm on weekdays. You cannot leave your home without permission of your superiors, even it its just to go down the street to the bank or grocery store. You must be available to come into the office immediately at any time for questioning, polygraphs, or anything else involved in the investigation. Drink a beer? That's consuming alcohol on duty, you're fired. So even when officers are cleared of the charges and put back on the street, Admin. Leave still isn't "paid vacation." 		EDIT: I did not realize the wiki explained garrity, but gave such a poor example of the admonitions, leading to some confusion. Here is a much better example. 		EDIT:#2 I changed the Garrity wiki link because the wiki had a very poor example of the warnings, which led to a lot of confusion. Plus the change has a lot of links to more information on garrity for those wanting to learn more about it.

Two line officers disagreeing over how something was handled on the job, getting in each others faces, and coming to blows?  It happens.

If it's serious, like people get badly hurt, someone might be suspended.  Maybe.  But that's not a frequent thing.		Two off-duty cops get into it in a bar in another jurisdiction, where another department is in control, and they're more likely to be arrested/cited like any other citizen.  They're less likely to be prosecuted, for sure.  Departments will usually work things out.  I've seen a local officer arrested and released by a nearby town, then actually demoted for the incident.

I will bet you $20 that he started flipping out, berating and shouting at her, to which she stood her ground and asserted what rights she has.

P.S. I will clarify that I've noticed that while we know not all police officers are jackasses, these encounters depend on the mentality of the local police department. I grew up in a fairly large city in upstate New York and the police deparment there is notorious for arresting people that threaten to file complains or ask for badge numbers or record officers doing stuff they shouldn't be doing (they made national headlines for this at least once).

This is horrible for many reasons.  But one of the biggest is it means bad cops stay around doing bad stuff for years, even decades.  If they would weed out the bad cops the image would be vastly better.  The problem is bad behavior (by cops, teenagers... any group) is very noticeable.  Good behavior is often largely invisible.  Thousands of cops probably made stops the same day and were completely professional.  But the police and district attoneys supporting horrible behavior such as this instance trumps thousands of reasonable actions by cops.		It is similar for cops.  Thousands of people every day cause cops no problems.  A few people many days for weeks and months and years are super jerks.  It is no wonder cops get annoyed especially when they see similarities with the hundreds of previous instances of jerks in their past.  Of course, good cops overcome this frustration and don't act out.		When police departments and unions not only don't take strong actions against bad behavior but support it they are directly encouraging the very behavior that has given rise to a growing frustration in the USA with the state of affairs today.		When your law enforcements agencies show they don't care about the law but care more about helping their colleagues (or being so scared of their colleagues they allow bullies to proceed because they fear they will suffer for confronting illegal and morally reprehensible behavior) no matter how egregious the actions it is obvious that people will become upset at those institutions promoting such actions against society.","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mod_cat","name":"t1_cpyq37k","parent_id":"t1_cpygkne","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427970775,"created_utc":1427967175}

It specifically requires forcible resistance or obstruction, it does not seem to require it to be incidental to an already occurring arrest, although court rulings would make that clear.  Unless this woman tried to physically fight the cop to stop him from giving her a speeding ticket, I believe this officer is abusing his authority.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LaserGuidedPolarBear","name":"t1_cpz0z2x","parent_id":"t1_cpyniwt","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427997016,"created_utc":1427993416}

I proceeded less than a quarter of a mile, traveling at around 15 mph with my hazard lights on, to the nearest exit and pulled into a convenience store on the corner.

I shit you not, this dumbass tells me that you are supposed to stop *immediately* after a cop signals you.  He tells me that I should've stopped in the road, and that the lights on his car are there to direct traffic to cautiously go around.  		I got his badge number and left a message for his lieutenant (or whatever) to call me back.  He *actually* called back but didn't admit to any wrong-doing on the part of the officer.   He did tell me, though, that I--and all this would be taking place within a span of about 45 seconds to a minute, mind you--should have called 911 and had someone dispatch to the officer that I was planning to stop at the convenience store, just off the exit ahead.

{"body":"When I was 16 and working at Burger King, one night after working a closing shift I was on my way home when another car slipped in behind me. It was a dark rural highway and I was going 60 in a 55, but something was odd about that car. It was practically RIGHT on top of my bumper and without streetlights it didn't have any discernable features. Unnerved, I began to speed up. 65. 70, 75. Finally we hit 80 and the car was closer than ever, and I was beginning to panic. What did this person want with me? We were approaching the turn-off for my house, after which I'd have to travel several miles of even darker back roads. What if he followed me? Should I try to make the turn without a blinker? 		In the end I flipped the blinker at the last moment and took the turn way too fast, jamming the brakes to keep from sliding into the field. At the same time this was also the first time I could see the other car, since it was a relatively busy turn-off and someone had thought it'd be wise to have a street light here if nowhere else. As I'm screeching across the road my eyes are glued to the rear view mirrow, and I experience two very conflicting emotions: the first is relief, because the other car is not turning to follow me, and second, confused rage, because as the other car passes under the light I can finally see the roof lights and markings of a police car, and why the hell is a policeman intimidating little girls on dark roads at night? 		I'm bringing up this story because that policeman's behavior caused me to experience fear, and as a dumb kid that fear caused me to do dumb things that put both of us in danger. Unlike this lady there wouldn't have been anywhere safe for me to go even if he had turned on his lights so I knew who the hell he was. I think the police are important and most of them are probably good, but our system is wide open to abuse.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nautical_theme","name":"t1_cpytlk1","parent_id":"t3_314z1z","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427984143,"created_utc":1427980543}

{"body":"This is crazy. I had been in a similar situation. I did not get arrested or a ticket, but it still resulted in a pissed off cop for the same reason.		So, I live in Los Angeles. one night I had driven two of my friends home from a bar, I was the designated driver. I was sober.

During those seconds, I hear the cop use her builtin walkie megaphone saying "PULL OVER." While kinda shocked by this impatience, I was able to get off the road and stop under a streetlight. Then I waited. 		Cop comes up to my window with her maglight shining it in my face. First thing she asks in the most annoyed tone ever, "WHY DIDN'T YOU PULL OVER RIGHT AWAY?!"

{"body":"I hate those phony resisting arrest charges. I really don't understand why the courts just blindly follow the cops' versions of the story, even against better knowledge. 		A couple years back I had to testify in a case against some poor devil who was charged with assault and resisting arrest in Nevada. I had just gotten off a bus somewhere in downtown Las Vegas together with about 10 other people and there were two guys wrestling right behind the bus stop. Seconds later, a squad car pulls up, one of the guys yells "He assaulted me!", cop tackles the other guy and cuffs him. He never saw the cop coming and didn't struggle or anything.  So the guy apparently hurt himself being tackled by the officer and suggested the cop had had intercourse with his own mother. LEO thus slams his head into the pavement and kicks him in the ribs. 		Long story short, they couldn't convict the guy on the assault charges as nobody had seen who had actually started the altercation and there was no evidence of assault, robbery or anything else than two guys getting into a brawl. However, they convicted him for resisting arrest although at least eight whitnesses clearly stated that the defendant didn't do anything other than calling the cop a motherfu**er and had been severely beaten AFTER he had been restrained...

{"body":"This happened to my dad on a family outing almost 10 years back...		We were at a beach, 2.5 hours away from home, planning a day of fun in the sun. While we were playing in the sand, we found little clams. So we grabbed a bucket and put a few in with some water to bring it back home as memorabilia and decoration.		On the way out towards our car, a couple of people came over and made small talk, found out that we had some clams from the beach. It wasn't until after we left that they had called the police on us.		We pulled out of the parking lot and drove through a small stretch of road, when my dad forgot which turn it was to make it towards the freeway. He stopped shortly after a stop sign, and decided to take a turn. Immediately a police vehicle came up behind us lights blaring. My dad drove 600 meters to find parking due to a full street with no free space to park.		My dad was cited for Resisting Arrest, Running a Stop Sign, Stopping in the middle of an intersection, as well as Illegal Fishing without a License and something about catching wildlife before it had reached a certain size / limit.		He had to go to court for all of this, cited with a Felony and several counts of Misdemeanor. It took him 7 months to finish all of the court hearings for them to deem him Not Guilty, and walked away with only having to pay for stopping in the middle of an intersection.		TLDR; Don't take anything home from a nature outing, and trying to find a valid parking spot after police lights come on can still count for a Felony.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"faye2thesky","name":"t1_cpypt8b","parent_id":"t3_314z1z","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427969306,"created_utc":1427965706}

{"body":"One time I got pulled over for going 65 in a 55. The officer was likely bored and needed something to do because in most places I've lived they don't usually bother you for 10 over unless you have out of state tags or they've profiled you for various reasons. He followed me on the highway for a couple of miles tailgating the shit out of me without his lights on, undoubtedly running my tags.			I went up the exit I was getting off at to go home, and turned into a busy 40MPH city street. The officer then put his lights on behind me. I drove an additional 100 yards so that I could pull into a well lit parking lot. I was not fearing for my safety or anything, I just felt that if I were a cop I would appreciate the driver pulling into the parking lot up the road rather than blocking a lane of traffic and forcing me to stand where a vehicle might hit me in the darkness.			Instead he came up to the window and berated me for not stopping immediately the very second he flipped his lights on. I explained that I thought he would rather stand in a parking lot than a roadway, to which he responded quite loudly "YOU DON'T GET TO MAKE THAT DECISION!". He didn't find the big bust he was hoping for and gave me a warning.			Usually when a police officer gives me a break about something I'm grateful, but in this case I was still upset that the officer was a bit of a jerk. Here I am trying to take his safety into consideration and go literally up to the next intersection at a safe speed to pull over so he doesn't become roadkill, and he's pissed off that I didn't let him stand in the middle of the roadway.

{"body":"She handled this poorly.  The late great Dr. Thompson told us how to handle being pulled over:		>Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side when he sees the big red light behind him ... and then he will start apologizing, begging for mercy.		>This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop-heart. The thing to do -- when you're running along about a hundred or so and you suddenly find a red-flashing CHP-tracker on your trail -- what you want to do then is accelerate. Never pull over with the first siren-howl. Mash it down and make the bastard chase you at speeds up to 120 all the way to the next exit. He will follow. But he won't know what to make of your blinker-signal that says you're about to turn right.		>This is to let him know you're looking for a proper place to pull off and talk ... keep signaling and hope for an off-ramp, one of those uphill side-loops with a sign saying "Max Speed 25" ... and the trick, at this point, is to suddenly leave the freeway and take him into the chute at no less than a hundred miles an hour. 		>He will lock his brakes about the same time you lock yours, but it will take him a moment to realize that he's about to make a 180-degree turn at this speed ... but you will be ready for it, braced for the Gs and the fast heel-toe work, and with any luck at all you will have come to a complete stop off the road at the top of the turn and be standing beside your automobile by the time he catches up.		>He will not be reasonable at first ... but no matter. Let him calm down. He will want the first word. Let him have it.  His brain will be in a turmoil: he may begin jabbering, or even pull his gun. Let him unwind; keep smiling. The idea is to show him that you were always in total control of yourself and your vehicle -- while he lost control of everything.		EDIT:  A few people seem to think this is serious advice.

When I was in medical school I just paid this ticket and moved on with my life, at the time they had my new address and had no problem contacting me!

I'm completely freaked out about it, I'm a medical resident and I have no idea what this means for my job prospects in the future and it's been awful.  I have to get a background check every so often and I'm sure that every arrest is on there, I only have this one of course.

I was traveling in the passing lane and a car came off an exit ramp on the right, flew across the three lane road, cut me off, and then broke hard in front of me.  Obviously it freaked me out and I honked my horn at the guy.  Next thing I know, a cop flies up behind me, and not only runs his siren and roof lights, but has this super bright light on my car, and I can't see anything at all.  I had to slowly move over to the right lane, and then there was no side strip to pull over on, and just curb, so I put on my hazard lights and was trying to find the next side street or a parking lot to pull into.  I could not look into my rear view mirror anymore, as the light was so blinding, and the next thing I knew, the cop car was in front of me and slammed on the brakes, and I nearly hit him.  I was not able to see him pass me because of the blinding light.  Then he came over to my passenger side and started yelling at me that I was supposed to just stop my car in traffic when I saw his sirens.  He was standing almost in the middle lane of traffic and I told him that it was not safe and I was terrified of him being hit in front of me and having nightmares the rest of my life about it.  Then it finally clicked for him how unsafe it was and he told me to follow his car, so he drove down the road ad I followed him into a gas station lot.  He then told me that I was driving recklessly, and not the other car that flew across three lanes, but he was going to do me a favor and knock it down to tail gating.  I usually don't bother fighting tickets if I know I am guilty, but this one I did go to court to fight and to also tell the story of how the cop put me and himself in a dangerous situation on the road.  I never did get to tell it though, as when my turn was up, the cop and the DA spoke to him and then my ticket was dismissed.  I guess he knew it was better for me not to say anything.

{"body":"I had a similar situation happen to me. I had just gotten into the first accident that was my fault. I had lightly tapped the back of a taxi, because my foot slipped while I was breaking. We were in a one-lane exit ramp and the taxi just... sat. We were blocking traffic, and a few cars started to attempt to drive around us. We were also right next a place where I regularly see homeless panhandling, about fifty yards from a strip club, and I had stopped riding my bike through that particular because of the creepy men who catcalled me. (And I'm not particular "sensitive". I work in clubs and bars, but these guys said scary things, like I shouldn't be out alone, and where my boyfriend was, etc). Frustrated at the taxi driver and the situation, I carefully pulled in front of him, waited, and drove slowly to a well-lit parking lot a little distance aways and waited for police to arrive. The officer arrived, was incredibly rude, asked if I was high MULTIPLE times although I showed no signs or symptoms of intoxication and was definitely sober. I didn't have a copy of my proof of insurance on me as it had been shipped to my moms house. He started to write me a ticket despite me telling him that I was insured and I just needed to call my mom. When she texted me a picture of my up-to-date insurance card, the officer got agitated, huffy, and silent but I figured the matter was resolved. I had traded insurance information with the taxi driver, talked to the owner of the company, and acknowledged that I knew the Arizona law required me to get a ticket for "Failure to Prevent an Accident". When I received it, however, it also included a citation for "Fleeing the scene", which meant that I had to go to court and could potentially receive a felony charge for a hit and run. Yes, a felony hit and run for an fender bender (with no visible damage) after waiting patiently for police to arrive.	Luckily, when I went to court, I explained the situation and they immediately dropped all charges. But I spent a month worrying about whether or not my future was ruined because some asshole with too much power was in a bad mood on a bad day.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MissArizona","name":"t1_cpz5lu2","parent_id":"t3_314z1z","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1428005071,"created_utc":1428001471}

Before he was right behind me I turned left onto a busy main street as that's the way I had to go anyway. The cop then got right behind me and I drove another 3/4 mile to a grocery store parking lot.

There are so many stories out there about women who have been killed by police or by people impersonating police.  Actually, it's not just women.  If I remember correctly, there was someone going around pulling people over and shooting them (regardless of gender) a year or so ago in Virginia(? I think?).

A temporary seizure of a person as to restrict their freedom of movement for a reasonable amount of time is a "detention". The charge of resisting arrest can only take place when the arrest is being physically performed by the officer .

{"body":"A similar incident happened to me in Ontario.  		I was at a stoplight at night.  The light was red my direction, and there was a police officer who had the green.  He didn't go for the first 5-6 seconds of his light, so I assumed he must be turning left and I just couldn't see the blinker (which was obscured from my angle).  I started to turn, and he immediately started through the intersection.  I stopped with more than enough space for him to proceed, but he stopped and waited for me to finish my turn (presumably so he could pull me over for almost turning into oncoming traffic).  		He then turned on his lights, but we were at a place in the road where oncoming traffic doesn't have visibility nor is there a shoulder to turn off.  So I tried to turn off to the closest parking lot to the left.  He then cut me off in the other lane and directed me back to the right.  At which point, I turned off another 1/4 mile on a side street off traffic.  The first five minutes of the stop he spent chastising me for essentially doing as I was taught in order to protect the police officer.  He, however, didn't ticket me or arrest me, presumably because my car wasn't stolen, I wasn't intoxicated and I didn't actually cut him off in traffic until he forced me to.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaplinatemyshoe","name":"t1_cpz2xdk","parent_id":"t3_314z1z","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1428000375,"created_utc":1427996775}

It was determined that custodial detentions require them, not temporary detentions to give a ticket.		Both are arrests, though.		Notice that "arrest" comes to us via Latin, then Old French and Middle English, with the original term meaning "to stop/remain".

{"body":">What a fucking stupid thing to say, she did nothing wrong in protecting herself and a male could surely have done the same thing if he didn't feel safe either.			##As much as I agree with the sentiment of moving to a well lit area here are a few factors to consider when pulled over. 			**1)** There is no legal requirement to open you door or step out of a vehicle when stopped unless asked to do so after grounds for stop are established, details are passed over and vice versa. 		Flashing lights with siren means pull over immediately.		Not 		 - unlock your doors		 - roll your window down		 - get out ready to walk a chalk line		 - you will be arrested	 	 - **Drive on for a little bit because you feel uneasy**		Only that you have to pull over immediately. 		Regardless of gender!			**2)** When an officer approaches the car you can then discus moving to a safer location on which the officer will escort you with lights on, no siren.			**3)** You can and are recommended to also request a badge number, the station that the officer is registered to and contact details. So you can also perform a check of ID on the officer as they are required by law to provide this information			**4)** An officer cannot ask you why you were stopped as this is soliciting an illegal admission of guilt.		*Either you were looking at your speedometer and not the road or you were unable to assess your speed accurately (as it is not an interview and they have not read you your Miranda rights this admission may be seen as creating grounds for a stop after the fact and that is illegal.)*  			**5)** They must tell you that (in order)		 - You have been stopped 		 - Why you have been stopped		 - Optional - Request a search		 - Optional - Provide reasonable grounds for the search. E.G.

{"body":"Perhaps I wasn't clear enough.  The only charge was a felony charge of resisting arrest.  There was no charge for her to resist arrest for.		If you can be charged with resisting arrest without being arrested prior to your resistance, then officers would not have to have legal justification to try and arrest anyone, they would just need people to resist, say by driving less than one mile down the road after acknowledging the sherriff by rolling down the window and waving, then turning on her hazards for the until she came to a stop in the parking lot less than a mile away?  (from the article: "Marshall acknowledged Good waved out her car window and turned on her flashers before pulling over less than a mile later in the store parking lot")		  None of that indicates resistance, so much as widely agreed on protocol for lone female drivers, as often taught by police officers themselves.  But by calling that resistance to a non-existent arrest, this officer created a reason to arrest her, and thus call her previous actions resistance.  There must be a arrest to resist BEFORE a person can be charged with resisting arrest.  At best, he could issue a further fine for failing to yield to emergency vehicles; this is also not a traffic infraction punishable with arrest either, according to Indiana state laws.		TLDR: A *lawful* arrest must precede any charge of resistance to said arrest, Citizens actually have the legal right to resist being arrested *unlawfully*, such as when there is no actual crime for which they could be charged. Such lawful resistance, supported by the Court of Indiana and the Supreme court, is not cause for lawful arrest.		Class C infractions, such a failure to yield to emergency vehicles or speeding infractions, are not by punishable by arrest.  So he charged her with a felony for "resisting" an arrest he could never have made in the first place.  Essentially, he invented a justification to arrest her and charge her with a felony, rather than a pricy ticket and a lecture on not speeding and possibly, the protocol of calling to let dispatch know she was driving down the road to pull over.		This officer taunted her at the station with threats of further charges for controlled substances: for fucking *Tylenol*.

{"body":"My understanding (and this is only anecdotal from speaking to cops on my campus), is that when they initially signal you to pull over they are making contact with whomever over the radio and relaying their location so that if something goes horribly wrong, other officers can come to assist. If they let people know where they are at and then have to follow you while you find a good place to pull over it makes it harder for other officers to react in a bad situation.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jrakosi","name":"t1_cpyukze","parent_id":"t1_cpyuexi","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427986320,"created_utc":1427982720}

{"body":"That MIGHT actually make sense if there was some sort of evidence to support why she would feel this way. Were there reports of that kind of thing occurring in the area? I can understand someone being suspicious of a Police Officer who doesn't look legit, but the difference here is she just decided to not pull over because she felt that wasn't safe. Well, if it had been someone impersonating a police officer that would be a good plan; however, that isn't an excuse. Case law has supported that a Police Officer's uniform should still be enough to convince a regular and prudent person of his/her position. I can't just shrug off lawful orders from the Police and later just say I wasn't convinced they were real police. It doesn't work that way. If it did, people would just run every time the Police stopped them stating they thought they were impostors.		You don't know what the Officer knew on top of her not pulling over to raise his suspicion either. Perhaps she has been charged multiple times for drug possession? Maybe she has weapons offences in her past? All of which could have been found when the Officer ran her plate. It's very easy to just assume he was being an asshole, but there may be more to it than that.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bosco14","name":"t1_cpyrwwn","parent_id":"t1_cpyrn17","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427979348,"created_utc":1427975748}

If that was the case the sheriff department would've included that information with the statement of backing their cop. The fact that isn't public makes it very likely your situation is not applicable here. 		Being that the department had told the citizens to stop in a well lit area if getting pulled over but your not sure of the vehicle behind you is official.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sockmess","name":"t1_cpyssh6","parent_id":"t1_cpyrwwn","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1427982076,"created_utc":1427978476}
