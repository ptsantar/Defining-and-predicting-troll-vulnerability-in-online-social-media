I don't blame them...		* This spying programs has [systematically degraded US cybersecurity](http://time.com/2966463/nsa-spying-surveillance-cybersecurity-privacy-advocates-schneier/).  By putting backdoors in everything they've made only the NSA stronger and every technological device weaker.		* The spying program [is unconstitutional](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/16/justice/nsa-surveillance-court-ruling/) and [illegal](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html).		* The author of the Patriot Act [did not intend for this use](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/11/patriot-act-author-there-has-been-a-failure-of-oversight/).		* James Clapper, then the director of the NSA, [lied to Congress under oath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsmo0hUWJ08).

That said, I worked on numerous political campaigns and this is a pretty conventional, well-known rule of thumb that has a pretty solid logic behind it. Let me summarize it for your benefit: 		- Mass emails are shit. 	- Individual emails are less shit but still irrelevant.	- Social media is a gray area. It is considered less effective than emails or letters, but has higher visibility and tends to permanently stick around. Can be manipulated for the purposes of public relations and branding, and can easily be used to make the jump to media. This is often used to manipulate public sentiments and create momentum for issues, or just use the channels to create mass panic, anger, etc...	- Written letters are ok, especially if they are individualized, rather than copied as part of a mass campaign. (Why? Because they are easily reproduced and emailed by organizers instead of individuals.)	- Phone calls are jarring, jarring enough for political actors to pay attention, because the effort to call someone up, rather than write a note means that you're pissed off and proactive. 		In other words, the hierarchy in terms of importance of how you communicate with your political representatives, is simply ranked based on personal effort and public visibility.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"manwhocried","name":"t1_crohwpu","parent_id":"t1_crn27iq","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432877959,"created_utc":1432874359}

{"body":"Oh, I agree. The US started looking into Iraq again the moment Saddaam nationalized his oil supply. Now, if you look at the Iraqi oil fields it's been taken over by the likes of Exxon, BP, Chevron, etc. 		Now, do I believe the motive was purely oil? No. We'd kicked their asses back in '91 under HW Bush (most lopsided war in history, 292 Americans killed in return for 20-35,000 Iraq troops killed) and in the *conventional* war in 2003, we kicked their asses again (139 Americans and 33 British killed against around 30,000 Iraq troops killed and *only* 7,000 Iraqi citizens killed). We probably thought it would be a quick and easy war where we'd go in, wreck Saddam's conventional forces, topple his regime, and install a US-friendly puppet. If it had worked, Bush would be hailed as a hero. 		And all WMD circlejerk aside, remember how close the Iraqis were to a nuclear weapon before the Israelis wiped out Osiraq. Even though they got international criticism, everyone breathed a sigh of relief that the Israelis had the balls to go do it. 		Bill Clinton: "Everybody talks about what the Israelis did at Osiraq, in 1981, which, I think, in retrospect, was a really good thing. You know, it kept Saddam from developing nuclear power."		Louis Beres, a researcher at Purdue: "Had it not been for the brilliant raid at Osiraq, Saddam's forces might have been equipped with atomic warheads in 1991."		Hell, even Saddam had a few things to say about it: "Once Iraq walks out victorious [over Iran], there will not be any Israel."		"Technically, they [the Israelis] are right in all of their attempts to harm Iraq."		Iraqi scientist defector: "And they get scared and bombed it out. Actually it was much less than this, and it would have taken a much longer time. But the program we built later in secret would make six bombs a year."		Alright, I digress. But the point is, oil is simply one of the (and one of the largest) myriad of reasons we went into Iraq. Saddam was clearly commiting human rights violations left and right (using WMDs on his own people, for instance, and look up Uday Hussein's treatment of the Iraqi national soccer team) and was looking to securing over 50% of the world's oil supply by taking Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Looking back, I believe the decision to go into Iraq was the right choice.		It was the handling of the *occupation* where we messed up. We disbanded the Iraqi army and banned the Ba'ath party, the only source of real authority in the government. We set the people against us with the Green Zone and overall mismanagement of resources. *That* was where we fucked up.

{"body":"I realize the current war was not purely about oil and in 91 it was about destroying their military. There is a lot more about Iraq/Kuwait than most people know. Kuwait was stealing oil using slant oil wells that went into Iraq's reserves. All the big players said it was between the 2 of them. The manipulators wanted the results they got. Iraq's military was destroyed.  	You don't mention the Shiite/Sunni divide and how we've taken sides in that because of the power the Sheiks have in our gov, through their wealth. Or how that divide is a big cause of ISIS, the Taliban and most other Sunni funded groups. It is the Sunni's who caused 9/11 and most other Arab based terrorist attacks. It is also the Sunni side we have taken in their religious war. Once again, because of their oil money buying our gov.  	And using Israel as an example is bad form imo. They are the aggressors and we do not hold others to the same litmus paper we hold them to. Israel can have nukes, but no one else in the region. Having and using them are also 2 different things. Pakistan has them and they are one of the most unstable, terrorist funding  govs in the world. But they know, using them is the end of their country. Same for India and even Iran if they get one. What we don't like is nukes prevent other countries from attacking them. Being a bully is only effective until your victims get guns. Nukes on the global scale are based on the same reasoning the CCW groups use to allow them to carry guns. They are for their protection against aggressors.  	I also do not buy that Israel deserves or should have gotten Israel based on biblical text. "Our sky God says this is our land" being taken as legit is Monty Pythonish to me. Giving them a country is fine, but make it some place they actually currently live and have a population. Not in the backyard of their adversaries. Maybe England could have given them land, or the US, or even Germany since they were the most recent gov who wanted to wipe them out. Germany could have been forced to provide land for Jews, Gypsies and any other native group they wanted to kill off.  	I also believe there is irrefutable proof that about 90% of our wars/police actions we've been involved in, were to protect our access to resources in that region/country. About 9% were to protect strategic locations, and 1% were legit and used to knock down an aggressor with regional ambitions. Propaganda wise, it was always to protect the people or our allies.  	And to finish up with, The Project for the New American Century wrote the blueprint we are still following, in the mid 90's. Our 2 party system is not democracy. Funding our election system with money from the powerful only helps the powerful. We are an oligarhy under the guise of a democracy.  	I'm also not saying it is right or wrong.

We being oligarchs from the west. And the pipeline is moving along quite nicely now.  	Yes, it is wrong to overthrow govs, as we've done throughout S. and C. America to protect companies like United Fruit. We purport to stand for freedom and human rights, which is window dressing. We support the most viscous dictators around the world and ridicule democratic countries who won't allow us to have their resources for pennies on the dollar. Look at countries like Dominican Republic and Haiti or Honduras and Panama, or Columbia and Chile. What kind of  life have we created for all but a few in those countries? These are countries we either put leaders in power or greatly influenced who was in power. We got sweet heart deals for their resources by lining the pockets of a few people. Now any future gov who challenges those long term corrupt and unfair deals is made a pariah. How our power manifested itself throughout the region, and continues to, shows our true colors. As does our silence about the sheiks behavior in the middle east. If we came right out and said, we're like China or Russia and we care more about the resources and strategic value of  a country than the people of the world, I would not have an argument. But when we hold ourselves up as the beacon of democracy and high regard for human rights, we also can't begrudge people who show the hypocrisy of what amounts to our Corporate Statement/Pledge.  	Democracy comes in many forms. It just means elected government, at its most base definition. As a republic, we do not have mob rules. Our system of checks and balances through the division of power is supposed to protect us from dictators.  We have a basis of laws that protects all equally. Well except slaves when we were created as a nation. Or gays now. And others in between; women, laborers, kids, fringe religions, etc. I can't think of any pure democracy where people vote on anchor laws every cycle. There are republics, parliament monarchies, theocracies, socialist, and all sorts of other flavors of democracy. Mob rule democracy is not something I am aware of in the world now or historically so I do not know what you mean by ???pure??? democracy.  	Yes, our country offers many opportunities. But Jose Mujica in Uruguay achieved the same thing from a lesser background. All throughout the world people are able to live their dreams. But if you are already born on 3rd base, your opportunities are far greater. I live in a city known for its bars and restaurants.

{"body":"I agree, I think from the near site we are within degrees of each other. It's as we get out to the edge that the differences are more noticeable,  	Terrorism is the modern day communism. It's a catch all to justify our actions. War is profit. Huge profit. Eisenhower made a statement about the military industrial complex, that I am sure you are aware of, based on the breadth of knowledge you've shown. Even during the birth of England, France, Spain, Russia, etc., factions within the barony and church guided their actions as much as the kings or queens. Even in China, Japan, etc with their warlords. It was also not unusual for other countries to influence the politics of another. The East India Trade Company is a great example how private industry started influencing governments as well, once democracies overtook monarchies.  	Can you provide any examples now or in the past of this real democracy or pure democracy you feel is the standard and not based on set laws, where all laws are voted on by every citizen instead of elected officials? Democracies are governments elected by the people. The whole concept of a democracy is all citizens elect representatives who are supposed to follow the will of the people. Democracy does not mean every rule and law is passed by every citizen each election cycle. We would not need elected officials in this pure democracy you reference as all decisions would be made by each of us through voting. I don't think even a utopian view of democracy is what I think you define democracy as and is certainly not any definition I ever heard in any poli-sci or gov classes in college or before. It's almost the angle I read from anarchists; no gov, we can make all decisions as individuals and don't need gov defined structures.  	I imagine both our views are much more nuanced than what we can get across on reddit. I really think we are both over simplifying the issue to fit within a post too, when there are hundreds of page papers written about what we are talking about, from all angles. I agree with those who feel we could have done the same thing the west did after WWII, to the countries in S and C America as well as Mexico. We could have built modern industry and had people get paid enough to build a middle class, which is the cornerstone of any country. Japan and Germany both have very strong economies with a balanced middle class. Instead we chose to support the oligarchs and allow the average citizen to get crapped on for our benefit. So we can have cheap fruit, oil, minerals, and any other resource they have that we need.  	And even this is a massive oversimplification. Japanese and German society is far more structured than anything in S or C America or most parts of Africa or the middle east. The priorities, cultural values, work ethics and many other things have an impact as well. And once again, have hundreds of papers from all angles.  	I've enjoyed reading your views and it made me think and investigate and question some of my facts/beliefs/opinions in more detail. Often what we want to believe is different than the facts. We are all good at using cognitive dissonance to see the world the way we want. Sometimes we need to verify the things we want to believe even more than the things we don't want to believe. It's so easy to accept faulty data when it's the data that matches our views.  	I use news sources that have been proven accurate to me over the years. Many news sources followed the gov line about Iraq, Iran Contra, 9/11, etc. or about GMO foods, radiating our food supply, industrial farms, raw sewage being used as fertilizer, toxins killing birds, bees, etc.  A few were telling us the truth. The sources that lied about each, are pretty consistent and some only told the truth about some things and not others. It seems like most people continue to use sources that have repeatedly distorted reality. Not only leaving them less informed, but even worse, misinformed But it's a distortion that matches their beliefs, so they continue to read and watch their Washington Times, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, etc. The lies they have been told, do not trump the worldview they want to maintain. I personally believe very little the corporations tell me through their newspapers and other media. We are a long way from a Walter Cronkite or  newspapers that investigate and publish stories about the little guy being stepped on by the big guy. Our media now represents the big guys. The little guy does not have a voice that can be heard through the trees. By no means, do I have the lock on truth or how to provide world, let alone national  'best methods' to govern the masses in a dog eat dog world. Facts not based on pure science are like a huge disco ball sending facts from thousands of different mirrors. We find the ones that match our view, or construct our view from a few cherry picked facts that match our greater view. I grew up hunting and fishing. I love nature, being outside, getting my own meal from the land and water. I despise what is being done to nature to benefit a few, with protections that prove faulty time and time again. Protections often written by the lobbyists, for the few. This view makes me believe corporate malfeasance involving the environment, when I read about it, without the usual verification of facts. There are too many past examples of it happening and being whitewashed or swept under the rug as soon as possible. I believe powerful industry, led by what are for all practical purposes; oligarchs, use our military and intelligence services to protect their interests overseas through the power their money has on our gov. This doesn't preclude WWI and WWII when we went in to stop Allied/Central Powers, or Korea against Russia and China. (That whole Russia China ???alliance??? after WWII is very interesting to read about. They were not the most trusting of allies or working toward the same goals.) All 3 are much more complicated than the fairy tales and fables we are fed, but if you don't protect your allies, you diminish your power in the world.  	There are actually a lot of good authors that use the early19th century to the mid 60's in Asia as their settings. It's also a region I visit and try to stay up on current news.  I've watched what our economic and trade policies have done for the few, and what they've done to our job market and our middle class. When I read about a new economic or trade policy written by the same people who have given us the same thing over and over, I don't believe a word they say. I've already heard their distortions and fantasies for the last 20+ years. I've seen who they benefit. I'm lucky, my wife is lucky, my 2 kids are lucky. We've never had a major injury or sickness. We work in the fields we went to school for. We've never been unemployed. All but my wife have 4 years degrees with no student loans. We all have supplemented medical through work and decent benefits. But I know so many people who have a lot of skills, worked hard and still saw their jobs leave when their employers moved to a free trade, low wage country. I have a lot of strong protectionist views.  	These and other life experiences, education and readings have colored my view of the world. I'm ignorant about far more than I am knowledgeable about. People consider the word ignorant to be a negative term, but we are all ignorant about many things. I know virtually nothing about brain surgery, rocket science, astronomy, physics or most advanced sciences. My level of ignorance about those subjects is vast. I'm a news hound and enjoy researching topics I become interested in. I enjoy current events around the world. I like following the money to understand a main facet driving war, or allowing and even supporting such short term thinking about the environment and the profit some can suck from it in the short term, with no regard for the very long term ecological cost. 	I 'm also a war gaming fan from the old Avalon Hill games like Squad Leader, and Eastern and Western Front. and miniature battle recreations in GameCons. Now I enjoy games like EU3 and SPWINWW2 (A remake and expansion of the old Gary Grigsby Steel Panthers.) because they are more playable from the same computer or internal network and don't require all the setup. From a purely strategic angle, my view changes quite a bit about our global actions. No games can recreate the global fencing between nations and religious, racial, and philosophical differences creating variables in regional and global plans. Plus there is the influence of all sorts of special interest groups and individuals within a nation on their economy and relations with other nations. The global economy and banking system, religious extremism, nationalism, environment vs growth in the 3rd world, are all subjects that we could study and read thousands of papers on from experts explaining a variety of problems and their solutions. Each facet from that disco ball is worth a discussion like we've had.

Terrorism has no chance of wiping out the US like communism could.		As for the pure democracy point, it's simply the pure basis behind democracy: the *people* control the government, not anything/one else. In a true, pure democracy, the people would vote and make the decisions on absolutely *everything,* from war to treaties to military contracts. The closest humanity has been to a true democracy would be Ancient Greece, where all the electorate met to vote on major issues (read: wealthy male landowners). Even they had elected leaders to make decisions for them. 		I also admire your views on ignorance - if only more people in the world admitted they don't know some things, we might be in a better place. Instead, we have a nation full of people who *think* they know everything when in reality they know very little. 		I believe that news sources are reliable sources for *raw* news. I tend to ignore their analysis entirely, coming to my own conclusions rather than what the pundits or authors will say. Of course, sometimes I find myself agreeing with said pundits, but more often than not I simply switch to another channel the moment some political hack start babbling about Benghazi or Deflategate. 		I also like to think that the media has *never* been for either the little or big guy. Until Tet the media blindly supported the government regarding Vietnam; the moment they saw images and video that could be sensationalized into profits, they turned against the government and jump-started the anti-war effort. The same now; after Desert Storm/Shield and the initial 2003 invasion, the media absolutely adored Bush and the war effort. Carefully scripted media releases from the president and frontline reporters were able to truly capture the enormous one-sidedness of the war (something like 130 Americans died in return for 30,000 Iraqi troop casualties). Then, as soon as the insurgency started, as soon as the IED started blowing things up, as soon as we inspected the nation and found no nukes, the media turned against the government and Bush. The media is only for one thing, and that is profit. 		I am optimistic about the future. America is slowly but steadily transitioning into the modern world, starting with free healthcare and banning of mass surveillance on our citizens. Of course, I really can't fault the NSA for reading the phones of citizens of other nations.

{"body":"Regarding communism, read about why the New Deal was made and the strength the socialists were gaining across the US at the time. Look at how workers were being treated. Look at the consolidation of wealth. We were Bangladesh in a land of supposed freedom and equality. Communism was only a threat because people wanted to share in the wealth they created through their labor. It wasn't a communist plot as much as it was the industrialists wanting to live like European royalty treating their workers like peasants. Creating laws to protect workers and provide some basic care for all citizens saved our nation. Preventing them from becoming peasants under the industrialists instead of peasants under a communist government was a major turning point in our history and gets very little discussion in the history books we use in school.  	I am somewhat amused by you saying the best pure democracy you can think of, restricted the voting to a very small group of people; the owner class. I guess some of the tribes making up the Iroquois confederacy were the closest I can think of. Almost all people had a say in important decisions affecting the tribe, and pretty much the freedom to do what they wanted as individuals.  	Even then, they had to have someone representing them in cross tribal meetings.  	In one of my media classes we talked about how it was not even the angle reporters put on a story, but what stories they are given to write about that affected what news we read. It's why the OWS movement got so little attention. What the movement represented was a direct assault on the status quo. Our police force does what it always does in times of struggle, represent the government. They are not the protector of the people. They are the protectors of the status quo. As are the corporate sources of news.  	In a poli sci class I had, they talked about how you can see the true interests and driving forces of a government by looking at who the laws are written to protect. Labor laws, environmental laws, laws for legal recourse against injury and damages, trade laws, regulations to protect free enterprise or monopolies. How did the law work for a black guy in the south until the 50's-60's? The new trade agreements are written in such a way that the trade laws will supersede local and national laws and disputes are handled through the trade courts, not the courts of the nations. Who are those laws written for?  	When WWII started Hearst and a few others controlled a large segment of the news most people read in the cities. Many of them were supporting the fascist ideals of Hitler. Many of our most powerful leaders of industry supported Germany. A general actually told the president about a plot the industrialists and military leaders had to grab power and ally with Germany. It's an extremely interesting piece of history to explore in depth. One of the first things any revolutionaries or conquerors want to do is control the information. If you investigate their attempt to grab power in the US, read what the media owners who were part of the plot were writing in their papers. And then reconsider the unbiased media ideal. 	Iraq is the best recent example. When the war drums were being pounded, most of my sources of information were calling them on their lies. The mainstream corporate media were banging the drums with really good stories and images. And our first videos of guided missiles for even better show. Now, it's Oh if we had only known then. Or well, it really had to be done at some point.  	An expansionist Israel, The Sunni/Shia civil war, our choosing sides in the civil war and the location of some of the best crude oil on the planet are the 4 main causes of the tinderbox over there. And lurking in the background, Russia and China provide military and technical materials and knowledge to Syria, Iran, India and others in the region. Our propaganda does not fly with the leaders in China and Russia. They know the truth, not the distortions we are told. They know why we have an issue with Iran. They know why we support the sheiks and Israel and they knew why we went into Iraq both times. As do the leaders in Europe, and most of the rest of the world. They provide their own propaganda, designed for their country.  	And yes, the beginning of our invasion of Iraq was easy. As I said before, Kuwait was side drilling into Iraq's reserves. Iraq went to the US since we were allies for both. We told them it was a middle east affair. They went to the regional Arab states group who told them it was an argument between them. Iraq then told everyone they were going to attack and nationalize Kuwait, yada yada. Everyone sat back and watched Iraq build up their forces for a few weeks. Lines of tanks, jets in advanced bases, infantry spread out in a line. All ready for the invasion. If the US did not want Iraq to attack Kuwait, they only had to send one company or even a division to make it a firm line in the sand. A marine company can be in place in most places in the Middle East in under 24 hours and probably a light division as well. Attack this line and you are attacking the US. There was a fair amount of discussion about this at the time in military journals. What Saddam did not know was our alliance was over and we were going to destroy his military once he got them all lined up nicely for our advanced aircraft and guided missiles. Pre-made for incredible kill numbers and a great show of force at home and around the world. Threat against Israel from Iraq brought from an annoyance to nothing in the blink of an eye. Saddam's response, cancel the oil contracts with the west and give them to Russia and China. The west's response, re-invade and put someone in power who gave the contracts back.  	I worry about our future when we are sending all of our jobs overseas. Kids can't find jobs and our middle class is shrinking. Wealth is being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. We're allowing big money to have more and more influence on our elections. Through the 70's most improvements in productivity gave almost equal growth in wages across the board. Now those productivity increases go to the top with greater and greater difference between wages at the top and bottom. The elite don't care about countries. The top 1% lives pretty much the same all over the world. They actually have it better in the 3rd world because of how cheap it is to hire people. Not even counting land, you can build a huge royal estate in India for way under 10% of what it would cost you in the spoiled west where people aren't willing to work hard for reasonable pay. Notice the sarcasm at the end. I think it is extremely unwise to move all of our manufacturing and sharing of advanced technical knowledge with our global adversaries like we are with China. We are destroying our environment. I can't hunt what I used to hunt because we have turned 80% of our farmland into subdivisions. I can't fish where I used to because the rivers have become too poisoned to have healthy populations. I have to drive N of Lake Superior from where I am to catch fish like I did 25 years ago or drive to the Dakotas to hunt bird like I used to. My kids are having kids now and I wonder what the world will be like in 25 more years.  	I'd like to see our 2 party system end. To achieve that, we would have to form gov's from multiple party's like many democracies throughout Europe and around the world. A 2 party system is inherently adversarial, which makes sense since our rules are written by lawyers. When your only tool is a hammer, all problems look like a nail. Their system is purely adversarial. I'd like to see a national or state holiday for all elections and make our voting far more secure and easier to do. I'd like to see elections with no outside money influencing them. We own or regulate the airwaves and cable/cellular bands, we can require all media airing on those airwaves (including cable) to offer free time for debates and limited air time for them to explain their views in their own setting. I'd like to see a company like Shell fined so hard for hard for their environmental and safety incompetence that bankrupt people up and down the coast that it jails some and nearly bankrupts them. The cost of not protecting the environment has to be so high, that they put extreme effort into preventing it. As long as we only slap their hands, they will continue to do it. Until we slap them so hard with fines, things like this will continue to happen. As long as the rules and regulations are written in such a way that we protect them over us, it will continue to happen. I think we should find key industries that employ a lot of skilled and hard working people and protect those industries through our trade policies. I think we should promote other countries to make the goods that don't fall in those categories. I think with our ingenuity and work ethic, we should have a positive trade balance with the rest of the world. People around the world love our stuff. Which is really just our brands and many of those brands are not even made in the US anymore. Which is why we have such a trade deficit. We import almost as much oil as we export. We export far more refined petroleum products than we import, so it is not our energy and fuel needs that cause our deficits. It's because 80+% of what we own is made in Asia. It seems like most people have jobs either moving or selling products made somewhere else. Our service based economy of the future supposedly. It makes for a very top heavy economy benefiting global oligarchs with national loyalty being nothing more than a coin to use at the bargaining table. I think we should find strong allies in key locations around the world, treat them right, press for a gov where the people feel they are treated right and have a strong middle class to increase national stability and help them build the infrastructure to help them achieve that.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JorgeXMcKie","name":"t1_crknoq4","parent_id":"t1_crkc3sr","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432593102,"created_utc":1432589502}

{"body":"As much as the liquid rules might not help anything, you shouldn't argue against them using reasons such as "I am obviously not a terrorist".  IF there is going to be security THEN it must be consistent and applied to everyone.		Let's start with the assumption that there are dangerous liquids we want to keep out of airplanes (we can argue against that separately).		They don't know you or your intentions.  They only know that you are passing through a security checkpoint with a liquid that "could" be dangerous.  The simplest thing is to not let you through with that liquid.		Why should they let it through unless you can prove that it is safe?  If they let in your soda because you *claimed* it was from a store and you took it on another flight is not a good reason.  Imagine the state of security if they simply trusted you on your word about what you are carrying.		Them - "Do you have a bomb?"		You - "No"		Them - "Well then come on in sir"		Would you trust that?		They could test every liquid that passes through to see if it is what it claims to be.  Imagine a "soda test" for each bottle going through.  That would be a nightmare and cause security checkpoints to be even slower.  I don't think anyone wants that.		The same goes for the girl's makeup.  IF you believe (which they do) that it could contain a dangerous substance that could destroy the plane and believe that that people want to take this on planes (which they do believe) then you must treat ALL pastes and liquids the same.  You can't just let it through because she is 14 or crying.  Who is to say that her parents or teacher isn't a terrorist and forcing them to carry makeup bomb material onto the plane?  There are any number of ways to take advantage of such a soft rule.		You have to apply the security equally to everyone because any hole in security will be exploited.  This is why I think the "you can keep your coat on if you are a child or elderly" is a stupid rule because then IF I wanted to carry illegal materials in a coat I would put it on an old person.		That said, I think the security theatre is a joke.  The threat from liquids is overblown and isn't even consistently secured.  You can take a 1 litre bag of 100mL bottles on the plane.  So you can, yourself, take up to 1L of dangerous liquids on the plane with you, but not a water bottle.  That is not to mention that you could work with a team and get 10 or 20 litres of fluid past the security checkpoint. 		So if we are going to argue against it, argue against inconsistent security or pointless security, don't argue that it should be made even more inconsistent.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"poco","name":"t1_crhqe01","parent_id":"t1_crheux0","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432326778,"created_utc":1432323178}

{"body":"I always see people complaining about the restrictions on liquids that came about after the 2006 liquid explosives plot that happened in London. Honestly, I feel that people don't realize that the rule is actually meant to protect us. While that may not be true for other rules, I feel that the liquid restrictions are actually meant to protect. I was vacationing in Europe in the summer of 2006, and we were in Heathrow Airport on our way home. Our flight was from Heathrow to JFK, then to SFO, on August 9th, 2006. This just happened to be the day that the British police made 24 arrests in connection to the threat. For my family and our travel group, it meant that our flights were cancelled for the next 3 days. I remember heading from security towards our flight's gate, when a full squad of British Special Forces in full combat gear stormed down the hall and right towards our gate. We were then ushered by security guards away from the gate and out of the airport. In a matter of minutes the entire airport seemed to be on lockdown. It was only later that we learned that our flight was one that had been targeted by a suicide attack. It really put things into perspective for me, and I realized how class I was to actually dying. Ever since then, I've learned to be more accepting of the inconveniences of flying.

Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water itself.

{"body":"Your ridiculous there are far more addicting things that are legal now like alcohol and cigarettes, caffine, and  long long lists of others. Do you know what an alchoholic will do to keep his high going? Probably not because they can walk to the store and buy a six pack and a pack of smokes for less than 10 dollars. They can go to work and not be fired as long as they arent drunk at the time so consequently they can make money to buy more alchohol when they want it. The artificial scarcity of a black market just means it's less accessible to those who want it so they will go to greater lengths to get it. You think you can regulate crime away but you can't. The justice system serves to arbitrate revenge an idea of doling justice which is entirely a system to prevent un ending clan warfare not to prevent crime. Go back to the foundation of society when the whole idea of justice was created and it was evident. As for your speed limit idea you would have to prove that more people would speed if there weren't speed limit laws along with proving that the higher average speed decided by motorists are responsible for more deaths which is only an obvious answer from looking at the surface of the problem. Anyone who drives regularly will tell you everyone on the road basically just drives the speed they are comfortable with. Consequently you end up with a distribution of people driving slower and people driving higher with a median that's usually higher than the speed limit anyway. The correct limits for the roads are the ones that match the average speeds of the drivers driving the road under a certain set of conditions. The sign as it is is basically a waste of time along with a way for a city/government to collect revenue and doesn't actually prevent anyone from doing anything as is apparent just by driving down the street almost anywhere. If you killed someone there are already laws which would arbitrate revenge for the family of the person you killed.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AnthraxAlex","name":"t1_crhu4sn","parent_id":"t1_crhtdwt","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432333192,"created_utc":1432329592}

{"body":"Hi All,		If you aren't familiar with the Patriot Act (or specifically Section 215) please take a look at the NYTimes article on the topic: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html?_r=0		For those familiar and who wish to repeal the Patriot Act, please call your senators and urge for them to let the sun set on an illegal act that does **not** perform it's stated goal. 		I've taken a moment to write a longer script but if you wish to use an abbreviated one, I've provided you with Fight215.org's. 		Long: 	> INTRO: Hello, I would like to share a few concerns regarding the upcoming vote on the Patriot Act extensions with my elected officials: 			> Please repeal the Patriot Act ??? Mass Surveillance of Americans and Foreigners was a widely misconstrued intent of the laws that Congress has passed, even the primary author of the Patriot Act, representative Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc has said that neither he nor anyone else imagined the law would be used for bulk domestic surveillance. 		> **QUOTE: ???How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation????**		> More recently, 		> In a 97-page ruling, a three-judge panel for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a provision of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, known as Section 215, cannot be legitimately interpreted to allow the bulk collection of domestic calling records.		>  If given enough time, more programs under the Patriot Act will likely be interpreted similarly illegal.		> The Senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell says:	> 	  **QUOTE: 	???Section 215 helps us find a needle in the haystack,??? he said. ???But under the U.S.A. Freedom Act, there might not be a haystack at all.???**		> Despite more than 60% of Americans wanting to see mass surveillance reformed or ended. 		> Supporters of Mass Surveillance say it keeps us safe. The problem is that is an allegation, not a fact- and there is no evidence at all to support that claim. In fact, a White House review with unrestricted access to classified information found that not only is mass surveillance illegal, it has never made a concrete difference in even one terrorism investigation.  			> Our intelligence agencies for years have touted their successes in dubiously legal areas such as the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, torturing individuals under mere allegation - as well as the NSA's Tailored Access Operations whose clandestine goal of 'Collecting it All' has implanted servers and impregnated routers with malicious code, designed to facilitate their goals of (in their words): 'Sniff It All, Collect It All, Know It All, Process It All, Exploit It All'.  			> The intelligence agencies have operated outside the law before in the past, for example the FBI program COINTELPRO in the 1960s and 1970s surveilled tens of thousands, if not more individuals who had not broken the law with the intention of violating their first amendment rights.  	 		> **QUOTE: Senator Frank Church Observed: ???The unexpressed major premise of much of COINTELPRO is that the Bureau has a role in maintaining the existing social order, and that its efforts should be aimed toward combating those who threaten that order."**		> In 1975, Senator Frank Church, Chair of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities issued this ominous warning:		> **QUOTE:  	???The United States Government has perfected the technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air.. That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything- telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide.???**			> Today, there is no place to hide and supporters of the Patriot Act wish to keep it that way, not for the stated mission of 'Protecting American Lives' of which it has saved none, but for the stated mission of Continuously monitoring all living entities 'pattern of life' details and should the individual pose a threat to the social order, they can and have been targeted.  			> I ask you please do not support Tyranny, what makes this country great is the ability to have checks and balances on government overreach, not a blank check for them. Please stand up to the intelligence agencies which pressure your hand to support their illegal and immoral programs that jeopardize American standing worldwide and at home.		> Thank you		Short:	> Hi,		> I???m one of your constituents, and I???m calling to urge you to end the NSA???s unconstitutional mass surveillance under the Patriot Act and vote no on S. 1035, a bill that would extend expiring portions of the Patriot Act until 2020.		> NSA surveillance illegally invades my privacy, along with millions of other innocent people, without making me safer.		https://fight215.org/ for more info!","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"balancetheuniverse","name":"t1_crhge30","parent_id":"t3_36v8l2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432308527,"created_utc":1432304927}
