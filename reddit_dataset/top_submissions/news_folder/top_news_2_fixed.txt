{"body":"There is a psychological study that shows a link between hardcore church going people, and being a dick.  It's been years since I read the study but the basic premise was that the person felt so good about their religion and the work they do for their church that they think it is ok to be an asshole.  Even if their contribution to the church is minimal.		I don't know if you go to church or not, but sometimes you can see that behavior at a smaller scale.  For instance at my girlfriends church the lady that plays piano is extremely judgemental of other people.		Now I'm not saying this is the explanation for the phenomenon.  The study I read said that it required more testing and analysis.  As for why it seems like a large portion of Mormons are corrupt, it could be because Mormons tend to always be under the microscope.  If you think about all the people you had worked with I doubt you could name whatever brand of Christianity or religion each and everyone of them was.  However, I bet you could point out the Mormons.  They either told you their religion during conversation, or more likely it came up when the discussion of alcohol or caffeine came up.  Then once you found out they were mormon you held on to that information because for some reason we have a bigger fascination with the comings and goings of a mormon than we do a protestant or a baptist.  Basically the only thing that would have been weirder is if you had found our they were jehova's witnesses.		So now when you see a mormon do something unethical it sticks out in your mind more.  "Mormons are supposed to be these super nice people and this dude just fucked over a lot of people."  Where a person who you don't know their religion does the same thing it doesn't stick out as much because it isn't that glaring.  You are also less likely to stitch together "protestants are unethical" because most protestants don't advertise their religion like mormons.		Just spit Ballin some ideas here.

{"body":"I doubt it is that.	You'll find similar things in other religious communities (I'm from the Islamic community).		I don't know if it's so much of an entitlement, like it says to scam the others.		I think it has more to do with the following:		1. The idea that because they belong to the religion, they are 'good'. All these earthly things pale in comparison. 		2. It might not be them, but you. In the sense that they might give the appearance of being holy/giving... This gives you a double take when they do scams, because of the duplicity involved. It's the same double take people took decades ago when priests were caught fucking children. It's not that there aren't non-priest pedophiles/rapists. It's the duplicity of it all. It wasn't that long ago, the church would be the last place you'd think your child was in danger. I grew up overseas near madrassas and dar ul ums, and the amount of fucked up shit that happens there is insane. Parents think they are sending their kids to get right in these places. I personally know of many cases the kids are being raped. Not to mention all the stories...	But again the point here is it could simply be your misconception. You are more turned off by the duplicity of it, than by the actual actions.	Afterall, a wallstreet asshole is a wallstreet asshole. 		3. They really do suffer some kind of cognitive dissonance. It does take its toll on your living in a religious community. You have to give a constant appearance of being extra good. And that can screw with your brain when you as a person might selfish/dishonest... You can often end up doing worse things than other people, and still think you're righteous. I'm boggled by these people, but I know enough of them. They wouldn't be as bad if they could actually just admit they are simply selfish, but because they can't, they never deal with that feeling and end up doing worse things.		You can see the same thing in many ideologies (communism, nazism, capitalism...). People end up doing worse things, when they can't admit their humanity. Republicans rant about the free market, responsibility, rights... while a lot of it is just greed. Socialists/public sector unions rant about labor rights... while a lot of it is just greed for themselves.  Rarely do any of these groups care about society as a whole or the poor. Which is fine, but often, they never deal with their own humanity and keep thinking they are righteous. This leads them to worse actions than someone who is willing to admit their are greedy/selfish...		Again, not saying there aren't valid ideologies. I'm talking about the people in them who don't deal with their humanity.			//off to work.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"scamper_22","name":"t1_crf5yrd","parent_id":"t1_creuzug","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432131726,"created_utc":1432128126}

{"body":"Here's what the site says in case it goes down:		>To Our Dedicated Patients & Supporters:		For years, The Breast Cancer Society has been dedicated to providing assistance to those suffering from breast cancer.		The vast majority of money raised for breast cancer causes are spent to fund research. While research and education are both vital, thousands of victims of breast cancer each year need not only information and the hope for an eventual cure, but also require direct assistance today so that they and their families can meet the challenges of this disease.		And so, I created an organization dedicated to providing direct assistance, supplies and referral services to those battling breast cancer. I am especially proud to have created The Hope Supply Program, which has allowed us to partner with retailers and manufacturers to provide personal care supplies and much-needed items (wigs, prosthetic breast inserts, and post-mastectomy bras, for example) for patients and their families free of charge.		Charities ??? including some of the world???s best-known and reputable organizations ??? are increasingly facing the scrutiny of government regulators in the U.S. The Breast Cancer Society (TBCS) is no exception. Unfortunately, as our operations expanded ??? all with the goal of serving more patients ??? the threat of litigation from our government increased as well.		While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.		The silver lining in all of this is that the organization has the ability to continue operating our most valued and popular program, the Hope Supply. Our Board will work tirelessly to maintain the Hope Supply program services that have benefitted our many patients for years ??? initially under the TBCS banner as it transitions under a different organization ??? all with the goal of seamlessly providing services to you. I take solace in the fact that this wonderful program has the chance to continue operating.		I have loved leading TBCS and being part of a team that engaged heart and soul in helping to serve the mission of the charity selflessly, tirelessly, and honorably.		On behalf of TBCS, I want to thank you for allowing us to be a part of your lives. It is my hope that you will continue to find the resources and assistance you need through the soon-to-be revamped Hope Supply Program.		Giving back to the community is a mission that drives me.

{"body":"It can be cheesed. My parents did this back in the day. They ran a somewhat scam telemarketing business that was clearly aimed at profit called "Save Our Children, Inc."		They bought leads of people who had entered sweepstakes and drawings. They'd call you up and say you won a fantastic prize. But if you receive the prize, you have to pay taxes on it. So instead, they'd like to sell you anti-drug coloring books. You buy the coloring books and donate them to a church, the Boy Scouts or whatever. Then you get a tax break for charitable donation. And then the company promises to then send you a prize worth more than what you spent on coloring books. As it is a bonus for the coloring books purchase, you don't pay taxes on it.		Let's say you spent $200 or $250 on coloring books. Then my parents company sent you a tennis bracelet with a signed appraisal that it is worth $399. You got a tax break, and an item worth more than the money you spent.		The best salesmen were "re-loaders" and they'd call back former customers and then hit them up again for larger amounts of money. The company had a scale. Depending on how much you spent, you would get different things sent to you.		The business is getting the items at wholesale and then shipping them to customers. For jewelry in particular there is quite a bit of markup. 		None of that is illegal. But the feds raided the business and threatened to put my parents in federal prison for a long time. They were doing an organized crack-down nationwide on scam telemarketing organizations (known as Boiler Rooms). They offered my parents a plea deal on wire fraud charges and short stints in federal prisons, which they took. My family went from millionaires to broke overnight and I ended up a teenager with both parents in jail. Honestly, I'm pretty thankful for the whole experience. I know what it is to be rich and live the high life. I have fancy tastes and got to experience some great things.

{"body":""you are a (small) part of the problem"		Yes and no. Many of the truly horrible things were in "the past" and thus like slavery and conquest we can say "Well I didn't do those things and even though I benefit I couldn't fix them" and that's true. 		But as you said, one does realise they share a small portion of culpability. It makes them feel like a bad person. But since they actually DID NOT poison or kill or waterboard someone themselves, their mind refuses to accept they are a "bad person" in any way.		I mean people refuse to accept they are a "bad person" when they actually do bad things themselves. Accepting that you are some shade of "bad" for simply benefiting from someone else's bad actions and not correcting them is a step too far for many.		Thus, whatever is said to happen either was necessary and thus not bad, or is a lie.		Edit to add that I have seen old people destroy their own identity when they confront the lies, but it nearly always results in bitterness, cynicism and anger that, unlike a young person, they don't get the time to get over or the knowledge they still have life ahead of them not being blind any longer. 		Sometimes I think the best thing is for people to simply accept that they *may* be wrong, and they need to respect other people's right to live differently or give money to people they don't like, etc. despite not agreeing with them.

B) Is he even right on a moral sense? Or better yet, can a person who seems to be completely divided from any sort of humanistic morality create it?		I got the feeling that the movie was hinting at the fact that what is 'human' isn't so much a level of awareness but how rooted in others that awareness is. I think Ava was witnessing the birth of that hierarchy of awareness. We have to remember the only person she knew before Caleb came along was seemingly divorced from any Emotional roots (Besides maybe rage, which could explain a bit of her sort of ruthlessness).

So from this we can see what's important to them :).  Their percentages went up for Fundraising, Admin, and Education.  They decreased Screening the most.

I am not a fan of Susan G Koman, but your numbers don't really show how it works.  First a lot of charities do this sort of thing to get people to commit to the significant time to raise money.  Typically the expense out is about 30%, not the 90% you calculated.  Typically you need to raise in the 1K to 2K range for a local event, so no air or hotel needed, or in the 3K to 5K each for an event they will fly you to, and even then you would be roomed with someone else.  Not all meals will be paid for either, typically only buffet style meals with a lot of participents which is lower cost for them.  So in your example both people would raise 2.5K each (low end) for a total of 5K.  Flight is $750, shared hotel is $400, food $150.  So 5K raised and 1.3K expensed out.  A decent take for a charity.

{"body":"> 38% goes towards Education, which can be unclear, because you can print out marketing items that "Educate" people.		There is some blurriness, but this isn't entirely accurate. Those items are accounted under [SOP 98-2](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176156442680&acceptedDisclaimer=true) which provides guidance for fundraising and joint costs. There are specific tests that need to be met, sometimes on a sentence-by-sentence basis within single mailings, to properly split mailing expenses between 'education' and 'fundraising'.		>They have 61 million less in 2014 than 2013. So from this we can see what's important to them :). Their percentages went up for Fundraising, Admin, and Education. They decreased Screening the most. 		This isn't a fair conclusion. There are a lot of reasons, but a few from a glance are:		* Most categories decreased in expense. Screening has the fewest contractual expenses; so it would wind down the most easily.	* Salaries expense is consistent. Non-profits can see wild swings in revenue; often the staffing stays put (doesn't make sense to do massive hiring/firing every year) while other expenses are adjusted. So, categories with more salaries expense are not going to decrease as much.	* Temp restricted net assets increased from FY13 to FY14 in both education and screening. TRNA is always released before URNA. So some of the decreases in this area is attributed to some of the spending being deferred into the future.		There's also a whole discussion that could be had about strategy, e.g. why would an organization with declining revenue want to cut down on fundraising, but that would take ages to cover.		Anyways, these are pretty mundane audited financial statements, and I'm saying that as someone who's audited dozens of these. I don't see anything that indicates a clear change in strategy, and most of the fluctuations look more or less in line with expectations. There's a bit of atypical activity within the Other category of Supporting Services, but that's probably related to the dissolution of the Alliance in FY14 per the Notes.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"suchvery","name":"t1_crenjlb","parent_id":"t1_cred9xv","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432083611,"created_utc":1432080011}

No. But they are not crooks like those linked to in this story and painting them in the same light is utterly ignorant and ridiculous.		God forbid charities spend money on expansion and growth, marketing, fundraising, increasing scale, etc. To reach the scale of a charity such as SGK you do have to spend some amount of money on things that aren't going to directly benefit the cause. Who cares if 100% of proceeds go to charity if you only manage to raise $200,000 and call it a day? Instead charities ought to be able to do what a smart business would do and reinvest that money in the form of hiring (actual qualified people who are not your family and friends and who will asked to be paid what they are worth at a for profit company), marketing and fundraising (the things that actually makes the money for the cause possible in the first place), etc and then turn that $200,000 into $2,000,000. This of course is what SGK does many times over every year. We need the scale of charities like SGK to tackle the really HUGE problems facing the world.

{"body":"There's also the fact that the overwhelming majority of cancer research funding in the US and elsewhere comes from the government.		In 1997, the only year I could readily find figures for, charities contributed only 6% of cancer research funding. Government provided 63% while industry provided the remaining 31%.		Charity funded cancer research is minimal, and arguably unnecessary. It's almost certainly the case more lives would be saved if charities put more effort in education, encouraging early screening, and vaccination. 		Cancer research is arguably over funded as it is, relative to other diseases and causes of death, and within it individual cancers (particularly breast and prostate cancer) receive a massively disproportionate amount of money for the harm they cause. Breast and prostate cancer are #1 and #2 for cancer research funding but other cancers kill more people, and other diseases much more people. They just aren't "sexy" for want of a better term and don't get the charity and media attention. Per death, breast cancer gets almost 10 times the research funding as lung cancer, the #1 cancer killer. 		http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/cancer-funding-does-it-add-up/?_r=0  			http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3411479/  	http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016837","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"blorg","name":"t1_crf2e70","parent_id":"t1_crerfoz","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432120565,"created_utc":1432116965}

Unfortunately, as our operations expanded ??? all with the goal of serving more patients ??? the threat of litigation from our government increased as well.		>While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.		>The silver lining in all of this is that the organization has the ability to continue operating our most valued and popular program, the Hope Supply. Our Board will work tirelessly to maintain the Hope Supply program services that have benefitted our many patients for years ??? initially under the TBCS banner as it transitions under a different organization ??? all with the goal of seamlessly providing services to you. I take solace in the fact that this wonderful program has the chance to continue operating.		>I have loved leading TBCS and being part of a team that engaged heart and soul in helping to serve the mission of the charity selflessly, tirelessly, and honorably.		>On behalf of TBCS, I want to thank you for allowing us to be a part of your lives.

{"body":"It depends. *My* doctor who works at a family care center was really nice, gave me the anxiety meds I needed but seemed concerned enough about their addictiveness to tell me to just be up front with him if I ever gain a habit and he would slowly wean me off them. He didn't believe in cold turkey methods (especially for this type of medication because withdrawals can be fatal) because it can lead to rash decision making.		But when going to an "After-Hours" type of doctor's office you see nurses, doctors who don't really care. I went to the ER once for a case of dizziness (I panicked and I shouldn't have gone). The doctor wasn't really nice, but insisted I should get an MRI. I walked out with a $300 testing bill. I didn't need that MRI, but I didn't know that at the time. I was young, naive, and overly cautious.		It just depends on who you see, where you see them, etc. The more family oriented a place is, the better more ethical doctors you'll find. Of course, the more expensive doctors are hit and miss. Some live by the policy that you pay for good doctors with good ethics But there's also the idea that higher paid doctors are more greedy and will thus try to talk you into tests you don't need.		One big problem is that my grandparent's doctors owns one of the lab's in our city's healthcare network. So he pretty much recommends that they get some kind of test done no matter what they go to the doctor for. Some of them are necessary as they both have a lot of health problems, but you just know that he's got to be recommending some unnecessary tests since he gets a cut whenever a test is done.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AustNerevar","name":"t1_creqnck","parent_id":"t1_creo99f","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432088985,"created_utc":1432085385}

{"body":"There's several types of blood cancers, but my sister had Hodgkin's lymphoma specifically.  It's actually pretty common to be diagnosed with that particular type at a younger age while many cancers tend to form later in life (including HL).  I am extremely fortunate to have a mother who works in immunology and even helped develop some of the marking agents for cancers so despite the confusing mess of treatment, she was able to understand the science (what is known and unknown) behind my sister's treatment.  It's incredible how much you learn when you need to understand what is going on.		To answer your question, it's unfortunately more complicated than cost, and life expectancy (or maybe fortunately).  If you can afford the treatment, then you can push for treating far past when it makes "sense" for life extension.  If you cannot, the choice may be made for you at a certain point.  It tends not to be a binary equation, but there is a point where the balance points to not treating or treating differently.  Quality of life is also hard to quantify. 		You can opt for less aggressive treatment (say based on your ability to withstand it), and this may actually work better than a more aggressive treatment, or it may not be aggressive enough and the cancer will quickly come back (even when your body is not ready).  The part that makes it complicated is that while things like age, health before treatment (regular exercise, effects of prior treatments, body mass, muscle tone) and genetics all play into how your body will accept the treatment itself, you're then faced with a number of moral questions.		My sister was treated with a well-supported, but still experimental regimen called the "Stanford-V" which is super aggressive.  Basically, the theory is that you maintain the same effectiveness, but deliver more chemo more quickly so your body has less total exposure time to the drugs, which may reduce their long term effects. I'm not endorsing this treatment, but it's the the one that made sense for us at the time for situation.		In her case the decision was not "to treat or not to treat", but what treatment do you feel most comfortable signing off on, which as you can imagine is quite a question for a parent and soon adult child.  Again, my mom is an immunologist and we had a long family discussion about the merits of this particular treatment for/with my sister after listening to the oncologists, doing literature review, and our personal compasses.  The crazy thing is that all these decisions are just the beginning of the consent form process and there are a million decisions you make after that point, which can be more complicated when the person being treated is gorked out from meds and is in little mood for discussing literature reviews and odds ratios.  My sister is not a fan of stats anyway, let alone when on massive doses of sleep agents.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_V#cite_note-pmid16172458-4		She had to go through two cycles, one year apart.  The first cycle, she was a rock star and compared with peers on the same treatment she exceeded all expectations.  There is even a case study somewhere out there on how little she felt the acute effects of treatment (i.e., she's a boss).  The second round (after we found out it was still slowly growing), had to be treated more aggressively and we had to basically nuke her immune system with chemicals and radiation (new born babies have more of an immune system at this point).  She then had bone marrow extracted from her spine and underwent stem cell therapy to replace her own blood cells after the volley of treatment.		http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/hodgkins-lymphoma/treatment/bone-marrow-and-stem-cell-transplants-for-hodgkins-lymphoma		This one was brutal.  We couldn't even be in the same room for a week, even in gowns and masks.  We skyped a lot and played a shit load of Command and Conquer (Red Alert II and Yuri's Revenge) through virtual LANs. She then was in an isolated room for a little over a month while her immune system rebooted.  No touching, no sharing food, no friends, no using the bathroom in her suite, no sick family members or young people etc. 		After all that she is healthy again and still a badass climbing and hiking out west and is 24 years old now.  It might still come back and we'll still never really know if we made the right choice of treatment; only that we tried to attack it from the best angles given the resources as hand.		TLDR: Cancer treatment is the ultimate strategy game that I wish no one would ever have to play.

Washington State has legal medical marijuana (and dispensaries) as well as legal recreational marijuana - the medical marijuana is tax free. 	My recommended dose is 1 gram oil daily, but i ramped up to that as well as ramped down. In Washington State one gram of "Simpson" oil retails for $75, but I got a 25% discount for quantity. The best thing about the legal oil from dispensaries is that it's been tested - the oil I bought was usually around 45% CBDs and 25% THC. Insurance won't cover so the cost is completely out of pocket, and about $1500 a month if I buy from a legal source.	So.... I started making the oil, and have friends who make it for me also.

While paying them 50K sounds like a lot, if the IT position needs skills that would be worth 100K in the general location, anyone who can successfully fill the role is giving up 50k to work there, which would be like finding someone willing to donate 50K of a 100K salary (actually it is more as the 50K is tax deductible, but the 50k lost salary isn't).		A lot of roles can be successfully filled by volunteers, but in some cases for some positions it is more beneficial for a charity to pay near market wages than to staff those positions with volunteers.

There are many facets of unethical behavior but again, chief among them is the violation of criminal law, especially violent behavior.		"My statements say literally nothing about who commits crime".

{"body":"I have a fundamental idea how certain types of cancers grow. My mother inlaw and sister inlaw both died from cervical cancer, my uncle died from lung cancer, and my sister is in remission from thyroid cancer. 		I know most doctors are helping people, but at a high level its also big business.		If you had a business selling something that made you well over a hundred billion dollars per year, would you take steps to eradicate the need for your business? Or would you make every effort for that money continue rolling in?		Take cancer, for example. Don???t let all the media hype about ???The Cure??? fool you. No one who is in a position to do so wants to end cancer because they are all making a killing on the big business of treatment, while ordinary people go broke, suffer horribly, and die.		There will never be a ???cure??? brought to market because there just isn???t enough profit in eradicating the disease entirely. There will never be a governing body that protects consumers from being subjected to known carcinogens, because that, too, will stop the cash from rolling in. A great deal of research is covered up and many potential cures are ignored and discredited because there is far more money in perpetuating illness than in curing it. In 2012, the reported spending on cancer treatment was 124.6 billion dollars. Blood money.		The Grim Statistics		Just the word ???cancer??? sends a frisson of fear down the spine of the most stalwart optimist. Terrifyingly, almost one in two people will get the dreaded disease, and the numbers are only getting worse. Here are some quick stats for background:		Nearly half of all Americans will develop cancer in their lifetime. (source) Quick math tells us that is an astonishing 157 million victims.	Over half a million people in America died of cancer in 2012. (source)	In 2011, cancer was the #1 cause of death in the Western world, and #2 in developing countries. (source)	Cancer is the #1 cause of childhood death in the United States. (source)				This is a fairly recent increase. A hundred years ago, the number was far different. At that time, 1 in 33 people was stricken with the disease. And despite billions of dollars being spent to find ???the cure???, the World Health Organization predicts that deaths from cancer will DOUBLE by the year 2030.		It???s being normalized. The news is full of photos of babies who are missing an eye, of beautiful bald children who have lost their hair to chemo, and of people who have had to have body parts removed in order to survive a few more years. But cancer is NOT normal. It isn???t something that ???just happens.??? Researchers know the things that cause cancer. Government protection agencies do, too, but they do nothing to limit these toxins in the marketplace.		Why?		Because, cancer is big business and those who are profiting have great financial interest in seeing the deadly trend continue to increase.		Poisoned for Profit		So what has changed? How did we go from a 3% chance of contracting cancer to a 41% chance?		It???s the advent of Big Pharma, Big Agri and Big Business. They are getting rich off of poisoning Americans through the manufacture of toxic elements that we are exposed to on a daily basis.		Unless you live in a bubble and have no contact with manufactured items, outside air, or the sun, you are exposed to a staggering number of known and suspected carcinogens every day. (Check out THIS LIST to see the known and suspected carcinogens that are readily available in the United States.)		The statistics support that the cumulative build up of all these different toxins in the human body eventually results in cancer in many people.		First, the manufacturers and the ???food??? producers profit when we buy their poisoned goods.		Then the medical system and pharmaceutical companies profit when we become ill and must fight cancer.		The drugs alone can cost over $100,000 per year, and that is on top of exorbitant costs for radiation, chemotherapy, and physicians' bills. In the United States, cancer is the #1 most expensive ???per person??? illness to treat. (source)		Why would those who profit want to prevent cancer when 95.5 BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR is spent on treating it? There is a vested interest in this increase in illness and the people benefiting from it have no intention of reducing the cases of cancer.","depth":2,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DanPlainviewIV","name":"t1_creqzoh","parent_id":"t1_crelchi","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432089570,"created_utc":1432085970}

{"body":"http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a6506/breast-cancer-business-scams/		"The Breast Cancer Society, based in Mesa, Arizona, has made an art form of this kind of creative accounting. Founded in 2007 by James T. Reynolds II, now 37, the organization provides critically ill breast cancer patients across the country with cash grants to pay for everything from groceries to medical bills, Reynolds says. In 2009 (the most recent year for which tax records are available), the BCS claims it raised $50 million in contributions, the bulk of which went to supplying medicines to hospitals in Third World countries like Guatemala and Ethiopia, ostensibly for the treatment of breast cancer. (Reynolds says he has visited only three of the eight hospitals that purportedly received these medicines.) Press him on his group's finances and he admits that, in fact, BCS raised just $15 million in cash donations in 2009. The other $35 million represented his estimate of medications that the BCS accepted as gifts or bought at a major discount but then listed on its books as having much higher values. For example, BCS reported that it sent $8.8 million worth of goods to hospitals in East Asia. "I'd have to look it up, but it probably cost us maybe $40,000 to procure and distribute that," Reynolds concedes in a phone interview. Where do these medicines come from? Reynolds says he gets them from other organizations, including the Ontario-based Universal Aide Society, which saw its Canadian charitable status revoked two years ago for malfeasance. (Its employees used funds to finance vacations and other personal expenses.) This so-called "gifts in kind" scheme makes BCS seem a whole lot bigger than it actually is and obscures the fact that the group spent 90 cents of every dollar that it raised on telemarketers, not patients."","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"letsgometros","name":"t1_crerhfa","parent_id":"t3_36iq0f","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432090428,"created_utc":1432086828}

They might fund individual researchers and help in the case of rare tumor types that might otherwise be underfunded, but really they are a small fraction of overall research spending on cancer, 94% of which comes from the government and industry.		By far the most important thing you can do, therefore, if you want to help fight cancer, is build political support for increased science funding. The fact that the NIH & NSF budgets have not increased in over a decade is a huge downward pressure on research in this country, and the resulting slowdown in research vastly exceeds any impact that charity could have.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"redzenfan","name":"t1_crekt3i","parent_id":"t3_36iq0f","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432078698,"created_utc":1432075098}

They spent 187 MILLION on themselves and their wages rather then giving it to research and treatment of cancer to children women and men who themselves and their family's are running near bankrupt from over priced treatment that may or may not save their lives!		I will only accept three possible out comes. One, they are stripped of everything the own and their assets are liquidated and the funds given to those who were meant to get them. Two, jail with no possibility of prowl, 20-30 years minimum and same the same as number one happening. Three, every cancer victim and their family members who were to be help by said organisations is given a stick from a gympie-gympie plant and let them give out lashings as they see fit. Cruel but justifiable.		I mean can you imagine how those people felt finding out they hadn't enough money to finish treatment and to get turned away by the very organization that was supposed to help them. Their family's would be crushed to watch them die a slow and painful death, and they couldn't do a thing for them.

But I stand by my earlier point: current Republican ideology is to reduce the size of non-military government and replace whatever services were provided with private sector alternatives, always while making the case that the private sector is more "efficient". In some cases it can be. But the private sector is also discriminatory; it chooses only to fund its pet causes or interests. In the case of charity, not only is the administrative cost going to be significantly higher for the private sector, but many causes will simply not get the funding they need.

{"body":"I see people in the comments talking about how they think having high administrative/advertising expenses means that a non-profit is somehow corrupt or a scam. This type of thinking is harmful to charities for a few reasons. Before I get into why, keep in mind that people's desire to not pay for a charity that has high "administrative expense" or "advertising expense" line items actually hurts the abilities of these charities to function.		The unfortunate reality is that in this country we put a premium on management skills. This premium is reflected by the extremely high CEO/upper management salaries we have in the US private sector. The largest charities in our country and, by extension, the ones that have the biggest impact, run much the same way as large companies. Among other things, they have to compete within the same labor pool as the private sector. Resultingly, large charities must either choose between hiring people that aren't qualified to run a multi-billion dollar company, or paying the higher salary. While they do often pay less than the private sector, it is only because they are able to attract talent that is interested in helping the world, and they still have to pay a good amount for it. That amount is reflected as in an increase in administrative expenses. Salaries represent a big portion of administrative expenses overall.		As for advertising expense, think of it this way. You have two small charities that have about 5 people each working for them. They each have a budget of 1 mil. Company A pays 50% of that in advertising, company B pays only 5% in advertising. They do this every year for 15 years. 15 years later, which of these companies do you think will be very large, like Susan G. Komen or United Way, and which do you think will still be small? If you guessed the company with the larger advertising budget, you would be correct. The advertising is literally investment in growth for the future of the charity.		But is it bad that we have a system that awards charities for spending a lot on advertising? I think it's not, because now company A has is spending 50% of billions on helping people, while company B is still just spending 95% of a couple million. And it's not like that money is being taken from charities. The research shows that when charities spend money on advertising, the overall % of people's incomes that get donated to charity increases overall (correlation between charity's total sector advertising expense and % of total population income spent on charity).		Yes there are scumbags out there like the above-listed cancer charities. But not all of the big charities are scummy, and in fact most of them are not. Every time it comes out that there has been a scandal at a big charity, people go on a witch hunt and start accusing charities that are doing their best with staff that has already taken a partial pay cut to work in a sector they love. The private sector has more scandals than charities, but since they don't cover their expenses with donations, they don't have to care. When a non-profit has the occasional scandal, it does very real harm to the sector as a whole because it discourages people from giving.		I would hope people would keep that in mind.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rationalinquisition","name":"t1_crejj4o","parent_id":"t3_36iq0f","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1432076496,"created_utc":1432072896}
