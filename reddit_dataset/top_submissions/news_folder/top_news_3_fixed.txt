{"body":"I keep applying at Costco, but seeing how they are the holy grail of retail companies, and as thus have an incredibly low turnover rate, I have been unsuccessful so far. I'll just keep applying every 60 days until they can't take it anymore and give me a job out of pity. Yup, that sounds like a solid plan.			**Edit**: Ugh, all these comments from former and current Costco  employees make me sick with envy. Let me send an empathetic "fuuuuck youuuu" your way. Just kidding! But, seriously. Fuck you.	Now, if I could have someone from REI pop in here and list all of *their* awesome attributes,  that'd be great, because I just got a job  there, yay! 		Thanks to everyone who replied with advice as to how to put in a successful application and stand out from the rest.

{"body":"Welcome to the great nation of America! 		Edit since I'm not on mobile anymore and can provide an adequate response. The entire idea with Costco is once you get your foot in the door and get past your initial 90 day trial period, you're good to go. They allow you to transfer anywhere they have a store so long as you're willing to go part time. Knowing that within 5 years of working full time that people can make $50k plus great benefits, they're willing to ride out 6-12 months of an hour commute each way and then transfer to a store closer to home. It's very difficult to get a job at a Costco that's been established, so people take that chance.		I completely agree that it really does speak to the current state of the economy. Most companies provide absolute shit benefits, and compensation isn't always gauranteed to be great. I think the comfort of knowing you'll make $22 an hour so quickly as well as continued yearly raises + CoL adjustment bonuses really attracts people. Once you hit your pay scale ceiling, you then have opportunities to move into corporate. As a company they do not hire externally for corporate positions outside of IT, so you do not have the same ceiling as other retailers. Costco really is still that classic American company that focuses on Employees and customers before it's shareholders.","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clnkeba","parent_id":"t1_clnkbdi","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414621264,"created_utc":1414617664}

{"body":"Well, thanks for your opinion on someones life that is not my own! Since you took the time to comment on a comment that's 9 days old, I'll reply the same way I have to other people who expressed very similar feelings. Yes, Costco is just another retail job. However, you're guaranteed a raise every 1000 hours you work. You start out at 11.50 and hour, and are guaranteed 25 hours a week if you're part time. If you're full time, you'll never have your hours cut below 40 hours. After 6 months, you're entitled to health insurance that matches if not beats most other health benefits for a stupidly low price. After 5 years full time(roughly 10,000 hours) you will earn $23 an hour plus  a CoL bonus that is twice a year. This brings most people close to $60,000 a year plus a great benefits package. 		Then if you decide that you want to go into management within the store, the base salary is $75,000 for a shift supervisor. If you don't want to go management, you cna go corporate. They do not hire externally for management or corporate positions. 		Now for the few people that decided to drive 60 miles each way to work at Costco, you have to understand how difficult it is to get into an established store. Because they only hire internally, the only time a position opens up is when someone quits or they get promoted. Costco historically has the lowest turnover rate. So what a lot of people do is get their foot in the door at a new location, and then transfer after they hit 6 months. You can transfer anywhere, so long as you accept going back to part time.		So yeah, it's just a retail job. However after 10,000 hours of working, you're guaranteed to be making at least $60,000 a year plus incredible benefits. That's pretty damn good man, regardless of what profession you're in. Then you have  the opportunity to move up internally or go corporate. I don't know many other retail stores that offer this. And considering that a majority of retail employees are between 21-45 and have a family, there's a good reason why people do what they do to get a job there.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clw2yw4","parent_id":"t1_clw2mvo","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1415395202,"created_utc":1415395202}

{"body":"Maybe this was just a long time ago and isn't true in this post-recession economy, but when I got hired at Costco back in 2006 I just applied online and got called in for an interview. One real interview and they called me in for a follow-up, which turned out to *not* be an interview, just a mouth swab drug screen before I was offered a position. 		They did a big seasonal hiring in the summer and brought in like 15 of us at once for training. This gives employees a couple months to get acclimated and learn the ropes before the crazy November-December months, and a chance to weed out those who aren't up for it (they really do work you hard, it's no cake walk job, but you are treated fairly). Then they all got laid off in January when the Christmas buzz finally dies down. The employees would usually be eligible for unemployment so you could sit and collect checks while the ones they really liked got called back when business starts to pick up again in the spring and go back on the payroll.  Once you've survived the cut, then you are basically a lifer and you have to fuck up to get fired. 		A couple months later I ended up getting offered a different job with another company  that had a great reputation for treating employees well and sounded more secure so I left Costco. Of course, the other job I took turned out be much *less* secure, and the company was mismanaged, desperate, and went bankrupt within 2 years and I was let go before the crash because I refused to participate in sales/marketing that I felt was unethical.  I still regret not trying to stick it out with Costco, maybe it's time to try to get back in the door.","depth":2,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"night_owl","name":"t1_clnlk0n","parent_id":"t1_clni068","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414623432,"created_utc":1414619832}

I'm glad you have come to my way of thinking but don't take up all that space writing my own argument back to me and writing it to me as though it was your idea in the first place, moron.		>I was comparing that are there are few homeless people in the UK in comparison to the US. 16% homeless at some point, not right now.

Your wrong, but you can do that. 		You can even continue to construct as many strawman arguments as you want, because I have never argued America has a good homeless solution that's all in your head. 		My argument was/is rather simple. There is a number of homeless people and it is to high. And anything relevant you posted (read: Not America's stats) supported me.

I never brought in America, America was the topic of conversation before you even started with these banal replies, pay attention please.		You and I both are going to end up like a broken record if I have to keep quoting myself saying that I don't think it isn't an issue, just that it is a much more preferable system than what for example the US has.		>I was comparing that are there are few homeless people in the UK in comparison to the US. 16% homeless at some point, not right now. It's not a perfect solution but it is better than America's 'lol fuck it they can work their own way out of the gutter' system		I never once said that you said America has a good homeless solution, stop making things up please.		You are rather simple though. So you think that 0.02% of the population being homeless is too high? Are you an actual imbecile? It's a pretty decent statistic to be honest, it doesn't support you at all it's like you can't even comprehend. Do you honestly think 0.02% is a bad number? 		It isn't 10,000 people in one place, it's 10,000 people spread out over 4 different countries if we were to imagine it is an even distribution (which I doubt it is but let's go with it) that is 2500 homeless people per country. Yeah it's a lot of people but I wonder how many of these people are currently going through the system to get government aid, or how many of these people just don't want to be off the streets (believe it or not this happens). All of these people have the opportunity to seek help, so they probably are. 		I think our system (as I have said before) is good, it's not perfect but do you honestly expect it to be perfect? Nothing is perfect kid. You need to wake up and realise there is only a certain amount you can do to help people and I think our government is doing well to have the figure at 0.02%.

You be entitled to 2.08 days of leave per month you work.  	The holidays are earned in the calendar year, ie from 1 January to 31 December.  	Holidays should be taken in the holiday year runs from 1 May to 30 April the following year. 	You are entitled to three weeks vacation in the relationship between May 1 and September 30 	(main holiday).  	The rest of the holidays can be placed throughout the year. How holiday placed, 	agreed with the employer. The company has closed for holidays or can not be 	agree, it is the employer who makes vacation planning.  	Even if you have not earned holiday money with an employer, you are entitled to keep 	holiday for "own account".  	If your employer does not pay you holiday pay, you must immediately contact 	your local 3F branch.  	If you leave your job, your employer must settle holiday pay 	equivalent to 12.5% of your earnings until retirement on a holiday account.  	You can get more information from your union or your local 3F branch.* 		**"Holidays (or 'loose vacation days')"**  	*In most agreements, one is entitled to one or more special holidays. Floating holidays 	is therefore extra freedom, beyond the 25 days that the Holidays Act gives you the right. there is 	also special conditions you must meet in order to be able to get a special holiday. it 	depends on the agreement.  	Ask your union representative or your local 3F afdeling, 	if you are eligible for special holidays.*		Mind you that's the union for unskilled & very short education blue collar workers.

{"body":"Depends on the corporate environment you are working in. Companies which have very high turn-over rates, aka meatgrinders which fire or lose alot of their employees and have to replace them frequently, tend to have very "productive" employees in terms of the number of hours they spend working and how hard they work during those hours. If they don't bust ass all day, every day, most of the people stuck working for these companies just get fired or phased out with reduced schedules, denied PTO requests, shitty raises and lack of opportunity for advancement. It's a catch-22 and companies like this end up with alot of pissed off, toxic middle managers and employees who want to leave but can't. Very hard to retain talented and cooperative people in that kind of environment.		However, even companies with more nominal turn-over rates do not necessarily inspire loyalty from their employees. These are businesses, they hire you to do a job, and you do that job because you get paid. Removing all moral variables from the equation, I wouldn't lift a finger to do even 1% more work than what I am expected to do / what I am paid for, unless I have a good reason to believe I will be properly compensated for those "additional services". If they want me to work harder, or longer, or take on more challenging tasks, that's fine - but I better get paid for it. Thus I perform at a level that "Exceeds Expectations" but only by the smallest of margins, in order to keep the managers off my back and keep getting those silly little 4% annual raises.		THAT is the American dream, except as in the previous comment under circumstances where effort & profit are intrinsically tied together such as owning your own business or getting significant bonus/incentive options as part of your compensation package. 		Doing anything more than the above is essentially charity for the business - a noble enterprise if you are working for a nonprofit that is doing great work without any intent to make money, a waste of your time and effort everywhere else.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"smokejaguar1337","name":"t1_cls0o50","parent_id":"t1_clnwrkr","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1415048345,"created_utc":1415048345}

{"body":"While Americans are known to work hard, most of us don't take off work either because we're too scared to (some people may have legitimate reason to be because they work for horrible companies/bosses, most of it is likely just paranoia).  It's gradually changing I feel like.  When I first started working in corporate finance 8 years ago (sheesh that makes me feel old) I was the same way.		I went from job to job, mainly due to wanting to find better opportunities and I was laid off once in those 8 years but I decided to take aim towards smaller tech firms since it was something different.  I live in the Washington DC area so most jobs are government or government contracting work and while the pay is good, the work is repetitive and dull (never felt a sense that I was moving forward in my career) but more importantly, the work environment is just depressing.		I've noticed these smaller, private tech firms are far more relaxed.  At my current job I get unlimited vacation and sick leave provided it's within reason (I wouldn't ask, nor expect someone on my team to take a vacation for six months straight since others have to pick up the responsibility and duties of the person absent), we get free catered meals daily, and frequent happy hours in the office (we stock booze).  The CEO knows us all by name and it's not entirely uncommon at all to just shoot the shit with him if you see him walking around.  We can also literally wear whatever we want provided it's not offensive.  There's also free yoga classes every couple weeks held in the office during office hours for folks wanting to relax.  We also have a game room where we can play Foosball, an old school Mortal Kombat II arcade, and a projector with an Xbox 360.  It's also just a nice lounge area to relax in to get your mind off things. 		All of this is done for a reason though.  Much like the way Costco treats it's employees, it's done to keep people happy and motivated.  We're expected work very hard which we do (my typical work week is 50-60 hours/week but I'm also a senior level employee now, most people get in around 9 and are gone by 6 at the latest).  Upper management is always   		I still work about as hard as I have in previous jobs, if not harder, the biggest difference is that we just aren't afraid to actually live our own lives and our work culture encourages it.  One week and two week vacations a few times a year among employees is not uncommon.  		At previous jobs, 3 weeks paid vacation plus 1 week sick leave was the norm per year for me.  Your vacation would go up every year to two years depending on company policy, maxing out at 6 weeks paid vacation leave per year so it's not like we're working slave labor over here.  It isn't required by law to use that vacation so you can use it at your leisure.  Upon termination of employment either voluntarily or involuntarily, you would get a check for your unused vacation time.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"guy_incognito784","name":"t1_cloiu0g","parent_id":"t1_clny44l","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414705030,"created_utc":1414701430}

{"body":"There are actually a lot of businesses like this.  I've had the pleasure of working for one, embedded in the midst of Cingular/AT&T if you can believe it.  I could tell the story, but it's kind of a tangent.  Of course, through wonderful American top-down management, AT&T has put the damper on this small business (authorized retailer) running in an innovative and different way that was hugely beneficial for the larger corporation.  If someone wants this story, I can put it in another comment.		Small businesses tend to grow through a quality product/service and reputation.  This is largely done by having a small employee base that's treated well.  Either it's one or two guys (in which case the top IS the bottom), or the owner knows every one of his employees pretty well.  It's pretty easy to know all of their circumstances, empathize with them, forgive and understand their mistakes, build trust in them, and generally treat them as human beings.  I think this is the healthy, traditional model of business.  It's the image that's invoked when one hears "small business".		The fastest way to grow and/or make instant money in a medium-sized business is a little different.  Cut every corner.  		Cash in on that built up reputation that came from quality products and treating your employers like humans.  Not all of the employees of course.  The ones you know better are more or less decent people.  But any monkey can do the lowest tier job.  You've just grown big enough that you can't manage to count all those widgets and stock all those shelves yourself.  You can find people for min. wage to do that. 		Oh, and you used to make your widgets out of leather, and it was taking your monkeys a total of 45 minutes to make each one.  If you get cheap imitation leather from here, and show your monkeys how they should be able to do it in 10, you can triple your profits.		Your customers have loved your widgets for a long time.  You've just made a few adjustments here and there that aren't really that big of a deal.  It's the same thing it was before, and you're still going to get people coming in from their friends telling them about your widgets last year, or even just recognition of your brand name.		Hey look, now you have the money to expand so much faster than the guy who stuck to the traditional model.  It's so much easier to open a new location when you're not giving your employees vacation time, health benefits, and 401ks.  You'll be on your 10th store by the time the traditional model guy is on his 3rd.  Now you can build your business more on advertising, price, your old reputation, anti-competitive practices (government lobbying, unsustainable price reductions), acquisition of smaller similar businesses, and name brand recognition more than the quality and service you used to have. 		Good businesses multiply slowly and carefully.  Bad businesses multiply rapidly and rashly.  Now our country is filled with bad businesses that are crowding out the good.

{"body":"I would define fair as a wage that lets an employee support themselves and their family without undue hardship. When I worked a shitty retail job, I remember one of my coworkers working two jobs, coming in one job at 8AM, and leaving their second job at 10PM, only to still struggle to put food on the table. That's not fair by any means. Nor does it make for happy, productive employees. She was generally pretty good at customer service and she never slacked off, but when you're working 12-14 hour days, the college student working 6-8 can work circles around you. She also volunteered regularly on top of that, though fuck if I know how she managed it. Had they simply paid her a better wage so that she didn't have to work so many hours, odds are she would be more productive in the hours each job paid her.		I would also consider the 'market rate' a very dubious proposition for fairness because it's variable based on bargaining power. We also live in the real world, not a microeconomics class, so firms aren't acting under perfect information about wage value. There's very few jobs where the employee makes X dollars an hour and the employer earns X+10 cents per hour from the employee, such that any wage raise is simply impossible. Instead, because employees are coming from a position of little bargaining power, they're going to be earning somewhere below the 'optimum' price.		Suppose that a janitorial position provides 15 dollars per hour to the employer, after accounting for material expenses. They're earning 8 dollars an hour. They get tired of that, and all the janitors quit their jobs simultaneously and refuse to work until the wage increases to 10 dollars an hour. The employer submits. Which wage was the 'fair market price'? They both are, just under different market conditions and different levels of bargaining power. Likewise, the fair market price could easily be higher or lower for retail employees in the real world, without necessarily bankrupting the businesses that hire them. Obviously, there's limits to this. If the wage was 100 dollars per hour, yeah, Walmart would go bankrupt overnight.

{"body":">1) That is going to be different for every employee. Someone may have a wife and kids, and someone may simply be a single college student.		That doesn't change the fact that for some employees, the low wages we're paying them are cutting into productivity.

On the same time, im not going to pay a retail person much more or less than the other retail places. Positions have a budget that reflect a range within the acceptable market rate.		I'm already very much aware of the economic principles you're describing. What you're missing is that fair is a subjective human analysis. Bargaining power doesn't make it fair or not fair. It's simply a description of market forces. As an example of what I mean by this, take evolution. Creatures willing to inflict violence on other creatures in order to secure food may have an evolutionary edge in many cases. That doesn't mean this violence is fair or not fair, it's just what happens. Likewise, just because the current state of retail labor is the result of the market doesn't mean it's fair or not fair, it simply is. If we, as a society, find it's not desirable to have a substantial portion of the workforce work long hours at low wages when it's possible to pay them more and retain profitability, then we can take steps to ameliorate that. 		>3) Both are market prices.

The market is an abstraction of the combined decision-making of all the decidedly human business owners and other market participants. If most retail business owners pay an employees such a low wage that it cuts into their productivity because they don't have the information to make the connection between the two from their disconnected position at the top of a vast corporate hierarchy, 'the market' will have that as the 'optimum' wage, even those it's very obviously not optimum at all. They're human.

{"body":"I'm sure this will get buried, but [this article](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-01/not-everyone-can-work-for-costco) is a very good argument for why this model works for Costco, but it can't work for everyone. Essentially, by offering the benefits they do, Costco gets the best employees who are worth the extra wages. If every company offered the same benefits/wages, it would be impossible for Costco to maintain its advantage and employee productivity. 		Edit: In other words, high wages don't create better employees, they attract better employees. If everyone has the same wages, no one place will be able to attract better employees, and everyone looks like a walmart again (from a service standpoint).","depth":1,"score":16,"ups":16,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Megamansdick","name":"t1_clnih27","parent_id":"t1_clndsei","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414617821,"created_utc":1414614221}
{"body":"I think there's something to be said for the ideas laid out in that article (namely that, if we take the "higher wages for everybody is better!" idea to the extreme, we should just put minimum wage at, say, $25 an hour as the author mentions, and I realize why companies can't do that all of a sudden) but I don't find them necessarily correct in every sense.		It's true that wages, in and of themselves, don't arbitrarily guarantee better employees. Just because I'm paid more doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to be a better worker. If I hate my job, or have a bad attitude, those will transcend the value of my salary. I agree that better wages likely attract better employees, of which it makes sense that there's a limited pool from which to draw from.		But higher wages and proper benefits also massively reduce turnover. With this, I, as a company, can create better employees. I can invest in my employees with the understanding that they'll likely stick around because they're being taken care of here. As someone else has mentioned, at Costco you start at $11.25 and get a 25 cent raise every 400 hours you work. As an employee, once I get one or two of those raises under my belt (half a year later, or so) I'll be much less likely to want to jump ship to Walmart, even if they too offer $11.25 to start. As an employer, if I'm under the impression I'll have a long time to recoup my investment from training my employees well, I don't necessarily need to have them be rock stars from the get go.		Another aspect worth discussing is the peace of mind benefits like these afford: so many Costco workers in this thread have mentioned how much better they feel given how well taken care of they are. This kind of atmosphere helps give some people the ability to be a better worker for the company. A person that is constantly stressed, over-worked and underpaid is probably going to be a mediocre worker, no matter the motivation to do hard work they have before they get in the door. With proper benefits you are likely able to turn some (certainly not all, I'll concede) otherwise mediocre workers into great ones.		And this doesn't even touch on the Walmart wage, with no benefits, being unlivable in the majority of circumstances. It's one thing to say "Not every company can pay wages that are above the market standard" and another to say "The majority of companies paying the market standard aren't even paying a livable wage."","depth":2,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"askingmfa_","name":"t1_clnuk5f","parent_id":"t1_clnih27","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414641113,"created_utc":1414637513}

I remember being taught about this when I got hired at Costco back around ~2006, and it was considered an outdated myth at the time back then and they wanted to educate employees about it to kill the myth. 		Costco had a gradual strategy shift. they used to rely heavily on memberships for profit (I believe in the early days it was actually like 80-90% of profits), and sold products barely above their cost in order to cover operating costs, but I think they realized this kept a pretty hard ceiling on their potential because the only way to really raise revenue would be to raise either membership fees or prices, and raising membership rates would obviously drive away a lot of customers and destroy their ability to keep prices low by doing such large volumes. 		So they chose to keep membership rates low (they've barely budged in the last 20 years) and allow prices to creep up, but within reasonable bounds--they still have caps to their markup % that are determined by the dept. the product falls into, so that  things like toys, DVDs, and books have higher markup rates than bread and potatoes.","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"night_owl","name":"t1_clnl45n","parent_id":"t1_clnk049","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414622598,"created_utc":1414618998}

One thing that bugs me though, they have such a rosy reputation but it sure isn't easy money and I think a lot of people simply can't handle it. Costco employees bust their asses for the most part and it can be extremely competitive/cutthroat to get hired/promoted. I was often exhausted, especially when I was spending a lot of time hauling in trains of 12 carts at a time in the 90-degree summer heat (they rotate tasks in an egalitarian fashion, so even long-term veteran cashiers still have to spend some time hauling in carts). One day I forget sunscreen and was obviously getting burned pretty bad, but they still wouldn't excuse me from being in the sun and hauling carts (and I paid the price with days of glowing red misery). You may have noticed that Costco employees tend to be fairly fit and energetic (the old ladies that give out samples are not Costco employees but 3rd party contractors), because you'd burn out really quick if you aren't. They have high expectations of their employees--there is no coasting and everyone is expected to be able to do physical stuff like loading heavy boxes and hauling carts. 		The management aren't pushovers and they can be very stringent. Breaks are closely timed and watched like hawks so you'll be in trouble if you are 3 minutes late clocking in for a shift, no matter how long you've been there or hard you've been working on a long shift.

It was like 6am at first, then 4am, then 2am, then midnight on official black Friday, and now it's Thanksgiving day.  The consumers just go when the retailers tell them they are open.

I'm not sure about other stores, but every year in the beginning of October, the manager in charge of HR will pull each team member into her office to discuss their holiday availability. Certain days (Thanksgiving, Black Friday+Saturday, the two weekends before Christmas, Christmas Eve, and the day after Christmas) are highlighted as most likely to be very busy. As an incentive to get people to make themselves available on those days, they actually pay you a bit more per hour to work. Regular (meaning, not seasonal) team members get called in first to give their holiday availability, so if you have plans with your family and can't work one or two of those days, it's really not a big deal because we hire so many seasonal team members that they can pick up the slack.

{"body":"Walmart sells to lower income demographics. Costco operates only if there are a minimum number of households within its planned radius (varies by population density) that meet the minimum threshold for combine household income. The *average* Costco household makes over $80K/year.		Costco really is a store where affluent households occasionally buy huge quantities of goods on the cheap. Wal-Mart is mostly a store where low-income people do their everyday shopping. Thus CostCo stocks about 4000 SKUs (individual products) at any given time whereas Walmart carries about 100,000. This means Costco can run with significantly fewer employees per store, which, in turn drives down labor overhead, and increases both profit per square foot, and profit per employee.		This data is a couple years out of date, but it's unlikely to have changed significantly.  http://www.bloomberg.com/image/iizxR2R7V2PM		What you're basically looking at is that while the inhabit similar real estate types, Walmarts will be *everywhere*, but Costco will only be there if there's a community of middle and upper class that can support it. 		Because of this, Costco's labor is only 9-10% of an individual store's overhead. Walmart runs closer to 20% because each store takes significantly more people to operate. When you realize that Walmart runs at a 3.5% profit margin, but a 20% labor overhead, there's actually not that much profit to disperse back to the employees. Walmart makes billions of dollars, sure. But that's because it sells an *ungodly* volume from thousands of stores. 		If Walmart cut its profits in half to be approximately the 1.7% that Costco runs at, that leaves only approximately $3,700 per employee. Which literally means Walmart could only afford to pay its employees about $1.75 more an hour without raising prices to offset. 		The problem is, Walmart's business model is based on selling everything that poor people need at low prices. If Walmart is no longer cheaper to shop at, do people still shop at Walmart?		The other question is, since Walmart sells to poor people, who is hurt the most by rising prices at Walmart? Poor people who can now afford to buy less stuff.","depth":7,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SD99FRC","name":"t1_clnm6go","parent_id":"t1_clnlk1d","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414624662,"created_utc":1414621062}

Again nothing wrong with that and if I was running a store I would do the same. Its just if every store followed that model poor customers would be screwed.		>Don't these poor people have lots of land though? Can't they cough up $45 bucks that they'll eat in samples?

First of all you're assuming that a high concentration near the top is inherently a bad thing, whereas we see that's obviously not the case globally. Places like Afghanistan and Pakistan have very low Gini coefficients (how much "inequality" there is), while countries while Singapore and America have extremely high Ginis. Equally poor is not a good thing. Secondly that statement is simply wrong, it's nowhere near where it was in the 1800s or early 1900s (at the same time as the average worker's wages were growing faster than they have ever grown in history). Thirdly you're assuming this is due to free market economics that have dominated over the past 200 years in America (which admittedly was probably the most unequal period in our history, along with being one of the most prosperous for all workers). What's your solution and explain to me how it's better than the system that has reduced extreme poverty worldwide by huge amounts in the past 30 years (more than any other period in history, again coincidentally the same 30 years under which China and India to a much smaller extent have become much more liberal in terms of their economic policies [liberal in this case meaning actually liberal, favouring liberty]).","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clnousl","parent_id":"t1_clnoi3z","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414630063,"created_utc":1414626463}

That ONE large competitor was open only in the early morning to mid afternoon on Thanksgiving, and was apparently doing a good business.		SOOOO, all the other chains including us, started opening Thanksgiving. In fact we made sure to open longer hours on Thanksgiving than they did. 		They just expanded their hours to meet us. Then the next year the entire industry, even some of the independents and small chains started opening Thanksgiving, essentially all day. 		Guess what?		Well into the 21st century at least, and maybe STILL, everybody is open close to their regular hours on Thanksgiving, and as far as I know NO ONE actually makes a profit on Thanksgiving day. All they do is just enough business to "eat each other's lunch"  as Wall Street likes to put it.  Mutually Assured Disruption!

Honestly, retailers should just be open anyway.  It's not like everyone gets the day off, I sure as hell didn't.  		The short and skinny is that any of these businesses that are open during those holidays don't just fuck over their employees assuming they are decently managed.  When I would schedule people for holiday work, I would work with the employees to figure out schedules that work around family events.  At the same time, yes, we would still need enough staff to cover the massive business happening.  		Hell, I used to ask "who wants hours?" on thanksgiving and I'd fill almost all of my schedule with people wanting to work.  Extra money going into christmas was important for people.  Other times, people would have their family events on the weekend instead of the holiday, so I could schedule around that.  		At the end of the day, working on a holiday really wasn't imposing at all if you are managing properly.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Duese","name":"t1_clnlsb2","parent_id":"t3_2kp34z","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1414623882,"created_utc":1414620282}

{"body":"I'm hoping this gets upvoted to help people when applying for a job.		Costco employee here. I didn't think this was news. When I was hired last August, I was told that holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, I would *never* work. This same thing came out last year. I'm pretty sure they're going to stick to it for a long time. To make an added bonus, Costco also closes early on Christmas Eve, and IIRC, for the day before Thanksgiving, the managers just try to get everyone out early.		I can't stand hearing how greedy other companies are. The CEO of Costco makes well less than one million dollars per year. To all those who want to get hired I have some suggestions. First off, apply online (obviously).  From my observations, April to August seem to be best. I filled out the application at the beginning of August, and got a call two days later. I was just lucky.		When you fill out the application, as far as they're concerned, you have open availability. Period! You have nothing else going on. This is how they weed out some of the applications (probably a good portion of them). Apply to a few in the area, not just one. When you follow-up (and you better follow-up), make sure you have a top-notch resume and cover letter. Give it to an Assistant Warehouse Manager. That title, nothing more, nothing less. Ask to speak to an assistant warehouse manager.		Interview, it's "Yes, sir/ma'am." You want this job, you need to be willing to learn. Most of the folks that I've seen on Reddit tend to want to learn, so I don't expect this to be a problem. Also, visit /r/Costco.

Walmart CEO: 4.4+1.3+13.6=19.3 million which is 0.12% of profit.		Proportionally, turns out the Costco's CEO takes a bigger chunk.
