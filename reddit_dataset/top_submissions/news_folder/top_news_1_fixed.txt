Even if they flawlessly perform anything the officer asked, if they blow above an 0.08, they go to jail. While I definitely understand why these laws exist, I think passing the field sobriety test should determine if a person is fit for driving or not. I say this because I know people who would likely fail the test while sober. I know a girl who last year side swiped 5 parked cars "because of a spider" and she was completely sober. Same girl last month drove her car off a hill because she didn't turn sharp enough around a corner. Again sober.  My point is there are so many uncoordinated people driving around that *could* pass a breathalyzer, but probably can't balance on one leg.

{"body":"Standard field sobriety tests, at least the walk and turn and one leg stand, are actually divided attention tests and can be fairly easily trained for. The theory is that when you are impaired, your ability to multitask is severely compromised. You could still have great balance, sharp wit, and crystal clear voice but that's not what the tests are looking for. 		Take walk and turn for example. It is actually a highly structured test that must be followed step by step (haha) in the exact order and the manner instructed to pass. You start too soon? A clue. Not doing heel to toe? A clue. Raising arm for balance? A clue. Too few or many steps? A clue. Stepping out of line? A clue. Not turning in the manner instructed (taking a series of small steps with one foot) A clue. I could go on, but you already failed at 2 clues. There are 8 total clues and the trick is to remember everything when you're stressed and nervous and might possibly be drunk. And pretty much everyone thinks they've done great at walk and turn. 		HGN isn't a divided attention test. It's the one with the most scientific support behind it but that's really not saying much. 		At any rate, concentrating on balance and coordination is a good way to fail the SFST. And balance and coordination are not necessarily good indicators of skilled driving.

It seems to help with withdrawal - but it is pretty addictive and has a very rapid tolerance and withdrawal problem. 		You can get both kratom and phenibut through a simple google search.  For an addict, the kratom you need is going to be very expensive.  I would recommend setting aside about 500 dollars.		This is how I did it.		I reduced down to 1/2 my amount of opiate and held there for a week.  		Then I started using 1/4 tsp of Ultra Enhanced Indo kratom + 1 tsp bali kratom 3x a day.  This certainly was not a comfortable amount but it was ok.		I also took .5g phenibut 3x a day during the first 2 days of withdrawal, then dial it down to 2x .5 a day for then next 2 days, then down to .5g each day for a long time.  I also took a valium as late in the day as I could stand it.		I also forced myself to exercise, avoided all stimulants, and took 3 very hot baths every day.  I filled every moment with activity so that I could look forward to stopping.  I drank ensure for nutrition at first - that helped as low blood sugar can feel a lot like being undermedicated.		After about a week of functional discomfort, I felt pretty normal on that regimen.  Then I dialed all withdrawal aid substances down by 50%.  I tapered off phenibut a week later.  		Thats where I am now.  I take kratom 3x a day in small amounts.  But my life is not recognizeable as that of a junkie, and I'm very happy with that.

{"body":"This right here. Everyone seems to be missing this main point of that argument. Sure there may be some decent police officers out there that actually do their jobs correctly, but the problem is that on every police force there are going to be dirty cops(read: "bad apples"). And these "good" cops DO NOT call them out on their corrupt behavior and sometimes even help cover up their actions. With this kind of mentality in police departments across the nation, it seems to me that the entire police system needs to be changed and these "bad cops" need to be called out by their fellow coworkers who are supposed to "serve and protect." 		Another reason why the "good cops" don't call out the bad ones, though, is because once they do it creates a hostile work environment for them. It's a stigma amongst the police community that cops don't rat out other cops. Regardless of what they may have done. IMO, there should be some government agency created that ONLY handles these types of cases. When a police officer calls in corruption, he does so anonymously without any fear of backlash against him/her. Then this theoretical government agency goes on to investigate the corruption and determine whether or not someone should be punished accordingly. This agency's ENTIRE job is to investigate police corruption and ONLY police corruption. That way they would have prosecutors whose only jobs are to prosecute other police officers. That way there is no conflict of interest like there usually is when I police officer is charged with something and prosecuted today.","depth":9,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LSDelicious91","name":"t1_cr21kvd","parent_id":"t1_cr212yd","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431049778,"created_utc":1431046178}

{"body":"I'd give him the shirt off my back, frankly. He'd look a bit silly in a lace tank-top, but I'd still offer.		One of my best friends was a cop. He had a minor fender-bender in a squad car that wasn't his fault (someone ran a red light and hit him; you'd think that would normally end up with the other person getting the book thrown at him, but here it was the other way around). But his chief didn't like him, at all, for purely personal reasons, and decided to use that accident as an excuse to shit-can him.		My friend went through all the usual channels with the police union and Garrity Rights and blah-de-blah-blah but in the end he just lost the popularity contest with his superiors and people in city hall (who were all buddies with the chief because it's a small town), and they upheld the chief's decision to fire him.		He's never been able to get another job as a cop since then. You get fired once in that world and it's like you're covered in shit for the rest of eternity. It's incredibly difficult for someone in a position like my friend, or like the cop in this story, to ever get another job as a cop again... and if he does, it won't likely be a good position, or pay as well, or be in a place where he wants to be. If he stays in that same community, he's going to be a pariah.		So here you've finally got a good cop who's doing the ethical thing, upholding the law in spirit as well as word, and was not being a hyper-aggressive POS... and he's being punished for it. What the hell kind of message is that for cops as a whole, when at the same time we're collectively screaming at them for being overly aggressive, corrupt, unfair, etc.?		So yeah, if there's a gofundme or similar, sign me right up. Meanwhile, I just hope he's doing okay from a psychological/social standpoint.

If you had not conscented to that test you could hire a lawyer to try and get your charges reduced or even dropped arguing that you were not over the limit...or at least NOT have the damning evidence staring you in the face.   I'm sure there is some translation for time between arrest and testing that they assume your BAC will drop and of course the evidence of the stop (you were swerving and couldn't walk heel to tow) still applies and you may very well sill be convicted.

In Maryland, (where I am from and where my father is a police officer) if you refuse a breathalyzer, the officer has the authority to detain you and take you the station because when you get/sign your drivers license you agree to field breathalyzer tests or blood tests, but when you get to the station you can still refuse a blood test because in MD they can't legally put the needle in your arm without consent (now's when you demand a lawyer if you haven't already).

Therefore, you have your license automatically suspended for 90 days but for failure to comply with the DOT agreement (**not because of the dui, and you are not automatically guilty**), AND you still don't have to do the test. for this reason, the BAC cannot be obtained and thus this cannot be used against you if they still decide to charge you with DUI. Therefore, to be found guilty there has to be other  evidence of your intoxication (eg driving erratically, slurred speech, smell of alcohol) but usually the other evidence won't be enough for conviction.

He didn't smell like alcohol and wasn't seen swerving... He just simply refused both tests and then had his license suspended.

{"body":">If you say anything other than "okay!" you're automatically convicted		This is wrong, and bad advice.		At least in my state, you're not automatically convicted of a DUI... that wouldn't make any sense at all. You can't be convicted of anything without a trial.		You automatically lose your driver's license because a driver's license is a privilege that can be revoked at any time, especially when it is conditional upon taking blood tests/breathalizers when asked. 		If you are definitely over the limit, it is still often advisable to not take the blood/breathalizer test. This is because a DUI conviction almost certainly includes the same or worse driver's license suspension, so you're not really losing anything by refusing to take it.... and it will potentially give your lawyer a better chance of defeating your charges in court. Typically, when/if you get the DUI dropped, there is at least a decent chance of the suspension being lifted as well. Though that's not guaranteed, if the choices are (1) DUI conviction and suspended license or (2) Maybe a DUI conviction and suspended license, I'll take (2) every time.		If you're pretty sure you're under the limit, it's probably best to take the breathalizer. If you're unsure, then it's just a total crapshoot.

{"body":"Actually no. The only constant that we know is fact is that people will always continue to drive if they feel they are okay to drive. Just like the war on drugs, you can approach it sensibly with real solutions, or you can approach it with a draconian iron fist by making the punishment so severe that it will actually have a counter intuitive impact on society as a whole. Research Russia's DUI problem. They've gone down the path of zero tolerance and it actually caused a sharp increase in DUI related accidents, because the logic at that point is, "Well if I have only one and that makes me a criminal then I might as well have 10". I know it seems that it is a very black and white "just don't do it" solution, but when you're shaping public policy you need to factor in a little thing called the reality of the situation.		 The reality is people go to the bar and have a beer. That is why bars exist. People go to sports games and have a beer. 99.9% of people can drink a beer per hour for a few hours and be completely fine to drive and well under the current legal limit. Yet for someone reason these people are lumped into the horror stories of people who get blackout drunk, often above a .16, and crash into a bus full of orphans. Law enforcement used to distinguish whether or not someone was endangering society by a series of roadside sobriety tests. Now the only reason those are performed is to entertain the police officer. You could pass every single roadside test with flying colors, blow a .06 and still be hauled off to jail for an 'impaired driving - alcohol' which is every bit as punishable as a .159 DUI, because they failed to use a turn signal at a stop light. Where is the logic in that? 		The real point is that for every person who is pulled over with alcohol in their system there are probably 10,000 people who made it home perfectly fine with alcohol in their system. I mean, have you ever been to a bar? Do you really think any of those people have designated drivers lined up on a Monday evening? Again, I'm not talking about the alcoholics who drink all day. I'm talking about the husband and wife who worked all day, don't have time to make dinner and go to a restaurant and have a tall beer or margarita with their meal. Literally something tens of millions of people do every single day. Yes. Lets turn them all into criminals. That should really help the economy when people are spending their life savings scratching their way out of the criminal justice system. That's a very slippery slope. At that point then you might as well make bars or any kind of alcohol at an event illegal.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"funkmasterastronaut","name":"t1_cr2gxy1","parent_id":"t1_cr2a65m","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431093150,"created_utc":1431089550}

We had also recently been parked for a while without the car running and it was winter so the windows were foggy so it looked like i may have been hotboxing. The cop asked me if i could step out and if he could take a look, I could have yelled at him about my rights and refused to leave my vehicle and the search, but i knew i had nothing illegal to hide so i played nice to prove that i was just dumb and not driving intoxicated.

But if it was something like here in AZ where you can get a DUI for driving after 3hrs of you legitimately having 1 beer, and thus blowing say a .005-.01% BAC, then it's a bullshit system and the cop was probably a rookie trying to rack up some points. The solution isn't just letting this guy go and continuing on, but I would hope he would put whatever power he had into changing the laws. 		Hell, you can get a DUI in AZ and a number of other states even if you have a 0.0% BAC and they're just dick cops. 		No article has mentioned any details and I'd wouldn't argue any direction without knowing it. But if it turns out he was over .08 or whatever the limit was there, fuck him and the town needs to change their local government completely.

It's funny how many redditors will agree with your argument, and many other arguments along the same line as yours, because it's an example of political influence getting in the way of an young/un-influenced officer.

I'm sure many users here have experienced both sides; novices who try to nail every single offense to you, and those who are experienced and know what laws are bullshit and that you are truly doing no harm.		I've seen both sides. Pulled over and accused of illegally carrying a firearm by a rookie cop, yet his *partner* backed me and the law. Case dismissed.

I had a beer on the golf course multiple hours prior and was driving home from dinner, he was near where I had some spirited fun with my car and pulled me over in suspicion. Gave me the breathalyzer and I blew less than a 0.01, he explained how he was obligated to give me the test, that I was driving perfectly fine (ie. straight within the lines, stopping properly, etc. ) but that I should be more careful in an area like that and the entire state, because he legally would have been allowed to give me a DUI "ticket" then and there.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sub116610","name":"t1_cr1wusd","parent_id":"t1_cr1r39o","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431041172,"created_utc":1431037572}

{"body":"I grew up in a small Oklahoma town.  When I was 16 years old and riding home at night on a motorcycle, a 14 year old ran a stop sign with his headlights out (since he and 2 friends were out stealing watermelons).  I T-boned the truck at 55-60 mph crushing both femurs, twisted lower right leg around, partially crushed two vertebrae and my spinal cord was "pulped".		The cop knew the kids dad.  He faked the police report showing I had a skid mark and the truck did not.  The faked motorcycle skid mark even went off to the side.  This defied physics as motorcycle could not lean to the side and lock up a tire without sliding out from under me.  The truck had actually skid before, through and a bit past the intersection.  The cop also ignored the stolen watermelons (in a ditch by then), left one kid out of the report, and listed the truck's speed as 10 mph.		The District Attorney knew the kids dad as he was a local "crooked" attorney.  So the DA kept finding ways to bury the kids tickets.  It took my dad writing the OSBI, FBI and I don't even remember what other agencies to ever get the tickets prosecuted.  After 11 months the tickets were finally prosecuted in another district.  $5 for Failure to Yield and $5 No Driver's Licence.		Months later we even had the Officer on tape saying, "yeah we still see him driving occasionally but there's no need to pull him over.  He's a good kid".  The fact that the kid was STILL under legal driving age or the fact that he almost killed somebody was apparently not a factor.

I've seen an very old man steal food and even though the cops are called they didn't arrest him. If everything is being recorded I don't want the police to be forced to never give someone a break.

{"body":"I grew up in this town. It's population is under 2000 and the vast majority of them are rural. It's literally a one stop light town where the convenience store is the hub of social activity. 		I'm not being mean, I'm stating truths when I say, the police dept in Chelsea is staffed with not the bottom of the barrel, but the goo that pools under the barrel. When I was in high school they were still driving personal vehicles with detachable lights and magnetic door signs. They are forced to hire people who are rejected from every other law enforcement job. The pay is horrible, benefits nonexistent (see using your personal vehicle as your cruiser), so what that means is a staff of angry, bullying rednecks who only take the job for what they perceive is the glamour, coolness, and power of the badge. 		There is a long history of the police here being lazy, egomaniacal, harassing (both assholishly and sexually), and just all around stereotypical small town bubba cops from the south. 		This town doesn't have a courthouse. You have to drive 30-44 minutes to Claremore to see a judge (or restaraunt that's not connected to the gas station, or hardware store, or grocery store open on Sunday or Wednesday after 5). Since the 2 coal mines left the town has been gradually falling or burning down. The only businesses there either cater to the elderly (who can't/won't move out) or the ranching/farming community. Whether you like it or not, the good-old-boy system is how things are ran. My guess is that Haggard calling in that favor meant he would have consequences somehow and if it was a chronic problem he wouldn't have been given pass. (I'm not here to debate the right and wrongs of the system, just to give inside info). These are people who value loyalty, hard work, and good morals. They are willing to forgive a mistake but won't stand for chronic bad behavior. It's a town where the deputy police chief is also the city manager and also runs the car parts store. Where the magistrate is also the fire marshal, health inspector, school board president, and deputy director of the parks department. The fact that the cop didn't stop when a favor was called in was the odd thing. 		Now, all that being said, i haven't heard ANYTHING about this. Not on Facebook or local news. My gut says it's a he said/(s)he said kind of deal.

He was legally intoxicated but the county attorney refused to prosecute on "lack of evidence" despite my report, the PBT, and intoxilyzer results.  About a month and a half later, I got called to the city council meeting where I was told I was being let go because they had just redone the budget and said there was no longer any money to pay my position despite the fact that they had just previously approved paying to send me through certification training.

I've gotten to know a lot of people and have had the privilege if working with the police department and see just how far they have come from the department that was known for the criminal police chief that was in the red financially and only giving this little town a bad reputation to now having an amazing chief with great officers that will go out of their way for someone in need and know the difference between right and wrong and they show that every day while doing their job. Now I am saddened to hear that all they have worked for may come to an end soon all because they did their job and protected who knows how many lives in the process but unfortunately the offender in this was someone of importance to the city council. They	 are the real crooked people of this small town. Those who believe they deserve to be above the law and can do what they want. All because this officer did his job protecting the public now his job and the Chief and Assistant Chief are rumored to be losing their job soon . This isn't right people! This is terrible news for anyone that loves this little town like I do. So I'm asking those of you that want to help keep this little town safe and fight corruption to stand with me and support the Chelsea Police! The town meeting is next Tuesday night and these officers need all the support they can get.?????#???Isupportthechelseapolice???","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chelseajustice","name":"t1_cr240m6","parent_id":"t3_357h7p","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431054279,"created_utc":1431050679}

{"body":"This reminds me of the story of that rich kid who stole beer from a convenience store, then went drunk driving and crashed into 4 people, killing them. That kid got away with just a few years of probation because his family bought off the Justice system in the court he was served at. The judge, the lawyers, the jury... Everybody got bribed. The funniest/most maddening part is the piss poor excuse that the lawyer came up to explain the kid's situation. He called it "Affluenza" and it means that you're so rich and privileged that you weren't raised with a strong enough sense of how you should behave or what you should and shouldn't do despite the law. And the judge BOUGHT IT. Affluenza is something I'd come up with when I'm on the damn toilet. Imagine what the reaction of the families and friends of the victims when the kid was released with just probation... Fully expecting justice to be delivered, but missed the mark thanks to some clown of a lawyer and his judge and the parents who put the whole damn court in their pockets.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Schlafenkopf","name":"t1_cr23e6m","parent_id":"t3_357h7p","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431053113,"created_utc":1431049513}

He approached a sobriety checkpoint and because he did not know his BAC... he turned around and a patrol car followed him and pulled him over. He refused the breath test and was promptly carted off to jail. His girlfriend called the regular  lawyer he used and the lawyer delayed any blood test until the bac had gone down enough  for him to pass. He had his license suspended for a year. He then hired a lawyer specializing in DUi defense. This was in a county and in a city that had it's own court system. The Lawyer was a judge with the county system. He repeatedly delayed the city court case with various motions ...all the while petitioning the city courts to allow the county system to handle the case. Both court systems operated from the same courthouse. Once he succeeded in that, the case came before a judge that the lawyer was acquainted with and the police officer was asked by the judge if there was any evidence that this man was drunk? No Sir was the answer since the man had been locked up immediately with out any roadside test or any other test. 	The court hearing happened after the 1 year suspension so he got his license back.... with no dui.		It cost about 8-10 thousand dollars but he did not spend 30 days in jail.

{"body":"Anarchy means the total rejection of all social authority (that includes government). Complete individual freedom in the absence of enforced law.		Anarchy and rules (which is a form of law) do not meaningfully exist in the same environment. Total individual freedom in the absence of government (ie an authority structure that monitors and enforces acceptable behavior) means that rules and agreements with other people can be discarded when not advantageous at any moment with no other repercussion beyond what the wronged party will do to you in turn.		What this means is that in anarchy, your neighbor might agree to a pact of nonviolence because it suits his needs but if he deems such a pact to no longer benefit him (let's say he's starving after a bad winter), there's nothing stopping him from murdering you for food, beyond what you can do to stop him. If someone steals from you, and you cannot punish the theft, government and its laws will not exist to aid you. Anarchy is not designed to protect the individual, only unburden them from social consequence.		The double-edged aspect of Anarchy as a philosophy and political system is that it stands in opposition to and cannot exist in the presence of law. Inclined individuals who wish to commit wrongdoing have much less to risk with no active form of authority to punish them. While most people will choose not to commit crime, there will be enough who will, that you will have to account for the potential for violence in every social situation you encounter.		Government has many serious social problems (corruption, tyranny) but it also provides what I believe are necessary components in a functioning society: law, and structure. These social institutions prevent our population from preying on itself and help build fragile social constructs (like school) that cannot effectively exist in environments of wide-spread violence.		Every example of failed government, where anarchy and chaos reign (Liberia, Syria, ect.) has shown that such places become death traps. Life expectancy, access to healthcare, functioning infrastructure, ect rapidly diminish while simmering and restrained social hatreds explode into outright and open interfactional wars. Opportunistic violence and looting spring up from the chaos. Ordinary people get caught in the crossfire and die everywhere. Forcing whole populations to either uproot their lives and flee or stay and face inescapable, constant violence while the country descends into total anarchy.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Wubwubmagic","name":"t1_cr2cp7d","parent_id":"t1_cr24lnm","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431077028,"created_utc":1431073428}

It's funny that you bring this example up to prove your point. Involuntary manslaughter is a crime that results in a death because of a negligent or reckless action.

On Violence - Violence requires intent. You cannot be "recklessly violent" or "negligently violent". Your recklessness and negligence can still result in injury, which would be its own crime, but you are not "violent" in that sense. So, unless you can show an intent to injure in the mental state of the person committing DUI, it's not violent.

However, the general rule is 1 drink per hour will keep a man under the .08 limit.  The hard and fast rule people have to follow is to not drink and drive.		As to the undue harsh punishments, here the punishment is up to $1000 and 10 days in jail.  Most 1st timers on a DUI only have to do a class and victims impact board, then they can get their license back.  Remember driving is a privilege not a right.  So if you abuse that privilege, by endangering others, you can lose it.		Finally, the penalties are harsh for repeat offenders because they do endanger themselves and others.

The reason behind that, I'm betting, is because you think 125% makes your point more forceful (and, somehow, more correct?) than having to use 25% with slightly different wording that is both more common and maintains clarity of meaning.

If I said he exceeded legal limit by 25%, that would also be correct, either way can say the same thing, and either way he was impaired.  So you called me on nothing and your complaint is BS.		2.  The punishment I mentioned is the max permitted by statute, not what he will face.		3.  How he gets to those classes is his problem given that he chose to drink and drive.  He could have called someone like the city manager (he wanted to come get him anyway).  		4.  While you may consider driving a right, you would be in dramatic disagreement with all 50 states and the Federal Court System.  Unlike actual rights which require no proof of competence or proof of responsibility, in order for you to legally drive a car, you must show that you are capable of handling a vehicle (driving test), responsible for accidents (insurance requirements), and willing to obey the traffic laws including legal limits on alcohol.  Failure on any of these things results in the inability to legally operate a motor vehicle.		As to being a functioning member of society without the ability to drive, perhaps he should have thought of that before he chose to get behind the wheel drunk.  I would argue that he was not being a functioning member of society when he chose to get behind the wheel, he definitely was not being a functioning member of society when he tried to use his connections to get out of the citation and arrest.  Part of being a functioning member of society is following the rules that the duly elected members of society enact as laws.  We may not agree with those laws, but that is why we have courts to challenge the legality of the laws, and we can elect other leaders to replace and repeal those laws.","depth":9,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chop1125","name":"t1_cr1vfxb","parent_id":"t1_cr1usk0","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431038765,"created_utc":1431035165}
