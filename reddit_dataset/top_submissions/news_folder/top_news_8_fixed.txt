The best part of reddit really is all the interesting little subreddits created by the community. Compare this with votable which has only 25 networks on the site. Worse, out of that 25, 10 are gaming related and 0 are programming or news related, which make up a lot of the subreddits I visit reddit for. 		Also, I deselected Minecraft as an interested network, but still received a message about how to take part in the minecraft youtube community (from minemaniac). I am not interested at all in this.  		So votable holds little interest for me in its current state. If you are planning on adding community created networks, and reduce the minecraft integration for people not interested, I can see it becoming a great website.

Agree with you, currently votable seems to only appeal towards people interested in minecraft or gaming. when we first launched we had a ton of different communities but found it very difficult to gain traction with little activity in a lot of communities so narrowed it down to be more specific and were able to get some growth going.

{"body":"I think the main problem (in terms of going to another site) is that reddit's design is so simple and *mainly* pretty easy to handle. From everything I've seen, that's one of the main reasons why facebook didn't fall to the G+ shit or whatever. Facebook (as a social networking site) and reddit (as a forum site) are about as simple as it gets -- though both can do better, obviously -- while also coincidentally being *fuckin HUGE* already. 		IMO the only possible site to take over facebook will be something that incorporates twitter, instagram, and the other fuckin 10 sites that involve short comments and/or pictures. It'll also allow more personalization just like myspace, except it'll be limited to what the developers allow (no random shitty songs playing full-blast when you click on someone's profile).		Reddit will be taken over by a site that allows for more (limited) customization as well -- you can play songs on someone's profile, etc. The search function would obviously be fuckin awesome and easy to navigate. You could make "friends" without having to tag people and/or randomly find them in a thread. With one click, you could browse your "sports" subreddits, or maybe your "gaming" subreddits, or whatever (you wouldn't need to type a bunch of shit into the URL).		Also, in light of recent events -- moderators would be obligated to adhere to various sitewide rules (you can't randomly ditch your sub as the head mod, you can't randomly change the sub into something completely different, adding/removing a mod would depend on an official vote that involves users, the mods, and maybe even an admin as well; hate speech can be regulated based on the head mod's opinion, but in controversial situations, it would require a confirmation from 1-2 other mods; vote counts remain unseen for 1 hour (on defaults, and similar subs, move it up to 2-3 hours), but then will be shown. 		Almost all of those are small benefits that require little-to-no sitewide structural changes, and they'd solve a decent amount of issues. IMO the main overarching problem is that reddit doesn't have enough money to hire the 10-20 extra guys that it probably needs if they want it to function *well*. Victoria was good at scheduling/hosting AMAs. I'm good at doing that too, for free. If I'm reddit, why the hell am I not looking for some PR/advertising/business guy who has a background involving similar shit? And why did I not already hire them like a month ago before firing Victoria?		I only basically minored in business (just took a handful of classes), but that shit's one of the first things you learn.

{"body":"Here they all are. It's kind of sad this was one of the top rated AMAs. The guy with the cum box answered more questions than this.		**Question 1**		> SharkGirl: We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?		> Obama: Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although their will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.		**Question 2**		> PartyInYourMouth: How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to impliment for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?		> Obama: We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.		**Question 3**		> karlfranks: Who's your favourite Basketball player?		> Obama: Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.		**Question 4**		> Silent1mezzo: What's the recipe for the White House's beer?		> Obama: It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.		**Question 5**		> Suzmerk: What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?		> Obama: Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.		**Question 6**		> Fifth Surprise: What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?		> Obama: The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.		**Question 7**		> Daveforamerica: What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?		> Obama: Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.		**Question 8**		> hmlee: I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?		> Obama: I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more. 		**Question 9**		> gobearss: How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?		> Obama: It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

But even if muh freedoms isn't what you want to talk about, it finds you. The fact that you're on voat means that it's a given you agree with the voat ideologies.

I have enough sjw hate in my life right now. I spend hours of each day playing a game with people who have views that are opposite of mine, and I keep my mouth shut just so I can play.

So that quality rises and shit posts fall to the bottom. This would work without any visibility of the scores. Making scores visible actually adds nothing positive to that system.

Also it creates a bit of a mob mentality as well in that not all but a lot of people are more likely to upvote a comment or post that already has a ton of upvotes... same goes for downvotes.		The upvote/downvote system could fulfill it's intended purpose without scores of any kind shown to users, and we'd get a more honest experience as a result.

{"body":"It's the best way for many things whether you like the saying or not. Obviously it doesn't apply to everything, and if something feels 'stagnant' maybe it's time for an upgrade.  	One of my favorite things about Reddit on a mobile browser is how basic it is. It loads up quick and I don't have a stationary menu bar on the top of the screen and a Toyota ad at the bottom that I will inevitably hit 9 times while trying to scroll in the 1 in. space left of the actual page.  	Many people would call it 'stagnant' or 'boring'. I don't think you fix something that has gotten 'stagnant'. I think that's where upgrading comes in. The point I was trying to make with 'Don't fix something if it ain't broken' wasn't that as long as everything still works, you should keep it exactly like it is forever.

{"body":"I don't think they can fix it. 		Here's my opinion (take it as you will). A site like this (community based, forum 2.0) cannot exist as a profit making enterprise. The problem is this type of site relies on unpaid personal to create content and moderate that content. Creating content you might be able to get away with, but moderation of content is a pretty fucking thankless job. The only reason people do it, put in the hours they do, is because they love the community.		As soon as you start bringing in profit motive, it corrupts the underlying community. Suddenly moderators are second class citizens. Now they're not volunteering for a community, they're volunteering for a for-profit corporation to help pad their bottom line. 		I think Wikipedia has it right. Wikipedia has a whole BUNCH of volunteer "moderators", but since it exists as an idea, not a profit making enterprise, those moderators feel like they're making the world a better place. Facebook on the other hand, has been relatively successful at monetizing itself, but it also doesn't rely on volunteers.		Basically, I think you can either build an internet venture for profit, but ensure your business plan can afford to pay everyone you need, or you build it as a community (using something like gold to pay for servers) and you bring together like minded individuals to help drive your "vision". Whenever the 2 try to mix, bad shit happens. 		On the positive note, something else will pop up soon. Some community that strives to keep things "pure". Of course, they'll be bought out in a few years as well, but then we'll all just move on to something else. Eventually investors will realize that some things just can't be monetized.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gilthanass","name":"t1_csr17aw","parent_id":"t1_csqm7g3","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1435938825,"created_utc":1435935225}

{"body":"This is the question/comment that pissed off Jesse Jackson 		*"Mr. Jackson,	You are an immoral, hate-filled race baiter that has figured out how to manipulate the political system for your own gain. You've personally set back race relations year after year and continue to do more harm than good. Extorting money from companies to line your pockets and threatening to bus in protestors and create a fake racial controversy if they don???t agree to pay you off is NOT civil rights activism. My question is simple; how is your relationship with the illegitimate child you fathered in 1998 while cheating on your wife? Bonus question: How much money have you extorted from various people and companies over the years of practicing your shakedown scheme? Do you think Al Capone would be jealous of your business model if he were still alive?"*		His response:		*"I do. But I was jailed in 1960. For trying to use a public library. And that caused more good than harm. I marched to end segregation. The day Dr. King spoke on Washington, in 1963, I was there for that speech. That day, from Texas to Florida, you couldn't use a single public toilet. We could not buy ice cream at Howard Johnson's, or stay in Holiday Inns. We fought to bring those barriers down. And because those walls are down, all the new interstate construction across the South - the new bridges and ports, and seaports - that's progress. You couldn't have teams behind the Cotton Curtain. You couldn't have had Olympics in Atlanta behind the Cotton Curtain. You couldn't have Toyota, and Michelin, behind the Cotton Curtain, so we pulled those walls down.	So our work has been beneficial. And it seems to me that people who benefit from that work ascribe it to the wrong reasons.	When the laws change to make the South more civil, that brought in more investment. So we've made America better.	All these changes have come from our work. Our work has bene good for the South, and good for America.	My goal is to expand our consciousness, to create as big a tent as possible, as we fight for justice and world peace. I was able to bring Americans home from jail, from prison, and gaining those freedom of those Americans was the highest and best use of my talents and time."*		https://archive.is/jouWQ		I have to say though that Jesse Jackson has shown time and time again that he is pretty good at segregating communities.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tzuridis","name":"t1_csqp5e5","parent_id":"t3_3bxueb","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1435902201,"created_utc":1435898601}

{"body":"I'm no fan of Reddit's executive and administrative style.  But I will say a few common sense things to at least consider as food for thought.  		Corporations do have the right to fire nice people, often for no good reason.  Nobody should be surprised when this happens; we've trained corporations this is acceptable, and we've given them laws that encourage it. 		We similarly shouldn't be surprised when they clean house to install people who like executives new ideas which may at first glance appear to be senseless, like video AMA's.  		A corporation may not wish to give advance or retroactive explanation to their administrative staff about such moves, and they would almost never want to leak a pending termination to a ring of volunteers either.  Granted, this closed approach may backfire, and certainly when most of your site is generated by volunteers, alienating them is probably beyond stupid, but it's still the normal corporate playbook.  		Ideally they would have explained if it's Victoria's *function* that's been chopped or changed.  They clearly blew that.  They also should have been ready with an action plan for handling the immediate void, and proactive communication about what to expect for day 2 to whatever's next.  		People shouldn't forget the intrinsic deal here: users get a free platform to use and abuse, and the platform provider gets the free benefit of the collective efforts of millions of users.

If they're getting more professional, they need to a) have their marketing function understand their own fucking user to a rudimentary degree - this should be so simple it's unreal, b) have their HR staff and board members start demonstrating competence in managing organisational behaviour, in terms of motivation and so on, and c) go and learn the basics of change management, because they're fucking up on a really fundamental level.

{"body":"It's not even the idea that she's 'Irreplacable' that's got the IAMA mod team, and others, upset. Consider the following...		The relationship between Administration and the Mod Teams has been strained for quite some time, now. Instead of working on and issuing proper Modding tools, much of the burden has been left to the Mod Team to figure out how to function. Now, if they were paid employees, this would not be much of an issue, but the Mods are volunteers. Volunteers are meant to operate within a very specific set of parameters ("Monitor X sub for X-type of content that violates global rules and remove", "Maintain subs and remove flamebait and trolling", etc.), not work as employees for free finding solutions that the paid staff are supposed to be paid to fix. And the fact that volunteers are expected to take on the roles of paid employees is just one straw on this massively-strained camel's back.		Victoria had a large role within the IAMA community, on top of being one of the few Admins that still had a decent reputation with the community. When the Admin Team let her go, they didn't have a plan going forward on how to alleviate the impact cutting her loose would have. In fact, it looks as if they had no clue what she even did in the first place. Alexis is still finding out what the scope of her role in the company culture was, and this speaks to an inexcusable isolation of the Admin Team-proper from the rest of the community, much less one of their fellow admins. Talk of Ivory Towers comes to mind.		Had staff been aware of the full scope of what Victoria did for the community, and had they formed a plan going forward for how to cope with not having her around, your mention that this would only disrupt the next few AMA's would be true, and barring a short transition period while they found someone to fill Victoria's shoes, we would have been right back on track. Instead, you have the following issues:		  * Spur-of-the-moment firing	  * No communication whatsoever between the Admins and the communities that would be most affected by said firing	  * Utter ignorance about the role said employee filled in the company, displaying an inability to ensure those roles would not be left vacant after said firing	  * Complete radio silence now that the massive volunteer staff is frustrated at the obvious impulsiveness and incompetence, as well as lack of communication, from the Admin Team, thus compounding the original problem.		In short, this is a conflict that has been bubbling underneath the surface for quite some time...the firing of Victoria under the circumstances that were so, was just the incident that nudged the pressure cooker just the right way to get it to pop. In the process, since all other approaches to get the Admin Team's attention to address those issues has failed, the Mod Team is attempting to force the issue, in a last-option approach by affecting Reddit's revenue stream. Private defaults across 75% of Reddit means massively reduced pageviews, which means ad revenue plummets.		Sure, it would be nice if there was another way, but if there were, I think the Admins would have addressed those issue by now, and we wouldn't be having this discussion.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrazyInAnInsaneWorld","name":"t1_csqzvs1","parent_id":"t1_csqxxb9","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1435935904,"created_utc":1435932304}

I could watch CNN and get the same thing.  		Just my opinion, but the sub is called "ask me anything", yet the overwhelming majority of questions being asked by readers have no chance of even making it to the celebrity, much less being answered by them.  Reader/audience participation is basically an illusion since everything was filtered through Victoria.  To me, that just makes the whole subreddit about as real as professional wrestling.  If the celebrity has no knowledge of what they're getting into, they can do some research.  And if they have a PR team of their own filtering out the tough questions, I'm (reluctantly) OK with that.  But if I were to ask a question, I want to have the same shot as everybody else who asks a legitimate question, and not be pre-filtered out of the running because mine wasn't a pre-approved softball question.		That all being said, my understanding is that it's a business decision anyway since some celebrities pay for the AMA, which means it's not going to change any time soon.

{"body":"The fattening I can *sort* of understand.  Mods posted pics of the imgur staff (most of whom have a right to be considered private citizens), named them as such, and started dogging them.  Fine.  It's weak logic, but at least you can pretend.		But this?  This is just plain *dumb*.  You do not pull this trigger without a backup plan in place.  AMA was the single most popular feature on reddit.  It was the feature that brought in millions of page views - and lots of ad revenue.  And to a) have it dependent upon just one staff member in the first place, and b) have absolutely no plan in place for dealing with the loss of that staff member shows a complete lack of business sense.  Tack on terminating that staff member - in complete silence, mind you, relative to the community that depended on her - and then not actually putting even a *pretend* backup plan in place makes it so much more obvious that this was a trigger-happy move by someone with no cares for where that bullet went.		There have apparently been a lot of issues between mods and admins lately.  Problems with communication on this issue notwithstanding, the admins have (as the rumor mill would have it) become more and more insulated as the community has grown.  Issues like the broken reddit chrome extension have apparently had no answers given, which suggests that the development team, such as it is, either hasn't got the time, scratch, or interest to make the site better.  The fact that all of the best extensions - or even any extensions that work - are all thirdparty, and that the mobile interface is completely unusable, suggests that the dev team is running shortstaffed and without good oversight.		And now Alex Ohanian is having to reply to problems about losing Victoria.		Here's the problem: Ohanian is not a staff member.  He's the executive chairman - that means he's on the board.  He doesn't do day-to-day ops of the company (or he damn well shouldn't, that's why the board hired Ellen Pao).  If Ohanian is replying to comments about this, why isn't Pao?		Chances are good it's because Ohanian doesn't think that the userbase trusts Ellen Pao right now.  And that, right there, is the biggest problem of all.		When you are a website CEO, you *must* have the trust of the user community.  It doesn't matter whether it's reddit, or digg, or myspace, or facebook.  If the user community turns on the CEO, or turns on the leadership in general, the user community LEAVES.  And when that happens, pageviews go down, ad revenue goes down, and the site collapses.		Right now, we're watching the community start baring its teeth.  I don't want to be overdramatic, but how reddit responds to this will make or break it.  If the shit really does hit the fan, the site will surely survive, but it probably won't be anywhere near as vibrant or as mature for a very long time.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"shapu","name":"t1_csqp81x","parent_id":"t3_3bxueb","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1435902360,"created_utc":1435898760}

{"body":"I really don't know the details or have followed anything much, so feel free to correct me.		From what I gather Victoria wasn't liked very much as it appeared that she heavily moderated AMAs in an excessive way and always pressured it into certain directions like so that a celebrity can talk about their newest pet project for publicity or whatever or to discourage certain questions. Apperantly she would also delete questions asked and then asks a different or heavily reworded question afterwards. She would remove criticism or negativity and turn tough questions into easy to talk about and around "easy questions".		Though I may be ignorant to the process but I don't see the problems with setting up an AMA.		You have like one moderator to contact or be contacted to set up AMA dates and write it into the calender and then you have a bunch more to moderate ongoing AMAs in a sensible way... like deleting the usual no-nos of hate-speech, racist remarks, threats or extremly inappropiate questions.		Edit: After reading up some more on this it appears Victoria was pretty popular after all because she served an important function. Though if one person missing causes such disruption then there was a flaw in the organisation to begin with imo. It just shows why you shouldn't overrely on a single person to handle everything.

In fact my main issue with this site is the rampant bigotry so I have more of an issue with the defaults allowing real hatred to be spewed. But this is an important issue as well, I really do believe the reddit team did an absolute shite job of planning for this firing and like I said if we didn't have a plan in place for someone leaving on my team heads would roll, this would be absolutely unacceptable. They did not properly communicate with the mods that would be affected by Victoria leaving, AmAs are incredibly useful for this site and drive a lot of traffic and somewhat legitimize the site. By screwing the mods over who run them they really shot themselves in the foot.

Not everyone agreeing with the subreddits going private are agreeing for the same reasons as me, for sure there are many who are just looking for a reason to get angry and push for voat or some alternative.

It can't just be left to shitty mods. Maybe I'm off and I don't know what I'm talking about, maybe you're right, but I don't think it's as simple as writing this off as reddit drama.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thegatekeeperzuul","name":"t1_csr2koi","parent_id":"t1_csr27gi","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1435941625,"created_utc":1435938025}

I love everything about Reddit (save for a little extremism towards certain sensitive topics), but I can't help notice the slow progression of censorship on this site. I remember when a deleted comment was something that required investigating because it was so interesting and mysterious; I'm so desensitized to it now that it doesn't even catch my eye while scrolling through the comment sections. I just assume someone angered the gods and were given swift repercussions. It seems like a somewhat small issue outside of the Reddit community, but this feels like a step towards a very controlled site. This group should not have relied on a single human for being responsible for many different, arguably unrelated aspects of their site. This concept has gotten so much larger than what they can apparently provide for. Given Reddit's significance in spreading news, knowledge, and communication to so many people, even so far as to give a group of otherwise unrelated individuals a collective voice, I can't help wanting to preserve it. If this ship really starts sinking, there are a LOOOOT of Redditors who can help in making an arguably better experience for the average user than what will most likely be provided in the future of this site. I dunno, this almost feels like when the Discovery Channel and History Channel went down in a ball of flames, but this time it's a community where preventing such an explosion is legitimately possible through enough effort.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"scurriloustommy","name":"t1_csqsa6p","parent_id":"t3_3bxueb","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1435909820,"created_utc":1435906220}
