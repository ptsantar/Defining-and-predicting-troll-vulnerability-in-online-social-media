{"body":"I've been a yelp user since almost the beginning, and have written my share of reviews. But even I have to admit, the reviews are nearly always basically garbage. I've seen my own good reviews get filtered out for no obvious reason. Even if there is no malice or manipulation, too many people just don't know how to rate or review food, which is why your locak Dennys gets 5 stars while your awesome neighborhood Italian or sushi place has 4. It might have been a good idea at one time, but it's been ruined by gaming of all sorts. 		Amazon's star review have essentially the same problem. Any product, no matter how terrible, will have a flood of 5-star reviews.

You are to bring me extra napkins, but not too many as I don't need the table feeling "full" That cup of water you placed on the table has made it small, I need that large table over there, the one that 20 people got up from. and chop chop, clear it quickly. Don't you do anything right  around here? Remove the sugar container off it also so it feels less cramped and ONLY bring ONE at a time when I ask for it. Your sweet tea sucks also, and why are you bringing only one packet of sugar at a time? Can't you do anything right? Bring the whole box out so I can actually make sweet tea, not the vile bagged crap you pass off as tea! Better remove that off the bill also. Who put this big box of sugar here? I come here to eat, not feel like it's a damn warehouse. Can't you fill the sugar containers on tables when I am not around? I don't care it's 24 hours, remove the damn box!		My room smells funny and I can't hear myself think over the air conditioner that won't turn on. I demand a upgrade to your highest sized room, top floor with a excellent view of your areas most prized asset.

I feel bad for a lot of sellers on Etsy that get the bad review here and there due to Post Office faults or for things out of their control. Not to mention people tend to forget that color calibration on monitor for products will make the colors look slightly different. 		I also don't appreciate 1 star reviews for Etsy shops that sell scented things like lip balms, perfume, soap, etc. I can understand giving 3 star reviews due to the scent not being what you were expecting, but a 1 star review when the seller shipped in a timely manner, packaged it neatly, and even when they include some freebies. Yet customers feel like 1-star review is justified for not liking the scent of something. You're taking a risk buying scented things online.

{"body":"Here's the abstract for the study you cited:		>Consumer reviews are now a part of everyday decision-making. Yet the credibility of reviews is fundamentally undermined when business-owners commit review fraud, either by leaving positive reviews for themselves or negative reviews for their competitors. In this paper, we investigate the extent and patterns of review fraud on the popular consumer review platform Yelp.com. **Because one cannot directly observe which reviews are fake, we focus on reviews that Yelp's algorithmic indicator has identified as fraudulent.** Using this proxy, we present four main findings. First, roughly 16 percent of restaurant reviews on Yelp are identified as fraudulent, and tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews, or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants -- which benefit less from Yelp -- are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to leave unfavorable reviews for competitors. Taken in aggregate, these findings highlight the extent of review fraud and suggest that a business's decision to commit review fraud responds to competition and reputation incentives rather than simply the restaurant's ethics.		The study sampled reviews that *Yelp itself* flagged as possibly fraudulent. It's obviously and categorically worthless as evidence of whether Yelp are creating fraudulent reviews to extort listed businesses. Yelp actually *hides* reviews they label as possible lies; you have to click a link at the bottom of the business's listing to view these flagged reviews on a separate page, and the link is explicitly labeled as "flagged" or "possibly fraudelent" or something (I forget exactly what). 		Why in the hell would they label their *own* BS reviews as fraud, and hide them from the main page for a business? How would this help them extort anyone, if that's what they're doing?		That study examines whether outside entities, particularly a listed business and its competitors, might be posting reviews to manipulate their own and each others' ratings. Their chosen data set is not used, and cannot be used, to credibly clear Yelp itself of bad behavior.","depth":4,"score":30,"ups":30,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_ckd6ew9","parent_id":"t1_ckd0phh","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410240955,"created_utc":1410237355}

It was very clear who wrote it, and we knew for a fact that she had not set foot on our property since we opened.  Made me pretty infuriated at yelp as there was nothing that could have been done especially as the review had little to do with the food (which she said was mediocre to poor, but anyone can have an opinion) but that it was an all out lie that we bought pre-cooked food and microwaved it AND that our kitchen was a health code violation. Kitchen was used in a documentary and local cable cooking shows and was used as a walk through example of correct kitchen health and safety practices for 2 local high school culinary programs and in my 5 years their never once had a public health official cite it for anything.  I certainly didn't pay my staff what I did and work 100 hours a week to microwave food.  Yelp's reaction after finally finding a human being willing to communicate was, "you can't get it changed and you better not criticize the review online either or else!" or else what we never did find out.","depth":1,"score":88,"ups":88,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cheffgeoff","name":"t1_ckd0b5x","parent_id":"t1_ckcusob","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410228174,"created_utc":1410224574}

They will never complain even if you get your their wrong, will be pleasant and tip overly well at all times. 80% of people are pretty normal. They have good days and bad days, complain when they have a right and reason to, will be helpful and will be selfish depending on the time and circumstance. The last 10% are just jerks. Total assholes. They lie, cheat, steal, are selfish and lazy and are here solely to make your life miserable. All of these people make reviews now a days, whether on line or a professional journalist making reviews. Take your best 10% and throw them out, take your worst 10% and throw them out.

How it works: If you trust someone's opinions, you follow them.

The positives: it obsoletes many current types of gaming the system, and makes some others more difficult.		The problems: a much smaller pool of reviewers to factor into your weighted score, the people who can't be trusted to review products/services intelligently actually are the people we think we trust, still possible to be gamed just in some new ways, potential privacy concerns if done incorrectly. Could benefit greatly from an "open" social network, but existing social networks will fight tooth and nail to prevent that.		It might not be the magical perfect solution, but I'd just like to see a good, solid try to see how it works in practice.

I went from a 3.8 to 4 ish average rating and about 20th in my category pre-advertising, to where I am as of right now which is 4.6 and 3rd place.

So from a business owner's perspective, I'd say I'm pleased with the way my advertising dollars were spent. From a consumer's perspective, on the other hand, I never use yelp anymore when I'm on vacation.		Edit: from the responses here and my own experience it seems more likely to me that yelp isn't outright manipulating my ranking and score, rather the advertising attracts more of the kind of people to my business who are likely to write positive reviews.

{"body":"I have the unhappily ever after version of your story.  	My family owns a small restaurant in mid-sized tourist town and has for about 30 years. Since Yelp's inception we've maintained a solid 4.5 stars. A few years back, we were contacted by a Yelp representative asking if we wanted to advertise with the website. We declined as our advertising budget had already been spent elsewhere. They were quite aggressive - calling often. We declined each time. Over the next several months, we noticed many of our 5-stars being sent to the filtered section. Slowly our total score dropped to a 4 with many great and legitimate reviews being filtered and not counting towards our total. The Yelp sales reps said they had absolutely no control over which reviews got filtered and which didn't - that it was all up to their automated algorithm.		It started to become very obvious that Yelp manipulates their star ratings. We had 5-star reviews that were filtered on our page, but similar reviews by the same reviewer stayed up on other pages that advertised with Yelp. We run a weekly event hosted by another company who advertises with Yelp. Many times after an event, customers will separately review the show (the other company) and the food (us). Our good reviews seem to get filtered while the other company's good reviews seem to stick, even though the reviews were made at the same time and by the same reviewer. 		We also noticed many of our good reviews were being filtered because the reviewer didn't have enough total reviews to be credible. Yet most of our not-so-good ratings, coming from reviewers with 3 or less total reviews, remained unfiltered and skewed our score downward.		I can appreciate Yelp as an avenue to connect with my customers as well as a place for them to share their experiences, but there is no way Yelp can try to tell me that they don't charge for their reviews. The easiest solution would be to just give in and advertise with Yelp, but I can't bring myself to give these crooks any money.","depth":1,"score":445,"ups":445,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"CapnBabyPuncher","name":"t1_ckd22qt","parent_id":"t1_ckcyxds","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410231608,"created_utc":1410228008}

When the AD and IT guy questioned me, they knew I hadn't sent any messages using the program because of logs or whatever, but they wanted to give me detention for starting the whole thing. I told them that I *hadn't* told anyone how to do what they did, but *even if I had* I wouldn't have been breaking any rules, since telling other kids that programs exist on the school computers didn't violate any student policies. They thought about it for a second, realized I was right, and I never heard about it again while all the other kids got detentions.		There's no way I would have gotten in trouble for it anyway unless I came out and "admitted" to doing it, because I was a good student and they weren't going to go try to pin a detention on me for something a few kids said.

{"body":"I work for a series of sites that could be considered "Yelp competitors".  I'm in marketing, and one of my core duties involves ensuring the integrity of our review system, in addition to our listing content and geographic information.		You would be shocked at just how much review abuse goes on.  Whether it be sock puppet accounts, review spam, and the rare occasion where someone goes and doe votes their competitors, it can be down right frustrating to deal with it all.  The worst part is how crucial many people consider reviews to be; it gives businesses massive incentive to abuse the process.		The sock puppet accounts are fairly obvious to identify, but only if you have access to the metadata.  If you create a series of new accounts at the same time, with the same IP address, and post reviews for the same business you're probably dealing with a sock puppet.  Rarely these accounts post bad reviews, but they do occasionally.  Companies would rather make themselves look good than their competitors look bad though, and our company removed obviously fake bad reviews.  There are rare occasions where it's hard to know if someone is a sock puppet; a restaurant may have free wifi which could look like suspicious activity when it's really benign.  Of course when a roofing company has 6 accounts created from the same IP address which is also the one used to manage the business profile, it's obvious.		The spam reviews are a bit harder; the text is sophisticated enough to pass through some of our more simple filters.  You have to look at commonality in IP addresses, time stamps, and other fields not visible to the general public (user agent string and cookie, for example).  We block updates from Tor exit nodes, so at least you can't beat us that way.  But with the prevalence of anonymous proxies, VPNs, and botnets for hire a purely IP based blacklist system is useless.		I sympathize with Yelp, I really do.  Until you see exactly what levels some people will stoop to, it's hard to understand exactly why Yelp does what they do.  I'd love for my company to adopt an algorithmic approach to displaying reviews based on how likely they are to be genuine, but that's not in the cards, for fear of getting the same bad reputation as Yelp.		This all said, if Yelp truly does remove bad reviews for paying customers and promote bad reviews for non advertisers then shame on them (they say they don't and it's never been conclusively proven, so I personally give them the benefit of the doubt).  No ethical or honest business would ever do that, and if I was asked to do that to our review system I'd simply refuse in principle.		edit:  also, fuck locksmiths with a rusty spike.","depth":0,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"macromorgan","name":"t1_ckd5rx5","parent_id":"t3_2fueg9","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410239389,"created_utc":1410235789}

After you buy in they put most of the good ones on top, but will have a slightly negative one within the first few in order to give the illusion of impartiality. Its abundantly obvious to me and if one gathers enough data from biz owners it could be proven it and have their algorithm in no time.		If you must use yelp as a consumer, always sort by date. Never let "YELP SORT" for you. 	NEVER USE THE MOBILE APP. ALWAYS USE DESKTOP.

If approached by yelp as a small biz, always be polite and give the impression of buying in later but don't buy in. There really is no need.

{"body":"Reading just the judgement, your post is misleading because it's not so much that the ruling says Yelp doesn't filter its reviews, but that people with no contractual link to Yelp apparently have no right to influence which reviews Yelp decides to show or hide, as this is Yelp's own practice; the judgement in fact seems to accept that Yelp does filter its reviews (from p.19 onwards). The "insufficient evidence" you claim to contradict the allegations of review-filtering is actually simply that this filtering of reviews seems to be too difficult to connect to actual economic loss, and that the claimants did not plead under trade libel law (I don't profess to know anything about US law and how it works, but the footnote suggests this may have actually been effective).		The contention only comes where Yelp allegedly authors their own positive/negative reviews to benefit/punish people who subscribe to/refuse their advertising offers. In this case, the evidence brought to bear (p.24 onwards: Yelp paying people to write reviews for them, getting their employees to write reviews etc.) cannot be directly linked to the specific incidents the claimants claim, but are instead general.		As such, your claim that the ruling contradicts Redditors saying that Yelp filters their reviews is completely untrue; it does show that there is a lack of evidence that Yelp authors *all* its reviews, or even in any specific incidents, but it's clear, at the very least, that the possibility is very real for any establishment they review, and that saying otherwise is flying in the face of the actual ruling.		In a given hypothetical scenario, even assuming your establishment isn't important enough for them to pay people to write reviews for you, the hiding/showing of your most negative or positive reviews can be a huge deal in the ratings/visibility game.","depth":1,"score":57,"ups":57,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sentrovasi","name":"t1_ckd1yg2","parent_id":"t1_ckcz2p2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410231386,"created_utc":1410227786}

"Describing the allegations that Yelp manufactures negative reviews as ???entirely speculative,??? the district court concluded that the Third Amended Complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to support a conclusion that Yelp authored content."

Edit: I checked your page reference, and would also like to add that the parts you quote from are a summary of the District Court's judgment, not the judgement of the Appeals judge.

{"body":"Yelp and John T. FUEAD :)		The .5 star chit baggers at Yelp filter out the higher ratings because "they are more likely to be false".  This is what I was told by Yelp personnel after I received/disputed a negative review. The negative review came from a client we worked for 5 years ago. I called/emailed both my client and Yelp with no positive results. Even though I had every email, documentation proving  the scope of work was complete and statements from my employees testifying my client never met them, Yelp wouldn't do anything about the negative review. 	So I did what any small business owner would do. I contacted a few clients to help boost/balance my negative review.	What did Yelp do? Delete the positive reviews, block positive reviews and left the negative review up higher on my company's profile listing.	Then I found out my clients, were being bombarded with spam mail from Yelp.	Most small business owners would just keep asking numerous clients to boost/balance their company's rating, not me. Yelp hasn't earned the rights to my clients information. I have not and will not ask another client to create a Yelp account. 	Yelp's business model: keep negative reviews prominent placed, business owners then ask their clients to boost/balance out the negative reviews, which Yelp blocks and in the end Yelp gains another user. 		Incidentally, my company's negative review came from an Attorney, my reply/rebuttal makes him look like a cake eater! :)     	http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-fix-it-home-services-hagerstown-2		Comment from T J. of Mr. Fix It Home Services 	Business Owner	1/31/2013  Mr Attorney John T.

{"body":"Seriously, I never trusted Yelp or any one of those other rating/review websites anyway!  Two reasons:  A lot of reviewers/people are unreasonably fickle.  As another Redditer mentioned, there are tons of one star reviews that were given based on something trivial like getting a 6am wake up call a few minutes late at a hotel, or the not being seated promptly enough at a popular restaurant they had no reservations for in the first place.  It's quite silly, really.  Then you have the other side of the coin.  What's to stop those business establishments from bribing patrons to write great reviews even though service might in fact be terrible.  There's a well known nightclub in NYC, that shall remain nameless, that comps your first couple round of drinks provided that each member of the party write a shining review on yelp/trip adviser etc.  Never mind the fact that waitresses in this particular establishment are notoriously rude, yet they have a stellar rating on all the review sites.  		So the point here is, always take the reviews with a grain of salt.

{"body":"I worked for Yelp back in 2010 for about a year. I was an account executive, meaning, I sold ads. These accusations were going on then just as they are going on now. And unless something's changed, I can tell you with absolutely certainty, this isn't happening at the company. As someone who sold ads, I never once possessed the power to remove negative reviews. EVER. I was just a phone jockey, I didn't even know any of the engineers that could MAYBE have the power to do this. We didn't talk to them. They didn't even work on the same floor as us.		Now, business owners have come out and said salespeople from Yelp have offered them this kind of deal, but I can tell you with 100% certainty that whatever it was that the salesperson said, it was said in such a way to only make them THINK their reviews will get better. It's actually very common that a business owner would ask me, "how can I get better reviews?" For an account executive, you try to always steer the conversation to the sales pitch. This is a good "open" question a potential client could ask us. And you can bet any sales person will see this as an opportunity to sell the power of Yelp. 		So, here's how it would play out. The salesperson would explain that when you advertise with Yelp, they can increase your exposure to people searching for a restaurant like yours. And by increasing your exposure, you get more customers through the door. And when you get more customers, you get more reviews! But does that mean your reviews will be positive? No. But ask any proud business owner and they'll tell you they're the best. So by this point, they're sold. 		However, there are SOME business owners that misinterpret this sales pitch as, "I give you money, you give me positive reviews." Especially ones that are disgruntled by all the negatives reviews they have, and want nothing more than to have them removed.		And what about all those reviews that get removed? Well, they don't. But I bet those disgruntled business owners, based off their misinterpretation of the sales pitch, think  that it's a deal they can make happen. In reality, the reviews get "filtered out" by the absolutely awful review filter Yelp has employed in hopes of weeding out potentially "untrusted" and malicious reviews. It's an awful filter, but it's actually designed to help the business from getting spammed and keep their reviews honest. In my eyes, I think it's a complete failure, as it does more harm than good. Reviews written by people who've been writing reviews for years are getting their reviews filtered. I think the review filter is what people should be really talking about.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"readditafterrreddit","name":"t1_ckd1xw0","parent_id":"t3_2fueg9","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410231358,"created_utc":1410227758}

If you even read my post you'd know that people in IT don't even get on the phone with clients. You would also know that I CLEARLY states I never once had the power to do ANYTHING IT-related.		Also, you don't believe me? I really don't care. Thing is, I haven't worked at Yelp since 2010, and to be honest, I hated that place. But that was because it was high-pressured sales, something that just ended up not being for me. I'm not even in sales anymore. so I really don't have any reason to lie about any of this.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"readditafterrreddit","name":"t1_ckegts6","parent_id":"t1_ckdbnne","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1410368798,"created_utc":1410365198}

{"body":"Long time user of yelp, know several employees and mangers in the company (but no one in sales thankfully). They give me the same reasonable explanation anyone with a brain does - any place where you can make an account for free will breed fake reviews. It's up to you to be part of the community and have friends you can trust for real reviews, whether or not you know them in real life. Then you can read their reviews and get a better idea from people you know.		The explanation for 90% of reviews getting removed is pattern-based algorithm recognition for fake reviews. This includes the fact that you have 0 friends and 1 review. Or 5 reviews.		My friends in the business have acknowledges that fake reviews will get through, and real ones will get filtered, but tough shit that's what it's like on a open community review site, particularly one that's as popular and has as much sway as any other. You can even pay for services to get 5 star reviews, and I know of some that trade reviews for free service. But how can a company actually stop it? Good luck. 		Also, it's like a given fact that almost every business owner thinks they deserve five stars cuz they're the fuckin shit. Oh, I'm mean to my customers and I get 3 star average?
