{"body":"I recently bought some prescription meds from a place that doesn't accept insurance and only sells generics. The same generics from a regular pharmacy that does accept insurance is about 3x the price... *after* insurance covers ~80% of the cost.		I asked the dude how they can provide such low prices and he said that insurance companies only allow your store to accept their payments if you jack up the price of all the things they cover.","depth":2,"score":682,"ups":682,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NakedAndBehindYou","name":"t1_cs04m9o","parent_id":"t1_crzzx7h","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433818421,"created_utc":1433814821}
{"body":"Sort of. Generally, the way most insurance works is they negotiate (or simply state outright, depending on your provider/pharmacy size) that they will pay X% of your usual and customary rates (UCR) up to the maximum price the insurance will pay for the item. That maximum price is not something they reveal. So when your pharmacy wants to get paid for a prescription, they have to ask for as much as they reasonably think they can get in order to get the full payment (and in some cases, that just barely covers the drug cost and your co-pay is pretty much what the pharmacy gets to cover everything else and profit). As I said though, the insurance company doesn't just pay a fixed price, so if the pharmacy submits a claim for a drug for $3 and that's under the max reimbursement, that's all the pharmacy gets. If the same pharmacy submits a claim for $30 for the same drug, they might run above the max, but they'll get $25 back, which is much better than $3. As you can see, this immediately gives pharmacies (and likewise providers) a significant incentive to keep prices high. 		But remember what I said about UCR above? That enters into it too. Your insurance company doesn't want to be ripped off. They want (reasonably and for your own sake as well as theirs) to pay the least they have to to get services. If they're reimbursing a pharmacy based on $30 claims and then audit the pharmacy and discover that they've been selling the same drug to other people and insurance companies for $10, your insurance company would reasonably demand to be re-paid the monies they overpaid to the pharmacy. So if your pharmacy started doling out prescriptions to the uninsured and charged them just a hair above cost, while billing full retail to the insurance companies, eventually the insurance companies would find out, and either try to take their money back or simply reduce reimbursement to the pharmacy to match the new UCR, effectively ending the pharmacy's ability to operate since that likely wouldn't meet expenses anymore.		Now there are some ways to dance around this issue, usually with "cash immediate pay" discounts and the like, but ultimately the insurance companies are wise to such tricks and watch that like a hawk as well.

{"body":"Sometimes the price just goes up either because generic manufacturers stop manufacturing a drug (there was one recently whose name escapes me, the drug is still currently on backorder everywhere because pretty much all the generic manufacturers except one tiny one have stopped making it). Other times, it's increases because of real cost increases (e.g. shipping). Having to buy brand when generics are available is probably the worse situation to be in though. Your pharmacy will (if they're lucky) get a little bit more reimbursement for the brand, but likely not anywhere near enough to cover their expenses. If you don't have insurance, you should contact the manufacturer of the drug in question. Lots of times the brand manufacturers have programs and deals to help defray the costs (they have an interest in pharmacies buying their product, witness the large amounts of money lipitor recently spent on commercials trying to convince people to have their doctors insist on brand name lipitor). Depending on your circumstances and the programs available, it might even be free.

{"body":"Bearing in mind I'm not a pharmacist, just work very closely with them, the gist of it is that while generics are legally required to have the same active ingredients and be in the same form (tablets, capsules etc) they are not required to have the same inactive ingredients, which are all the extra bits that make up the pill itself, binders, fillers and dyes usually. Depending on the the drug, different generics can actually have different release characteristics (how long and how quickly the drug enters your system) but as long as they fall within the legal guidelines for effectiveness, they're considered equivalent. 		There are some drugs where switching between generics is something your pharmacist and doctor should be talking about because the medication is so sensitive to inactive ingredient changes that even though they're legally generics, there's a high likelihood that you will have a different outcome. 		Sometimes, people are just allergic to something in the generic's inactive ingredients. Like an allergy to red dyes for example might mean that if the only generic is manufactured in a pink pill, you may not be able to take the generic.		All that said, for most people, most of the time, generics are just as good as the brand and you probably want to at least try them (baring your doctor or pharmacist saying otherwise) since it will save you money.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"omega884","name":"t1_cs0hcfy","parent_id":"t1_cs0gtt0","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433854854,"created_utc":1433851254}

{"body":"Yes and no. Think about it from the perspective of each actor. Your pharmacy wants to make the most money they can (reasonably so, they're a business, they have workers to pay and expenses to meet). They know the insurance companies will pay some amount, they just don't know exactly how much, so they charge an arbitrarily higher amount until most of their claims aren't paid in full and then use that as their markup (say AWP [Average Wholesale Price] + 20%).		Your insurance company on the other hand, wants to pay the least. The less they pay, the more profits and the lower they can keep their premiums (I did the math on this once. As a rough estimate for an average person over their lifetime, your insurance company needs to bring in about $300 / month just to break even on your lifetime medical expenses). So they audit the pharmacy and make sure they're not getting ripped off (which is exactly what you would call it if you found out a store was charging you and only you $500 more for something than everyone else).		It's less a scam and more conflicting interests that both feed into each other to raise prices in the long run. That isn't to say there isn't scammy crap going on, because there is. My favorite is that insurance companies will have reimbursement adjustments from time to time to reflect changing costs (e.g. a generic stops being manufactured, only a brand or one specific generic manufacturer is a available, prices go up). By their contracts, they're usually obligated to post those price changes effective a certain date. Sometimes though, they're a bit ... shall we say slow. Oh sure, when the reimbursement rate is going down, (newer generics) the change goes into their computers immediately. But when it goes up ... well sometimes that might take a day or two to fully process. The change itself is effective two days ago, but your pharmacy would have to notice that their reimbursements went up for a drug, and reverse and rebill the claims from the past few days to find when the change actually went into effect.","depth":5,"score":129,"ups":129,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"omega884","name":"t1_cs07mtq","parent_id":"t1_cs079mj","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433823829,"created_utc":1433820229}

{"body":"I'll chime in.  I'm currently in school studying Risk Management and Insurance.  It is true that insurance is protection against outrageous billing practices, but it is kind of a vicious circle.  The example I always use is a broken arm.  Lets just say a broken arm costs the doctor/hospital $10,000 in total.  Your insurance has usually already negotiated a set price for a set schedule of fees.  So the insurance decides that a broken arm should only cost $5,000.  The doctor is now having to decide between not allowing that insurance or taking less money.  So hospitals, knowing that insurance is going to negotiate down must inflate costs, to be able to recover their expenses even after insurance has negotiated it down.  Which of course hurts uninsured americans.  But the cash price can't be dropped because then the insurance will renegotiate for a lower rate.  So while it is awful, sending people that are uninsured into debt/collections or just writing it off is the cost of doing business to keep insurance paying back fees.		Also, of course the ACA benefitted insurance companies.  It is now a federal law that you must have insurance, which drives up sales of insurance.  But the net benefit is even though insurance companies benefit, now those people have health insurance.  People will also roundabout benefit, because the ACA is also going after companies with penalties for not offering insurance or paying enough that employees can seek insurance on their own.","depth":7,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kingfisher6","name":"t1_cs0cb83","parent_id":"t1_cs09ceq","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433835193,"created_utc":1433831593}

{"body":"The largest problem is that we use insurance to cover routine and expected care. What everyone should always remember is that for 90% of the people insurance (of any type) should be a losing game. Insurance is a bet that you will incur and expense in a given period. You pay X (a very small amount compared to the expense) and in exchange, the insurance company pays the expense if it comes to pass. The insurance company is betting that you won't have this expense, and hoping to keep your premium.		It should be obvious then, what the problem is when you use insurance to cover routine and expected expenses. It becomes less insurance and more of a delayed savings and group discount plan instead. Ideally, the way the system would work, you would pay cash for everything at your PCP, all general lab work, some minor outpatient procedures (basic X-Rays, etc), and routine maintenance drugs (BC, asthma meds, antibiotics etc). Your insurance would then kick in to cover major medical expenses (which is why health insurance used to be called Major Medical Insurance) like getting into a car wreck, cancer, that sort of thing.		The obvious problem is determining what you should pay in cash vs what you should charge to insurance, and in theory that's part of what your copays and deductibles are supposed to handle. Unfortunately, people (reasonably) don't want to pay a lot of money so over the years, we've encouraged insurance to cover more and more and more expenses while trying to reduce or eliminate out out of pocket costs. This has resulted in a world where even if your broken bone would normally be something you'd pay cash for (and would normally be affordable as such) the providers are stuck charging largely inflated prices because the insurance companies for other people are covering that cost and demand lower prices.","depth":6,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"omega884","name":"t1_cs0jalx","parent_id":"t1_cs07neg","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433859764,"created_utc":1433856164}

{"body":"That's not how taxes work, and that is not the reason behind the inflated prices.  The hospitals do not get a $200k tax deduction for writing off those bills.  The inflated prices have more to do with squeezing every last cent they can out of the patients - they are fleecing the unfortunate people that *technically* have the ability to pay those absurd inflated prices (even though it will wipe out all of their life savings in the process).  The business model is essentially scaling the cost of care according to the patients' income/net worth.  The hospital sends them the inflated bill, and then tells them if they can't pay, the hospital will work with them to reduce the bill.  The hospital will typically ask the patient to provide personal financial information to them proving their hardship, and then will scale the bill down so that they take every last cent they can from the person, while leaving them with *just enough* to make declaring bankruptcy not really worth it.  So instead of having to pay 10x the cost of care, most people might get away with paying only 2-3x the cost of the care, some get away with paying nothing, and every once in a while there is some poor sap that winds up paying 10x the cost of care.

{"body":"Well sort of. Generally you should expect a markup on medication averaging 4.6x hospital purchasing cost. This is for several reasons. 1St being is that it's a starting point used to negotiate with insurance companies for reimbursement. Insurers and hospitals have contracted pricing for goods and services. Sometimes there is some negotiating on that depending on the circumstances. Both are trying to save as much money as possible. The average total return on investment despite the 460% price increase is only about 2-3% currently. Meaning you make about a 2-3% annual profit on departmental expenditures. People don't realize how much multi-million dollar equipment is being used in hospitals. Most of which is leased. So there's that cost, plus purchasing, plus staffing, and a Fuck ton of waste that happens for a variety of reasons. 2) prices are calculated to adjust for overhead since pharmacy and surgery are usually where most hospitals make cash to reinvest in the system. Need newer buildings and equipment to provide the best care.			The reason people get fucked is because you can only rework the pricing so much before insurance companies start crying foul and demanding lower prices as well. You can always work your bill down with the right help. The truth is there is quite a bit of money that gets flushed down the drain everyday in waste and charge offs that is rarely discussed outside of internal meetings. It's a fucked up system I happen to be a part of but it isn't just made up numbers as people think. A lot is just politics between healthcare providers and insurance companies.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"scag315","name":"t1_cs08ppa","parent_id":"t1_crzzx7h","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433826043,"created_utc":1433822443}

{"body":"EDIT!!! -- I was just sitting watching the Wire..again, and I'm seeing gold coming through multiple times.  THANK YOU for that!!!  I just want to get people some information so they can know about the lunacy rather than speculate about it.   		Time magazine did a absolutely fantastic article that covers some of this.   "Why Medical Bills are killing us".  This article had enough impact that many places have it up in PDF in its entirety (not Time Magazine, but...so be it).  Here it is.   Read this, it will give you more information than 99% of the people out there have.  NOTE:  It's a long...long article - it has to be, this isn't an easy thing to explain nor attempt to fix.   FYI - This was sent to me in 2013 by multiple CMOs (Chief Medical Officers) as well as a healthcare CEO.   They know this, and believe it or not - some of them out there, are on your side and hate the system they have to work with.		http://www.uta.edu/faculty/story/2311/Misc/2013,2,26,MedicalCostsDemandAndGreed.pdf 		FYI:  This article doesn't get all of it right - it's aspects on reimbursement are quite wrong, but other pieces of the puzzle it gets very right.		As usual, there are people replying to a post, in this case yours, and they really are not informed about what happens/why it happens.  This isn't a slight against you mutatron, but I thought you might want to know why this is as it is.  NOTE this doesn't excuse it, it just explains it, as it works here in the US.		Hospitals buy software from huge medical informatics companies like Optum-Insight (who is owned by United Healthcare).   This software is called a CDM, a Charge Description Master, or "Chargemaster" for short.   This is a price list of every action in the healthcare industry down to each singular procedure.   This price list is compiled under "black box" type of scrutiny, and their formulas as purchased software, is not known to even the hospital.  The hospital then has a whole group of people dedicated to changing the Chargemaster if need be.  		The formulas for pricing are calculated with some very complex  and deep measurements as created by the original Healthcare Informatics company that built the software.    		This price list has an absolutely outrageous markup to it - 10x - 20x or more for things.		The running theory as to why the pricing is so insanely high is because it is making up for the massive shortfall from medicare and medicaid funded patients.   Medicare and Medicaid reimburses insanely low -- often 10x or 20x less than the procedure actually costs to do.  The discrepancy is so huge, and has been going on for so long, that it's caused a massive spike in other prices to make up for the shortfall.  This is also the reason why many facilities are refusing to take new Medicare and Medicaid patients (they can't refuse existing patients or emergencies).   When you hear someone say something like "medicare reimbursed $6.36 and yet they charged 240.00! - what a rip off!"  keep in mind that just because the govt reimbursed 6.36, doesn't mean that's what it cost.   what the procedure actually cost is probably around 80 dollars in this case.    		Now - the insurance companies know all this.   And each insurance company works with this differently.   Some companies use a blended discount, i.e. they cut any price they receive from the hospital in half, and start there for their baseline, and then pay/deduct according to your plan's coverage.    Some insurance companies have negotiated out most or all services on an individual basis.   		The rate of discount that the insurance company gets depends on often, how large and powerful that company is in comparison to the health care facility they are negotiating with.   This negotiation happens fairly often (there was even an episode of House where Cuddy refused the negotiation and they lost their insurance network till she gave in		Edit: cuddy won, the insurance co gave in, I'm in error. The reference still applies ).   Even single percentages means millions of dollars in volume, so this negotiation is pretty serious, and can cost someone their job very quickly.		Now, lets say you don't have insurance.   the bill you get is the chargemaster price.  You might get a lawyer to knock down...30% or get a lawyer and an independent coding expert to knock it down closer to a small insurance company, but on your own?   Very few facilities will reduce anything.   		This short fall isn't a write off.  It's basically them charging a huge price and then negotiating down from there.  It's only a write off if none of it gets paid, which isn't as common as one would think, however a hospital's revenue cycle (i.e. from when you walk in the door till when you pay your first bill) is, at a good facility around 200 days (yes...that's a good facility - hospitals strive to get to 200 days) 		What keeps the lights on?   well, you won't believe this but, medicare and medicaid reimbursements do.   Even though they are a massive shortfall, they are paid in a 6 day turnaround! (it's by far the most efficient section of the US government, it might be the only one...) 		So they basically "float" on small, but immediate money to hold them until insurance pays out/individuals pay out.		That's how it works in the US system.    		Don't even get me started on the mess that is pharmaceuticals....that one, the drug companies are robber barons, and their pricing models are lunacy.   		Source:  I do lots of healthcare informatics work for several different companies ranging from public health insurers to medical malpractice slush fund holders.  I've kinda become the "healthcare" guy when we have that type of client....if given an option, I'd rather be a "go-cart" guy or a "vodka" guy, but so it goes...  		**EDIT:**  Some people are arguing that my medicare and medicaid quote about massive underfunding isn't true.  I know first hand it's true as I've seen the accounting books and compared wholesale cost to reimbursement.  However, I can't publish that.  What I can do is point to articles out there that touch on this a bit.   The average underfunding for the nation varies - I've seen the number for the average to be ~60% of what everything costs, i.e. total underfunding (differing based on what is called "Payer mix" - i.e. what kind of facility they are, the bulk of types they treat, and their geo location and urban/rural classifications.  Inner city facilities are lower, and inner city facilities in low reimbursement states really suffer depending on the procedure and frequency it's done).    However, this does not take into account the specifics of each procedure in each state and it's there that you see some states are far closer to getting either all, or even more than all of their cost back - and others where it's absolutely a devastating loss.    The same procedure is reimbursed to drastically different amounts depending on what state it's performed in.   One that's talked about quite a bit is "27447" which is "Total Knee Replacement" as well as other treatments like cancer and cardiac care.     There are small amounts of facilities and doctors making money on medicare and medicaid - most do not, and in many states as I've said, docs and facilities are refusing new medicare and medicaid patients.   People that are saying otherwise are just not right nor are they telling the full story.  Please note that this underfunding isn't a political party line, though it's been argued as such at times.  It's not political, it's just right now - how it is.		Here's a article by CNN - but it's not telling quite everything and it's making the numbers seem better than they are by only talking about procedures that are "close" (80% reimbursement is way too high, but still...), but it will give you some idea that this happens:		http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/21/news/economy/medicare-doctors/ 		here's a quick article about this from forbes, but know that if you look, there are many more out there.   		http://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillmatthews/2015/01/05/doctors-face-a-huge-medicare-and-medicaid-pay-cut-in-2015/ 		This is an older article from Forbes but it speaks to this underfunding as well.		http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2012/08/07/health-affairs-study-one-third-of-doctors-wont-accept-new-medicaid-patients/","depth":1,"score":270,"ups":270,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Capolan","name":"t1_cs04l0q","parent_id":"t1_crzxdb6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433818363,"created_utc":1433814763}

{"body":"Transparency is a double edged sword.  Here's how I've talked about it in the past.   If you went to your auto mechanic and asked what was wrong and they said, "well, it could be "x" or it could be "y" or anything in the entire chain between those things"" You'd want to know how much each of those things cost and you'd want to make a judgement as to what you will and won't do.		the problem is - this doesn't apply to healthcare because everyone says the same thing "oh it's my health? well do everything doc! do it all!"    When a doc is selective and makes a judgement call, they then run the risk of being sued - and in turn you get what you have now which is defensive medicine, i.e. over treatment to avoid missing something.  		We've put docs and healthcare providers in a bit of an impossible situation.   i.e. "don't do anything that in hindsight is un-necessary, but you better do everything you can!"  		Medicine has "art" to it - and often that's not accepted.  The body isn't a machine that is easy to fix and as you know - comorbidities and complexities can be staggeringly real.  		A big thing right now is what I've heard called "appropriate use" which is the idea of doing exactly enough - no more, no less.   Many companies out there are trying to find these thresholds of "no more no less" but it's very very difficult both because it's not a simple problem, and because the actual data needed to find this sort of thing is just not there making what is there statistically irrelevant to a large degree.

{"body":"We're the country with this permutation of the same problem, actually. Medicine costs plenty, even if we got down to "true cost," the whole of it isn't an inexpensive concept. Other countries pool together through taxes the funding to pay for medicine, acting like a nationalized insurance company, and other countries take it further and actually administer practicing medicine as well as payment. You can imagine if you have the government acting as the equivalent of both the insurer and the provider that it makes it a lot easier to figure out what a procedure costs.		So why do we do it this way and not that way? Why did it take so long to even address the idea that so many people had no insurance and therefore couldn't reasonably seek healthcare? You tell me. Go read the jibber-jabber from before the ACA was passed how we were all going to die if we did it that way, or how there is so much anger about illegal immigrants getting healthcare under this system. The thing that always gets me is that people who have a position more akin to "why should I pay for my neighbor or the illegal immigrant?" is that they don't realize that they already are in some ways. It's been a law since the 90s that the emergency dept can't turn people away, and guess where people who don't get regular health care end up when things get terribly worse? Riding a $700 carriage to the ED to get a high dollar work-up.

Let me translate that: You got to the ER and were assessed by at least two professionals - a registered nurse and an ER physician.

On average you also got about 30 minutes of the nurses time. They did at least an EKG and basic labs - that's probably at least 300-500 of that bill - because it's more expensive to do labs real time (you may have to run a whole batch for 1 patient, while when you get labs as an outpatient 10 are done at a time). You also received an IV and I am guessing IV fluids. You were on a cardiac monitor while you were there (which is monitored by the nurse, and any abnormalities reviewed by the doctor). You also paid a premium for everything because you accessed a 24 hour service. If there is a lull in patients coming in at 3am, the hospital can't just stop paying the nurses and lab techs and xray techs until it picks up again at 6am. So you paid extra because there ER is there day or night. Not to mention the cost for the hospital, doctor and RNs to maintain malpractice insurance.		Patient care is often like a play.

And if he was uninsured and met income criteria, at the hospital where I work, he probably could have gotten that cut down to $1000.		Funny story: the hospital system I work in got busted a couple of decades ago because some of the affiliates were not pushing the charity care system to patients who were uninsured. We're a not-for-profit system, and part of the regs are that you have to have a charity care program with income based discounts. We had that discount in place at every affiliates, but some were leaving it to just a tiny sign in the waiting room so many people got the full bill... bad shit.		So as part of the spanking we got, every hospital at ER registration has to provide information about the program to every uninsured patient. Where I work, we give people this nice glossy folder with forms in it, information in English and Spanish. It's really slick.		Now here's the funny part. My system started making *more* money on self-pay patients after this was instituted. Basically most people want to pay their bills for services they recieved. However if someone making 30k a year gets a bill for $5000, that seems imsurmountable, so they are less likely to even try. However if you tell that person that because of their income, you will be discounting it to $500, most people will try to pay it. They may only be able to pay $50/month, but they will do it. So once we gave people bills they could see being able to pay, they did. 		A friend of the family actually had his appendix removed at the hospital where I work and he was uninsured at the time. (He made OK money but no one would insure him because he had asthma and diabetes - and this was before the ACA.) They discounted it to $4000 and he paid the whole bill.

{"body":"I appreciate your elaborate reply but you are missing my point.		I understand the bill is justifiable to you and everyone who works in the field and you might even try to save as much $$ as possible but the problem lies with the fact that a hospital bill that is 500x the minimum wage is simply not sustainable. It just isn't. A re-structuring of healthcare costs is in serious need. There is a ridiculous amount of waste in most hospital, mostly centered around redundancy to avoid malpractice suits or because something is federally mandated. You mention patient monitors having to be replaced every few years. Why? Regulatory requirement most likely which is why the US is the biggest re-seller of used medical equipment. I've been to European hospitals where they used decently older equipment but never did I felt I received poor care. Europe tends to re-use a lot more (autoclave usage is a lot more predominant) and the regulations allow it. The sad part in all this is that most hospital regulations were not introduced to benefit patient health (or the benefit is barely incremental) but rather because someone is selling something. Add good old fashioned lobbying and you have a perfectly good monitor that needs to be replaced every 3 years (and the manufacturer pockets some $$) instead of going the distance.		I understand you have a reason for the monitor replacement (and probably a good one), but all our standard medical practices need to be reviewed. Will it negatively impact patient care? Probably, but at 500x minimum wage most people can't even get care, period. It is a system doomed to either fall or be overhauled.		Still, you have my utmost respect.

In a country overflowing with guns, escalating an issue to involve guns is much easier and is done much faster and with more long term consequences.  	  	Besides, if your country is so shitty you are living in fear and think you need a gun to survive, maybe start fixing your shit country rather than screaming for more guns? Guns are not for protection but reaction.

{"body":"According to the published RAMQ price sheets, the cash price for the Advair 100/250/500 Diskus (all with 60 doses, apparently with varying mcg but idk) costs $75.79/$90.69/$128.74, which in USD is $61.34/$73.60/$104.48. Pharmacy costs may add a bit more to that.		You pay $25 per month, but I guarantee that $25 is a fixed copay set by your insurance company. How much do you pay for THAT? The prices I listed are CASH prices, people have additional drug insurance that usually covers a sizable percentage of that cost... Even just the provincial plan has pretty decent cost scaling, there's currently a monthly deductible of just $16.65, then you only pay 32.5% of the cash price past that up to a maximum monthly contribution of $83.83/month, and yearly charges are capped at $1006/year (all prices in CAD). So let's say you want to buy the max dose $128.74 drug, after deductible that's $112.09, then your co-insurance cost is only $36.43 CAD, which is $29.56 USD at the moment. Pretty solid for the provincial plan -- I'm pretty sure that most private plans are even better than that at reimbursement coverage. Yes, the pharmacy will usually charge a bit extra on top of the drug price, but it's not huge.		Edit: I forgot to add the $16.65 CAD onto that, but that's just $13.51 USD more, so final cash price is $43.07 -- of course this assumes that you take only this drug.

{"body":"And the reason that system is fucked isn't the hospital, it's the insurer. If I could bill $300 for treating someone for a heart attack and get paid $300, that's what I would charge as an ER physician. However if I want to approach that, I need to charge $1,200 in order to get insurers to give me $300.		And that's why we also offer a self-pay discount, and a prompt payment discount. If someone is self-pay, we charge them what Medicare pays for that service. Realize that if you accept Medicare you can't charge people less than what you charge Medicare. If I charged someone without insurance $10 for care, Medicare expects me to charge them $10 too. If you do this and get caught, Medicare will ask for years of money back and fine you out of business.		You can get around this to some extent by 'prompt payment discounts'. Basically you can have a policy that if people pay at least a portion of the cost upfront, you can give them up to a 50% discount. (The reasoning is that you don't have to go to the trouble of billing them and you get your money faster).		So say you come in with a laceration on your leg. I would like to get paid $125 for it - of which I will see probably $75. I list the price as $400 so that insurers will give me something like $125. Medicare says 'fuck you' and tells me they will pay $80. I take that because I know I get a bit more from insurers. Then if you are uninsured and poor, Medicare lets us charge you as low as $40 for a prompt payment discount as long as you pay something up front.		I always carry dollar bills with me at work, because when uninsured patients ask me about cost, I explain the system. If in the odd circumstance they don't have a dollar to their name, I give them a dollar to give to the clerk on the way out so they can get the prompt payment discount. 		Is it a load of horseshit? Absolutely. Do I game the system? Also absolutely. Did I make the system? No. Do I get blamed the existence of the system and for my gaming it and get called a greedy asshole all the damn time?

{"body":"I fell pregnant a few months after moving to the US. I didn't know I was pregnant and became really ill and was in agony so my husband rushed me to an ExpressMed Clinic which was where I found out I was pregnant, but they said it sounded like I was having complications so I'd need to go to the hospital across the street for a simple scan.		At the hospital I told them I was uninsured and couldn't afford to be there but they promised that the scan would only be between $100 - $150. The scan confirmed that I had a large cyst and that the fetus wasn't developing as it should be, so my options were to either wait it out in agony and rapidly losing weight (by this point I was 80lbs) and have the inevitable miscarriage or have an abortion elsewhere. Since I didn't have insurance to cover my deteriorating health I opted for the abortion, but the hospital refused to agree to give me the OK to go and get one, and told me that nowhere would perform an abortion without their go-ahead, so I'd have to keep returning to them until I had my miscarriage. I was new to the US and was clueless so I believed them.		One night they called me saying they had found something serious on my scan and that I needed to come back first thing in the morning for a second scan. I turned up and they performed the scan and then told me afterwards that I had been contacted "by mistake" the night before, but that I would still have to pay for this scan too.		In the end I did go and get an abortion after asking a lawyer if what they were saying was true about me needing their discharge forms for me to have an abortion. I then went to Patient Relations to complain about the $3000 bill they had given me, telling them that I had been tricked into coming back and that they had told me my scan would be $150 max, and the woman there (Gloria) told me that if I filed a complaint I would be deported back to my home. HA. I filed a complaint against the entire hospital but was still told I had to pay the $3000, but then the bills simply disappeared, so I think someone on their end finally felt sorry for me (a lot of the women in the billing department got very upset when I told them what had happened).

{"body":"Mostly because this has been a race to the bottom.		It used to be that doctor's billed insurance, who basically paid what the doc billed. Then in the 70s HMOs started to pay less.... initially they would pay just 90% of the billed cost. That was tolerable because some of the billed cost was 'fat'. For example, physicians would bill an insured patient more to cover the care for uninsured patients that they would see for free. So doctors took the decreased reimbursement and just didn't do as much 'charity care' (which eventually led to the nightmare circumstances that resulted in the passage of the EMTALA law).		Well, the doctors took 90%, so then it was pushed down to 80% and you get the idea. Then insurance companies made deals with 'preferred providers' that if they saw their patients for 60%, they could be assured they would get lots of business... so some doctors took that deal and made up for it with volume (and now you wonder why doctor visits are 10 minutes). This process has just continued until the situation we have now.		However it's been driven by the insurers, not the physicians. HMOs (and other managed care products) were initially cheaper because they trimmed that fat... which made fee for service trim the fat too in order to be competitive.		And you are right, it's a mess. But the physicians response is entirely reactionary to a fucked up system. I would love it if I could just see patients and get paid a fair rate for it. And if I didn't have to pay a biller $15 for every patient that I see (to wrangle with the insurance company, fill out reams of papers, etc) I would be charging less.		Moreover the reason that physicians don't like to balance bill is partly because we don't like sending individual patients bills. It's shitty. I wish I just got a salary and worked the hours I'm scheduled and never had to ask a patient for a dime.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bayesianqueer","name":"t1_cs0bpra","parent_id":"t1_cs0bh2l","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433833398,"created_utc":1433829798}

Their perfect patient is someone who never goes to the doctor and just keels over from a massive MI alone so there is no bills sent to the insurer.		As a doctor I want to make decent money.

{"body":"Not only that but "10-12.6 times the cost of care" is a bullshit, meaningless statement. I'm looking at charges 24.6 times higher than the costs right now for anesthesiology (whether someone has insurance or not, hospital billing does not care about insurance category).		Things like ct scans, anesthesiology, diagnostic medicine, etc. have an extremely low ratio of cost to charge because you're mostly paying for professional care (skilled doctors and nurses), while procedures like surgery or physical rehabilitation have lower ratios because they have *predictable costs* like drugs, equipment, tools, room fees, tangible things, etc.		The reason why it's meaningless to point at RCCs is that professional fees aren't included in the figure. Those are raw costs (think: the raw metal it takes to build a car). It doesn't include the doctor's, nurses', anesthesiologist's, housekeeper time. Uninsured and underinsured patients get the benefit of this. Their charges get adjusted. In some cases at a *loss* to the hospital which most nanny states actually step in and foot the bill for.		The "gouging" is because the hospital has to pay it's employees, it's utility bills, its own insurances, and so on. There's also a lot more that goes into it regarding surrounding CBSA's and median wages, but what it really boils down to is mostly wages.		People tend to prefer to get paid for the work they do. If someone's paying "10 times as much as what something costs" what that really means is 90% of what they're paying for is to have someone with a PhD and/or a nursing degree take care of them. How obvious a reality we live in. Meanwhile everybody wants something for nothing and values their own time more than the time of others.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CodeShaman","name":"t1_cs13l85","parent_id":"t1_crzykew","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433891636,"created_utc":1433888036}

They even toss in taxi service to and from the airport and hotel to the hospital, and several nights in an expensive hotel, as part of the sticker price.

If we were on a plane and I had a stone, I would pay you $500 for 800mg of ibuprofen if you had the only ibuprofen on the plane. I'd probably give you a grand for a shot of toradol... or rather that's where the negotiations would start. If all you had was a tramadol, I'd take that too (even though I don't like to take opioids as a general rule).

What amazes me is how often chronic pain patients refuse just about any pain med except for opioids with the complaint that it's dangerous or toxic, yet they [ignore](http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0220_drug_overdose_deaths.html) the [significant](http://www.the-rheumatologist.org/article/opioids-more-dangerous-than-other-analgesics-for-elderly/) risks [of](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/09/the-dangers-of-painkillers/index.htm) opioid [medicines](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/report-highlights-dangers-opioid-painkillers-201501157615).

I was talking about normal people who are in pain. I wasn't talking about drug seekers. They refuse meds all the time - non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, lidoderm, medicines for neuropathic pain, anti-migraine meds, steroid injections, you name it. They are like the dude begging on the side of the road with a sign that says "hungry". Go offer him a bag of food and many times it will get thrown back in your face. He doesn't want food, he wants cash. Ditto drug seekers. They often don't want to try anything that isn't a controlled substance. And it's not just opioids. My favorite is the new thing that people request is Ativan or Valium "because it's the only thing that works for my nausea, doc". The cheeto dust on their fingertips tends to suggest they aren't as nauseated as they suggest.		Similarly if you tell me the only thing that helps your pain at all is an opioid either you haven't been willing to try other meds, or it's not relief from pain but rather the euphoria and high that you get from opioids that you actually want. I'm not saying that tramadol or toradol alone will eliminate pain - but it will take the edge off. And if you refuse a drug that will decrease pain (unrelated to withdrawal) at least somewhat, you aren't really at a 10. Because if you are at a 10 and I have a way to make that even just an 8, no one is stupid enough to turn away that offer.","depth":13,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bayesianqueer","name":"t1_cs1bcti","parent_id":"t1_cs1acty","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433905395,"created_utc":1433901795}

{"body":"Market forces do apply, it's just so far out of the actual consumer's control to not be of benefit. 		The situation with uninsured happens far more often than people realize. Mostly for profit hospitals but does in healthcare in general. 		With insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid, they pick up the bill before you do. You may be asked to contribute a small fee - your copay. Then your insurance pays a negotiated amount that is often below the actual charged amount. For Medicare/Medicaid, since the government writes the program they can pay what they want with impunity. Private insurance will pay negotiated amounts based upon if the health care provider is "in network" or not. If they are out of network expect to pay more. 		The amount any of these entities pay however is never the true cost to provide care. It's not necessarily covering all overhead. For nonprofit hospitals they can write some of this off in taxes and such but not entirely. They can't just give away free care. The nurses, pharmacists, reception, doctors, etc. all have to get paid. The utilities need to be paid so you can get a shower and your family can use the cafeteria staffed by cooks who need a paycheck as well. The hospital however just decides to settle at the amount the insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid pays. 		So what if you're uninsured? Insurance doesn't just pay your bill. It's your negotiator for your cost as well. That comes with lawyers, support staff, accountants, etc. someone with no insurance is at the table alone. So their bill comes with the cost that their care cost with nobody to negotiate for them. What's worse, is that the "cost" ends up being more than actual cost, it may be trying to adjust for what wasn't accounted for because other insurance carriers have been short changing the cost of care to the hospital and they are seeking to compensate. 		**tl:dr If you're uninsured, you have nobody to negotiate your cost for you in healthcare, and your bill may be making up for a hospital getting short changed elsewhere.**","depth":1,"score":128,"ups":128,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"P82","name":"t1_cs051xl","parent_id":"t1_crzytf6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433819172,"created_utc":1433815572}

The problem is not that the insurance companies get too much money, they only make .03 per dollar spent in profit. The problem is insurance itself. Ultimately, the idea of insurance is just inefficient because it causes people to consume health care inefficiently and wastefully. There is no other country in the world that pays physicians 30% of all medical care costs [\(doctors salaries are about 5 times higher in US than our peer countries\)](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1647.full?ijkey=HqIXCdVJkQzLI&keytype=ref&siteid=healthaff). The reason is because we pay for "specialists" and pay for expensive medical treatments like MRIs even when the marginal benefit of choosing these services is incredibly minimal. For example, only 1/2500 back X-rays for lower back pain show an important finding. Thats the reason behind all this. We as americans need to realize that its okay to just utilize primary care physicians. We have to internalize the costs of health care to the individual so that patients actually have skin in the game instead of wastefully spending on services that they don't need. We have no shortage of specialists. We have to get rid of the employer sponsored health care subsidy, and increase premiums on some of these treatments that show very little marginal benefit on average.

Not to mention the mechanism of insurance insulating end users from the actual price, making the price-elasticity force that would otherwise drive supply-side actors to reduce costs so as to undercut their competitors simply not exist.		You end up with insurance being a "king-maker", but also reducing the incentives for hospitals to attempt to bill at the actual cost of care, simply because they know, a priori, that they are not going to get 100% of what they are asking.

{"body":"I agree completely. I personally think the solution is to get rid of health insurance entirely. Private and public. But i mean overall, the goal is to make the health care industry more like a perfectly competitive market (I agree that non-profits aren't going to solve much). So theres a couple things we can do (in no particular order):		1. Malpractice reform. Especially in cases where doctors are suing other doctors to eliminate competition. It's always "you could have saved if you made him do an incredibly expensive treatment before hand!" I'm not sure if there's a way to do that incrementally, as you said. But I don't think it necessarily matters in this case.		2. Eliminate the employer-sponsored healthcare tax loophole. This works on a couple levels. First of all, people need to pay for their own health care. If you're not paying the full (or even a portion) of health care directly, you are going to consume inefficiently. In the long run, this will also increase wages because now employers wont want to compensate their workers in the form of care, so they'll go to income instead. Second, it would help to eliminate job lock, again making life easier for the American working citizen. 3rd, this is by far the most expensive tax expenditure. tax payers lose over $131 billion a year because of the loophole. Get rid of it. 	This is a case where you'd definitely need it to be incremental because wages wont rise right away and a lot of people would be stuck without insurance all at one time. But that's pretty simple. Just phase out the loophole over x amount of years. 		3. Put the money saved from 2 into a fund that invests in cost saving medical technology. Especially things that involve big data. This is exciting because [technology like this is starting to get more popular right now](http://www.elsevier.com/connect/Dr-Eric-Topol-Digital-healthcare-will-put-the-patient-in-charge), and its all on the consumer's side so there's nothing that hospitals or insurance companies can do about it. This will help extremely on the information asymmetry front.		4. Make insurers incorporate reference pricing. This would analyze data on past treatments and determines what is effective, and what is not. The data would be used to determine a reasonable cost is for patients. If the patients still want to see the ultra expensive, celebrity doctor then they still can, but they have to make up the difference in the reference price. An insurance company in California tried this for routine hip and knee replacements after discovering it was paying as much as $110,000 for those procedures in some cases, while in others it cost $30,000. In the first year, savings averaged $7,000 per patient???and several high-cost hospitals suddenly discovered that they, too, could offer $30,000 joint replacements. However, it will be very hard to implement incrementally. A lot of consumers might claim that quality has decreased. Maybe its possible to apply this pricing for only the most expensive producers at first? And slowly work it down. Or perhaps implement reference pricing for medicare and other insurance companies will follow suit over time.		5. Implement some kind of incentive scheme for healthy behavior. I'm not so sure about this one though. Its hard to even think of a way to get more people to exorcise for example. Maybe find a way to pay people to go to gyms (and actually workout) or something? Or maybe a carb tax? This is harder, but its worth considering. If everyone ran on a treadmill for no more than half an hour a day, medical care would be unbelievably cheaper. There is no better medicine than exercise.It costs time, which is still valuable to people. So we should compensate people for that. I'm just not sure how to do that fairly and in a way that prevents cheaters.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BainCapitalist","name":"t1_cs0zrwd","parent_id":"t1_cs0vnt6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433885563,"created_utc":1433881963}

The costs of medications in a hospital are complex; what you see in the breakdown on said explanation of benefits statement you receive from your insurance after a service is not only the medication but it may include the cost to store it and dispense it by the nurse (this is why Tylenol might be a $5 pill, you're paying the nurse to get it).

What your asking though sounds more like if I asked a restaurant how much they paid for the steak I'm eating, not how much they're selling it for. But that's ridiculous.

Theoretically, this actually makes sense too, because a for-profit hospital actually does _not_ have an incentive to reduce cost for society. It has an incentive to _increase_ cost, as the cost of healthcare is what constitutes the "profit" they make.

It's a meta-analysis of 149 articles examining the subject of non-profit versus for-profit hospitals. They don't explain the causal link, because the simple economic theory you apply does indeed suggest the opposite. In practice, we see that non-profit hospitals perform better.		I have suggested some hypotheses as to why price reduction is not a goal of for-profit hospitals, which is one explanation of why the cost of care tends to be more expensive there. As for operating costs and business structure, I have to admit I am talking from my experience as a medicine student in Europe, and not an economics major. It seems that operating costs may very well increase in non-profits, as they tend to provide "non-profitable" (yet essential) care. However, in my country, and in many non-profit healthcare systems, there is an incentive ingrained in doctors to _not_ treat, which might reduce costs of care. This incentive is completely absent in a for-profit institution.			>"Law XIII.

{"body":"I like the quote, and I do trust that a meta-analysis is likely true. The subject of that chapter in my textbook was 'asymmetric information', including the difficulties in evaluating performance in CEOs when monitoring that is expensive.		Perhaps non-profit hospitals are more closely watched by donors than for-profit ones by stockholders. That could be a measurable hypothesis. 		I do like your suggestion that culture could reflect changes in healthcare costs. In the United States, 'defensive medicine' is practiced because doctors can be legally liable for many things they do or fail to do. It makes sense because patients often don't have information about the quality of the care they're receiving, but it also makes doctors somewhat overzealous in practice.		We could test whether doctors are more likely to prescribe in for-profit environments than not for-profits.		Another important point to consider is that hospitals use their market power to set prices such that there is never an equilibrium price for a service in a hospital. That inflated price is negotiable for insurance companies (who can withdraw coverage for non-emergencies) or can be sold to debt collectors at a percentage of the debt.		In contrast, a centrally-planned public health system could determine the 'true value' of something like a cornea transplant. I believe the NHS (UK health services) rations cornea transplants such that it's better to give two people one eye each (assuming they would both go blind without the procedure), than one person two. It makes sense, but I think most Americans would feel discomfort over the proposal.

{"body":"You make excellent points. To the issue of non-profit hospitals possibly being supervised more strictly (and, actually, some of the other points you raise) I'd say that the crux is on healthcare laying in the hands of practitioners, and not the hospital.		 I do not think a government (or donor) supervised hospital actually diminishes costs because they have to, for the government/donor. The government or donors can never exert the same amount of pressure that a private system can.		 The issue is much more fundamental. The (government funded?) system creates a situation where the practitioner, and by extension, the professional group, has much more power, because they are not concerned with competing. This creates a situation in which (outside of monetary incentives) a practitioner can "care" in a much more fundamental sense than healthcare for his patient.		 This is a large part of my education, which makes the idea of providing healthcare for  profit so foreign to me. It's about giving the doctor the (admittedly, frightening) power of making a decision without considering other hospitals/doctors, but also with the welfare of society in mind. Professional guidelines make collective decisions about what kind of care is worth it, and sadly, what kind is not. For example, in certain cases (at end of life, but also at the start) it may be up to the professional to decide that it's not worth it, even though he might make money of the interventions he can perform.		The "true value" of care is fundamentally indeterminable. In my opinion, a public system indeed comes closer because instead of considering immediate results, it empowers practitioners to make hard decisions without being corrupted by monetary concerns.		This might sound very vague. The healthcare system in my country certainly has it's flaws, but I think there's truth in not making health a matter of competition ("Who can get you the healthiest?") but a matter of careful consideration.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DailyFrance69","name":"t1_cs141v2","parent_id":"t1_cs10e57","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433892426,"created_utc":1433888826}

{"body":"> In this case you don't care		You do care - you go to the more expensive one, because "you've been paying insurance for so long, it's about time you get something out of it". And anyway - you want the best care, which for people translates to "the most expensive".		That means there's pressure on hospitals to actually *raise* the sticker prices, even if they will charge the insurance company the same amount as before. 		And insurance companies love it when the "sticker" price is much higher than the price they actually pay - as it means they can advertise higher coverage for the same insurance cost. So that's another incentive to raise the "sticker" price.		The whole concept of "virtually all of X industry is paid via insurance" means the free market no longer works. And since healthcare can legitimately become very very expensive in some cases - it means that most people will have some form of health insurance.		In addition, free market requires that a person can legitimately choose not to purchase a product without threat of bodily harm / death from the seller. In other words - the monopoly of the use of force by the state is required for the free market to work (for example, you can't pay "protection" to a cheaper mobster. There's no free market governing mob "protection" money - because they use force against you). But in healthcare the options are often "pay us as much as we ask or you / your kid / your parent dies", and even if not "dies" then "suffers physical pain". You don't have an option to "not fix a broken arm" because it's too expensive.		Finally - there's a government-enforced monopoly on the right to practice medicine. That is bad for the free market, but as history has shown us - is required as ordinary people don't have the capacity / knowledge to do the required research for an informed medical decision on their own.		(This in addition to the government enforced monopoly on medicine itself through patent laws - meaning that if the only cure to my fatal disease is a drug that's patented to company X - that company can literally demand everything I have and more and I have no option but to pay - even if actually creating the medicine is so cheap another company could do it for $2 had they been allowed to)		Add this all together, and you see that the health industry cannot operate as a free market. In other words - it *has* to be regulated. There is a reason medical care is government regulated all around the world, and more regulated places actually have cheaper total health costs per person.		The free market cannot work on the health industry.","depth":3,"score":35,"ups":35,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Men13","name":"t1_cs054kq","parent_id":"t1_cs04hu1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433819304,"created_utc":1433815704}

Now it is good that I go every year because it catches stuff, or could catch stuff, before it got really bad and cost a lot more to fix.		But if we had a system where I had insurance that charged me one rate if I went to the OB/GYN and a higher rate when I didn't but didn't pay for it, that would be more reasonable still.

{"body":"Is what they're doing really isolation from market forces?		Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, but if you're a hospital and an uninsured patient comes in, gets services done and leaves, you send them a bill for ten grand.		If this were an insured patient, the insurance company would get a bill for ten grand and just refuse to pay (they'd probably do this if it was a legit bill too, because insurance companies are shitty like that, but I digress).  When they pay, you might get a thousand bucks out of it.  Chances are the prices for procedures are already negotiated assuming an in-network insurer.  The insurance company doesn't give two fucks if your business lives or dies, so more likely than not the price they've negotiated is barely profitable at all for your hospital given the cost of overhead, but being in network practically guarantees your hospital patients from that insurance network.		If they're uninsured and can afford the ten grand, they may or may not dispute the charges.  If they don't dispute it, you made a HUGE markup over every other insured or financially smart patient you had - PROFIT!		If they're smart and dispute the charges, settle for half - you still made 5x markup, and PROFIT!		If they aren't insured and appeal to have the debt dismissed, or a rolling jubilee, church or other charitable group steps in, you made some money, and wrote off the delta between what you charged and what you got against your profit so you pay less to uncle sam.		If they don't pay and there's no charity option, you sell the debt to a collection agency.  You get ~2-10% of the debt back immediately, and just like above write off the delta between what you got and what you billed against profit from other operations, so you lose less to uncle sam.		I mean, the system is shitty - there's no disputing that.  But I think that what hospitals are doing is rational within the constraints and rules of our shitty healthcare system and shitty tax code.

{"body":"2 personal stories about healthcare.  To preface, I have Cystic Fibrosis and was sick to the point I needed constant hospitalisation.		1.  I was on an HMO and had to be referred to a specialist (pulmonologist).  The doctor I went to see referred me to "the best pulmonologist in the area!"  I went to see him and his patients were all old COPD patients.  He had no idea what CF was and every time I was admitted to his hospital, I was constantly asked why I'm in there cause I was so young.  He then referred me to an infectious disease doctor who had me come see him every 2 weeks and I did, stupidly. 		  Finally, I needed financial assistance from the state, so they had me go see a doctor with CF experience in San Francisco.  When I went to see him, it was like night and day.  He told me that when I was sick, I would come there because they knew how to treat patients with CF and he was 100% correct.  The next time I was hospitalized, the infectious disease doctor (who oh by the way is on the board of directors of the other hospital), calls my new doctor and tells him that I have to be transferred back to their hospital because he didn't refer me to him.		 My new doctor told him if he didn't transfer my care that he'd cover the bill himself because the other hospital didn't know wtf they were doing.  The inf. disease doctor wound up transferring care.		2.  Fast forward 13 years, I'm now 9 years post double lung transplant.  Having CF the only problems I have are with food digestion on occasion.  I had to take a trip to the local hospital to get unblocked.  While I'm there, they have me see 3 different doctors who have nothing to do with my issue.  They also put me in a room with a patient with COPD, which can cause infection to me if they have something contagious they are coughing up. 		I had to explain to the charge nurse why this room situation was an awful idea and they changed my room to be in with a guy with extreme dementia and thought the hospital and me were out to get him.		 I get out of the hospital, but leave with a cough that turns out to be Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).  RSV can cause rejection in transplant patients, so I head to my transplant hospital and get treated for two weeks in a bed tent for RSV.  Meanwhile, the local hospital misbills me for $12,000, which my insurance did catch, but I wanted to sue them for malpractice.		TL:DR: HMO story of a doctor  being greedy, and another story of hospitals providing shitty care","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kakbakalak","name":"t1_cs09fio","parent_id":"t3_3931ss","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433827607,"created_utc":1433824007}

{"body":"America has innovative healthcare, free healthcare is good for things like normal eye conditions, strep throat and a broken arm. However when you have something weird in the U.K. and the NHS in your local area does not treat it you basically are fucked at that point. My wife had an eye condition in the U.K. and her local doctor could not treat it because you are assigned to your town only really with what they have there.  When she came to the USA laser surgery fixed in in less than 5 minutes when in the U.K. they could only giver her medication that she had to take 3 times a day. The NHS did not have laser eye surgery for early onset of eye pressure. She was told it was an old persons disease and you are SOL at this point. In America the eye doc fixed her up within two appointments and her eyes are normal now. 		Another instance is when she was a young girl she had to have her tonsils removed. The NHS in her area could not do it because the last person to use the machine had mad cow and they could not afford another one for the town. So she had to suffer instead. In America any town could easily do a tonsillectomy without having to skimp on money or machines to provide adequate health care. 		Free health care is good and all but when it skimps out on treatments due to lack of funding for rare or abnormal diseases it can become really bad. In private healthcare your money can go along way, but with things like the NHS  with funding shortages you are at the mercy of the system meaning the machines they needed to save you with they could not afford so you died instead. In America you could live but have debt instead so its like a hard choice, live with free healthcare and be at the mercy of your government and its funding or live in some debt but you are still alive and kicking.","depth":1,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Key_nine","name":"t1_cs06zrs","parent_id":"t1_cs0516j","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433822618,"created_utc":1433819018}

{"body":"Americans pay many times more, on average, for their healthcare. A while back I read all this, I believe it was actually popular on Reddit for a while; fact of the matter is the prices of pharmaceuticals are many times more than elsewhere in the world, more (needlessly) expensive operations are recommended and standard practice, and medical professionals earn massive amounts of money; far more than the already sizable incomes of their other western counterparts.		As a Canadian, it seems like a completely different universe whenever I hear of people just below the border, being royally screwed over due to insurance companies only covering certain hospitals, or families getting set back many years because of medical fees, if not, even worse yet, unable to pay them.		Fact of the matter is, I'm glad private healthcare is illegal in Canada; the free market has no place in the medical industry. As some pharmacists are noting below, the drugstores and insurance companies pretty much wage a price war, inflating prices, with the pharmacies trying to get a larger cut of the insurance companies' profit, and as a result the insurance companies trying to get a larger cut of the customer's income (though neither side is innocent, not that this wasn't already obvious). And the fact of the matter is this happens with the hospitals, as well. The hospitals can, will, and do increase their prices, trying to find the highest sum they can bleed out of the insurance companies; and similarly the insurance companies will try to either dump some of the cost upon the customer, or worse yet, avoid paying through loopholes. Obamacare was supposed to subsidize insurance, but you can bet that instead it was abused by the insurance companies; they increased their premiums and are now not only taking your money, but the government's (and as a result, your taxes) money, just another example of blatant theft of the American taxpayer's money in broad daylight...		Anyways, to sum up my opinion on the matter... fact of the matter is, the insurance companies want to rake up a profit, as large a profit margin as possible. And the same goes for the hospitals, and for the pharmacies.... and in the end something has to give. There's no way, in a free market, that any of these are going to take even the slightest loss in profit margin; after all, they are not public services (despite their blatant appropriation of taxpayer/government funding.... note Obamacare, among other things), they are private companies and they exist to make a profit, not to save lives or serve the people. **Something has to give. The money has to come from somewhere. And that somewhere, in the end... it all comes down to you poor suckers, the American taxpayers, coughing up the money for grossly exaggerated and inflated prices.** Doesn't matter if you "get Obamacare, and somehow manage to break even on medical expenses." Your taxes are going into this, and your own disposable income is being used for this, too. The prices are only inflating in the price war between these industries, all trying to bleed you dry.		Now, here in Canada, I believe I'm content with what we have, regardless of what some people might say about "waiting lines" and the sort... and my belief is only reaffirmed when I talk to my American friends about such things. Even in rural Alberta, or in Saskatchewan (basically the boonies) there was always some clinic or hospital in the nearest reasonably sized town, growing up. While I never used it myself or knew anyone who did, I believe there were emergency helicopters that served as ambulances for major emergencies; while I've heard they would cost some money, fact of the matter is even that is kept at a reasonable (set) rate, in comparison to the bleed-the-customer-dry rates that America has. Buying medical insurance isn't necessary here; now, while you do have to pay for prescription drugs usually, it's not like as if I've ever had to pay for the prescription itself, and when in doubt about my health I can easily go to a clinic and get a checkup free.		I actually remember reading articles, pretty much ads, stating that doctors could earn a certain amount more if they worked in the countryside; surely this also helped, and I can imagine that access to proper medical care (I understand there are limitations, but basically the most basic of care at least has to be available) in rural regions as well. My point in this being that when healthcare is run by the government, it's got some accountability. Fact of the matter is, in a democracy like Canada (and America as well, ofc), when medical care is part of the responsibilities of the government, you can bet that it's within political parties' interests to provide reasonable care... it is not uncommon for people to use their medical budgeting, just like they might the education, military, etc budget in America... as part of their platform in provincial elections. While, in the end, it's still the taxpayer's money being used and I don't deny that, fact of the matter is that this system is, clearly, better for the interests of both the government, and the people... and I would argue that it brings more reasonable and naturally less/non exploitative practices.		Comparing my life to what it might have been without public healthcare, I shudder to think of what might have become. From the time my dad broke his back and couldn't work for a while, to the numerous incidents with my siblings... fact of the matter is my youngest brother fell and broke his collarbone, nearly dying when he was 3; and fact of the matter is my family was deep in debt at the time. Well, can't really see how that would have turned out, either, though the only plausible results would either have been him dying or my dad going through another year of debt or so...		I'm not sure how America can ever fix itself in this situation, and I can't claim to know of any good answers. But I'm firmly convinced that private healthcare is evil and immoral, and should be abolished; and also that public healthcare is the only system which can, in a realistic setting, cater to the needs of the people. It might seem like a radical shift from the free market that America's used to, but it's a necessary one, and I dislike the word radical for things that should have been to begin with.		America's a democracy(republic), so there's little excuse. With the people, is where the power is supposed to be... and that's also why it's gone through such radical changes since its foundation... I believe public healthcare in America is not so far-fetched a concept, really.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thanatar18","name":"t1_cs0ebm5","parent_id":"t3_3931ss","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433842669,"created_utc":1433839069}

There is a law that no one can be turned away from a hospital *for emergency care.*  This has been around since the 80s, and is known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.  Prior to 1986, private hospitals were dumping patients back out on the street for public hospitals to care for, while taking all the wealthy patients.  It is a good thing, if we allow private, for profit health care at all.		That said, no hospital has to treat you once you are stabilized.  They don't have to do a diagnostic CT for that occasional abdominal pain or give you chemo for your tumor.  They are only required to treat you to the point where you can care for yourself.		>When you arrive, give an alias. When asked for id, say you have none. When asked for an address, you are homeless. 		This is tremendously bad advice.  You are still liable for your care, regardless of what name you give. 		>When they try desperately to have you sign paperwork, refuse.		They won't treat you.  If you refuse treatment (and refusing to sign the consent is refusing treatment), you are not going to get treatment.		>The system is so rigged against the working man.		Agreed, but you're angry at the wrong people.  For what the US spends in tax payer dollars per capita on health care, we could have a universal health care system which covered everyone.

{"body":"This'll get buried, but everyone gets billed that much. It's designed by the insurance companies to make having health insurance your only option. They don't allow providers to charge lesser amounts for non-insured patients or the network will drop that provider/facility costing them millions. They then further strong arm them by only paying a percentage of the bill based on how you negotiate beforehand, it's typically between 8 and 13%. And the insurance sends the patient a bill showing the original cost, their negotiated drop in price and your portion, but not the amount they actually pay, so the insurance company both gets to screw you and look like the good guy.		Some numbers to show how it works... Say for simplicity's sake, the hospital gets a 10% reimbursement from your insurance and you're on an 80/20 split. Your services are worth 1000 to the hospital, so they charge 5000 initially. The insurance company comes back and says they'll allow 1000 (based on various nebulous rules they make up, but if the hospital asks for 1000 to begin with, they'll get even less), so the hospital bills you for 1000. The insurance company tells you your portion is $200 and they're covering $800, of which they only pay out $80. So the hospital gets $280 for this visit, most of which was paid directly by you, and you see on your bill that the insurance company negotiated your bill down from 5000 and you only owe 200, leaving you praising the insurance company and calling the hospital a bunch of greedy fucks. 		Meanwhile your uninsured buddy gets hit for the full 5 grand because your insurance company won't allow them to charge less and he's forced to make payments for a few years while working with a hospital sponsored charity to lower his bill as close to off their books as possible.		Healthcare isn't that crazy expensive, It's mainly just insurance companies and DME companies fucking everyone over.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"colovick","name":"t1_cs0gul2","parent_id":"t3_3931ss","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433853301,"created_utc":1433849701}

{"body":"I didn't read the article, I don't really have the time to read it, but I did want to lay out some basic facts. My dad owns one of the larger medical billing companies in the region, and so I've learned a good bit through the years working for/with him. I don't claim to be an expert, but I know more than the average loon. 		* The reimbursement rates are *AT BEST* around 45%. I believe our average reimbursement last year was about 47% of what we charged the insurance companies. Many of these rates are determined in a contract the doctors/hospitals sign with the insurance companies. For example, I was putting in a bunch of payments today on an OBGYN. Her charge for a delivery was ~$1,800. The insurance companies just wrote off $1,050 of that and sent us a $750 check for her services.	* CPT codes are the procedure codes. All this is is a number that corresponds to a procedure. For example, an easy one is a 99000. This is for specimen handling. A lot of the guys I know charge the insurance companies $20 for it and 99.8% of the time have it completely denied. 	* Hospitals registration processes are not very good. More times than not, we'll receive info on an uninsured patient that a quick run through the system shows he/she has insurance, which is then billed for the services rendered to them. 	* If you're uninsured, you CAN negotiate. Hospitals just want what they can get out of you so they don't lose their ass. If you go to their billing offices (which may be a third party) and tell them you can pay $X in X increments, they'll usually do their best to work with you. If you can only pay $700 of a $5000 invoice, and have to do it in 7 monthly payments, that is better than them getting nothing. A lot of states will reimburse hospitals anyway for uninsured patients. You'd be shocked what those numbers look like. 	* The claims process is a bitch and a half. If you just go to the doctor and pay a $20 copay, the doctor will probably charge the insurance company $98. They may get $10 out of the insurance company, they may get none. Just because a doctor charges an insurance company for the services rendered to you, they are not guaranteed repayment. I've seen $4,000 procedures get completely written off and there is nothing we can do about it. I had a denial come in the other day where they wrote off $14,750 of a $14,900 claim. If we're lucky we may get another $500 out of them. 		If you have any questions I'll do my best to answer. Medical billing is a very complicated and odd field, so it's not unusual for people to have no idea what they're dealing with.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CPTsAreNotMyFriend","name":"t1_cs0asb3","parent_id":"t3_3931ss","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433830880,"created_utc":1433827280}

{"body":"I'm a doctor and run my own practice, so I understand this billing stuff.  Here's my explanation:		1. Medicare only allows hospitals and providers to charge 1 price.  So they all have to have one price for all payers (medicare, medicaid, workers comp, private insurers, cash payments etc.)  What they receive can be different, but they are only allowed to charge 1 price.	2. So what if you are at an out of network hospital (a hospital not in your insurances agreed area)?  So you went to visit your friend and got appendicitis in the next state over, well your insurance company will pay a portion of the charges.  Whether thats 10% or 100%, that's between the hospital and the insurance company. Or what if you are driving cross country and are in a car accident?  Well the guy that hit you will probably have to pay your bills.  So that settlement you get will go towards paying back those hospital bills.		So the reality is its like playing the lottery.  99% of the time the hospital will receive less.

She sent off a claim (invoice) to the insurance company for $148 for the clinic visit. The insurance company paid her $66.52 and wrote-off the rest. This left the bill at zero and the patient owed nothing. 		Should they not have any insurance, that bill would've been reduced to around $66.52 and they could work out a payment plan with the patient. 		The problem with hospitals is that there are so many expenses in such a small area that all have to be covered. Clinics have much less overhead and the procedures never cost much.

{"body":">That said, isn't there a free market solution to this? What's to stop a hospital from just setting a reasonable price that covers costs, and taking all taking away all the customers from the corrupt hospitals?		Honestly, no, there isn't a free-market solution to this. There's a number of reasons for this.		First, what does a free market require? It requires the ability for consumers to shop. Shopping, in turn, requires consumers to have (a) time to shop, (b) a selection to shop between, (c) transparency in advance regarding the product or service they are purchasing, and (d) the ability to do an opportunity-cost analysis, where they are determine how much they are willing to spend for X amount or Y quality of service versus spending their money elsewhere. So you can see the problems here: 		- in emergency cases there's no time to shop; 		- an in almost all cases, there's no transparency in advance for the type, quality, and costs of the services you are going to need because what exactly is needed for proper diagnosis and sometimes even for treatment isn't known until the process is already begin, a reliable way to ascertain the quality of service in advance is difficult, and even if both of those things weren't the case, an emergency would preclude you getting that information in advance; 		- without transparency, even if there is no emergency, you can't compare a selection of providers because you really don't know the costs, what the services entail, etc.;		- and, finally, no one deserves, much less wants anything less than the quality and adequate medical care.		Second, if we're speaking about America, a hospital wouldn't be able to set reasonable prices and then outcompete its gouging competitors. In addition to all those issues of transparency in advance, etc., we have an insurance problem. Currently, insurance companies bargain with hospitals to get certain rates for services. Sometimes this doesn't cover costs for hospitals. The result is that the hospital up-charges uninsured people. And then it reupcharges uninsured people to cover the cost of uninsured people who can't afford their bill. It's a downward spiral, really. "You can't afford insurance? Here, foot the bill for the people who can. Oh, and foot the bill for the last uninsured guy who couldn't afford to foot the bill for insurance."		But, because a hospital is a profit-seeking market entity, it has to constantly be increasing its profit margins to maintain demand for its shares. This means that it needs to get in as many people as it can, which then means accepting as many different insurance providers as possible. And, for the reasons I explained above, the result is the uninsured get their costs jacked up to keep this thing afloat.		In order to compete with this in a free market, you'd have to out-profit it, and that's simply not possible in the short or even medium term. The second a hospital says "We're only going to charge material costs, overhead costs, and a 5% profit, insurance companies take it or leave", insurers aren't going to take it and, even if they did, investors are going to scoff because they can get 10% by investing in the gouging hospitals.		Now, given all that was said above about how medical care fails to meet the criteria necessary for free market consumption, let's apply a different principal that comes from a free-market lesson: economy of scale. Countries that have universalized health care such as Sweden and France have reduced costs to between one half and two thirds of what we pay in the US. In short, in Sweden, medical care is fully covered and it's 9% of the GDP; in France, medical care is mostly covered, with the exception of non-emergency, non-hospitalization care, which is covered at 70% of the cost, and it's 11% of the GDP; and here in the US, where it's not covered at all, it's 17%. And it's not like we can pretend mean income is anywhere near per capita GDP, which is to say that that 17% is hitting the vast majority of the population a lot harder than 17% of their income during the span of their lifetimes. 		And one of the nice things about France and Sweden is that they have as a lot more transparency because of this universalization. The country is not trying to maximize profits on medical care, so it takes the entire country's worth of data on a given diagnostic procedure, for example, and then determines the cost. Most of that cost is taken out of the federal budget, and what's not is known in advance. In other words, you might not know you need an MRI, but when you find out you do, the cost is known in advance.		A know this is bothersome to a lot of people here in the States. They've been--very unfortunately--sold on this greed idea of "I don't want to pay for someone else who gets sick". The truth of the matter is that (a) the average person is going to require quite a bit of healthcare in their life, including a period of 8-months out of work by age 55; (b) by pooling our resources in a unversalized public system, we can drive the cost of that healthcare down; and (c) because the costs are driven down so low, even if we fair better than the average Joe and don't need as much healthcare as our neighbour, we are still paying less than we would if we tried to pay for healthcare through a private system.		In other words, instead of thinking of it as "I'm paying for other people who are unhealthy", think of it as "I'm paying in advance into a payment plan for myself, and because everyone else is doing it to, I'm getting the benefit of an economy of scale." The crux of this issue really is understanding that our decision on how to economically organize, or, more precisely, how we decide to which degree we want a given sector or service to be governed by ourselves as a participatory society versus ourselves as a individual competitors, should be based on which will afford us the greatest good, empirically speaking, not on a dogmatic ideology of "free market is best" or, conversely "command is best". That is to say, both the free-market and public-command apparatuses have their benefits and disadvantages, which vary from sector to sector, service to service, etc.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jedouard","name":"t1_cs0e4j5","parent_id":"t1_cs0d0ky","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433841832,"created_utc":1433838232}

Hospitals know that uninsured people usually won't be able to pay, so the higher the bill, the more money they don't get paid, and the more the hospital can write off as a loss for tax purposes. This is useful for both for-profit hospitals looking to reduce profits for tax purposes and non profits looking to retain their nonprofit status.		3) "Saudi princes". Wealthy foreign nationals who are basically price insensitive.		Unfortunately, the uninsured are pretty much screwed by this status quo.

What you must realise is they then deduct the loss from there company income tax.

{"body":"I was pregnant 2 years ago and my doctor insisted I go to the hospital at 5 weeks (yes, that's right, 5 weeks) the doctor wanted me to get a 24hr urine test and watch my per-existing diabetes/HBP. Overnight I ended up telling them I wanted to go home as this whole mess didn't make sense and I was extremely uncomfortable being asked to stay in a hospital for a urine test I found out I could do at home. They called the doctor and the doctor spoke to me directly stating that, "If you leave the hospital it will be against medical advice and your insurance will likely not cover for the amount of time you've already spent there." So I stayed concerned for the finances to follow.		Two weeks later they slap me with a $5,000 bill for a single day/night stay that my insurance shrugged off claiming it made no sense to have done it and somehow was my responsibility to pay. Fuck them both, I pay you nothing. I had a 780 credit score, too scared to look at what that might have done to it now. I didn't ask to stay in and I cried when they told me I couldn't leave, I felt like I was being held hostage financially.		I hate doctors and hospitals, that wasn't the last incident.. at the end of my pregnancy (my SO who is now my ex talked me into staying with this dick obstetrician) they forced me to stay in the hospital at the end because my blood pressure did end up shooting up but only at the last week..so they kept me in the hospital for monitoring but wouldn't tell me any more than that.. A few weeks after THAT nightmare and an emergency c-section? $32,000 bill shows up at my door for the stay alone. They end up talking it down to $900. In the end I will not pay you a dime for things I never asked for and their attempts at taking advantage of me. I somewhat understand the last bill but the entire stay was awful. There was a very racist woman who kept coming into my room, I didn't sleep the entire week except for a few times I actually passed out and when I started nodding off the head nurse would barge in and startle me grumbling under her breath that I, "Didn't belong here, we need this beds for sick people." while my BP was rather dangerously high for both dia and sys.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Alexxis_","name":"t1_cs0rpix","parent_id":"t3_3931ss","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433873472,"created_utc":1433869872}

{"body":"Hospitals charge so much because they only receive 20-30% of charges on average. Here's a simplified version of how:		- the majority of patients generally have Medicare (pays around cost of business) and Medicaid (pays below the cost of service). 		- uninsured or underinsured patients get full cost bills, but only pay a tiny portion and take forever to pay. Hospitals don't want private pay bills. Seriously. 		- so, how do hospitals make money? Private insurance. They contract with some popular insurers, which pay at a decent rate, but their biggest profitable payments come from non-contracted insurers. Non-contracted insurers have to pay full charges, which is why full charges seem so inflated. They have to make up the difference for all the other categories that make less money. 		- the main problem with this system is the greater prominence of high deductible insurance plans. This pushes the full charges of non-contracted insurance companies onto the patient until they meet their deductible.		- finally, many hospitals are minimally profitable at best. While there are exceptions, they generally aren't gouging patients to line their pockets.

{"body":"> Have INS officers waiting at hospitals to discourage illegals from using our services and driving up our costs.		Yeah, that's the moral solution. Never mind the fact that you're wrong; they're not using *your* services and driving up *your* costs. Current estimates are that illegal immigrants pay between $90B and $140B in federal, state, and local taxes, so why should they get to enjoy the $4.5B-8.1B it costs nationwide to cover their medical expenses? 		Illegal immigrants, in the majority of cases, contribute quite a lot to taxes, as the companies hiring them are taking out payroll tax and income tax for them, the products they buy have sales tax, and the properties they live on have property tax. In fact, they tend to contribute more to income tax than most of their citizen equivalents of the same income because they don't file for tax returns, which would refund everything.		And the system is currently designed this way. These companies have to do this because they have to pretend the illegal immigrants are legal, so that when the INS comes in, they can say, "Hey, we checked their social security cards and paid the taxes" and avoid all blame. And the illegal immigrants have to *not* file taxes or else the red flag goes off at the IRS that a social security number has either been double filed, if it belongs to two people, or doesn't actually belong to known person. 		It's one thing to argue about how illegal immigration should be handled; it's quite another to deny or impede someone from getting medical care because of their residency status.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jedouard","name":"t1_cs0dmlx","parent_id":"t1_cs0d5bd","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433839772,"created_utc":1433836172}

{"body":"Haha.		Okay, I've addressed this before, but I'll do it again, and this time with even more facts.		>At the expense of American jobs.		These illegal immigrants are working in jobs Americans won't do. Most of them are in construction, agriculture, and low-level sanitation. If you get rid of them, as Georgia tried to do, there will be no one to fill these jobs at their current pay. If you increase the pay for these jobs to attract people, then either (a) the companies in that state cannot compete with the companies in the next state over that have access to illegal immigrants and even more jobs are lost because they go out of business or (b) you have to make it universal for each state. But, if you do the latter, then the costs of these services have to increase drastically to cover the pay, which is going to be much higher because no one wants to bend over all day and pick tomatoes in the sweltering sun.		And when this happens, when the prices skyrocket for staple foods and housing, disposable incomes will drop for the average household, and then we get a recession with layoffs.		So, no, they are not costing American jobs; they are floating the economy, and that is precisely why there is no real movement in the federal government on either side of the to do what is necessary to stop the influx of illegal immigrants.		And, the reason I say that is very simply that changing the employee identification process from having a person give a number for their identity, which can easily be made up, to using a photo ID or thumbprint is all it would take to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants.		>Just because you don't agree with a law doesn't make it not a law. 		What does this statement have to do with anything we've discussed?		If you're talking about the access to medical care, then it's about what the law ought to be. You're trying to argue that the law ought to coerce illegal immigrants away from accessing medical care. And I'm telling you that if you do this, not only is it immoral, but it will be far more costly because it will spread disease.		If you're talking about why illegal immigrants move her, it's not as if they aren't aware of the risk of punishment for violating the US law; it's that that risk is far less worrisome than the risk of staying where they are because either it is dangerous or it is destitute.		>I do not care what happens to them.		Obviously, you're a dick without an ounce of compassion. And that's made all the worse by the fact that, if you match the statistical average for the United States, you are no more than five generations away from someone in your family fleeing their home country for the United States because of danger or destitution. 		Oh sure, they did it legally. Of course, that was back before any real immigration regulations because politicos hadn't seized the issue yet.		>If I moved to another country in violation of its laws I would not expect to be able to sponge off of its social support systems.		What part of being absolutely wrong about this do you not understand? Illegal immigrants pay between $90B and $140B in taxes each year. This more than covers their $4.5B -$8.1B in medical costs, which is the only social support system they use since they can't get access to any other.		> Take your sjw pity trip somewhere else.		Ah, how convenient to latch on to identity labels so you don't actually have to think about what you're saying. How dare someone require a little introspection, a little analysis from you. "My ideas are my ideas and they are right because they are my ideas. Never you mind that every bit of hard, empirical data proves me wrong."		And that's not even to mention the immorality of your stance.		> Your desire to keep Americans unemployed disgusts me.		See the first paragraph above.

But a 50% discount may be lower than the cost of the procedure so they increase the list price.		It all comes down to the discount prices the insurance companies demand.
