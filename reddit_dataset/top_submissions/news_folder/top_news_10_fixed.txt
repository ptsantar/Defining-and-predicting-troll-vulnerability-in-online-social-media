{"body":"> what politician is actually going to stop this shit when it clearly works so well for them?		Not many of them will as things currently stand. That's why I really like the Represent.Us [ballot initiative strategy](https://represent.us/action/thesolution/) linked at the end of the video in the article. Copy/pasting from a similar thread from a little while back:		I think it's the best strategy I've seen for tackling this problem so far. For all the talk about how awful Washington is, this is a problem that starts out small. Most state and local elections have even looser political money rules than at the federal level. What most of us see as "corruption" feels totally normal to the people who end up in politics because they've been funding their campaigns the same way their entire careers, starting with their first run for city council or state rep. Just passing a federal law (or yes, even a constitutional amendment) won't instantly reverse decades of corrupt political culture. That has to be done from the bottom up.		Plus, knocking over a couple states with direct ballot initiatives (like with marriage equality and marijuana legalization) would build a lot more momentum than trying to get reform through a Congress that clearly doesn't give a shit. And statewide public funding systems can be used to support that state's federal candidates, which means it would be way easier to get reform-minded pols elected.		Most importantly though, going the state and local route actually feels winnable and realistic to me. Definitely seems more likely than somehow getting a bunch of red states to support a constitutional amendment that's been pegged as a leftist plot from day one.","depth":1,"score":1061,"ups":1061,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheFightingFarsi","name":"t1_cr2r8gd","parent_id":"t1_cr2qgs2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431111326,"created_utc":1431107726}

You cannot impose a spending limit on speech without abridging the right to free speech. There are spending limits on political campaigns, but since when is there a spending limit on communication.

Really solid point. I think it's going to take a lot more public education (like the video in this post) to really show people how this kind of corruption *directly* affects their lives.

With all the extremist partisans in government now, and all the corporate cronies, and all the career politicians who are only out for themselves; a ConCon is the *last* thing you want.  They'll appoint themselves - or their more extreme party purists - as delegates to the ConCon, and re-write the whole damn thing to benefit them and their donors and their party platforms even more than it already does; and *not* to benefit us, The People.		Here are some discussions of the problems with a ConCon. (Note: I am not advocating or supporting the political opinions or points of any of the writers.  I don't agree with the first nutjob, as he only sees the faults of the Democratic Party, without also seeing the faults of the increasingly extremist views of the Republican party.  *But*, he is right about the general threats posed to what is good about our system and our nation by convening a ConCon.  Just ignore when he starts ranting in the last 5 paragraphs or so about Leftists and about this being a bad time for a ConCon "because the Republicans can't now control the debate".  He's a fuckwit.  The Democrats are bad for the country, and the Republicans are *worse* for the country.)

If there are 4-5 times the number of congress critters, the same level of integrity would cost 4-5 times as much money to compromise.  That prices *a lot* of special interests out of the market.  Those that *aren't* outright priced out of the market have to consider whether paying 3-5 as much for the same results is worth it.		And those who *do* take money will be running against people who can honestly say they have never taken a dime from special interests.  Who would come out ahead in *that* race, do you think?		> Besides, the biggest problem is voter apathy		Voter apathy comes, largely, from the fact that it currently [doesn't matter what the average voter thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=710&v=SzS068SL-rQ).  Currently, any given voter is [(on average)](http://www.statisticbrain.com/voting-statistics/): 		* one of 733k people in the district	* one of 473k people who are eligible to vote	* one of 336k who are registered to vote	* one of 301k who actually *do* vote	* one of 150k who voted for *them*		That means that if one person decides to never vote for you again, there are still 35k who you haven't decided one way or another that you can get votes from.  And that isn't including the additional 140k who aren't even registered.  It's hard to care about your vote when it accounts for a tiny fraction the overall outcome, who could be replaced by one of 140k people, 35k of who only need to be convinced to leave their couches. 		Not much reason to listen to voters at all, not compared to the few hundred people, total, who really end up funding their election.  That makes it hard, in turn, for voters to care about politics that you have no chance of influencing.		On the other hand, if you initiate the Wyoming 3 rule, you're looking at *these* sorts of numbers:		* only ~176k people in the district	* only 113k people who are eligible to vote	* only 80k who are registered (at present rates)	* only 72k who actually vote	* only 36k who vote for the winner		That means that congress critters wouldn't be so ready to dismiss their constituents, because each one would represent something like 4x voting power that they used to.  That easily tapped resource?  Down to 8k people.  Many of whom will *know* you, and may hear why you refuse to vote for them.  And not only would there be fewer replacement voters, all of you would be *several* fewer removes from knowing the candidates, and each other, directly.		Elections would no longer be between "Random Challenger" and "Professional Politician," but between "Person who went my high school a few years off from me" and "A Coworker's Cousin."  Which of those is a more interesting, more compelling race?  Which is more likely to get people interested?		> misinformation, and lack of being informed 		A lot harder to be misinformed about a candidate and what they're doing when it's your college roommate's uncle/aunt running for office.		> the political pig feed that is shoveled to the masses 		That's just it: it won't *be* "the masses."  It'll be someone that is *maybe* as many as 3 removes from you.  They'll almost certainly be someone who went to school in your school district.  Hell, they may have even gone to your High School.

Either way it's a system where the minority is being marginalized and rendered impotent. In fact in a representative democracy the minority actually has *less* of a voice. Let's say in a given jurisdiction you have 51% of people who hate the other 49%. So what do they do?

Now if that other 49% was actually directly involved, how could you possibly say they would have less influence? That at least gives a diversity of opinion that wouldn't have existed otherwise.

On the side of reality, if a convention were called, and it went beyond the scope intended by the states calling it, and it were to go to court over the matter, I think, as he mentions in another case, the court would call it a political matter and leave it to the political system to address.

Moreover, Warren is known to be really active in hearings (she loves dragging bankers in to testify and shredding them on camera) which ends up affecting legislation, or equally important, public opinion. 		Finally, she has a position of moral authority among Senators, which means that when she speaks up on an issue that isn't well known, other senators tend to be swayed. For example, the Trade Protection Pact is in jeopardy because Warren has sparked a little rebellion among the Dems against it.		You could make the same case for any Republican senator, as well.

{"body":"The US, UK and Canada (and not other western countries) have "first past the post" voting systems, which from my perspective from the outside, not being from any of the three countries but having lived in the UK at least, seems insane. Changing the voting system wouldn't fix everything, and there would still be many problems, but at least it would be a step in the right direction.		Doesn't matter how well educated the population is if most of their votes don't count. There is also a huge middle ground between "educated citizens" and "drug using societal cancer", demanding higher education and property ownership would disenfranchise large parts of the lower classes. People aren't necessarily unintelligent because of their situation, and it would be difficult to fight for political change they support if they can't even vote.		Comments like this just show how conservative reddit really is. If you make property ownership a requirement, you might as well take away the ability for women to vote, and return to all the social structures that were around in Victorian and earlier times. 		In my case, I didn't go to university, and I don't own any property (though I have a small amount of savings), I work with people who have gone to Eton and Westminster and Oxford and Cambridge, who own lots of property and companies with head offices in Mayfair (not entirely sure how I got to this point to be honest), the thought of their voice being even more important than mine than it already is just because they own lots of property and are "better educated" is very unsettling. You are telling me that I shouldn't be able to vote but they should, it's the same when you assume everyone is in the middle class and not going to university or having property is solely down to personal choice.		They are still just people, they are not actually superior to us no matter what self-assured arguments they make. Being born into privilege which allows better educational opportunities and inherited money and property doesn't mean they're inherently more intelligent. Just as people born into poverty still need a way to have to be involved politically and have their voice heard, not just the upper middle and upper classes, which you wouldn't have much of if property ownership is a requirement to vote. What if someone used "right to buy" to buy their council flat, now they have property, can they vote now or are they still "societal cancer"?		Actually no, like most people reading this they don't own it, they have a mortgage.		Many of the people looked down on the the lower classes work, full time, they produce and contribute, in-work welfare is one of the largest categories behind pensions in the UK at least, you want people to be engaged, to care about society, but you also want to disenfranchise them.

{"body":"I used to be a state director for the PAC when I had more time on my hands. Not once where we ever involved with the social media stuff, in fact, I didn't even know it existed. It may have been either done by small local groups doing what they can to build awareness, or recruiting efforts. But what you are saying about it is not what I saw from the inside. In fact, here is what has been going on: EDIT: Removed for obvious privacy reasons. Don't need the bad guys to know the internal workings. 		All those emails are just 3 days of communication (each email is massively responded to, over and over). Tons and tons of emails. Progress is happening at such a rapid pace, I'm almost at the point of just zoning it out. Emails, all day. 		As you can see, that's just the recent attack, in Missouri. The week before it was TX, and the week before that, it was another. 		See the reason you didn't see the actions was because your state failed to get any momentum. All that was required for you to see more than just Facebook posts, was if your state was actually trying to do things more than Facebook posts. Instead, you should have been calling your reps one at a time, trying to explain the issue and finding one down to earth state rep willing to submit it. All it takes is a small team of just a few people, or in some cases, "Lone Wolfs" of a single person getting it submitted.		Then once the bill is submitted, you see the real attack. That's when the entire state is activated. Each state has HUNDREDS of volunteers on standby. You may only have 5-15 people making the meetings, but once the bill is in, all of a sudden, you have 100-200 ready to mobilize in your state alone (You'd be surprised how many are registered). That's not even counting the die hard national team ready to take action. Or the sleeper members, who don't want to get directly involved, but are calling you at 1am updating you on who's saying what, who's talking to who, and other inside info. It's crazy.		So from there, each step of the way, the PAC charges the phones, churning out calls, getting in touch from a grass roots position with every one that needs to be contacted. In some cases, it's the politicians themselves, in other's it's the small town local constituents who need to be called and educated about what's going on (reps and dems alike are behind this issue, across the board), and getting them to phone in their reps. 		About 1 out of 5 constituents you call and educate on this topic will call their rep - even though a good 4-5 say they will. Imagine how many people that is when you have 30-50 people making calls all day long. You have the core members, and their teams, working across the nation to educate constituents with passion.		Now imagine what that small town is thinking when he's getting a hoard of angry constituents clogging up his lines. Yeah, they tend to move fast and jump on board with the proposals. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.		They are so effective at this, TONS of states have legislation slowly moving through the slow processes of getting through committees. And I've yet to see it fail. I've seen people try to kill it, but I can't recall many actually being able to kill it. In fact, the last election round ended up in EVERY rep that was in the way of it getting through committee in an attempt of killing the bill, get voted out. Yes, the PAC is that serious, that if you stand in their way, they will mobilize your district and get you removed. Not only that, but there are some cases where they mobilized the district to get an even better Wolf to replace them at the local level and submit the proposal themselves. It's a corporate lobbyist's wet dream. A barebone organization is pulling off so much, so quietly, and so effectively, that it's just not possible for any other issue. Unlike corporate shills who pour in money trying to get their guys in office, Wolf PAC is getting things done the old fashioned democratic way, by presenting really good ideas via education and passion.		But yeah, my point is, they are doing A TON. They are quiet about it, because there is no need to be loud. Other organizations are doing just fine engaging in the discussion. Meanwhile, the Wolf PAC is the one actually with boots on the floor making change. These social media campaigns you talk about, I've never even heard discussed. Until now, I didn't even know it was a thing. At least it wasn't a thing from the action side of the group.		And if anyone wants to join, feel free. If you want to be a part of these big attacks, join and request it. Your state lead will gladly help you get on their local team and get involved. 		*Sorry for the spelling errors; I am in a rush.","depth":2,"score":52,"ups":52,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"duffmanhb","name":"t1_cr36xg8","parent_id":"t1_cr319r2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431139615,"created_utc":1431136015}

{"body":"Red states are actually very much so on board. The money in politics issue goes beyond partisan lines.		The only issue that ever comes up is that some are afraid of a "runaway convention" because they think a convention is too scary and potentially dangerious. Which is ridiculous in on itself, because the convention is calling for the states to convene on ONE specific issue, and still requires a 2/3 vote by the states to ratify it.		However, the reality is, the last 5 or 6 amendments to be rattified came as a result of the threat of a convention. That once more and more states called for it, congress would get scared, and eventually bend to pressure to prevent one of the most historical disgraces in our history against congress, happen on their watch. 		And that's realistically the plan. Just get more states on board (which is a TON. Like in the 30s have legislation moving through) until congress gets fearful enough to take direct action. It's a proven method.		Also, our communications are private so I don't want to give too much away, but Wolf PAC is making serious progress in TX. A bill just had its hearing and was a huge success. Even had D and R reps who were typical enemies come talk to us about moving forward. And some other really cool stuff like lobyists backing down.		So it looks like it's coming to a vote soon, to get out of committee and onto the floor.

{"body":"Well, first off, what you just did is like showing up to a climate change summit, and then saying, "You know I don't really support what you're doing. I don't think climate change is real. We should focus on something else entirely." It's sort of odd. 		And how do you not see money as being a problem? Money is a form of speech, of course. It's why Cit United was allowed, and many people like myself, understand why it was allowed. However, like many things in society, we have to determine when our rights become suicidal. I mean, it should be my right to protest, but it that right needs to be reigned in a bit when I choose to do it on a highway during rush-hour. 		One thing we do know, is money IS influencing negatively our political process. The data is extremely clear here. We also know that money is a form of speech. However, we need to find a balance.		Because what happens is that if money = speech, then that means some people have more access to speech than others. Here is an example: A corporation comes in, and wants a law repealed. It's a complex law that prevents Z-Corp from having a monopoly on widget production. Now while the law was originally created by some very smart people who were hired to understand the economic situation of Z-Corp's position in the industry to protect the citizens as a whole, the average citizen just doesn't understand the law. They just don't get it. You can try to explain it to them, and their eyes just gloss over, hoping for someone smarter than themselves to understand the situation and make a good choice for them.		Then politician Joe comes along, and Z-Corp offers him 100 xollars for his campaign. This 100 xollars will be a HUGE help to his campaign, and help him afford more than enough resources to beat out his oppenent. However, politician Joe knows that this law is good, and benefits his people. So Joe goes back to his people and asks them what they think about it. Again, he's met with blank stares. It's well beyond their field of knowledge. They don't have time to understand these complex issues when they have careers and families to care for. That's why they elected Joe to learn these things and make the right decision.		Then comes along a group called Y-Stop. They are a smart group of people who understand that this law is a good law that benefits everyone. And that if it gets repealed, the society as a whole is going to suffer. However, they aren't a powerful corporation. They are just regular folk who understand this complex issue. Unlike corporations, even the wealthiest of them can't afford what a corporation can afford on this effort. So the best they can do, to support Joe is 10 xollars.		Now Joe is faced with a dilemma. Does he take the 10 or the 100? If we apply some rational thinking here with game theory, it's pretty clear what the best move to make is.		He can take the 100 xollars, gain support of a powerful corporation that can heavily influence tons of people, and almost guarantee his reelection. Best part is, since his constituents are not really educated on this subject, if he takes this money, it wont even slightly nudge his approval rating at all.		Now if he takes the 10 xollars from the opposition group, which he knows is the right direction to take. He still wont get a nudge in either direction based on his decision. However, now he risks not only losing the opportunity of a net 90 xollars for his campaign, but now Z-Corp is going to give 100 xollars to his competition who does agree to follow Z-Corp's agenda. That 100 xollars is a bunch of xollar, and would tremendously jeopardize his own campaign.		So what's the most rational move to make? It's to take Z-Corp's money. It's to pass bad legislation. It's not that Joe is a bad guy, it's just that he's being forced to play by the rules of the game. And I don't blame him.  		-------------------------------- 		This isn't philosophy that's extended to just politicians. This exact logic is placed on judges. Again, no one is saying judges are bad people, but we have agreed to understand that money can corrupt even the best of people, and sometimes those people are in charge of our entire society. So we've said, "If you have any financial stake in Z-Corp at all, you can not reside as a judge on any case involving Z-Corp. Not because we don't trust you, but because we understand that the conflict of interest may cause a bias. So just to be safe, let's get another judge with no vested economic interests in the outcome."		So we are already limiting speech in the form of capital in the judiciary, so why not the legislative?","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"duffmanhb","name":"t1_cr3aqrf","parent_id":"t1_cr3a2ta","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431147651,"created_utc":1431144051}

{"body":"I'll have to research this if I ever get behind him.		I'm honestly a little concerned about too genuine of a presidential candidate.  Where will they stand when it comes to fighting against the BS?		But things I'd look into might include his talks, what bills he's voted on or abstained from, what bills he's introduced, how he's allocated funds (to whatever extent he can) for his state, politifact, etc.		He seems like an interesting guy, but I'm actually still recovering from last elections.  That year, I felt like I was surrounded by political ads.  I couldn't breathe.  Nearly caused an anxiety attack.  I have no idea why.  The colors, the tones, the constant political talk... it was like I was being brainwashed to pay attention even when I didn't want to.		Ron Paul ended up kind of cooky when I looked into him.  Obama seemed OK, tough enough to be President as well, not too old.  There were many things to disagree with, but I am not too happy about a Republican majority anything at this point because of the state of politics in the US right now.  Also, his political truth meter read well compared to his competitors, largely on issues I thought needed to be dealt with at the time.		I still think he's an OK guy.  Every recent President seems decent, but then when they get into the White House and get a national security review, things seem to change.  I wonder what they learn.		The hype.  The hype around him.  Or any candidate.  I just don't know how helpful it is.  It's frustrating.		"This is the first candidate I REALLY believe in, and I'm 35!"		I hear this every year about every candidate.  Reddit hasn't exactly been the best place to vet a candidate.		Out of all the candidates currently running, I'd say Rand Paul has the best chance.  I personally think Bernie will be seen as too old, too focused on social issues.  Hillary, no one actually likes her...

{"body":"Don't have just a tiny shred of hope: Bernie has a very, very good chance. More than people realize.		First off, in the primary, mostly only far off partisans vote. Not many people show up to primaries. Those who do tend to be on the extreme ends of the political spectrum: Those people like Bernie. They like Bernie a lot. Many of them will prefer Bernie to Hilary.		Secondly, the public opinion polls are generally done country wide, and then stratified by self-identified political party. When you do a simple random sample of the population of the United States, you're going to get a relatively standard bell curve on an x-axis of partisan strength (so more left = more democrat, more right = more republican). A lot of people are at the center. The center bulge, where most people fall, are median voters. Those people, as I say in #1, don't vote, but they make up the majority of respondents. Even among a stratified sample of only people that identify as Democrat (which would be those identifying as Leaning Democrat/Democrat/Strong Democrat on a 7-point likert scale), you're more or less just looking at half a bell curve. Most of the people are going to be not too strong of partisans. Those people don't show up to primaries. The people on the far left do. Public opinion surveys can be really tricky things.		Third, the 2016 election is the perfect opportunity. The economy is on the rise. The single greatest predictor of political opposition to a party is the way the economy is going. If the party in power resides over a time when the economy is doing well, that party *tends* to keep power. It isn't 100% by any means, but it is a strong factor. With things getting better, Bernie could be competitive in the general election.		Fourth, Bernie would be seen in the media as not a sure win, which is good! One of the strongest predictors for voter turnout that exists is perceived electoral competitiveness. If everyone thinks "Candidate A is definitely going to win", then people of Candidate A's party see no reason for voting, because they take the win as a given. When things are framed as far closer as I think the media would frame it under Bernie, more people turn out. And the more people turn out, the more likely it is the democrats will win due to their broad constituency. Add this onto the economic prosperity at the moment, and one can easily see Bernie winning.		Fifth, if Bernie wins, and performs well, he will have the incumbency advantage on his side for the 2020 election, and via the coattails effect, the Democrats will retake the House and Senate after they lose it in 2018 (generally the party in power loses Congress in the midterms, regardless of parties). That means redistricting for the democrats after republican favored redistricting in 2010 (Obama presidency, midterm election goes Republican, hence Republican districting).		Bernie can win.

{"body":"> what's your suggestion for solving the problem?		A 20-30 year generational attempt to push the country in the correct direction, starting with an effort to have a state constitutional convention to correct campaign financing laws. An effort by the population at the local and state level to get more involved in politics and elect people of integrity at the bottom and continued efforts using technology to make every level of office more transparent and accountable. Continued efforts at election reform, starting with the abolishment of the electoral college and eventually the implementation of some kind of proportional rep system. But you need the public to be involved on a bigger scale than what they've been in the last few decades. The system is composed of checks and balances, and unfortunately a large number of voters forgot that they are one of those checks and balances. Politicians need to be scared (not in a physical way, but a political one) of the electorate again and not so beholden to corporate interests.		I'm not saying the electing Sanders would be a bad idea or couldn't be a part of that effort, but people have unreasonable expectations about the man and the office that _will_ be disappointed if he was to be elected.

{"body":"Politicians have always represented the "interests" of their constituents. "Interests" have always been a code word for money. This is the way the system was designed.  The trouble is, when a politician's constituents have conflicting interests, whoever has the resources to get more of the politician's attention, or has something else to offer their politician (campaign funds, a job, dropping a lawsuit, etc) will get favorable treatment. It seems incredibly challenging to fix a system that is inherently corruptible.		It's counter-intuitive, but one way you could reduce the incentive for politicians to be beholden to their moneyed constituents would be to make political votes secret. The very fact that legislative yea or nay votes are public makes politicians corruptible. If a company or wealthy person couldn't be sure that all of their donations to a candidate's election campaign were actually resulting in their candidate voting for their interests, there would be much less incentive for them to make those donations or favors. The politician would then be judged on the effectiveness of the legislative body as a whole, and not whether they voted in the interests of their constituents. 		Such a system would lose some transparency in the legislative process, but it would likely result in more legislation actually being passed, as there would be little incentive for legislators to keep their promises to their partisan constituents. I believe it could also result in less money being poured into campaigns from special interests.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"splash27","name":"t1_cr2xqw4","parent_id":"t1_cr2voxm","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431122208,"created_utc":1431118608}

{"body":"Yes, it's a tough problem to solve. The same system that keeps politicians accountable allows them to be corrupted. Anonymizing their votes makes politicians no longer personally accountable, but also no longer pressured to vote one way or the other by special interests, or their own party.		I'd dispute the idea that with anonymous voting incumbents would win almost every single election. If constituents could be sure their representative was casting a yes/no vote (but without knowing what the vote was), they would know they were being represented. They could also keep track of which bills were proposed by their representative. 		Maybe the notion of "accountability" would be replaced with "effectiveness." Politicians would be lobbied to propose legislation, and they would be judged on whether or not their proposals became law. They would still be accountable for the laws they proposed, and whether or not legislation was passed, but not for the votes they made. "Ineffective" legislators (who had too few proposed bills pass) wouldn't last long in office because there would be little else to determine their value to their voters. The legislators who were re-elected would presumably be "effective" politicians who had more of their proposals become law.		 Legislators who proposed laws backed by special interests which weren't passed would be seen as poor investments by those interests. The most effective investments would be made to elect politicians who could build consensus and get their proposed bills passed. It wouldn't do any good to lobby all of the people voting on a bill because you'd have no idea whether or not they would vote to pass the legislation you want them to. 		Politicians would feel pressured to propose legislation and get it passed, rather than to vote a particular way. This would presumably create a culture where more bills would be proposed with the intention of actually passing, rather than being proposed as political statements to score points with donors. Would people continue to elect representatives who proposed bills which mostly failed? If they did, how would that be worse than the status quo? Conversely, if representatives proposed legislation which wasn't in the interests of the majority of their constituents, would they continue to be re-elected?","depth":8,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"splash27","name":"t1_cr30snu","parent_id":"t1_cr2y7zj","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431127647,"created_utc":1431124047}

{"body":"Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist.

[You can read it for yourself here.](http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf)		I have serious issues with the statistical methodology of this paper.  Take a look at Table 3 in the paper.  The conclusion in the title comes directly from the Model 4 column of this table.  		When the wishes of each group of people are added into a statistical model and used to predict the legislative outcome, the model says that the preferences of average citizens have a negligible effect (coefficient of 0.03).  The preferences of economic elites have the largest effect (coefficient of 0.76).		Now look at Table 2.  Specifically, row 2 column 1.  The preferences of average citizens are highly correlated with the preferences of economic elites (coefficient of 0.78).  One of the main assumptions in (most) regression models is that the explanatory variables (e.g. the preferences of the different groups) are independent of each other.  This is why they are also called independent variables.		The preferences of average citizens and the preferences of economic elites are highly correlated, which violates one of the key assumptions in the model.  This invalidates the interpretation of the regression coefficients.  The model gave a low coefficient to the preferences of average citizens because the preferences of economic elites explain the same variation in the legislative outcome.		The point of all of this is you cannot say that the preferences of average citizens have no effect on legislative outcomes.  In fact, Model 1 in Table 3 shows otherwise.		I'm not saying that Congress is amazing and they always have our best interests at heart.  I'm just saying that you can't make that conclusion based on the analysis in the paper.		**tl;dr: The preferences of average citizens are highly correlated with the preferences of economic elites which invalidates the model used to reach this conclusion.**","depth":0,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"noelsusman","name":"t1_cr2zt51","parent_id":"t3_35b40a","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431125941,"created_utc":1431122341}

[This site seems to back me up on that](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression/) (ctrl+f for multicollinearity).		In the paragraph you quoted they try to make interpretation of the coefficients more clear by producing the results in Figure 1 based on the coefficients from Model 4.

{"body":"While the study, resulting in Gilens Flat Line, shows the distribution of influence in the political process, it did not identify the cause.

(see Sec. 103 and sec. 104, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-84/pdf/STATUTE-84-Pg1140.pdf)	Two key provisions of this act are:	Meetings for the transaction of business of each Congressional standing committee shall be open to the public	and 	The results of roll call votes  taken in any meeting of any such standing committee upon any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast in opposition to each measure and amendment.	Intuitively most people are supportive of transparency, i.e., knowing how their senator and representative voted, and instinctively think that transparency is beneficial.	Transparency, however, is much more useful to powerful interests since they can afford to pay for provable results as compared to the general public who aren't able to understand the complexity of the legislation being produced, nor able to afford to change outcomes.	There are 21 standing committees in the Senate  and 26 in the House , e.g., finance, energy, banking, environment, etc. Most Americans have neither the time nor interest to attend committee meetings where bills are drafted nor the inclination to monitor Congress on a day-to-day basis. But lobbyists and activists do, and they use the information and access to ensure that the groups they represent are well taken care of in the federal budget and the legal code	Lobbyists have the ability to influence politicians while they are literally drafting a bill in committee and compel them to support their POV. And, since lobbyists and party whips can see exactly how congressmen voted, and political survival rests on their approval, then voting is guided not by conscience or convictions but rather by pocketbook.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rsmazur","name":"t1_cr37nv6","parent_id":"t3_35b40a","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431141086,"created_utc":1431137486}

You did read wrong but that's okay because the internet can be like that sometimes. My point is elected officials pay most attention to the people who show up at the polls on election day. Not to everyone of course because sometimes the desires of voters are diametrically opposed (e.g., higher taxes versus lower taxes). The best indicator of voter turn out tends to be whether an issue means enough to a voter as to donate even a dollar. In my experience, the fact one is willing to contribute to a campaign not just a "yeah, yeah, do this" cheer but also some form of tangible property which they could otherwise put to great use is a very effective attention getter. My experience also indicates politicians very often recognize just how important an issue is to someone if they say, "Look, this really means a lot to me and I know I don't have a rolodex or a rolex to help you get elected but I was able to scrape together a buck 29. It's all I can spare; please do good with it."

As an analogy imagine that you wanted to predict the the winner of the superbowl from performance in the regular season. You could use as your predictor the % games won but then you would be treating games that were won narrowly the same as blowouts. Imagine two teams that each won the same percentage of games, but one team tended to win by large margins and lose by narrow margins while the other tended to lose by large margins and win by narrow ones. If those teams played one another, any reasonable person would expect the former to win, but the % win model would give even odds. 		edit: fixed typo","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheLunaticFringe","name":"t1_cr32w4h","parent_id":"t3_35b40a","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431131782,"created_utc":1431128182}

You look at voting stats ( tihkn after presidential elections where they take in what people think on issues like wealth inequality / thoughts on health system) vast majority always vote very left winged, majority always agree with things like, "poverty is bad, money should be better distributed, I don't really like the iraq and afghanistan wars."

What I'm saying is that money in politics has broken the system and that's the principle problem, not people not voting. 		I'm more interested in getting money out of politics so that we can have candidates who have our interest at heart, as this article strongly suggests that they quite simply don't care about us because we don't get them elected, money gets them elected. 		One way to solve the problem is by getting everyone to vote for a candidate who does care about us, SURE, that is true, but it is far easier said than done, and there is no saying that we elect the dude and then money buys him after the fact.

{"body":"How can we fix this issue?      	        	How about this:    	      	1. ***No more campaign contributions that come from ANY private entity directly.*** Each election has a single funds pot, and it is split equally among each potential nominee. Every single penny used to campaign must come from this pot.     	Example: Your state has a $50,000 pot for their senate elections. There are 5 people running. Each nominee gets $10,000 to spend on campaigns. Anything they don't spend is returned to the pot for the next elections. If they are caught spending money that wasn't from the pot, then they will be disqualified from the race, and given a mandatory prison sentence.                 	Where does this money for the pot come from? Anyone who wants to help their favorite nominee is to put their contributions into this pot, with only 50% of the entire pot coming from contributions. They must also be informed that the contribution will be split equally among the nominees. They are allowed to state that they contributed, but they are not allowed to disclose the amount that they contributed. The other 50% of the funds will come from the politicians. Each person serving in public office will be given a 1% income tax that will go directly to the campaign pot. **Remember, you should be in public office because you want to make a difference, not because of the money.**       	        	1. ***Term Limits.*** No more lifetime politicians. The longer someone is in office, the easier it is for them to be persuaded against public opinion. A single person can serve three four-year terms of public office in their lifetime, but only two in a single position. The only exception to this is the position of POTUS, where they can serve an additional term if they have already served three. Example: Joe the Plumber has been elected to state senate. He serves two terms then unsuccessfully runs for governor. However, two years later he is elected vice-POTUS. He serves a single term before they are voted out of office. Since he has now served three separate terms, his options are to either retire from public office, or run for POTUS for a single term.           	       	1. ***No closed doors between the people and politicians & lobbyists.*** We elected these people to represent us in public office, that means we should be very aware of everything they do that could affect us. Politicians and lobbyists are allowed to meet and talk, that is their freedom of speech. However, anything spoken, given, or done between them must be fully documented and made available for public access. Any persons found violating this process will be given a mandatory fine, prison sentence, and the politician will be removed from office, along with the additional punishments. That way, if it is becoming obvious that a special interests group is heavily persuading a politician to side against the will of the people, the voters will have a much easier decision when the next voting season rolls along.        	         	1. ***Mandatory town halls.*** Each politician is required to hold at least one town meeting with their constituents. All records are to be made available in print for the week leading up to the town meeting at the location of the town hall. Any politician found not complying with this requirement is to be removed from office & their remaining term limits revoked. A replacement will be voted in & the remainder of the term will not count against their own term limits.        	       	This is all just off the top of my head, so I know it's not perfect.

{"body":"So yes this looks but let me explain why this is somewhat necessary. First off this has to do with the public policy process and for those who don't know, it takes A LONG time. The reason it takes a so long for a bill to actually become a law is because that's the way the framers of the constitution made it. They believed that slow public policy was better than fast public policy that may not actually be well thought out. At the time too, the framers were the most educated people in America, but they knew that the government down the line would not be from the same educational standing as them (look at congress today). This was included basically to make sure congress didn't fuck itself too hard by churning out policy after policy. They believed that in order to avoid any potential chance of a dictatorship this would be necessary. So that can explain the thirty percent chance of a bill becoming law. Public policy is intended to take a while, which unfortunately means that some things will not necessarily be addressed right away. So the ideal which the video mentions, would be nice in theory, but potentially dangerous politically.

No, the point of the study is that issues that are backed by high income earners are more likely to be passed by congress. Whether that is due to the effect of corrpution or the effect that high income earners have better ideas is completely open to interpretation. 		They list pharma as a major lobbyist and receiver of government subsidies. Let's look a little bit deeper at that industry. 		First, pharmaceuticals are extremely scientific endeavors. What gets passed by congress, a bunch of old people who are mostly lawyers, needs to informed. How do legislators get up to speed? They listen to the people closest to the ground, industry experts, the people who research the topics, academics, and they also listen to how laypeople feel about it. Now of those three, which are most pertinent to the practice of regulation? It goes like this: academics ~ industry >>>>>>>>>>>>> lay people. Now what is the average academic salary in biomed? 70-15k if they're a tenured professor. Closer to 150k if they're an older and more well respected academic. If you're curious about this, look up renowned biomed professors in the UC system. Their salaries are open to the public.		Continuing on with my point..: What was the salary a graduate student in my department received as soon as she got her PhD and went into industry as a regulatory consultant? 80k. What household income puts you in the top 10% of amerca? about 150k. 		Now think about that for a second. Both positions MOST likely to know a pinch of what they talk about easily straddle the line between the top 10 and bottom 90% of america if both members of the household made similar incomes. **Suddenly, it's apparent that it's less about money and much more about finding competent advice which largely comes from well compensated people.**		And what are the kickbacks that these guys cite? I'm guessing that subsidies for solar panels would count. I'm guessing that funding for research into rare diseases like ebola would count. Are either of those things the bastard child of corruption? You can twist every and anything to support that idea. 		So what am I saying? There's a threshold of analysis that should be done. That short webpage doesn't do it and neither do the majority of the people in this thread. I don't doubt that if i followed the references that I'd find some pretty detailed analysis by academics.

I'm not saying the alternative hypothesis is necessarily true, but that it's a hugely conflating issue that makes the study findings, as reported by the linked site, very very very shit evidence.

That's my ideal as well. But you can now see how clearly flawed the above website is. It's taking provocative studies, and spinning them as facts. The video is emotionally manipulative (note the music) and presents shit evidence in a shit fashion (you cannot seriously boil down the legislative process into one graph much like how you cannot boil ANY complex issue into a bumper sticker). 		There's tailoring your presentation to your audience and leading your questions, and then there's straight up omission and misrepresentation. The site linked blatantly sits on one side of that seesaw. That nobody is pointing that out only further to make the case that a direct democracy would be a terrible idea. 		Furthermore, the form of the republic isn't meant to directly reflect the will of the people. It serves to insulate governing bodies from the capricious and ill informed wills of the people. That is the nature of a republic as opposed to a direct democracy. And that's another thing the site gets completely wrong. You don't want a linear relationship between popular support and congressional action. If we had a direct democracy, we'd literally all be learning about [creationism in lieu of evolution](http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/hold-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx).

Rewarding politicians for doing a good job is great, but the problem is that *everyone* thinks their candidate is doing a good job, even if they hate congress and big government (here's looking at you, tea party) as a whole.		So the net effect is that nobody ever gets voted out of office by their local constituents, even if they're doing terrible damage to the nation as a whole and everyone who lives outside their district can see it. And the worst politicians nationally often do a great job in their districts because like all fallible humans, everyone loves the highway funding and army bases that get shoveled their way. Realistically, a politician could probably do something ridiculous like vote for a bill that calls for death to everyone east of the Mississippi, and still get elected by his district if a new interstate highway gets funded.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bartisgod","name":"t1_cr39zq5","parent_id":"t3_35b40a","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431145898,"created_utc":1431142298}

So take your pick; conform under a government which only allows you the impression that your say matters, or exist in a state of near anarchy where the government is fundamentally diffuse, and people have the only say. I would much rather find a happy medium, however such common ground seems to hold no more promise than a naive fantasy.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cirxe109","name":"t1_cr3e92s","parent_id":"t3_35b40a","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1431158121,"created_utc":1431154521}

Another example is the American Revolution: 1/3 of the colonists were pro-Independence, 1/3 against, and 1/3 had no opinion.

{"body":"A few significant issues that illustrate why reading source material is important:		* The Princeton study sourced by the interest group represented on the website linked defined the "affluent" as anyone in the 90th percentile for income. These are not, however, the "economic elite" that we seem to like to depict handing off bags of cash to senators with smiles and handshakes. The 90% is any American making above roughly $150k per year. Hardly struggling, but not wealthy enough to be single-handily nefarious. All things considered, these are Americans who are more likely to vote, hold higher education, and engage with those in office in a way that creates visibility for issues (i.e., have the resources to take off work and attend political events)	* The study points out that the interests of the elite usually (extremely often) coincide with the rest of the public's. It also points out that one way that the poor can cast their vote and have their voice be heard is extremely effective: lobby groups don't always champion the public, and business related lobbies are more successful for myriad reasons, but groups like the AARP and labor unions do take on issues that a great deal of Americans deem important (citation probably needed) and do well. 	* On that note, the interests of the top 10% do coincide extremely well with those in the top 2% (r=.91) but also coincide significantly (in statistics) to the views of the public at large (r=.69). The gap is present, but there is hardly an entirely separate group of held ideas. It would be interesting to see the study done again with interests of the *truly* *truly* wealthy, the top .01% of the country. Their interests likely fall out of alignment with even the top 10% of the country. The Princeton study cites this as an area where further research is necessary. 	* The study claims that the public's voice is most insignificant (to the point reddit would actually see as insignificant) when lobby and affluent interests are aligned. This should surprise absolutely no one, considering they make up the majority of contact with elected officials. Again, there are issues other than money at play here.	* Finally, the rich don't have that much power in the case cited. Only when 4 of 5 of the affluent were in agreement did bills pass with a 46% success rate. High, but that kind of support (and the source didn't list whether they aligned with mass interests as well) is noteworthy and likely extends beyond undue influence by income.		For issues not covered by the article and referenced specifically by the source, read:		Olson, Mancur, Jr. 1965. The Logic of Collective Action:Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.		Key, V.O., Jr. 1961. Public Opinion and American Democracy.New York: Knopf.		Both of which are usually recommended in political science courses and offer insight as to how and why interest groups and the "affluent" gain influence over American Democracy.		**Tl;dr: The group's suggestions are worth considering and even adopting, but their largely hyperbolic bullshit is an unfair representation of *already* biased academic work.

People seem to exist only in these echo chambers full of ideas and demands and wishes and then get angry when politicians don't magically know what the people want.

They listen to people who *talk* to them. Whether that speech comes in the form of money or letters or petitions, it is actually effective. How many people actually talk to their representatives? If millions of people told them that what they were doing was wrong, they would *have* to listen. But the fact is that millions of people are *not* telling them that. Millions of people are sitting around in their homes, grumbling amongst themselves about how corrupt the government is. How many of them are actually doing something about it? How many actually care?		People with money are actively pursuing their goals on capital hill, and while it is true and unfortunate that money does provide some advantage, it is not an impossible obstacle to overcome in and of itself. What money does is filter out the few voices nagging at the politician about "answering to their constituents" and replaces them with shiny bobbles and a cushy future.		My point is, the situation does not simply boil down to "money is too influential in politics." It is a systematic and organizational flaw in our government that representatives are so isolated and insulated from the opinions of their constituents that they can *afford* to not care.		The way we fix that is through organized public reaction. How do you accomplish that? Fuck if I know.

{"body":"B.S. In political science. Here's my take:		A lot of this is spurious. For example, the data for the graph was derived from surveys using the general public instead of likely voters. It's also an aggregation of surveys which compounds any errors or biases from the source surveys. I'd like to get my hands on the raw data, but it's not really sourced in the Gilens and Page article. Assuming that the study is correct, rep.us clearly took that material and ran with it to produce propaganda. Their video lumps elites and interest groups together, whenever some of the largest and strongest interest groups like the AARP and the NRA are largely funded by the general public.		I also feel I need to stress that, again, this data is derived from surveys of the general populace. The general populace doesn't vote people into office. The general populace has one power over politicians: they can vote. The general populace includes those who do not vote. Likely voters vote people into office. Of those likely voters, some voters have more strength in voting than other due to their location- which, although a major problem in our democracy, it's not related to corruption.		The measure for how much the people influence government is not general approval vs. laws passed, but rather, the rate at which campaign promises are broken. Depending on what politician you look at, it's usually between 15-40% of campaign promises broken. Which means that 60-85% of the time, politicians do what they promised to their constituency. Yes, political influence is not distributed evenly across the population, yes the number of broken promises is too high, but the public does have an influence in the passing of laws- it just happens on Election Day, not on the day that you answer the phone and answer between a scale of 1-5.

Text of their proposal from the Anti-Corruption Act website: 		> The Act limits the amount that lobbyists, clients of lobbyists, and employees of lobbyists or clients that either engage in lobbying or supervise lobbying activities may contribute to a federal candidate, political party, or political committee to $500 per calendar year. Additionally, these individuals are prohibited from fundraising for federal candidates, political parties, and political committees. This provision also includes a one year cooling off period: Individuals who make contributions in excess of $500 in a calendar year to a federal candidate, political party, or political committee, or engage in fundraising activities to benefit federal elected officials or candidates are prohibited for one year thereafter from becoming a lobbyist. Finally, individuals involved in lobbying activities are prohibited from making contributions in excess of $500 or engaging in fundraising activities to benefit federal candidates for one year after terminating their status as a lobbyist. 		One of the biggest misconceptions out there is that the Supreme Court's *Citizens United* ruling made all reform impossible without a constitutional amendment.

While those groups undeniably have an impact and should absolutely be reigned in, there's a huge menu of reforms we could (and should) push for **right now** that are 100% constitutional, even under the current supreme court. The Anti-Corruption Act pulls together those reforms into one piece of model legislation that covers everything from campaign funding to lobbying reform to transparency and enforcement. 		**TL;DR: Nobody is saying you shouldn't be allowed to hire a lobbyist to convince politicians that they should support your idea.

{"body":"That was a dumb video.		1. Public support. It's a big assumption to think you can gauge public support of complex ideas with a single number. Consider gun control -- there are issues surrounding the kind of gun, who can get it, where it can be carried (loaded or unloaded), how it must be stored, how long to wait before you get it, what training is necessary, etc. It can't be represented by a scalar.	2. Liklihood of passing a law doesn't make any sense. You can measure *if* Congress passed a law recently, but not if if is likely to in the future. Furthermore, in my gun control example, what if Congress makes it harder to get a gun if you've got a history of mental illness, but easier to get a gun if you don't have a history. Where does that stack up in the spectrum of support for gun control?	3. Then he draws a diagonal line, asserting that the IDEAL outcome is that an issue with *X* percent of support has an identical *X* percent chance of passing. Sorry, bullshit. Even if one-tenth of one percent of Americans think that raping six year olds is okey dokey, that doesn't mean that an IDEAL democracy would have a 0.1% chance of legalizing pedophilia. Similarly, if 98% of Americans think that it should be okay to wear white after labor day, that doesn't mean we should have a 2% chance of that becoming illegal.	4. The narrator asserts that Congress passing an unpopular law is bad, I cringe at this kind of *prima facie* assertion. Plenty of politicians voted for the Voting Rights Act even though it was unpopular in their districts. Sometimes politicians should follow their electorate, but other times they damn well ought to lead.	5. The image near the end links unions with trade associations, special interests, and billionaires. Thing is, of the ~150 million employed Americans, about 15 million are in labor unions. To put that 10% (actually more like 11%) of middle class workers in the same graphic as billionaires is the same thoughtless logic we see all the time when discussing politics, in an effort for balance. That portion was just plain silly.	6. Since when is "fix this mess ourselves" what America does best? Crikey, we dumped some tea in the harbor but without the French we sure as shit wouldn't have been free of the Brits by ourselves. Rinse, repeat.		Look, I'm not arguing that the political system isn't broken. It is broken. Money as speech is problematic; money from non-human and/or non-American entities is especially problematic.

Ultimately, this video just tells people what they already believe and what they want to hear, without citing actual examples of popular legislation that failed.		As a counter-example, take gun legislation. That's an idea that's likely generally supported by many elites, but vigorously opposed by certain grass roots, and thus it never passes.
