The Pentagon is symbolic of America's military might.  Any deaths that happened were a bonus for the terrorists, but not the point of the attacks.

{"body":"Number 1 absolutely not. The test bag is a separate bag, and it is highly unlikely to cause a screener to miss real-world contraband. If anything, its acts like wake up call to thoroughly scan every single item coming across because one will literally never know when something real or fake is going to get sent thru. The test bag, additionally, is only one testing mechanism utilized by TSA and there are other things that happen both physically and virtually to attempt to increase screener awareness. Number 2 TSA are regularly trained to scan their own personnel. A TSA screener has to show an ID to get through the checkpoint, must scan their IDs to get through various doors or past certain points, and are subjected a mind-numbingly high number of other checks and balances to ensure they are real. A TSA imposter would have an incredibly difficult time making it to the check point in the first place.		They already do have roving teams, red teams, which travel throughout the country trying to figure out clever ways of bypassing TSA security. Additionally, many new employees are sent through as security tester before assignment to boost this effort.","depth":6,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MaybeZoidberg","name":"t1_crs3jnt","parent_id":"t1_crs2tnw","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433187350,"created_utc":1433183750}

As far as being disguised, you dont think anyone can simulate a badge, put on a white shirt, tie, black pants, blue gloves and look official for 30 seconds to an unsuspecting traveler untrained in NSA standards?

{"body":"Did you read the original article? The one where it says the 95% fail rate was via DHS/TSA red teams, and not by normal test bags often used by TSA supervisors?		I say absolutely not to number 1 simply because when one stares at an x-ray machine for an hour and something that looks like a bomb pops up, one generally wakes the fuck up. Thats a major part for doing it, to keep the screeners active and on their toes. When one thing that looks like a bomb hits the screen, everything starts to look like a friggin bomb. My point is that a fake bag will absolutely not cause someone to miss a real bag. 		To number 2, can someone dress up similar to a TSA screener and wander into an airport? Yea its possible, but the uniform is exactly the same for every single screener, minus the epaulets. So if one little thing is off it will immediately be suspicious. If the person doesnt have an authentic ID they won't get thru physical security. And if the person is off wondering thru the airport alone and not immediately recognizable to other staff, screeners will challenge them. 		If some weird psudo-looking TSA guy hands you a bag in the parking lot and says carry it thru security, then yea obviously thats weird and suspicious, common sense will prevail. If the supervisor standing next an x-ray machine just asks you to place something on the machine, its significantly less suspicious. Should you do it? I dont know, nor do i even care. If you don't inherently trust TSA thats your personal issue. But they're just people trying to do their job. 		Nothing in security is 100%. Nothing on this planet is designated 100% safe from all potential hazards. This is threat assessment 101. You mitigate and minimize the risks. With regards to someone dressing up like a TSA screener, i believe the risk is sufficiently mitigated to not be a threat.","depth":8,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MaybeZoidberg","name":"t1_crs6ekd","parent_id":"t1_crs4xju","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433191712,"created_utc":1433188112}

Because letting private companies run everything can often times work against the public interest.

The real issue with trains in Britain is a chronic lack of investment, politicians playing politics with what little investment goes where, and a refusal to increase said investment (except for huge vanity projects).

{"body":"The point is not to catch terrorists.		 It's a subtle point, but one worth making. The point of the extra inspections is to create an obstacle to a serious coordinated attack. 		All Qaeda cannot plan massive coordinated attack if it depends on the luck of not happening to get caught by the TSA.		If you bring a water bottle onto a plane, all that happens is the water bottle is taken away. If you're bringing a shoe or undrerwear bomb onto a plane, it's not like they'll just confiscate the shoe or the underwear. 		Instead you'll be arrested, and probably all fights will be grounded. The attack you've been planning for months or years will be ruined. 		The purpose of the TSA doing inspections is to ensure that al Qaeda is forced to do smaller operations.		---------		**My opinion**: The TSAs enhanced screenings should be eliminated. Yes that means that people will be able to smuggle shoe, underwear, and liquid bombs onto airplanes. But that is OK:		- don't be terrorized by terrorists		In the 1970s plenty of planes were highjacked or bombed. People kept flying.

In a system like this one, it requires the citizens to have money in order to exert power, Instead, what happened (as is the case with all governments with people interested in keeping their power) they deny their population the resources that would threaten their power. The way the US elites handled it was to enact a system of a super-virtualized economy called a 'credit' system where they can manage the dollars (and the citizens). *Dollars are the basis of a virtual economy as well above the real economy, and the credit system is the economic system to manage and control the dollars and the citizen's access to dollars.		The credit system not only blockades the citizen from access to the currency, but it also controls the citizens further through the 'hard' system backing the credit system by way of enforcement. This credit system further exemplifies the rule of power by a velvet glove (over an iron clad fist) in that the credit system is backed by this 'hard' system. The control of the citizen is no longer direct, but rather directed.		The US further designed their economy for their citizen to participate in the economy only through this system of credit, rather than the dollars.

{"body":"I used to live by SeaTac Airport in Washington state and rode the bus through there every day on the way to and from school.  An overwhelming majority of TSA agents I saw riding the bus to work were Somali immigrants (big Somali community around there).		They'd constantly try riding without paying fare by pretending they didn't understand enough english when the driver told them they were short.  Drivers were constantly telling them to stop trying to rip off the bus fare system and kicking them off instead of letting them ride.  A lot of the ones that were on the bus did that thing where they prop a cellphone against their head using their hijab/niqab thing, and then proceed to talk loudly the entire ride.		It always made me think that these folks probably are great candidates for TSA because TSA will only take people with clean backgrounds.  If you come from some shithole 3rd-world country like Somalia, you could have been a mass murderer and it's not like they have a dependable system to report that info to the US.  So immigrants who've made mistakes in their past would get jobs with TSA easily while Americans with a DUI 10 years ago probably don't get hired at all.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HelpingOutPops","name":"t1_crs8z6m","parent_id":"t1_crs4kvm","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433195662,"created_utc":1433192062}

"Oh", she says,"then we'll have to inspect it". So they opened the case right there in the open area, took it out of the case, made me play something on it (a solid body guitar that makes very little sound on its own, mind you) then they took the back cover off to look inside the control cavity. Then they asked me about the spare strings that was in the case,and the tuner / metronome. They had a fit when they made me turn it on, and it started clicking. I thought they were going to call the bomb squad, or stomp it to pieces. But I turned it off and patiently had to explain to them what a metronome is and what its use is. And take its battery out and show them the insides. I was getting annoyed when another TSA agent walks up and says, "he's a guitar player  - let him go. I (the agent) play guitar too".

You're assuming that people are both informed and somewhat rational. Also, so much of the US economy is based on war that it's unlikely that given the choice between invading innocent nations or having fewer jobs and a worse economy, most Americans would most likely rather invade some more. 			>Like free college for all just isn't possible for America right now		[Citation missing]		The only reason why it "can't" is because there's too much money being made by greedy, powerful people. Telling them "no more" would be the hard part. 		Actually teaching students within a new and affordable system is actually very easy. Teaching doesn't require magic.

Tar coats the cilia in your lungs which causes them to stop working.		From the American Lung Association:	>"Smoke is harmful to lung health. Whether from burning wood, tobacco or marijuana, toxins and carcinogens are 	 released from the combustion of materials. Smoke from marijuana combustion has been shown to contain many of the same toxins, irritants and carcinogens as tobacco smoke."		http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/about-smoking/health-effects/marijuana-lung-health.html		Smoke is harmful to lungs - that's a fact. Hell, even smoking green tee is bad.		>Smoking marijuana clearly damages the human lung. Research shows that smoking marijuana causes chronic bronchitis and marijuana smoke has been shown to injure the cell linings of the large airways, which could explain why smoking marijuana leads to symptoms such as chronic cough, phlegm production, wheeze and acute bronchitis.4		Your also forgetting that smoking marijuana causes you to breathe carbon monoxide, which is also dangerous.		>CO binds to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells 200 times more effectively than oxygen does. The result is that many of these blood cells that were designed to carry oxygen to different parts of the body, instead bind to the CO, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). This means that the heart has to do more work to supply the necessary amount of oxygen to the body. There is good evidence that high levels of carbon monoxide in the blood of smokers is one of the main factors causing smokers to have increased rates of cardiovascular diseases (such as angina and heart attacks). Other factors include platelet aggregation increasing the ???stickiness??? in the blood, stimulated by oxidant gases in cigarette smoke, and increased myocardial oxygen demand caused by nicotine. But it is clear that the reduced oxygen supply caused by carbon monoxide is a major factor. For example, increasing blood CO levels (either by smoking non-nicotine cigarettes or inhaling CO) has been shown to reduce the amount of exercize required to cause angina (chest pain) in patients with a history of angina.		http://www.healthline.com/health-blogs/freedom-smoking/carbon-monoxide-cigarette-smoke		Keep in mind, I never say smoking marijuana causes cancer. I said it isn't good for you. The people who get cancer from smoking get it because they smoke two packs a day for 30 years, which clearly people don't do with marijuana.

{"body":"This, of course, ignores the fact that even with perfect screening, they've just moved the goalposts for terrorists. Let me paint a little picture for you...  		It's the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, the day everyone considers the busiest travel day of the year. At airports across the country, local news reporters are doing remotes, because that's just what they do. The lines waiting to pass through security are packed, but everyone is trying to stay upbeat as they inch forward.  		In Dallas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, and a half dozen other airports, individual men each roll forward their regulation size carryon bags, occasionally glancing at their watches or phones to keep track of the time.  		At 5:05 eastern time, just as the network news has finished their top story, 20 roller bags that never even got to the security checkpoint detonate, in 20 different airports, in the middle of packed crowds. In each city, hundreds are killed or wounded by the blast, and scores more are trampled in the panic. Air travel ceases, like it did on 9/11, except this time there is no easy fix to give the illusion of safety. Any time there is an unscreened crowd, there is a vulnerability, but how do you effectively screen without creating that crowd outside the security zone?  		Resourceful terrorists won't fight the battle they did last time. They will find a new time and place.

The huge government apparatus to hunt down random individuals that are only fractions of fractions of a percent of the population is a giant farce. Every citizen could be locked up in a jail cell and monitored 24/7 and it wouldn't stop a damn thing.

He was packing up to move to PA, and had his little sister help him.  He had his sister pack most lot of the weapons he had in a few check bags and he gave the rest away.  Long story short, he went through security, got on the plane, took off, and fell asleep.  He woke up an hour later, went to the bathroom, and pulled his back pack down from the over-head and put it on the seat.  He opened the bag to pull out his book, and right on top of the bag was his fully exposed knife set.  They were all sheathed, but it was *right on top*.  The person next to him saw them and immediately hit the flight attendant button.  Regardless of him trying to explain what happened, he was strong armed to the back of the plane, away from his bag, and required to sit in a jump seat supervised for the remainder of the flight.  The flight attendants took the back to the front of the plane and locked it in a box.  		When he got off the plane, TSA and FBI were waiting for him to get off.  He spent two hours in an interrogation room explaining that he had no idea they were in his carry-on, his sister had packed them, and he had gotten all the way through TSA, but the refused to believe that TSA would make a mistake that huge.  The eventually confiscated the knives, put him on a temporary no-fly list, and the FBI told him they have him on some kind of permanent threat list.  He's since been able to resume flying, but he doesn't know what's up with the FBI list.

So, usually i have a small AA bottle filled with water in my back pocket (thats how i also get those things into concerts btw) and sometimes they hassle me for it and sometimes they don't even notice. Anyway. One time they took it away and placed it on top of the scanner for the bags. I walk through the metal detector. Go grab my things. Then walk behind the security personnel, grab my bottle of water off the top of the bag scanner and continue to sit down. Nobody blinked an eye. 		Second story, also on a return trip from Turkey. I accidentally had my mom's ticket and she had mine. When my mom went through they didnt even notice she had the wrong ticket, when i went through they did. Then, while i was continuing to walk to the gate i just used some sloppy hand signals and half broken English (not that mine is bad, but you have to butcher your sentences otherwise they dont understand you) saying we switched tickets and continued into the plane.

TSA is trying to detect a threat that is infinitesimally low studying  multiple variables and EVERY passenger. 	How can this be done? There is no diagnostic test in this world that can accomplish this. 		Here are some things that can help though: 	Careful evaluation of select passengers (unfortunately not politically popular as people call this profiling) 	However, we do this in medicine ALL the time! We typically choose high risk populations to test if we have a test with low sensitivity (low false negative rate) and increase our positive predictive value. Because the prevalance of a disease is directly related to our positive predictive value! 		Secondly, TSA should stop testing unimportant items. By decreasing the amount of things you look for you can focus a make a test more powerful at detecting the important things (bombs, guns). I mean honestly, would a knife actually make a difference? The reason 9/11 occurred was because it was policy to allow hostages to take control of the plane. I think that has completely shifted. Again, another politically unpopular opinion because can you imagine someone bringing a knife onboard and the news articles that spurn from it? 		I would be interested to see of the millions poured into TSA how many security threat items were found and of those security threat items how many of those were going to be used for malicious purposes.

At times they'd hire pretty much anyone. You'd be granted a basic security pass and have to be escorted by someone with the proper clearance until you passed the federal government's security check.

Personally, I think the passenger security is a convienent way for airports to shake passengers for extra money, because after every security check there's always a store ready to sell you shit you just threw in the garbage.

I got there , looked at it for 5 mins, I needed to order parts. so get back to check point, changed partner, got out of american section.	What burned me then was that no other travelers were subjected to that level of "safety". So if there is a real threat then what is the attitude? fuck you all, only Americans deserve to live? Then I asked myself ;"Were there examples of airports where that ghettoisation of security saved life? I believe not once. Dear Yankees, how much is this costing you? How much do you like it? You have got to vote better.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"riconoir28","name":"t1_crs6rj1","parent_id":"t3_382zpn","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433192266,"created_utc":1433188666}

In the next tray I have my laptop, clearly beaten to death, with the padding not attached. I go through the scanner, and walk out, and one of the guards has my tubes and pulls me over. And I was distressed to learn that they were unregulation, and I'd either have to pay for them to be checked, or toss them???neither of which I wanted to.		Meanwhile, my laptop arouses no suspicion.

{"body":"Here is a little TSA story for you. So I was catching a flight to Florida from JFK. I was coming from work, and I was running late. I got to the Delta terminal and forgot to do my normal pre security purge. I have a ritual where I pat myself down a few times and empty my pockets before I get in the security line. It reduces my anxiety. This time I did a once over and then just got in line. I put my jacket in a bin and walked through the mental detector. No problem, I just breeze through. I put on my jacket and start walking away. I check my pocket for my keys, and then I feel it. I didn't know what it was until I pulled it out. There I am about 20 feet from the security checkpoint with a box cutter in my hand. I freak out and quickly put it back in my pocket. Then I slowly move over to a trash can. I find a napkin and reach into my pocket, wrap up the box cutter with napkin then throw it out like it was just some trash from my pocket.		This was 2011 at JFK. If I can walk through security at one of the busiest airports in the US with a Fucking box cutter in my jacket, then the TSA is essentially useless.

{"body":"> Well it works in other countries.		Funny joke.  Sweden finally allowed the private sector to compete with the government-run healthcare because people hated how expensive and shitty socialized care is.  The NHS gets brutalized in the polls in the UK.  Even the founder of the Canadian system has publicly admitted that it's been a disaster.  Socialized medicine inevitably leads to bloated prices, lower-quality care, and longer wait times, and people are finally waking up to the scam.

Expecting those protocols to remain secret when they are known to a very large workforce (which is known to be under-payed and over-worked) and practiced in full view of the public, is silly.

It takes 18 hours for me to drive home, I can get on a plane and be there in 2. That's all I meant, if you read more into it than that, then that is your problem.
