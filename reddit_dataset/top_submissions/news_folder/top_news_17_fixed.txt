No, that's not what I'm saying. You didn't understand what I wrote. People are rationally ignorant, and rationally irrational. This is an incentive problem. The cost associated with both rationality and not being ignorant are huge.		Imagine this person: He believes we need to kill and destroy all of those terrorists who are waiting for any chance to destroy the west. He believes the state needs to uphold good, old fashioned christian values. He believes homosexuality is a sin which needs to be dealt with. He believes the problem with the war on drugs is that it's not being fought hard enough.		These ideas, and the rest of his ideas are part of his identity. It costs him nothing to hold these views. It costs him nothing to avoid educating himself. Ridding yourself of your identity however can be painful, especially if your friends and family hold similar views. The same is true of ignorance. It takes time and effort to read educate yourself, plus, most people find that boring. It costs you nothing to not understand political theory, or to know about current events. There's no cost attached to you not knowing who your local congressman is, or what they most recently voted on, or how they voted.	Hell, even people who feel invested in politics are highly unlikely to have the answer to that last one. And why should they? Again, collective rationality does not always equal individual rationality.		You understand how silly it is to expect anything to change by saying "if we all stopped fighting each other, the world would be a better place.", right? How is politics any different? The same exact problem is present: incentives. Incentives that are inherent to democracy.		> A direct democracy where everyone voted on every issue directly instead of having to trust elected officials, who are easily corruptible and swayed by money, would allow everyone a voice- an equal choice.

It's about the value of one vote, versus the cost of spending hours and days getting educated. It's about the lack of a cost associated with staying ignorant and irrational, and the cost of becoming rational and informed. It has very little to do with apathy, or the state of one democracy or another. These problems would also be just as present and problematic in a direct democracy.		This has nothing to do with your points about apathy, or feelings of	powerlessness, or corrupt politicians. 		>This system would be better because it would empower people with the freedom to determine their own destinies, instead of being imposed upon by corrupt politicians and ruled by the giant corporations who have bought and sold the world.

That's like expecting world conflict to end by saying "if we all stopped fighting each-other we would be better off."

Well, you view is based in a misunderstanding. Your version of democracy is as unlikely to appear as anyone else's version of democracy. If it did appear, it would suffer from the problems I've outlined just the same, as the cost of holding irrational opinions is tied to the value of your vote.

I bear the cost alone, and I make the decision alone, so I put in the effort to research the best fit for me. 		If a hundred thousand people decided what car I would buy, then I wouldn't care as much, as it wouldn't be my choice at all. Research into the car "I'm" buying would be heavily disincentivized.

I'm pretty sure the person you were responding to is me. 		>We have a voice to make a difference, but a good number of our youth and even adults do not make the effort to keep their government in check.		You didn't understand what I wrote. People are rationally ignorant, and rationally irrational. This is an incentive problem. The cost associated with both rationality and not being ignorant are huge. 		Imagine this person: He believes we need to kill and destroy all of those terrorists who are waiting for any chance to destroy the west. He believes the state needs to uphold good, old fashioned christian values. He believes homosexuality is a sin which needs to be dealt with. He believes the problem with the war on drugs is that it's not being fought hard enough. 		These ideas, and the rest of his ideas are part of his identity. It costs him nothing to hold these views. Ridding yourself of your identity however can be painful, especially if your friends and family hold similar views. The same is true of ignorance. It costs you nothing to not understand political theory, or to know about current events. There's no cost attached to you not knowing who your local congressman is, or what they most recently voted on, or how they voted.		Hell, even people who feel invested in politics are highly unlikely to have the answer to that last one. And why should they? Again, collective rationality does not always equal individual rationality.		You understand how silly it is to expect anything to change by saying "if we all stopped fighting each other, the world would be a better place.", right? How is politics any different? The same exact problem is present: incentives. Incentives that are inherent to democracy.		>It's also funny because something we can't even prove legitimate is more important to us than the one thing that does protect us as citizens.

Let's also forget about the *massive* injustices done to immigrant workers during the industrial revolution. Upton Sinclair's novels were just fiction anyway, so why bother even reading them? 		And the 1920s, prohibition era, there was absolutely no government corruption then either, and definitely no involvement of local government with straight up mobster criminals. 		Also, forget that whole great depression thing also. Man, fuck that. They were a bunch of whiners. There was absolutely nothing to complain about back then. Things are much worse for the average American today. 		Then that "golden" era in the 1950s. Ah, yes, a car in every driveway. Life was perfect, as long as you were a WASP male. Also, all that great economic success, definitely not an unsustainable lifestyle leading to further instability down the road. Nope, it was just happy housewives and shiny chrome stuff. 		The 60s? They were great, just don't be black, or a woman, or near a major city that's likely to be bombed by those massive exploding thingies we made in the 40s to wipe out two entire Japanese cities filled with civilians. 		Then the 70s came, and thank God that Cold War nonsense settled down a bit, because now we're feeling way more safe, unless of course you're draft eligible, because if you are, there's a solid chance you get to be shipped to Vietnam to fight in the fucking jungle and only sustain massive psychological trauma if you're lucky enough not to be killed or lose several limbs.

How the fuck, do you think the situation we have now is anywhere close to early 20th century Germany, an incredibly unstable country surrounded with various countries of various radical political leanings from fascism to communism. We are quite the opposite. We have a bloated government, one that moves slowly and is not responding to change nearly as quickly as the public would like, which is causing much of the unrest. We have a non-unified scatter of criminals in our government, and we are unable to stop them because of this bloatedness. We are not influenced by the change we see around us, but rather are looking too far inward for our solutions and for our place in the modern world.		Please learn the history of your country, and of other countries, before you start mindlessly comparing us to genocidal governments of the past.

{"body":"Well, this is straight up stealing from people. And you are right that a law written down doesn't make a thing right. These civil forfeiture laws (and I don't even like dignifying them enough to call them laws) need to be stricken from the record.		As for taxes, in the grander more general sense I dont see them as theft unless the system becomes perverted (which it is). Generally speaking, I see taxes as more of a contract. The government provides services and those services have to be paid for. Ideally speaking, if you enjoy the protection of the armies supplied by the government, the public roads, state parks, and you hire employees who know how to read and write and such things... Then you pay for those services. Again, ideally, taxes are a means of exchange to pay for those things. The fact that they will collect on those debts by force if need be is nothing more than a practicality. If it was never enforced, no one would pay the damn things and the whole system would collapse due to default. A lot of people claim that they never agreed to this "contract" of taxation, but they generally do so long after they were born behind our walls of protection, grew up being taught to read and write on our dime, likely recieved subsidized medical care at society's expense.. And the come to this place where they are young, healthy, educated, protected adults who then say, "but I never agreed to all this". 		I say these things, but I'm not at all defending our system of taxation. It's compley screwed and wasteful. It's so complex you need a degree to navigate it and that leaves it open to massive corruption. It's also rigged to steal from people (you hear stories all the time where the government uses some tax law compley out of context to wipe out someone's life savings and then they shrug and say, "hey, it's the law. We didn't do anything illegal).		I just disagree with the idea that all tax in any form is theft. The way our system is rigged is and it badly needs to be fixed.

Sure, except there's no reason for the government to kick in your door for bullshitting on reddit. It's actually more insidious because it's much more effective to allow people to get away with whatever you need in order for them to remain pacified. You don't see some dark parts of dystopian novels coming to be here?		It doesn't bother you when the DoD refers to protesting as a form of low-level terrorism or that the administration has a "disposition matrix" (/kill list) with the names of American citizens on it and a president who assures people that it's perfectly Constitutional and no he doesn't have to explain why... Or laws like the one here that actually allow the government to take a person's private property and simply keep it for themselves. How about the Patriot Act basically allowing the government to violate our Fourth Amendment rights for years and establishing the FISA court to rubber stamp all of your surveillance overreaches and declare them constitutional?		Why does the government have the power to demand that a company give up info on customers who have committed no crime, and how is it okay to make it illegal for those company's representatives to say a single word about the request? How about the makeshift prisons in Chicago that resembled black sites where they kept American citizens terrified and unable to access their attorneys for weeks in deplorable conditions. What about elections that are actually bought, when billionaires fund presidential candidates who they know will make them richer and more powerful and even though must people understand our two-party system with too much financial influence from billionaires is corrupt everyone is too pacified to do anything about it or even really care?		They're too busy worrying about foreign terrorists who present an insignificant threat to them, or about the fucking mortgage or student loans they can't pay because everyone is kept in debt through not only a system which encourages people to accumulate debt but also one that makes it a near necessity by raising prices across all sorts of things as borrowing limits expand. And what about the wealth disparity itself, where we claim to live in a land of opportunity but a huge majority of wealth is in the hands of a tiny percentage of the people? People with nothing work full time too so don't tell me the people at the top earned it.		The system is designed so that those at the top own all the money and the people below them are allowed to have as much as they need because guess what - when you give a person below the top money they go and spend it on food or rent or clothes or anything else and it ends up right back at the top by design. This system makes sense in a way but it's obviously broken when work isn't being properly rewarded, when wealth disparity is ridiculously high. What about the money influencing politics through Congress, offering lucrative post-Congress jobs to our supposed representatives if they'll just keep on strengthening the interests of the corporations, it's clear bribery. And what about the recent study showing with extreme clarity that the actions of Congress have no relation at all to the interests of the lower classes (that would be "the people") and in fact they only seem to ever act in the interests of billionaires who can finance their campaigns or find some other way to legally bribe them. And what about the fact that media companies have all of course been bought up by the richest people in the country and so they can broadcast their political desires (to further their corporate interests or scratch the backs of politicians) into the homes of every American 24 hours a day? The main difference between our world and most dystopian fantasies from last century is that the government shares a great deal of its power with the people who own the large corporations.		I've never been accused of being a conspiracy theorist before, but I've never really gone on a rant like this. Instead of finding a picture of a tin foil hat, go ahead and look through this list and tell me if you can honestly call me one now, and if not if you can say with a straight face that there isn't a serious problem here.","depth":6,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SilentRover","name":"t1_csbpe7h","parent_id":"t1_csbkyz1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434710809,"created_utc":1434707209}
{"body":"No one is saying there aren't problems, but hyperbole, disinformation, and fear-mongering aren't solutions to corruption.		The courts have taken away several powers involved in the USA PATRIOT act and even put checks on FISA courts. They did this because our government is set up in such a way that there are checks to authority. Further, that we're discussing it openly is a clear sign that this isn't 1984.		The role of money isn't great, but it's not going away either. Fortunately we have lawmakers that acknowledge the problems with the system who are working towards real solutions. They aren't just changing the history books and telling us that everything is okay. And again, we're talking about it openly.		We live in the information age and as a result 1984 can't really ever happen. Public outcry in this era is more powerful than ever. Look at what happened with SOPA/PIPA, net neutrality, support for LGBT organizations, Wikileaks, public outcry to police brutality, politicians being kept in check when their histories are dug into, or countless other things that the internet has empowered the people to do.		So yes, I call you a conspiracy theorist. You're spreading fear through mischaracterizing the situation, over-blowing the power of "Big Brother", and throwing out so much nonsense that trying to address it all is futile; so you get to declare a victory if I don't address every single point you've made. 		This reads exactly like one of the long-winded screeds you constantly see on the front page of /r/conspiracy; where someone insists that our government is a great danger, but doesn't actually consider it a big enough danger to actually want to do anything about it. They don't actually want to do anything about it because they know it's not a big danger; they just like feeling "enlightened" and laughing at the "sheeple" who are going about their days without living in artificial fear.

{"body":"> so you get to declare a victory if I don't address every single point you've made. 		Christ dude, get off your high horse. I'm not trying to declare a victory here, I was just listing some things for you to consider. But you also don't make any sense when you think you can invalidate my points by saying that you don't have to address them. They're all real, and they're also only a few out of so many more. I don't feel "enlightened" and I've never said "sheeple" in my life, and I don't have any fucking interest in laughing at anyone.		If things are getting noticeably and progressively worse and you say there's no need to be concerned because they're not as bad as x and then you accuse everyone who points any of it out of being a crazy conspiracy theory, then it seems to me that you just don't really have a point. Some people blow things out of proportion? Obviously they do... is that your whole point? Anyway, don't tell me I'm a conspiracy theorist and then try to brush off my examples and points when you know that every one of them is true. I don't really care what it reads like to you, I don't waste my time on conspiracy theory subreddits, and I am *not* some crazy conspiracy theorist if I'm not actually wrong, which as far as I can tell I'm not.		The actual crazy conspiracy theorists are the people who believe things without evidence, and who believe in things that haven't actually happened and aren't happening. When you accuse anyone who says anything negative (even when it's accurate) about the government of being crazy, you've completed invalidated any point you might have had.		Now this is where I'd ask you what the pay is like at the NSA's Cyber-Propaganda department if I were actually crazy. Since I'm not, I'll just say thanks for the chat. You're right that some things that have been bad are improving in many ways, and that exposure thanks to the internet is and will continue to be a good thing for transparency, but public outcry often doesn't last too long.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SilentRover","name":"t1_csbx1bs","parent_id":"t1_csbw37e","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434730676,"created_utc":1434727076}

Unfortunately, it has been largely used since 9/11 to seize what could be considered "petty" amounts of money (think anywhere from a few hundred dollars to 5 figure amounts) that pretty much go straight into the coffers of the local PD's discretionary fund.","depth":4,"score":308,"ups":308,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Pellantana","name":"t1_csbgkvu","parent_id":"t1_csbg7si","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434685092,"created_utc":1434681492}

Also, if the police "determine" that there's probable cause (say, smelling weed), then they can search your stuff in some places.		Generally, the process is begun by a simple traffic stop. Say your tail light is out. You get chatty with the cop, maybe trying to avoid a ticket. Happen to mention you're on your way to look at a new car? This makes the cop wonder if you've got some money on you. So he asks how you're paying. You maybe say "cash" and he's in.

Yes, even if the dog did find something, there's a good chance you'll walk anyway due to the evidence being thrown out of court, as they resulted from an illegal search.

That's the whole problem, like the article stated: the threshhold for those seizures is so incredibly low that even an illegal search or some bullshit story from the officer will suffice.

Two sets of rules are applied in this case.  Of course that's not uncommon in civil vs. criminal lawsuits but right here this is taken to an absolute extreme. 			On second thought, there might be something to it.

My point is that there is a very good chance you are not engaging in a legal transaction in this day and age, or a transaction that is structured to avoid the Bank Secrecy Act's reporting requirements or other anti-money laundering measures.

I don't think civil asset forfeiture is bad in theory--it's probably a good thing that we can stop people from doing bad shit with money like buying sex slaves or funneling money to terrorist organizations either in the form of cash or through less liquid assets (e.g. New York City skyscrapers, sedans purchased by West African insurgent groups, etc. (these are real examples of actual money laundering cases)). The problem with asset forfeiture is in the procedural protections afforded to people who are targeted by it. Tenaha is an extraordinarily egregious example of asset forfeiture used in an overtly corrupt manner. That's not to say that local PD around the country isn't engaging in this behavior. But there is some good that comes of it too--how the hell else do you target Bernie Madoff, or Steve Cohen, or Raj Rajaratnam?

{"body":"Not entirely, but it is much more dangerous to interact with the pigs when a vehicle is involved. In this case, the following procedure may help:		**PROCEDURE C -- FOR DRIVING**		*Pull over immediately.* If you cannot safely pull over immediately, call 911 and make the following statement: "I am driving on [road] in [municipality]. A police officer wants to pull me over, but I can't do that safely. Please let the police dispatcher know that I will pull over as soon as it is safe for me to do so. I am driving a [color] [make] [model], license plate number [number]."		(You may still be arrested and/or beaten if you do this, however.)		When you have pulled over, if you have a smartphone, start the recording application of your choice immediately.		Your main goal is to *end the encounter as fast as possible*.		There is disagreement over whether you should roll down your window or just open it a crack and slip your documents through. The latter may cause suspicion, but the former makes it more plausible for Piggy to "smell marijuana", or worse, to stick his head into the vehicle and look around. Use your best judgment.		Keep your hands on the steering wheel until commanded to do something with them. *Never make any sudden movements, especially toward the floor of the car.* 		The officer will ask you for your license and registration. Produce them without a word. *Do not speak unless spoken to.*		If the officer asks you, "Do you know why I pulled you over?", or any other question for that matter, reply: "With all due respect, officer, I have the right not to answer any questions without my attorney present."		If the officer asks you to step out of the car, do so slowly and close the door behind you. Then pronounce the Litany of Warding: "With all due respect, I am going to remain silent. I not make any statement without my attorney present. I do not consent to any searches."		*DO NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD*		Technically speaking, the officer may only detain you for as long as it takes to run your license and issue a ticket. They may not lawfully detain you until a K9 unit arrives -- but they may do so anyway. They will in any case move as slowly as they possibly can. This is deliberate. You must wait it out.		When the officer returns with your papers and a ticket, accept them without a word and immediately roll up your window. There is disagreement whether you should drive away immediately or let the officer drive away first. I trend toward the latter, but use your best judgment.","depth":6,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"boccelino","name":"t1_cschxc2","parent_id":"t1_csc07l5","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434767039,"created_utc":1434763439}

{"body":"Some really are that dumb. 2 years ago I went to the Outer Banks with my fraternity brothers for the weekend. Obviously we were being loud and drunk and our party got busted. I had only had one beer and I was over 21 so I decided that I was gonna drive back to the house I was renting. On my way out one officer asks me where I'm going and I respond that I'm going to my car. She and another officer follow me in their cars the entire walk. Right as I get to my car they block it in from both sides. One comes up and offers to breathalyze me before I leave "just to be safe". So i oblige and I blow 0.03. That's when things start getting bad, the cops start telling me that I can't drive even though I'm well under the legal limit. They take my ID 3 or 4 separate times, try to tell me it's a fake,  and tell me to hand over my non existent fake ID's. When all these tactics fail to uncover a crime, they rifle through my wallet, frisk me, and then attempt to get me to permit them to search my vehicle. They kept getting more and more frustrated that I wasn't doing anything wrong and they got more and more belligerent. Finally they just said that I was not allowed to drive. I told them I was well within my rights to drive and that the whole situation was "bullshit", the one officer seemed upset that I was talking about rights and that I was no longer respecting his authoritah. He told me that if I unlocked my car I would be arrested for disobeying a lawful order. So I had my friends, who had arrived to watch the whole spectacle, start recording everything. Apparently this cop wasn't going to look stupid in front of an audience. As soon as I put the key in the door, I was slammed into the side of my car, handcuffed, thrown into the back of one of the patrol cars and taken to the station. After sitting in a holding cell for a few hours and being given a citation, I was finally released. Luckily I am from a well off family and we happen to have friends that are lawyers. So the next day, one of said lawyer friends called the police department on my behalf to lodge a formal complaint and to inform them of an impending law suit for the violation of my civil rights with video evidence as proof. The officer then offered to drop the charges if I agreed to not file a complaint or proceed with any litigation against him or the police department. Oh and a really funny bit is that some of my friends were protesting my arrest and questioning the officer as to why I was not being allowed to drive. Apparently the conversation proceeded something like this:		* Friend: Why did you arrest my friend?	* Cop: He was trying to drive after drinking	* Friend: He said that he only blew a 0.03	* Cop: Yea, but really it was more like a 0.04	* Friend: Isn't that still legal?	* Cop: Yea it's under the limit but we didn't feel it was safe for him to be driving	* Friend: That's ridiculous, you can't arrest him for that	* Cop: Do you want to go to jail too?","depth":5,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"throwawaywazzup","name":"t1_csbo4ao","parent_id":"t1_csbml14","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434705289,"created_utc":1434701689}

When you have a $300 flight on the line, you do what you feel is necessary to get through the airport and catch the flight.

{"body":"But there is no logical connection between those two things. I mean, yes, in a situation like the Allied invasion of Germany you can (sadly) say "American troops killed a lot of German men, but at least they didn't rape their daughters", because Americans agreed that the invasion of Germany was necessary and that that would require killing Germans, but didn't (like the USSR) adopt the additional goal of raping an absurd number of German women between the ages of 8 and 68. But the *difference* is no one, absolutely no one, would be daft enough to say, "It's really not fair to kill them unless you're willing to go all the way and rape their daughters first."		In this case, seizing assets with have no legal provenance is equivalent to killing Germans - obviously not the goal in itself, but an important part of fighting criminal enterprises. The additional punishment of sending the criminals to jail is, of course, not strictly comparable to rape - it is an additional step that could be helpful in fighting criminal activity, but *in general* wherever you can seize the assets and let the criminal scamper off with a warning, I think that's preferable.		Here's a better comparison - what if they took away plea bargaining? To say "you can never send someone to jail unless they are convicted by a jury." That would be strictly comparable - to take *any* steps against the criminal, you have to take the most aggressive steps. In most cases, I think it's good when non-violent criminals can get out of jail as quickly as possible after admitting guilt. Forcing the state to prosecute them to the fullest extent to get any jailtime at all would be terrible; likewise with forcing the state to prosecute every single accused criminal to take any possession to which they have no title.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"semraxua","name":"t1_csbjal7","parent_id":"t1_csbivgb","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434690718,"created_utc":1434687118}

{"body":""This might literally be the oldest trick in the book. I'm thinking powerful people have been doing this to protesters and activists since the days when getting gored by a mammoth was a leading cause of death. It plays out like this:		A) A certain group has a complaint -- they're being discriminated against, had their benefits cut, whatever -- but they are not the majority.		B) Because the majority is not affected, they are largely ignorant and uninterested in what is going on with the complainers. The news media does not cover their issue, because it's bad for ratings.		C) To get the majority's attention, the group with the complaint will gather in large numbers to chant and block traffic, etc. This forces the media to cover the demonstration (since huge, loud groups of people make for good photos and video) and cover the issue in the process (since part of covering the protest involves explaining what is being protested). In America we've seen this tactic used by everyone from impoverished war veterans, to women seeking the right to vote, to the protests about police violence you're seeing all over the news right now.		D) To counter this, all you need to do is simply wait for a member of the activist group -- any member -- to commit a crime. Then the media will focus on the crime, because riots and broken glass make for even more exciting photos and videos than the demonstrations. The majority -- who fears crime and instability above all else -- will then hopefully associate the movement with violence from then on.		E) You, in your quest to keep the system from changing, can now reframe the issue not as oppressors vs. the oppressed but as citizens vs. criminals -- supporting their cause means supporting violence. The TV will be full of images of burning convenience stores and looted storefronts, at which point the majority will then smirkingly say, "I would never protest government oppression by mindlessly destroying someone's private property!""		- Quoted from [5 Ways Powerful People Trick You Into Hating Protesters](http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-ways-powerful-people-trick-you-into-hating-underdogs/)","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_csc97n6","parent_id":"t1_csbeny0","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434750046,"created_utc":1434746446}

{"body":"Ok, really need to point out the consideration of this case. You've got a kid showing up to an airport reeking of pot, admitting to smoking, and carrying over 10k, which is actually an amount which needs to be declared. Seriously, who is stupid enough to carry $11k on them, that is nuts. If you can afford 11k, you can afford to use a bank, and probably get a credit card or debit card. 		Secondly, the government is basically holding it hostage until he can prove where it came from. They unfortunately have reasonable suspicion on him, Now, if he actually did earn the money legally (and seriously, red flags, I'm listing that as an if), then he can provide pay stubs etc (and if he were dumb enough to throw his out, he can get them from the place of employment). His W2 forms would be enough, just show income well above the 11k to demonstrate it could be accumulated over 3 years. Show standard of purchase receipts to demonstrate living expenses and he eventually gets the money back. 		Now, I expect a lot of people to bury me, but sorry, those are the laws, hate and protest them all you want, or better yet, learn what not to do to get screwed.		1. NEVER, NEVER carry large sums of cash for any, any purpose. The government wants a paper trail, if for nothing other than tax purposes. And if you have cash over $1000 make sure you have higher assets in bank accounts, credit card, etc that you can demonstrate.		2. Never show up to any government institution, especially a border or airport, with odor or traces of drugs on you. They can swab you , smell you, have a dog nearby, all makes probable cause and everything else is now legal for them. If you're a minor, even worse. And for god's sake, wash your hands, id, everything thoroughly if you handle drugs or they'll detect it on a swab test (they swab id's at border crossings)		3. Keep all your receipts, pay stubs, documentation, etc. Not McDonald's crap, but bills, big purchases, grocery receipts. You can throw receipts our after say a year or two, keep stubs for min 3 years. If you get into a case like this that documentation will be the difference of months to years of battling. 		4. If you need to bring a lawyer in, then take their 50% deal. You'll rack up more than $6500 in legal bills that are out of your pocket getting your $11k back, and that assumes they drop charges and don't fine you (resisting arrest, failure to claim, or send the IRS after you for failure to declare income)		And figure out a way to keep money in a bank, if you can afford $11k, you can afford a no fee bank account with multiple locations and an ATM card. You can get an account with no fees typically if you maintain $1k in the account, and free ATM at their branches (fees at other branches, but seriously, ATM fee beats the hell out of a cash seizure. 		If you get a credit card, pay it off in full every month, don't be dumb, use it as a transaction tool not money you can't afford.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Zetavu","name":"t1_csbsobv","parent_id":"t1_csbd0mx","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434722309,"created_utc":1434718709}

It doesn't but you didn't only have a few pills and a dime of pot.	You were driving with I'm guessing a dozen pills or so, an eighth of weed and most importantly $3000 in cash.

I think the police were justified in seizing his property and if they proved that it was going to be used for a drug purchase the police should be aware a portion while the majority of the proceeds go towards rehabilitation and education. 		Reading over the affidavit and civil complaint some things that really stand out to me are 		1. The officer is very experienced.	2. Clarkes bags were giving off a strong odor of marijuana	3. He had a criminal record, robbery to be exact	4. The date was February 2014 Clarke had said he is a student at central florida state and had been there since December 2013. I find it peculiar that he didn't have class in that time. 	5. A k9 unit confirmed the marijuana odor was on his checked bags.	6. Clarke had exactly $11,000 in his pocket. An extremely precise amount. 	7. He wasn't employed	8. He said that the money his mother was a war vet and that HE received money from the government because of that fact. 	9. When asked his mothers name so the officers could verify that she was a war vet he refused to provide it. 	10 When asked why his bags smelled like marijuana he did not answer right away and finally said I must have smoked it on the way here. I find it odd that he wouldn't know that he smoked or not. I also find it very strange that no where in the affidavit does it indicate that he appeared high, something that certainly would be present.	11. The officers informed him that his money was going to be seized (only temporarily until they proved that it was drug proceeds)	12. Clarke assaulted the officer and resisted arrest	13. The currency gave off a narcotic odor confirmed by the k9 unit			"After Clarke finally made it back to Florida???without his $11,000???he was forced to move back in with his mother, as he planned to use the money to pay for his living and school expenses. Clarke also took out additional student loans to help get himself settled at the University of Central Florida."		This sounds as though it came from an interview and was never verified. 					"Law enforcement argued Clarke failed to provide sufficient documentation for where his $11,000 came from, but Flaherty said she???s confident they have documentation from his three jobs and mother???s benefits to prove exactly where the money came from."			This happened almost a year and a half ago. Employers & banks have to keep records for 7 years, I can still see what I got in federal aide. Documentation of all of this would take me 10 minutes to provide why is it that after a year and half later there is still nothing? The police would not take this to court if the documentation showed how he had $11,000. 		Furthermore 	"Clarke brought the money with him to Cincinnati, Ohio, he said, because his mother was moving apartments, and he didn???t want the moving company to find his money. Additionally, because his bank had few branches, he felt safer knowing his money was near."		Has got to be one of thee dumbest excuse I have ever heard. This is implying that he was keeping 11,000 in his mom's home and the reason he didn't deposit it at his bank because they didn't have many branches. You don't need branches you have an atm card and why would you need that much money over at most 12 weeks?...why was 11,000 being kept at his moms house? Why didn't he just pay the $2 fee for using a different banks atm...I'm just not buying this kids story. 				Additionally in regards to your case. I also found it strange that you kept $3000 in cash at your mom's house in a safe. Why didn't you have that in a bank account?

Why. Because I was sick of my friends (and myself) of not having quality weed and paying to high of prices. So if one person went and bought a bulk amount and each person could have say a 1/4oz for $80 vs $120, and it was guaranteed quality - totally worth when were all college kids. I am simply a very frugal person, point in case - b4 i ever smoked any pot - I had managed to save up $5,000 and put it in a CD for 5 years (that way when i graduated college I would have something nice waiting for me). That didn't magically change because I started smoking.		I may not of made $$ at the time, but I did know the potential for it was there... and I knew enough people where I knew such a possibility existed for me (everyone at work loved my pot and was always begging to buy a gram or two if they could)		> should they have convicted you of trafficking being awarded part of the proceeds with the majority being allocated for rehabilitation and education.		Sadly, a very small % of that money goes towards these programs. Unless you live in a state where its legalized. Kind of ironic huh?		> Pills are a slippery slope.		For some sure. But personally, no. I only did them when I felt like it and managed to keep it like that for a # of years because I'm well away of that slope. I've had multiple friends fall to that addiction and even my ex GF (who I was dating when all this went down) was cheating on me with her pill dealer (i found out later it started about 1 month prior to my 'situation').		> I think the police were justified in seizing his property and if they proved that it was going to be used for a drug purchase		That's the thing... they can't prove something he didn't do and you can't(shouldn't) be convicted of a crime you never committed regardless of your "intent", unless evidence points beyond a reasonable doubt. In the case of civil forfeiture though they are more or less finding you (well your property) guilty of something you (it) didn't yet do. I guess if perhaps they obtained a warrant and searched his phone records and found that 2 days ago he said, "yo dawg I'm leaving in 2 days to come scoop that good shit from you. 11g right?" Then I would consider it justified. Other than that, in his case he does have a lot of priors that would indicate he probably was on a run of some sort (I'll admit I didn't read it as thoroughly as you).		> Employers & banks have to keep records for 7 years,		What sucks for me is that that $3,000 was no money I was saving in a bank account. So no withdraw slip and regardless of steady employment since I was 15 to 25, it made no difference. I even obtained a signed statement from the dealership I was going to buy the truck from, but it made zero difference.		Civil Forfeiture is simply a terrible thing IMO.

Sure possession of the pills/pot was illegal, but I was naive and didn't know about civil forfeiture. I mean.... how is possessing cash money illegal?

In my situation a guaranteed 50% of my stuff back was better than a chance at 100%, which to me is honestly just sad since I was never even convicted of the possession crime in the end. I was given state of adjudication, which I'm in the process of being released from. If your not familiar with the term it means my charges sit as 'pending' while I'm on probation, upon completion of probation they charges become 'dismissed' - but my record will still show an arrest. Which will take an additional 7 years to go away or I can spend more money ($350 ish from what a friend told me) and file papers to have it removed early.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Geldtron","name":"t1_csd18os","parent_id":"t1_cscq4jw","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434824897,"created_utc":1434821297}

{"body":"you're the one talking in absolutes bud. I'm speculating but I'd be surprised if you watch tv news regularly. 		edit. Heres the thing, you're implying that if we looked at the type of stories that make up the front page of reddit over a year or so they would be indicative of what most people want to hear. That simply isn't true. The majority of the people on reddit fit into a specific demographic and share many of the same core beliefs. The majority also aren't educated. 		What I found funny is that you you called the media bias and agenda serving when this article is incredibly biased and absolutely serves an agenda. Here I'll just point out a few of them for them.		Headline > Law Enforcement Seizes $11,000 From 24-Year-Old at Airport Without Charging Him With a Crime		* 1 This is FACTUALLY incorrect. 		> With $11,000 in his pocket???the culmination of five years worth of savings from various jobs, financial aid, gifts from family members and benefits from his mother, a disabled veteran???		* 2 This is stated as fact, when I will bet any amount of money that it was never substantiated by the "reporter". 		> Clarke checked his bag and headed to the gate to await the departure of his flight.		* 3 Nice omission about how he admittedly got stoned right before. 		> After Clarke checked his bag and headed to the gate, a ticketing agent with U.S. Airways???unbeknownst to the young man???placed a call to agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport Police Department. The ticketing agent told the officers that Clarke???s luggage smelled like marijuana, according to an affidavit filed by William Conrad, a Cincinnati-based officer with a DEA task force, with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.		* 4 This is actually great, its exactly how it should read! Unfortunately, it creates doubt when you contrast it with the matter of fact style she uses when talking about Clarke's side. 		> Clarke told the agents he had $11,000 in his pocket and agreed to let the officers search both him and his carry-on bag		* 6  That is in starke contrast to the signed affidavit of the Police officer. 	 	> When the officers attempted to take Clarke???s money, Conrad alleged the 24-year-old ???became irate??? and grabbed Boyd by the wrist.	???A short struggle ensued and Clarke was eventually arrested and charged with assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct,??? Conrad said in court documents.6. Nothing really about journalistic integrity in this one I just find it hilarious that he "worked hard" to save money given to him for free. 		* 7 This was cherry picked to imply all clarke did was become "irate" and grabbing the officer's wrist. It also fails to mention that according to the officer, they repeatedly tried to explain it and deescalate the situation. 		 > "In many cases, though, the property owner is never charged with a crime, and those who fight to have their cash and property returned are forced to prove that their belongings are innocent. The practice, policy experts argue, flips the presumption of innocence???innocent until proven guilty???on its head."		* 8 This is not at all what it does. It is called the preponderance of the evidence and it is the standard of evidence required in almost all civil cases. 		A reasonable person would find that it is more likely to be true than it is to be not true. Which a reasonable person would conclude is that it is more likely that a 25 year old felon who's bags smell of weed, admitted to smoking weed prior to, (The officer's affidavit didn't mention he thought he was high which is something he certainly would have put added), carried exactly $11,000 (awfully round number) in his pocket and refused show documentation for, his reasoning was he couldn't leave it at his mom's because she was moving and didn't want the movers to take it (why wasn't it in a bank...), and he didn't deposit it in his bank because the bank had few branches(certainly not because the irs would look into it...) , he then started shouting and assaulted the officers after they had repeatedly explained the situation. Nothing about this isn't making you ask why he felt carrying $11,000 in his pocket was somehow safer than bringing a checkbook, certified checks, taking a $2 atm fee, or switching banks, or any number of other things. Furthermore its not as though it is difficult to provide documentation if he did in fact  get it legally.  Based on the article alone if the standard for these cases was clear and convincing evidence a court would still likely seize it. 		If the documentation was as strong as his attorney suggests the case would be withdrawn by the government but it has not been and like I said this is just some of the bias contained within this article. It's almost as if that website has specific type of readers and told an extremely biased account of what happened in order to increase viewership and gain more add revenue. No i'm sure thats not the case, that would be like msnbc and fox news putting a democratic and republican spin on stories because most of their viewers are part of those parties, respectfully. 		> It is rather obsequious to exculpated everyone in power by defaulting to "it's just the voters/viewers/consumers fault		It is rather obsequious to condemn everyone/thing in power by defaulting to " ~~It is candidates and the mass media who don't talk about it because they serve a tiny minority of monied interests, and not the people.

How doesn't it? We may understand, intuitively or otherwise, that some parts of our self are less important than others -- if someone accidentally, or even forcibly, cuts my hair, or a fingernail, for example, we don't generally consider it an *egregious* offence -- but, as I tried to say earlier, I believe this to be a difference in *degree* and not in *kind.* Taking 5$ from you against your will is the same *kind* of violation as taking the last morsel of food from you that would prevent you from starving, even if the difference in degree is very large. We often let small things slide, but when we recall to ourselves what's really happening, fundamentally, we can be moved to action to stop something on principle, such as in this case where the confiscation of a gun is, for the vast majority of people, not a critical issue, but upon consideration should be seen by these lights as something to oppose.","depth":11,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SpiritofJames","name":"t1_csbznir","parent_id":"t1_csbyzll","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434734863,"created_utc":1434731263}

{"body":"This seems like a confusion over how the Federal Reserve system works.		Firstly, our physical currency is technically issued by the Federal Reserve, not the Treasury. The notes are backed by the assets of the Federal Reserve, which is mostly just a ledger they use to create money at will via issuing new debt (although recently the Fed has branched out into owning real assets via initiatives like quantatative easing). Ultimately, U.S. currency is backed by the U.S. government's taxing authority.		But the fact that the Fed originates the notes does not imply that they physically own the paper; but that question is not particularly relevant. Were the police, for example, to confiscate $10,000 from you and later return it, you would not care whether they returned the same physical currency as was confiscated (unless it was collectible).		It's the value of the currency that's important. And while the original collateral used to print the currency exists in a Federal Reserve balance sheet somewhere, a series of presumably legitimate financial transactions (simplifying greatly, Federal Reserve bank loans money out to an affiliate bank, which loans it to a company, which pays you wages in exchange for labor [labor which presumably allows them to sell goods and services to repay their loans]) have led to the value of that currency being your property.		There is no legal question that, assuming no impropriety on your part, the money??? in whatever form it may be??? is the property of the individual (until forfeited, at least). The problem is that, through a quirk of common law evolved from British maritime import laws and customs duties, reinforced through various statutes throughout the centuries, authorities have great latitude in confiscating said property based on nebulous standards of probable cause; and furthermore since the property itself becomes the target of legal action, the government employs formidable bureaucratic powers to keep the owner separated from their property in perpetuity.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"matunos","name":"t1_csbhrc9","parent_id":"t1_csbd5mw","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434687455,"created_utc":1434683855}

{"body":"No it's not. 		Money is created in two ways. The first is the treasury department prints money both literal (hard cash) and figuratively (issuing new notes, bills, and bonds)  . They sell this to the federal reserve at cost. The federal reserve then gets the money in circulation by buying notes,bills, and bonds. 		However most of the currency created is created through bank deposits. When you deposit money (cash check doesnt matter) in a bank the bank only holds onto a 1/10 of that money. The other 90% is loaned out. If you deposited $100, $90 is loaned out. If that $90 is also deposited then $81 is loaned out. This created $171 in new currency. The fed decreases currency in circulation by selling bonds to people which is a promise that the bond will mature in 30 years at a fixed rate with will gain interest every six months. The buying and selling of bonds increases and decreases the number of deposits made at a bank, this increases or decreases the money in circulation. 		While the physical device the currency is printed on is owned by the federal reserve it is loaned out to you and they do not own the value of that physical device.

The Second Amendment is about *national defense*, not overthrowing the government.

Article III, Section 3 begins:		> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort...		In other words, the Constitution itself **defines rebellion as treason**.		The notion that the founding fathers deliberately included a mechanism for violent rebellion is laughable. Rebelling against your government is treason, rebellions were already being/had already been put down when the Bill of Rights was being drafted, and nobody has ever considered civil war a "good" solution to political disputes.

Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, Jonathan Elliot, ed. 1836, vol. 3, p.168		???If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual State. In a single State, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.

(b) The actor's belief under Subsection (a)(2) that the deadly force was immediately necessary as described by that subdivision is presumed to be reasonable if the actor: (1) knew or had reason to believe that the person against whom the deadly force was used: (A) unlawfully and with force entered, or was attempting to enter unlawfully and with force, the actor's occupied habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment; (B) unlawfully and with force removed, or was attempting to remove unlawfully and with force, the actor from the actor's habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment; or (C) was committing or attempting to commit an offense described by Subsection (a)(2)(B); (2) did not provoke the person against whom the force was used; and (3) was not otherwise engaged in criminal activity, other than a Class C misdemeanor that is a violation of a law or ordinance regulating traffic at the time the force was used.

{"body":"I used to live in Cincinnati. It might as well be called "rural god knows where cow town," especially the area near the airport (which was purposely built in the middle of nowhere for noise pollution reasons, it's surrounded by farmland and undeveloped areas). I would not characterize it as a "massive city" despite the apparent size of the metro area; it's extremely suburban and spread out save for a *very* small urban core, and if you don't have a car (which is likely if you're visiting family from out of state as it sounds like he was) it's exceptionally difficult or expensive to get anywhere if you aren't in the city center; the public transit system is so horrible it might as well not exist, and it's not at all a walkable city.		As far as banking goes, regional chains rule there (PNC, KeyBank, Fifth Third; the latter is headquartered there) and I would assume these chains have few, if any, branches in Florida. Chase and US Bank are the only national banking chains that I can think of that exist there (and most of their branches are in inconvenient, hard to reach locations in suburban areas, again requiring a car to get to. I don't recall seeing a Chase branch anywhere within Cincinnati proper).		Other big national banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo do not have any branches in Cincinnati or Northern Kentucky. It also sounds like he was visiting family, I can imagine someone with an out of state ID trying to open a bank account and deposit a large sum of money, only to be withdrawn a few days later in a different state would raise a few red flags for the bank. It's also worth mentioning that federal money laundering laws require $10k+ in cash payments or deposits to be reported to the federal government, so it's not implausible that they would have gotten wind of the fact that he had a large sum of cash on him anyway.		Furthermore, while I would agree with you that carrying large amounts of cash around is generally not the best idea, there's nothing illegal per se about it, and when looking at it from the perspective of someone who is (most likely) unaware of asset forfeiture laws, it seems like a perfectly reasonable assumption that the **police,** of all people, aren't going to steal your money. Even if he did know about this, it's not like he could suddenly turn around and decide "wait, I better deposit this money" upon seeing drug dogs at the airport, because it's in the middle of nowhere.		Cincinnati is also not exactly the most forward-thinking and racially integrated place in this country so, unfortunately, I suspect his skin color may have played into the behavior of the airport cops. CPD in particular [does not have the best track record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_riots_of_2001) when it comes to race-related issues. In additional, I have personally observed overtly racist behavior from CPD officers on multiple occasions (i.e. harassing black people who were loitering in an area but not white people who were doing the exact same thing; setting up speed traps in the neighborhood where I lived and selectively pulling over only black drivers who were speeding).","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TookFiveMarijuanas","name":"t1_csblmr3","parent_id":"t1_csbh8km","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434696556,"created_utc":1434692956}

I don't have kids yet but should I one day I'm not missing my childs golden years messed up because some loser on the internet tells me it's "fun."

There, I acknowledged it so no one can swoop in saying I'm making excuses though the former has applied. On another account of mine I was talking with someone who wasn't making sense and wouldn't ya know it he was on acid and I was "Giving him anxiety" by talking to him in the comments so I apologised for it and moved on. -6 or so down votes because I upset someone by asking a question regarding their incoherent babble.

It's kind of sad that this is your go-to reasoning for when you deny a cop searching you. Will he still want to search you? Sure. Is he going to beat you up at an airport, in front of security and other officers? If he's the most stupid cop out there, then maybe. 		>Especially if when they get caught they get paid vacation time?		This is bullshit as well.

{"body":"I have a funny story while travelling from Colorado to new Hampshire. We got stopped at 2am at a toll booth on the border of Illinois and Indiana. I had crossed the white line to go to a booth that had just opened. The officers came over to us and asked us to pull over to the side because they wanted to talk to us. He never said we did anything wrong and I assumed he wanted to pet the husky in the back seat. I had no problem stopping to get out and take a break as I had been driving since 7am. The officer I was talking with was pretty cool as we were shooting the shit while the other was talking to my friend. My friend had just been in a snowboarding accident and could not fly home so that's why we drove. When the other officer came to speak to me he asked if we had any illegal drugs(with a long list of "drugs") or large amounts of cash. I said I had $300 and no drugs because we had guns. That was the wrong answer and I should have said we didn't have drugs because they were illegal. That turned him into rage mode when I denied his search request. He started threatening to bring a dog in and would arrest us, impound the car, and send the dog to the pound if there was a hit. My friend consented to the search shortly after that. They searched for  45 minutes and found nothing. I got a warning after 2 hours and no money or drugs found. They assumed we were running drugs and hoped to find something because the car had Colorado plates. I hope that made sense.

{"body":"Actually, that's a really great way to annoy a cop, and if he had reasonable suspicion before he stopped you he's going to make your life hell for it.  Not right, but true.		You're actually much better saying "My attorney has informed me not to have any conversations with the police without him present.  If you would like to talk to me, I need my lawyer.  If you do not want to talk to me, I am in a hurry and need to be going."		At that point, you have informed them of your desire to leave.  If they do not say you can't, then you can go.  At that point if they can and desire to stop you, they will tell you to stop.  At that point, you say "My Name is X and I live @ Y.  I have my ID @Z.  I can get the ID for you if you'd like, but I cannot speak with you and you may not search me without my lawyer present."		The above is much more effective for a few reasons - the fact that you sound much more legally informed than the "am I being detained" crowd being one of them.  I have friends who are cops - they always laugh when they get the "am I free to go" crowd, because they are generally speaking easier to catch on things than the average person.  The average joe is ignorant of the law, but cautious.  The "am I free to go crowd" is almost always misinformed, and that makes them cocky (and hence they make mistakes).		Don't get assertive with cops.  They are trained to use a continuum of force that maintains assertive control.  If you end up with a warrior instead of a guardian, they can and will make your life miserable.

The study also revealed that many of those households were comprised of low-income earners and minorities, with 71% of ???unbanked??? households making less than $30,000 a year and 24% being Hispanic.		>???It???s remarkable how many people down there in the lower 20% to 30% [of the income ladder] don???t have a bank account, especially immigrants,??? UCSB???s Lichtenstein notes. ???If Wal-Mart can make it convenient, safe and doable for that slice of the population [to bank with them], it will have a market.??? He also suggests that this segment is likely to pay slightly higher fees to use Wal-Mart???s services because of convenience and lack of trust in traditional banks to manage their money. ???Many of these people live on a cash basis and are afraid of banks. But they are not afraid of Wal-Mart.???		>The potential market size is enormous. Research from Wal-Mart in 2008 estimated that 28 million people in the U.S. are unbanked and 24 million are underbanked. The research also suggested that by charging less than the fees levied by alternative financial services providers, such as check-cashing centers, money-wiring stores and payday loan outlets, Wal-Mart could save customers between $3.25 billion and $6.5 billion a year.","depth":2,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"watchuseek","name":"t1_csbggo1","parent_id":"t1_csbg6v1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434684860,"created_utc":1434681260}

If you put it in the bank and make a mistake, say pay a bill that leaves you with $20 in the account, and then buy $50 in groceries, that mistake could cost you an additional $50 minimum in surcharges. Also, banks used to be able to re order you withdrawals to before your deposits. Then they charge you $25-$35 per overdraft, and when your check deposits, you're broke again.

{"body":"Civil Asset Forfeiture isn't right.  What happened to this kid is wrong.  The article goes to great lengths to explain how he isn't a drug dealer, or a criminal.  But it really shouldn't have to.  It's like it's some kind of preemptive strike against the suspected racial bias of the 'black kid with money must be drug dealer' attack that is likely to be perpetrated on him.  Even if he was a drug dealer it'd be wrong to just take his money without charging him with a crime.  That being said, the reasons provided for carrying around 11,000$ I think are pretty weak. 		>Clarke brought the money with him to Cincinnati, Ohio, he said, because his mother was moving apartments, and he didn???t want the moving company to find his money. Additionally, because his bank had few branches, he felt safer knowing his money was near.		Step 1.  Find a better bank.  	Step 2. Don't keep your money in your mother's house?  	(Steps 1 and 2 may be interchangeable)  	Step 3. Put money in the bank  	Step 4. Profit  		the whole reason for not carrying around large amounts of money is to A.) Not lose it. B.) Not get robbed.  So is it really surprising when somebody finds out you have it and you get robbed?  Governments and their agents have been corrupt since time immemorial.  Is it right? Of course not.  But this isn't exactly something that came out of left field either.  9/10 you could probably walk around with that kind of money and be okay, but is it really worth it?  I know everybody would like to live in a Utopia where nobody suffers and doesn't have to worry about this type of thing but that's just not the case.  	  	To reiterate.

The solution is simply that if police decide they strongly suspect the money is drug proceeds or is being used to purchase drugs, or for some other nefarious purpose, they can seize it, but must file charges within say 1 month (if their suspicion of crime is so strong that they can justify preemptively seizing the cash, the evidence should not require more than a month to be compiled sufficiently to form a case). Said money would be held in the meantime by a separate federal escrow agency with the suspect being issued a claim voucher at the time the money was seized. If at the conclusion of the 1 month period the police have not filed charges, the suspect can claim his/her cash from the escrow agency with the voucher.

{"body":"I think the analogy is not strong here. I don't think the underlying drug should be criminalized, yet in a world where it is criminalized and drug trafficking is also criminalized, i.e., in a theoretically democratically determined de jure regime, then society is free to determine the contours of what constitutes a substantial step necessary to raise criminal suspicion. Traveling with $10,000 USD has always flagged travelers as suspicious devoid of diplomatic immunity. This means the defendant had notice, perhaps not de facto, that you are likely to be questioned while carrying certain holdings of currency, e.g., in the US, $10,000 USD or more. 		The determination that this is suspicious activity has to do with a balancing of rights, individual against the collective. The individual has a right to not be charged for a "thought crime." Yet, the collective has a right in a democratic state to determine the contours of laws to protect the collective from what it defines and decides constitutes crimes. Since cash is the tender of choice for drug traffickers, gun smugglers, and hostile non-state actors, there is a nexus between the collective's criminality of the conduct and what it perceives as necessary evidentiary standards. 		I'm not sure the collective's determination to set the $10,000 mark was correct or incorrect, but even if the defendant is 100% innocent, I could see why the collective through its democratically elected agents thought it was reasonable to mark possession of $10,000 in currency as suspicious. In addition, I don't see this as so extreme considering this declaration requirement is fairly standard internationally.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Brigitte_Bardot","name":"t1_csblrp7","parent_id":"t1_csbfdj4","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434696960,"created_utc":1434693360}

Basically carrying large amounts of cash is becoming illegal. I wrote a future crimes thread that I actually believe they will officially outlaw it one day.	Because the government hates cash. It's harder for them to track it, people can use it to avoid taxes easier, and basically every illegal activity you can think of for the most part uses cash. Nobody writes their drug dealer check or gives a credit card number.		So I think they're just flat out going to make it illegal one day to have cash but as it stands large amounts already seem illegal unofficially		But of course the terrifying thing is also that keeping the money in banks isn't necessarily safer for people.
