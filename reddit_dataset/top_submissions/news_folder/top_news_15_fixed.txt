{"body":"PR is weird. Yes, there's a potential for it to boost sales for a few months, if the public reacts the way you would hope (and this isn't a unrealistic hope... sometimes they love cinderella stories).		But there's also the potential for sales to tank.		And it's not entirely predictable. This will sound dumb, but it works a little bit like how reddit voting works. The same post can be upvoted to a level that's ridiculously, or its nuked into oblivion. Apparently the first few votes (essentially random) determine how it will go. If the first 5 people downvote you, it never recovers... if the first 5 (or 50, whatever the threshold is) upvote you, it does well.		So if some asshole comes along and starts badmouthing him about how the guy almost killed his mama or sold drugs to his 11 yr old cousin, and a few more detractors pile on, it's a PR fiasco. If a few do-gooders dominate the first few exchanges of gossip, then he's the golden boy.","depth":3,"score":929,"ups":929,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","name":"t1_cs9ylyz","parent_id":"t1_cs9xve1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434576991,"created_utc":1434573391}

I nearly got canned because I didn't force the subject on customers already being customers. 		To my credit, when customers actually approached me with questions about the credit card crap, I told exactly what I knew: "The APR is ridiculous.

The same reason why Taxi drivers are upset at Uber is the same reason Car dealer's are upset at Tesla.  Its simply not fair to have a loop hole like that when Dealer's pay x amount of dollars in fees, taxes and other things to the state when Tesla is circumventing those costs.  Is it fair for Uber to exist in New York city when Taxi drivers literally have to pay 1 million dollars for a medallion (taxi license)?		Dealer's were not made by some shady car salesman, the government itself set the whole thing up to hold Manufacturers accountable for their vehicles.  It's to protect the customer believe it or not.  		Also if you could buy a car on Amazon you would not be getting as good as a deal you could get at a dealer.  In case you have not noticed the internet exists people.  In the early years (before the internet) yes car dealers were able to get away with selling cars above or at MSRP.  That's because when you went car shopping you went to your local "car dealer strip" and went down the strip looking for vehicles.  usually the last place you visited got the sale because customer's buying energy was all spent up and they just wanted to get something done.  		Enter the Internet age.  Phones exist.  Internet exists.  Pricing is not a secret anymore.  You can look up car invoices online.  Not only that but you can put "leads" into dealer's using the internet then have them fight over who is going to give you the better price on the model you want.  		If you get ripped off buying a car in this age, its because:		1.  Your stupid, and dont know how to math.		2.  You dont know how to internet.		3.  You just dont give a flying fuck because your wealthy enough not to and just want to walk in and get out fast.  		4. You have bad credit and want to accuse a dealer of ripping you off when really its your own fault for defaulting on those seven credit cards.  But yea its the car dealer's fault you ended up with that 20+% interest rate.  Keep telling yourself and others that.    		This is excluding those buy here pay here "small" used car dealer's.

{"body":"Briefly, sealing and expungment are different  (at least back when I still worked on criminal records sealed and in the jurisdiction I worked in). First what you can get sealed versus what you can get expunged is different, expungment is usually only for crimes committed as a juvenile, sometimes it's also for arrest records that didn't result in actual charges. Expungment means no private entity ever can see it, it won't show up on a criminal background check done by a private entity and will be removed from a background check information released by a public entity (courthouses, police records, etc.) But your "expunged" records are still available to public entites, when you apply for a job or any kind of licensing position unless the licensing entity specifically does not ask for expunged records. 		Sealing is generally the same with regard to released records privately, except in certain fields; anything to do with schools, Healthcare including pharmacy employment, and a few other fields can see your whole records including what has been sealed but not what has been expunged. 		Basically if it's expunged no private entity can see it but the government can still use it against you to deny you a government benefit, including a job, professional license, or other benefit. If it's sealed a few select private types of employers can still see it. It never really goes away. 		This website http://www.abacollateralconsequences.org tries to show by state what you can and can't do with a criminal record. It doesn't cover expungment and record sealing, nor does it cover the consequences solely of being arrested (I had a client once who was fired from a public school because she was arrested, even though she was not subsequently charged). Additionally the website contains some innacuracies, for example under Virginia it states that someone with a felony is  unable to "annul a marriage" or "establish grounds for a divorce." It's actually far more nuanced than that and a felon can absolutely initiate a divorce proceeding in Virginia, but they won't win a fault based divorce proceeding because a felony record is a fault and if both parties are at fault neither will win on fault grounds and they couple will have to have a no-fault divorce. Still as a general overview of how much the government prevents people from trying to turn their lives around the website is very helpful.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"question_sunshine","name":"t1_csaoq53","parent_id":"t1_csaexob","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434639714,"created_utc":1434636114}

You live in an area where jobs outside of mining are scarce. You exhaust your unemployment and finally have to settle on a job making $8 an hour at a Jiffy Lube. Bear in mind that six month ago you made about $30 an hour and now it's all gone.

Yes, prisons are expensive, and yes, the taxpayers foot the bill for that.

{"body":"Once the system gets you it is very very hard to break free from it. In my 20's I was on probation for almost 9 years after getting in trouble many times on stupid shit because of being in the system and being stupid and thinking it was all unfair. I had to learn to become very cautious of who I hung around and what I did until I was finally free from the eye of BIG BROTHER. If he doesn't get an attitude or chip on his shoulder and just hangs in there and keeps working on it eventually he will get free from the system. But it is one of those things where you have to change who your friends are and where you hang out for a while. Good friends will understand.		My most telling moment was when a friend wanted to go somewhere in my car but had a joint on them and I said ditch the joint or I can't take you in my car and they said thats bullshit. I said well if I get pulled over you get a slap on the wrist but I go back to jail so you figure it out dude. So he was a good friend and he smoked his joint and then got in the car. That's the way it works. 		No one is going to look out for you like you have to look out for yourself. And most people wont feel that your life change is their priority.		edit: Just to clear the mental image - I am a woman , now in the first year of the second half of my first century. My issues were drinking, bragging about knowing people with drugs, drugs, talking too much,drinking and driving,  drinking and driving with drugs, selling drugs to narcs who were specifically trying to catch me, violating probation several times cuz you actually have to do what they tell you LOLOLOL (who knew??) and according to the judge being just a really stupid individual.

{"body":"You're right Flavordaaaaave, I can't come up with anything... I'll just downvote you and fuck off then... Grow up with your aggressive nonsense.		I cannot answer why you personally should give him a chance; that would be your personal choice whether or not to do so, obviously, you fucking clown. I will tell you why I would give him a chance, not that it will matter to you because you're clearly a fucking idiot.		Anyway, if I owed a business (which I do) and I lived in Syracuse (which I do not), I would give this man a chance because he has served his time for his crimes and he trying to better himself and his life and I believe he deserves a second chance. He is no longer running with a gang, he is actively trying to prevent gang violence; he has earned his GED as well as his associates degree, showing that he is working to better his life and follow the right path and become educated; he is not dealing drugs, rather he is working to support himself through gainful employment. These are all signs that this man is deserving of a second chance by me. Yes, he made mistakes in the past and he served his debt to society for them. I made a lot of mistakes when I was young and I am grateful to the people who believed in me and forgave me for the poor choices I made. Had it not been for them, I wouldn't have become the successful person I am today. So as an employer, I would give him a chance- not multiple chances, but I would absolutely give him the opportunity to prove himself. Whether or not you would doesn't mean a thing to me- you sound like an aggro loser who doesn't matter to anyone.","depth":13,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dickholeshitlord","name":"t1_csachp4","parent_id":"t1_csabou1","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434602626,"created_utc":1434599026}

{"body":"*Personally* give him another chance? I can't answer that, you are entitled to your own opinions.		*We* should give him another chance because he has proven himself worthy of one. He has used tools available to him to try and better himself through various prison education programs and is actively trying to reintegrate himself into society. Rehabilitation programs in prison give people opportunities to do this, and he has chosen to pursue those opportunities. Prisoners who take advantage of these opportunities are much less likely to return to prison, as these programs are specifically designed to reduce recidivism.		Plus, we've all received a second chance in some form or another. People fuck up, get involved in shit they shouldn't, make mistakes, etc. Some people need help, therapy, psychological treatment, etc. Denying them these chances and opportunities does no one any good.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nuwayve","name":"t1_csaeztl","parent_id":"t1_csa9sv3","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434608273,"created_utc":1434604673}
