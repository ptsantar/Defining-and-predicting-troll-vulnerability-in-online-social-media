{"body":"I agree.  When I saw this video, my immediate thoughts were:		1)  There must be some undercover agents/cops working on the case and as such, the officer may have been attempting to protect their identity by destroying the video.	2)  That lady is too close to the scene and is putting herself in danger. I'd be afraid of someone in the house opening fire at the cops/agents and being hit by a stray bullet.	3)  The lady, while repeating she has a right to be there, looked to me like she was interfering with the bust/investigation with her continued rant.  Who in their right mind does that?	I saw the interview of this lady on the news.  I did not see her as a victim. I saw her as a grown adult that should have known better than to interfere with an investigation.  If she wants to video the event, go right ahead but wouldn't it be a good idea to do so at a safe distance and not make yourself part of the problem?  I don't condone police brutality but I am wondering - if a cop, (who has a gun), pulls someone over for a possible offense, what would cause that person to run, (as opposed to following the cops directions), if they are innocent?  I can understand why a guilty person would run as he doesn't want to get caught. I know if I ran from a cop, I would not expect them to be all sweet and gentle once they caught up to me...not to mention, I would be expecting them to shoot at me in an attempt to stop me in my tracks. I don't know.  I was raised to respect cops and the law and if confronted, to cooperate with them.  Again, I'm not saying that the people on the receiving end of the recent rash of police brutality were deserving of such treatment. But, what exactly did they expect to happen as a result of their failure to cooperate with the cop(s)?  If the cops do nothing and let these guys get away, what message is being sent to society - that you can do as you please and get away with it?  One last thing, why doesn't the public show the same level of outrage whenever a cop is injured or killed in the line of duty?  Where are the videos of that?  Where are the wrongful death lawsuits?  I'm not trying to upset anyone by going against the grain on this topic - I'm just trying to figure out why the outrage seems to me to be one sided, why cops no longer seem to have any clout, and what consequences a person expects to receive by running from a cop?

Because if I knew the cops had like a 2hour response time for all crimes because they had only a handful of officers, I'd commit more crimes.		Because for a lot of people, like myself, the only reason we don't commit crimes is because later we will be punished. Its like a friend once said to me, "What's stopping me from killing you?" To which he explained, "It isn't because it's against the law. That wouldn't protect you if I attacked right now. Its that I will be punished later"		And he's right, if we create such a burden on the police force, eventually they have to stop arresting and prosecuting crimes.

{"body":"Yes. Your argument is very good and valid. However, the point you make about balancing a few peoples' rights, and that of the many is very wrong to me. I'm aware that is the practicality of the collective vs individual argument, and that is how the system currently runs, but it still bothers the hell out of me. 		I will disagree with your last point. We should create a burden on the police force. Not a burden to be short-staffed, or to not be able to do their jobs. But a burden to follow the law. There ought to be a n institutionalized respect/fear among police departments when it comes to their attitudes towards the rights of the individual. It seems the attitude points towards that not being the case. My father was an MP, and then a police officer. He would tell me stories of officers who just wanted to "go out and bust people", he would also give me examples of when shooting a perp was justified. These cases are extreme, and thankfully they're rare, but there ought to be some heavy form of punishment, and sadly, being understaffed is not a good enough argument, to me it just says you're hiring the wrong people. 		Hell, what about a sort of general liability insurance policy, where, just like in regular insurance, what most likely causes the rates to increase are due to one's behavior. IF you're a good cop, your premium won't rise (as much) year over year. If you're a crappy cop and constantly have complaints against you, your liability policy will increase as well. This policy would also pay out in certain cases. 		I realize this is far fetched, but it's the only way I can think of taking the burden away from the citizenry and placing it a little more directly on the police officers.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"francisco300zx","name":"t1_cqkht21","parent_id":"t1_cqkhhch","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1429679889,"created_utc":1429676289}
{"body":"> the point you make about balancing a few peoples' rights, and that of the many is very wrong to me		I can agree with that as well, because it implies that when it comes to people, which ever group has the most people on one side needs to be protected more. Which is a bad assumption, because it breaks down more into the "Might makes right" ideal.		But there is an issue that is very complex.		Because the police forces are following the rules when it comes to punishing their own, because of department rules, union by-laws, state, county and federal laws. It's just that on the outside we see them doing everything they can to protect their own, when in reality. They want the bad cops out, but they can't just fire them without cause or else they end up paying out money, which is not what anyone wants and it sets a nasty precedent where a cop can come in at like a shit, get some attention than get fired and a fat paycheck for the rest of their lives. No one wants that at all, we don't want to subsidize police who abuse their power.		But it's a very complex system because the laws are written from a logical standpoint and humans are not, we are taking a logical system and trying to make chaotic people fit it.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheMightyBarbarian","name":"t1_cqki6tm","parent_id":"t1_cqkht21","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1429680664,"created_utc":1429677064}

Confronting the bad cop "undermines the bad cop's authority" in the eyes of the bad cop and the bad cops who "have his back". At worst the wanna-be-good cop has to arrest the bad cop for destruction of property, destruction of evidence, etc. Both of these will guarantee the wanna-be-good cop a shitty work environment at best, and real threats or actual violence to him or his family at worst. If the wanna-be-good cop decides to look the other way, there's a *chance* nothing bad will happen to him aside from a guilty conscience, but there's also the chance the public will crucify him along with the real bad cop. 		So you have cops that *want* to be the good guys, but they're mostly damned if they do, damned if they don't. But they're statistically better off doing nothing. 		Doing the right thing at great personal cost is something few people will do in their lives. If we selected one random person from this thread, I would bet a month's worth of pay that person would not report a cop destroying someone's phone if it *guaranteed* they'd lose their job and possibly be threatened with violence.

There's a difference between violence used to protect yourself and violence used as vengeance, or violence committed against the innocent.

Even had it been, it would still be wrong, as violence is not an acceptable course save in *direct and immediate* defense of oneself or others.		The "protest" we need to see isn't random violence, it's not people attacking others (innocent or not) because they're angry... what we need to see is self-defense. We need people to successfully defend themselves when attacked by the police, and then we need to bring all the social and political pressure we can bear to ensure that these people aren't punished for defending themselves from an unlawful attack, as is their right.		We can't base our actions solely on what is more or less effective. Police misusing their authority to attack and oppress innocent people is *effective*... but it's also *wrong*.

Destruction of documents by one officer of the government should not be taken to mean that said destruction is government policy. It is normally undertaken to thwart the work of other arms of government, and should be treated as a systemic threat to America.		Spoliation and perjury have made a mockery of our Police forces. It is fortunate that they heap so much honor and glory on themselves; I can no longer honor cops that I don't know personally, because as a group, spoliation and perjury and a thriving prison industry are all that they represent. Draconian laws have undermined all our communities, so they can't really claim to even be doing what they are supposedly *for*. I used to defer to the word of the Police; now I assume in all cases that charges of 'resisting arrest' and 'assault on an officer' are lies meant to thwart off attempts to hold them to account. This is a dishonorable state of affairs. It saddens me that they have pissed on their own brand like this, because I am a strong advocate of law and order. Still am, hence this rant.		If the system truly cannot: a.) resist locking up innocent persons, and  b.) succeed in locking up criminals acting under color of authority, then we will be seeing the whole notion of 'American Justice' come under wholesale attack. And rightfully so. The 13th amendment gives the US the authority to keep slaves. At present, it looks like that is all the system is for.		It gives me some bemusement to notice that wholesale surveillance is proving to be more of a problem for our authorities than it is for average folks. I'm not sure that the shoe wont be on the other foot eventually, but at this moment of our history, cameras everywhere really are bringing a pressure to make the country better.		The trouble is, it is DAs that drive the problems; DAs that work the system to, say, have a murderer cop exhonorated by bringing erroneous charges (I don't believe that was an accident, and why should I?). No DA has been meaningfully held to account for their role in undermining justice in our country, and so we are unlikely to see anything improve. It is THEY who tolerate 'testilying'.  It is they who engage in spoliation of evidence where it really matters. It is they who collude with police to enshrine violence as a normal policing tactic. We need to find a way to put the onus on *them*. We have placed them above the law; above judges; above holding to account in even the stinkiest of circumstances.

{"body":"We seem to have lost the notion that drawing a firearm means you *intend to kill* the person you're point it at. This is what police officers are trained on every single day from when they're a cadet. 		It's also why they carry mace, baton, Taser, shield, armor, plastic cuffs, rubber bullets and other items of deterrence before the deadly weapon is drawn.		I feel like we've lost touch, because now they draw their weapon almost immediately, as if the threat of being shot is supposed to make someone subdue their behavior. Cops don't always treat their weapons as deadly.

{"body":"You know, on the top of my front page is the Askreddit question, "what would happen if 9/11 was proven to be a conspiracy by the US government and the people found out?" Most of the top answers allude to hashtag activism, emails, short bursts of outrage, and nothing. And because of stories like this, I fee like maybe the American public just feels too bullied and helpless to actually do anything. There are bigger guns, more tanks, better technology--anything you could do to lash out against the corrupt government can be squashed by that government.		Philip K Howard has written several books about how and why government accomplishes so little without so much waste and red tape and little or no common sense. The gist of his latest book is that the reason for this is the lack of accountability. Nobody makes *the* decision to do this or that, it's just sort of a protocol that everyone generally follows until clusterfucks ensue. As such, it's hard to vote people out because we don't know who they are, or they aren't elected positions.		Now I'm not speaking of terrorism or any specific level of violence or vandalism or anything of the sort, but I bet that if the people could find out who was to blame in a 9/11 conspiracy, for example, and there were people who acted out against them vigilante style ala Boondock Saints, I think the culture of deliberate indifference and lack of accountability would start to change.

The 53-second video, recorded by a bystander on April 19, shows three U.S. Marshals Service agents standing in front of a house in South Gate, Calif. The agency was reportedly investigating a ???biker gang meeting??? at a bar in the area.		A woman standing roughly 15 feet from two of the officers is heard repeatedly telling them to keep their distance. She appears to be recording the officers with a cellphone or camera held close to her chest.			???I have the right to be here. You???re making me feel unsafe,??? she says. It???s unknown if the officers had already ordered her to move further away.		A third officer holding a rifle appears in the video and approaches the woman. As she backs away he dashes forward and grabs the camera from her hands before throwing it to the ground and kicking it. 		A spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service told the Daily Dot that the video appears to show an individual on their task force. "We are aware of the video and the incident is under review,??? she said. ???We're still looking into it."
