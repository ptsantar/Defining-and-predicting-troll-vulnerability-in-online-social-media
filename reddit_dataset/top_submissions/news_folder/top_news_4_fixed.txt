{"body":"Well, they were pretty obsessed with preventing tyranny and put in the 2nd amendment (right to bear arms) and the right to form a militia.  I guess they didn't count on America becoming a police state.  But I guess that's our fault.  If anything, they overestimated our intelligence to resist propaganda, Fox news, false flags, executive orders, and our desire for freedom.  Eisenhower was a douche bag at times, but he redeemed himself with his 1961 exit speech.  It's on youtube and also in text.  They should make this required memorization in high school. 		I spent 30 years working in defense and it destroyed my life.  I ended up in a homeless shelter.  I used to make $90k/yr.  The military industrial complex extends to the police state.  I haven't had a full time job in 10 years.  But I'm not taking it sitting down.  I'm just trying to find one fucking lawyer who has the balls to send a letter of demand to the govt.  It's not easy.  I had to fight city hall in CA years ago and not one single lawyer would take my case, not even the ACLU.  So, I represented myself in court and I kicked their fucking ass.  If I could get in touch with that tractor driver, I'd get him his money back, guaranteed.  Shit, I got busted for being stone fucking drunk, but I was parked.  The cops threw me in the drunk tank.  I had to go to court so I printed out the forth amendment and handed it to the judge and he tossed it on the floor saying "I've seen it before."  I said, "Good, then you won't be surprised when I appeal it on constitutional grounds."  I ended up plea bargaining for $50 in court costs.  The last thing any judge wants is to is to be appealed on constitutional grounds.  If they lose a case on constitutional grounds, they'll never make to the circuit court and will be stuck dealing with people running red lights and stealing candy from Walmart for the rest of their career.  		I swear I can get this guy's money back.  I'm busy right now. I live on $450/month, planning to sue for $25M, but if you feel like getting in touch with that guy, put him in contact with me, I'll get his fucking money back, and I'll do it for free.  If you ever have to deal with lawyers, and I've hired them, and fired all of them, 3 so far, the first thing you'll learn is that they're all scumbags.  No lawyer is going to help that poor motherfucker because 33% contingency on $16k, ain't worth shit to them.  I'm not a lawyer, but I'm fucking smart, and learned the hard way.  BTW, that case in CA... I was charged with "police harassment."  I can get that guy double his money back, and he'll have it in 10 days.  The problem is simply that people don't know how to fight back.		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y06NSBBRtY","depth":5,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nwo_platinum_member","name":"t1_crsrcv8","parent_id":"t1_crsqut6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433232257,"created_utc":1433228657}

{"body":"Reasonable suspicion in this case was not determined solely on that criteria, the context is quite important.		The driver was driving in a mountainous area about 45 miles from the US/Mexico border on a stretch of road which, because of it's terrain, proximity to the border, and lack of border checkpoints, had high levels of drug and undocumented immigrant smuggling.		The road leads away from a town known for smuggling, Douglas Arizona and is one of the only roads leading away from this town that does not have a border checkpoint.  As such, smugglers attempting to avoid detection by Border Patrol are known to use the road.		The driver's licence plates indicated that the truck was registered in Tucson, Arizona.  Out-of-state drivers rarely use the road she was on and it would be particularly unusual for a driver heading to or from Tucson to use this road as it would add approximately 100 miles to the drive.  The more direct routes to Tucson all had border checkpoints.		The driver was driving on this road at 7.45pm.  Border Patrol agents change shifts between 6.00pm and 8.00pm and smugglers are known to frequently exploit this two hour window.		The agent also noticed that as she drove past him, the driver appeared "stiff with elbows locked and hands in the ten-and-two position on the steering wheel. After he turned around, he had to drive significantly faster to catch up, **indicating she increased her speed by an estimated 10 or more miles per hour after	passing him.**  As he approached her vehicle from behind but before he turned on his lights, she abruptly hit her brakes."		The part about increasing her speed is important, because the agent testified that he paced her driving at 70mph in a 60mph zone which further adds to reasonable suspicion.		The court found 	>These circumstances can contribute to reasonable suspicion depending on context. See Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 275-76 (???We think it quite reasonable that a driver???s slowing down, stiffening of posture, and failure to acknowledge a sighted law enforcement officer might well be unremarkable in one instance (such as a busy San Francisco highway) while quite unusual in another (such as a remote portion of	rural southeastern Arizona).???). The dark tinted windows on Ms. Westhoven???s truck	raised Agent Semmerling???s suspicion that she might be concealing something or someone in the back of her truck. 		That lady didn't get pulled over just because of how she held her hands.			TL;DR: 		>Driving stiffly, having tinted windows, slowing down when seeing law enforcement, and driving in an out-of-the-way area may be innocent conduct by themselves. But when taken together along with driving a vehicle with out-of-state plates in a mountainous smuggling corridor 40-45 miles away from the border, we conclude Agent Semmerling had reasonable suspicion Ms. Westhoven was involved in smuggling activity. ???It was reasonable for [Agent Semmerling] to infer from	his observations, his registration check, and his experience as a border patrol agent that [Ms. Westhoven] had set out . . .

It probably would have been best if the police charged him with what he was doing wrong and let him go.

{"body":"If all of those facts are true, then not only is that money incredibly suspicious, from my point of view it actually seems very very likely that he was in fact using the money for drugs. 		I think the fact that he brought $16k in cash on a trip to meet a person that doesn't exist, to buy parts that don't exist, is more than enough to consider the money "suspicious". 		This all comes with the idea that if they were not able to charge him for anything, the money should have been given back. That was fucked up. But I think any reasonable person in the cops shoes who seized the money would agree that the whole situation is super suspicious.		I'd assume it went something like this:		"Can we talk to the woman you were going to meet?" (to try to verify his alibi)		"No she stood me up"		"Why do you have the money on your way back if it was to buy tractor parts?"		"They didn't have the parts I wanted."		That's fishy as shit.		Not to mention that anyone who knows anything about weed knows that Cali Kush is pretty much the cheapest and best weed you can get in a non-legalized US state. Half the time small time dealers lie about the weed they got by saying it's from California because everyone loves the weed that gets dealt out of Cali. Not saying that it makes the guy a dealer, but a guy driving out of California and driving back with $16k without any good explanation of where he was or what the money was for, I'm assuming that guy was dealing drugs 10 times out of 10. But again, if they don't charge him, they have no grounds to hold that money. Funny part of that is though, is you know how you don't get caught dealing drugs? You get caught without any drugs on you, which would be the case if you were returning to California with the money you made from selling all your drugs.		TL;DR If they didn't charge him, he should have gotten every penny back. But with all the facts, it's hard to argue that the money he had wasn't suspicious, plus **in my opinion** it does seem like there's a good chance he was returning from selling a bunch of California weed and only had the money left on him, since he didn't have a good alibi or explanation of where the money came from.","depth":6,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OnceAteABurgerAMA","name":"t1_crsjd5f","parent_id":"t1_crsioni","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433213766,"created_utc":1433210166}

{"body":"I can understand why though. Sure, they aren't certain that it's dirty money, but if it is dirty money and they let him keep it, it will be gone immediately. This is only acceptable if the police would give the money back if they don't charge him though.		This would be the ideal scenario: "This money seems very very likely to be dirty, and if it is, you're going to make it disappear as quickly as you possibly can. Therefore we have to hold it, but once you go through the process and can prove it isn't dirty, you get it back, plus interest for us holding it from you." 		It's a system that could work, but all goes to complete shit if the cops don't give the money back. From what I've gathered, the cops fucked up big time by not giving the money back, but I think that the guy was way to suspicious to just let him leave and get away with what appears to be dirty money. If I was the cop who pulled him over and found the money and heard his story about the mystery girl and the mystery tractor parts, I'm assuming that it's drug money 110%, and letting him keep the money is basically just letting him off the hook.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OnceAteABurgerAMA","name":"t1_crsna0r","parent_id":"t1_crsmvkm","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433221162,"created_utc":1433217562}

Due process is important, as is the concept of innocent until proven guilty. This new law helps both when it comes to civil forfeiture.

I have heard of police keeping property for 2 years while they "investigated". This is longer than normal though....I would expect <1 year.		On the *very* outside they couldn't keep it past the statute of limitations of whatever "crime" they are investigating. Which could be 1-7 years all depending.		An additional note: when it comes to money many(all?) states have abandonded property laws, where the money goes to the state for safe keeping until you retrieve it. The police do not get to keep it if you don't pick it up in time. 		A good video about civil asset forfeiture is linked below by /u/translatedcomment.

The police can't be just another gang.

Most contingency fees range between 30% and 40%. 		There's also a profitability threshold for an attorney considering the case. If the cop takes your $1500 (for no reason, or hell, maybe he's got a bag of weed... Does that really justify civil forfeiture?), my worst-case cut is $500.  That's pretty bad use of time as a lawyer considering I have to write up an answer (in my State it must be verified, so let's get our schedules lined up so I can meet you with a notary), negotiate with the State (another awkward by-product is going to the DA to negotiate with them on something they just flat-out took from somebody ???_??? ), and eventually have a full-scale hearing (but in front of a judge, not a jury... A judge who has to see those law enforcement agents every day, and knows they're "trustworthy") where WE have the burden of proving more likely than not (a "preponderance of the evidence" in lawyer-speak) that the money was not used to facilitate a drug transaction (there are a fair number of defenses in my state's civil forfeiture laws... Guess they feel some shame about the outright taking of your stuff). 		The process is so complicated you can't realistically do it without a lawyer. Example: in my state the most common way to file a civil forfeiture is as a suit against the property in question. In lawyer-speak this is called an "in rem" action, and what *that* means it's not the "State vs. iRonin," it's the "State vs. one thousand dollars in United States currency."  iRonin has to butt-in to the action to avoid a default judgment (literally since the U.S. Currency didn't have anything to say, and no one else claimed it,now the government gets it all).

The constitutionality of forfeiture statutes has been upheld time and time again, and in almost any circumstance where there was some evidence (however weak) supporting the forfeiture the discretion of the trial judge will stand. 		2.) There are actually good constitutional defenses (the 8th's "cruel and unusual" is helpful in equalizing the seizure to comport with the gravity of the crime, aka more dope you've got more assets they can seize) and forfeitures *do* make the judges feel squeamish; I can't speak for the prosecutors but judges and defense lawyers it just doesn't sit right. 		3.) But still though, they have to work with those people all the time. Making a finding, an actual part of the record that can be admitted in evidence, that an officer's version of events is untrustworthy the officer's career is over. Every open case of his has to be re-investigated and old cases (closed cases) come under scrutiny. That's my best guess on why some of the rulings are the way they are.

They would visit barber shops, chat you up at a grocery store, etc. They would be friendly about it, allowing you to trust them to have the community's best interests at heart.	We shouldn't be afraid of the police. Our only interactions with them shouldn't be getting pulled over/arrested and D.A.R.E class in grade school.

We want them to gain our trust by being active members in the community.

If that's all the logic that's required to take people's money, then the U.S. is truly fucked, because no matter what law is written, the courts will make some contrary shit up and people will just believe it.		The due process clause is CLEAR.  Therefore, either the courts have some other logic that we're missing, or the courts are corrupt, and need to be exposed as corrupt.		Some examples of what may actually be going on:		1. When cops threaten people with jail unless they sign a paper and give up their money, the paper may simply say that you wave ownership.  Thus, this is a bypass of the due process clause as its no longer your property.		2. FRN's are actually bank or tresury property, cars and houses are actually state property (registered in your name).  Other property would fall under the due process clause.  (I have no clue if this is the case... but it's just an example of hidden logic to make it "legal".)		3. There's some proceedings that ask "does anyone claim this property?" that is not well known so people are not present to claim ownership.  This severs the ownership and allows for civil forfeiture.		Again, these are just brain storms as to how they get around the due process clause.  I have no clue as to how they make it "legal" or if they're simply corrupt, but the logic has to be there.

Not to take away from the ridiculous civil forfeiture laws and actions of police who take advantage of them, but training a dog for anything like police/military duty takes _years_. 		A dog can be trained for a year only to be disqualified due to some character flaws - that's lost $$. I believe most dogs only enter service when they're around four or five years old, having been trained from puppyhood. That's a lot of time, effort, equipment and expertise. 		There are many companies that sell fully-trained German Shepherd Dogs. There are also many levels of obedience training that can be instilled into the dog, and it's not uncommon to see a $50-70k sticker for a fully trained dog protection dog.

{"body":"The current problem with dogs is that they are used to make 'probable cause'.  Probable cause is when the police have legal grounds to search you or your stuff.  A cop, legally, needs to have probable cause to search you.  He needs to have a reason he suspects you of doing something illegal.  Saying "I smell pot" or "the dog smells pot" is, currently, accepted as probable cause.  This is bad because they could just be making that up.  		If we made it so that dogs don't count as probable cause, then dogs wouldn't be a problem.  This is because the cop will need an actual reason to search vou and can't use the dog until he has that reason.  Once he has that reason, he doesn't need the dog to fake it, so the only value the dog will have for him is actually finding the drugs.  If there aren't any drugs making the dog fake a signal won't accomplish anything.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CheeseNBacon2","name":"t1_crsvfp0","parent_id":"t1_crsl13b","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433249066,"created_utc":1433245466}

Transfer money to guy buying via phone app.  Done.		Major downside here is you're paying exchange fees (which can still be 1%+ for each party involved) but you still get all the advantages of cash without the risk (e.g. civil forfeiture).  Other downside is the price can easily fluctuate in 2% up or down in a day so you could easily be out another 2% unless you and the buyer agree on the price in BTC beforehand.  Rare downside is MAJOR market crash or rise can occur in just hours and you could be out quite a bit!

Most people don't use Heroin because they access to the synthetic stuff (Percocet, Oxycontin, Vicodin).

No one would inject themself if they had the opportunity to take an oral drug. How is heroin bad for you?

{"body":"You are the typical prohibition supporter. You argue without facts. Look at how I actually tried to back my argument with facts and links. 		> If you think the drug war is responsible for destroying civil liberty in America you're a fool		The drug war has eviscerated the 4th amendment. Police steal money from people on the side of the road with laws called asset forfeiture under the belief that any and all cash found is drug money. Look at how police in urban areas stop people and search them for drugs just so they can make petty arrests. 		So what if the cartels do more than sell drugs? What does that have to do with the drug war? The cartels are the direct result of America's prohibition the same way alcohol prohibition created bootleggers.		Regardless, if you are dumb enough to support cigarettes being illegal than you aren't smart enough to understand drug prohibition. You do realize 16% of the population smokes cigarettes? What would you achieve by making them illegal? Do you honestly believe that you can make the use of something go down by making it illegal? If so, why has heroin use gone up even though it was illegal?		>Heroin does not benefit you at all, therefore there is no reason to legalize it.		So what? What does benefiting someone have to do with making it illegal or legal? I would argue video games don't benefit people who are addicted to video; does that mean we should ban them. Alcohol doesn't benefit anyone as well, does that mean we should make it illegal? If you want the heroin use to go down, make it easier for people to get opiate drugs and make it easier to get methadone. Heroin use would drop like a stone. Do you want crystal meth pr cocaine use to go down? Make it easier for people to get oral amphetamines like Adderall, Vynase, etc.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Eokpar1989","name":"t1_crudhj8","parent_id":"t1_crubnsj","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433357138,"created_utc":1433353538}

In fact, the owner of the property doesn???t even need to be guilty of a crime: Civil asset forfeiture proceedings charge the property itself with involvement in a crime. This means that police can seize your car, home, money, or valuables without ever having to charge you with a crime.
