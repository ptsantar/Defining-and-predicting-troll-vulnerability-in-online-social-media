{"body":"Flouride in tap water doesn't make a difference for your teeth if you use toothpaste with flourine.		As /u/SonOfTheNorthe commented, distilled and deionized water is dangerous to you because your body needs ions to function. Pure water has low electrical resistivity, but just adding a small amount of salt gives the solute high conductivity. (Salts become ions in solutes, the most common being NaCl, the salt you put in food. A chemical that increases conductivity is called an electrolyte. Salts are electrolytes.)		Your cells (all of them) function because of an electrical potential over the cell membrane, meaning that the inside of the cell has a certain charge and the space between the cells have another. (About a -40 mV difference if i remember correctly.) Charge is due to the concentration of ions in the solute.		The cell is powered by flushing ions across its membrane, meaning that the cell maintains a certain electrical potential. But if the potential (ion concentration) is really out of wack, either because you've ingested way too much or way too little salt, this process becomes too costly energy-wise: the cells shut down and you die.		Sickness from low ion concentration is called water poisoning, and is an acute and dangerous condition. It doesn't take distilled water to achieve. Some people get water poisoning because they hold their pee too long. It takes about 1.8 litres of normal drinking water and no peeing to die from water. Others die from dancing or excersise. This is usually associated with rave parties.		A funny and tragic thing is that one of the symptoms of water poisoning is thirst.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mirshafie","name":"t1_cqbtp2k","parent_id":"t1_cqbs2zb","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429009117,"created_utc":1429005517}

{"body":"Thanks for the detailed information, makes a lot of sense. Id heard of water poisoning and the ionic potential across cell membranes before, but never put the two together. 		I've got a question about this stuff that you might be able to help with if you can be bothered. In alternating current systems the current flow reverses rapidly. At low frequencies (like 50/60 Hz mains power) your muscles will contract/spasm at a similar current to the DC grip current. As frequency increases the grip current also slowly increases, however at some point around ~20 kHz your nerves simply stop responding. The explanation I've heard is that above a certain frequency the current flow reverses before the potential across the cell membrane "collapses." A year ago I accidentally conducted a serious amount of power across my chest from a 50 kHz supply. There was an oscilloscope in the circuit measuring output current and I saw it peak around 35 mA, yet I didn't feel anything at all. Likewise, I've played around with a solid state Tesla coil operating at 460 kHz and managed to light up an incandescent lightbulb by wiring one end to earth and holding the other wire while standing near the coil. Again, my oscilloscope was measuring the current on the earth wire via a shunt resistor and I was reading a peak of almost 80 mA, which is above the threshold for heart fibrillation if we were talking about 50 Hz mains. Like the other example, I never felt anything. I've been told horror stories about older ham radio and electronics guys who have very shaky hands from years of playing with high power radio sets and vacuum tube Tesla coils. At what point does the risk of nerve damage become a problem when dealing with RF currents? Its easy to get minor RF burns on your fingers if you touch something metallic within a couple of metres of the coil, so a there's definitely a worrying amount of power in the air.		EDIT: People often say that the reason you can't feel high frequency currents is the "skin effect," but that really only applies to solid homogeneous conductors like a copper busbar, and a human body certainly isn't homogeneous. Your arteries, nerves and muscle tissue carry 90% of any electrical currents. When lightning tracks across your skin and leaves a Lichtenburg scar its called "surface tracking" or "flashover" as opposed to "skin effect" and is a common problem in high voltage circuits of all frequencies.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PermanantFive","name":"t1_cqcxe0i","parent_id":"t1_cqbtp2k","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429086668,"created_utc":1429083068}

Anyway, another part of the SDWA is that municipalities are required to make the water safe, but the EPA leaves it up to individual municipalities if they want to go the extra mile to make it taste better, though they have guidelines in place. 		There are two categories of drinking water standards:		> A National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR or primary standard) is a legally- enforceable standard that applies to public water systems. Primary standards protect drinking water quality by limiting the levels of specific contaminants that can adversely affect public health and are known or anticipated to occur in water. They take the form of Maximum Contaminant Levels or Treatment Techniques, which are described below.		> A National Secondary Drinking Water Regulation (NSDWR or secondary standard) is a non-enforceable guideline regarding contaminants that may cause cosmetic effects (such as skin or tooth discoloration) or aesthetic effects (such as taste, odor, or color) in drinking water. EPA recommends secondary standards to water systems but does not require systems to comply. However, states may choose to adopt them as enforceable standards.

Companies don't just use water because it is fun, they use it because it a necessary part of their industrial process.  There is a company I do business with that was using 400,000 gallons a month to process metals.  They have since been able to reduce it to 180,000 gallon via process refining.  That is still a lot of water going into 1 building.   Do you think they like paying the utility out tens of thousands of dollars a month?  If they could cut water usage to zero they would. Cooling alone is a big part of industrial processes and sucks up a ton of water in the towers.    	    	Anyways, you may say "fine, let them leave, let them move to where there is water".   You're kind of defeating the purpose of saving the water to begin with then.  Literally the only reason people live in many places in the US is because they have a job there.   If you take their job away and they can't find another one, they will try to leave ASAP to greener pastures or they will be stuck there and become homeless.   	      	The point I'm getting at is that it is never a black and white issue.  It isn't companies bad, people good.   It is a symbiosis between people and companies.  Not every one can work for the government as a teacher or a cop.  You have to have people working for entities that produce actual work and growth that can support a service industry that begats more jobs that begats more infrastructure investment.

Water, and water facilities and services, must be affordable for all. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggests that **water costs should not exceed 3 per cent of household income.**		Sufficient. The water supply for each person must be sufficient and continuous for personal and domestic uses. These uses ordinarily include drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation, personal and household hygiene. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day are needed to ensure that most basic needs are met and few health concerns arise.		Safe. The water required for each personal or domestic use must be safe, therefore free from micro-organisms, chemical substances and radiological hazards that constitute a threat to a person's health. Measures of drinking-water safety are usually defined by national and/or local standards for drinking-water quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for drinking-water quality provide a basis for the development of national standards that, if properly implemented, will ensure the safety of drinking-water.		Acceptable. Water should be of an acceptable colour, odour and taste for each personal or domestic use. [...] All water facilities and services must be culturally appropriate and sensitive to gender, lifecycle and privacy requirements.		Physically accessible. Everyone has the right to a water and sanitation service that is physically accessible within, or in the immediate vicinity of the household, educational institution, workplace or health institution. According to WHO, the water source has to be within 1,000 metres of the home and collection time should not exceed 30 minutes.

{"body":"> Its insane that you think its normal to attribute a price to somthing that literally meltst from glaciers or bubbles out the ground.		I never said I think that. I was explaining what the former CEO of Nestle said that everyone keeps mis-stating. 		What I think if you really want to know is that water is a limited resource, and it can't just be made freely available to all. There has to be some way to ration it to prevent overconsumption, especially in environments that don't have enough to meet all demand. One way to do that is via price controls that make it financially unsustainable to consume large amounts of water. Another way to do it is to enforce consumption via government agencies. And I'm sure there are other methods I'm not really up on.		Suffice it to say, using price to control access to a limited resource is not exactly a novel concept and is certainly not 'insane'. You may think other methods of controlling access are better, and that's fine with me. But using free markets to control access isn't exactly an unheard of concept, in fact we use it successfully for other resources that are limited. 		I'd also note that what he's talking about is not straight up free market, as he advocates ensuring all have access to a necessary amount of water regardless of ability to pay. One example of doing this would be to make say 5,000 gallons of water available free or cheap to all households and but significantly increase the price for amounts above that, as well as for industrial or agricultural usage. 		But again, I'm not saying that's the best or only option.

In fact, it compounds it. Companies shouldn't be allowed to abuse a public resource, especially if that abuse is interfering with quality of life. If anything, we need to adopt greater regulation over private access to water, and agriculture needs to jump into the 21st century and adopt updated watering practices.		From a people perspective, people should also stop planting non-native, water slurping plants in their yards--which would have a few percentage points of water consumption.		Waters value in this equation is in its usage by people to do other useful things--like live. A private company attempting to manipulate the situation by arbitrarily placing a monetary value on it, that is advantageous to them, represents little more than greed. Especially when they are being given access to this resource for little to nothing.		It is a power grab to gain influence and control over a necessary and strained public resource.		Privatization does, has, and will always represent the death of democracy and the rise of broken capitalism. It is bad for society, it bolsters inequity, and it strips people of their rights.		The very concept of privatization for profits over a public resource is glaringly disgusting--particularly when the privatization we are talking about is water.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Red_Stormbringer","name":"t1_cqblkan","parent_id":"t1_cqbkdg3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428984404,"created_utc":1428980804}

{"body":"The stuff I read under this thread is crazy. Do you realize that:		100 million gallons = 307 acre feet. Agricultural water rights for live flow west of the Cascades are typically limited to 2.5 acre feet/acre. This would be an efficient 123 acre farm.		100 million gallons/year = .43 cubic feet per second. This is equivalent to what an efficient 34 acre farm gets during the irrigation season. Farms in Eastern Oregon generally get more due to differences in soil water retention and evapotranspiration rates (this is regulated at the basin level). 		This is just a direct transfer of two water rights. The reality is that ODFW needs a more reliable source of water during the dry season, when the discharge from the springs are too low for the salmon hatchery they operate at the location. The water comes from THE EXACT SAME SOURCE. These wells are drawing from a shallow aquifer that's tapping surface water from Hermann Creek. [This](http://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/wr/wateruse_query/wr_wur_wris_report.aspx?snp_id=93699) is how much water they already draw from those exact wells. They're just giving up the right to withdraw 0.5 cfs of it so that Nestle can take it directly from the spring and call it spring water. The water right they're giving up is certificated. You can't just take it away. There are also no grounds to oppose the transfer unless you can demonstrate that the transfer constitutes enlargement of a water right or harms a downstream water user. It literally couldn't. This is the most innocuous of government actions.		Water scarcity simply does not provide a basis on which to oppose this deal. This will have no impact on the availability of tap water to anyone in Oregon. The waste created by plastic bottles are the only environmental concern here. I therefore suggest you do the following, in accordance with your political ideologies and personal preferences:		- Advocate for a tax on bottled water to prevent people from buying bottled water.	- "Raise awareness" to try to prevent people from buying bottled water.	- Maliciously attack anyone you see purchasing bottled water in order to prevent people from buying bottled water (not recommended--may result in arrest).","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Euain_son_of_","name":"t1_cqbtcs1","parent_id":"t1_cqbgdi0","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429007463,"created_utc":1429003863}

Most water in aquifers have probably not seen light in thousands of years. Aquifers are often so slow, that it takes groundwater up to a hundren years just to travel one kilometer underground.		Aquifers in arid regions are especially susceptible for a couple reasons. One, they don't recharge well because the water table is not close to surface, and two, because when aquifers are tapped and depressurized, they compress, and their maximum capacity is decreased.

And oh yea, while these shills are trying to convince you that toxic shit is somehow safer than it's purified and enriched cousin... There are no regulations concerning pharmaceuticals, MTBE, perchlorate, radon (which have all been proven to be in your US tap water) and a whole list of other contaminants. No regulations.
