{"body":"You're talking socialism which has been a counter to American politics since at least the beginning of the Cold War. There was a discussion the other day on Reddit about the distribution of funding for schools. The common issue people brought up is that individuals hated the idea of their money helping others. This perpetuates a problem of richer areas getting better schools. The political Right has done a great job painting a picture of the needy being lazy freeloaders. These people see what their hard work has brought them and despise the idea that their quality of life could just be handed to someone. I wouldn't call it "wrong or missing" education rather a unrealistic and selfish view of the American Dream. 		Edit: I should clarify the line "people hated the idea of their money helping others". First, this isn't an American wide issue, there were specific areas mentioned and a lot of hypothetical thinking involved. Second, its more of a crab bucket mentality like someone correctly pointed out. Sure, if we all work together and knock over the bucket,  everyone will be better off but the idea of helping others before yourself isnt always easy.

Your friends and family are far more likely to change their opinion and even volunteer if they see that it is a cause that is important to you.  		Its expected that a volunteer returning for the third time is likely to bring a friend.  You know your friend and are therefore able to train them easier than a regular staffer would be able to.

{"body":"Look. My initial comment was a reaction to sending a voter to a site that "matches you with a political candidate". I'm certainly not saying that those websites are crap, but ultimately they're making the same exact judgment call that I'm asking the voter to make - figuring out what the candidate truly stands for and will do in office. Except you're putting that judgment in the hands of someone you don't know instead of at least gathering some actual information yourself.		Aside from that, the impression I'm getting from you is that it's impossible to reasonably figure out what a politician might be like in office and so there's no point in trying. Just look at what they promise, what their platform is, and vote based off of that. If that's what you're saying, I flatly disagree because a better decision would be to look at their voting record. And that does NOT mean have someone else tell you their voting record because I've heard those slanted SO many times. "He voted to cut off all funding to our troops currently stationed in Iraq". No, he voted to pull out of the war in Iraq. I made up that example and it's kinda crappy but it's exactly what happens over and over again.		Politics are a tangled mess of deception and biases and money interests and it sucks.

You made a claim, you provided zero evidence for said claim. Your point was groundless and baseless, get it? This isn't either EITC or not, but EITC in place of higher minimum wage. EITC is just an indirect method of paying employees who get low wages more, by corporate welfare. Or you could implement minimum wage and they'd get paid more.

Must have caused? When did I say that? There was two claims, by the way. First, not having free trade is not disastrous, or in other words, not crazy for certain situations. Second, free trade can have negative consequences or play a role in them. And yes, again, most economists actually admit free trade agreements have played **A ROLE** (see, not sole cause) in wage stagnation.

{"body":"I appreciate what you're saying, but I think we have to avoid key phrases like "mainstream media". That's a linguistic tool to evoke emotion. Like "terrorists", "flip-flopper", and "liberal", which was a perfectly good term before being soured with repeated negative context in, what... the 80's? And if you get your keyword trending and into the media, even if it's just in the background, people relate to you when you say it. Then it compounds its emotional attachment on some mental database where recalling language happens. Kinda like SEO, where words trend and swarm into the gravity wells of "competitive keywords".		The brass ring is controlling what words become key phrases. If you do that, you set the connotations for the keywords that everyone will have to use during the end game, stacking them in your favor. Advantage you.		So maybe we should come up with new keywords/phrases on the issues that need it. Make them good and fit within 30 characters. We're already using the greatest series of tubes ever built for that kind of thing, so we should be able to come up with something, right?		tl;dr: Try replacing the phrase "mainstream media" with "traditional media" instead.

{"body":"Sorry it took me so long to reply.  I was at work and I didn't think I could give a decent reply via mobile so I waited until I came home.  		The reason why most of us are against magazine capacity limits is that the number(let's say 10) is purely arbitrary and does not really serve any purpose beyond hindering people who already follow laws.  Magazines of standard capacity(15-19 for standard double stack 9mm, 30 for AR15, etc.) are already plentiful and will not just go away if banned.  The problem with this is all of us who intend to follow the law will now have to buy reduced capacity magazines to be in compliance, and the criminal element that the law is aimed at will not care about the law and will continue using what they already have.		I've been trying all day to come up with a good analogy for this and this is the best I can do:  Imagine a scenario where gang members, cartels, etc. use machetes to kill each other and to perform bloody executions.  In an effort to curb this machete violence, the government enacts a law that any blade over an arbitrary length of 6 inches is now illegal.  The feeling is that making machetes illegal will prevent the gangs from using them, but they're already trafficking drugs, running prostitution rings, and killing people so the laws really mean nothing to them to begin with and they'll continue using them anyways.  The people who are actually affected are the people you didn't have to worry about in the first place: butchers, chefs, fisherman, etc.  Can a chef slice a loaf of bread with a 6 inch knife?  Sure he can, but not as easy as he could with his 8-10 inch bread knife.  So in the process of trying to make people safer, the government has restricted things that are common use to combat a problem that laws can't fix anyways.  		I know people like to point to mass shootings as reasoning for reduced magazine sizes but I like people to look at it a different way.  The mass shooter is more than likely possessing a gun inside a gun free zone(don't get me started on this), he is already planning to murder defenseless people; how much do you think he actually cares about making sure his magazines hold 10 rounds or less?","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Skeeter_BC","name":"t1_cqvicp7","parent_id":"t1_cqv4xrr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430524227,"created_utc":1430520627}

One of the things they do is sponsor commercials that say candidate X is good, or candidate Y is bad so you should vote for candidate X, but candidate X was never contacted by the group that made the commercial. 		> Is it basically bribery like the rest of American politics?		I take issue with this statement, but first I will say it is not bribery for the reasons I listed above. It is in fact illegal for any candidate to be affiliated with a Super PAC, so Bernie Sanders is just pandering to people who don't know how Super PACs work. Now, as for the rest of American politics, there is actually very little bribery in our political system. People just tend to take the above example, see that someone is paying money to support a candidate, and call that bribery.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"guitar_vigilante","name":"t1_cqv7kwh","parent_id":"t1_cquo6hj","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430505398,"created_utc":1430501798}

With the Internet and social media you have access to demographic information right down to the individual level.

And the great thing is that if anyone tries to call you out on what you're doing, nobody will care as it will remain within the online filter bubbles, and only results in the message being spread further.

{"body":"First of all, the study you link to is an examination of ***only North Carolina*** and is not, therefore, ***generalizable***. Here's research from the Brennan Center...it's the best study of the effects of gerrymandering (nationally) to date:		https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/redistricting-and-congressional-control-following-2012-election		Secondly, gerrymandering--as can plainly be seen by the above study--isn't much of a problem, has been around since before the term was coined in 1812, and is part of the US democratic, electoral process. The disparity in representation is a direct result of the Constitutional allocation of Representatives which exists because of federalism.		Edit: Funny thing about the study you post: it doesn't produce any majority-minority districts. Because of the Voting Rights Act, many states *must* produce these districts, and breaking them up is often invalidated by the courts...there's always that.		It's also funny how the truth gets down-voted, here.","depth":4,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"theunderhillaccount","name":"t1_cqurf8l","parent_id":"t1_cquq462","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430462830,"created_utc":1430459230}
{"body":"The article you mentioned talks about redistricting and the effect that redistricting has had versus previous district boundaries, but never specifically mentions gerrymandering.		> Republican legislators and governors drew district lines for 173 of the 435 seats in Congress.[9] Where Republican legislators controlled redistricting, Republicans likely won 11 more seats than they would have under the old district lines. Five of these 11 were seats that flipped party control due to redistricting; six were Republican seats saved by redistricting. **In states where Republicans controlled redistricting, Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats. But even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats.**		> Democratic legislators and governors redistricted 44 seats, just one-quarter the number of seats as Republicans.[10] But they still used redistricting to their advantage. Where they controlled redistricting, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, and Republicans lost five more seats. **In the six states where Democrats controlled redistricting, Democratic candidates for the House won about 56 percent of the vote and 71 percent of the seats. However, that disparity would have persisted even before redistricting, as Democrats would have likely won 61 percent of the seats under the old district lines.**		So what they're saying here may be a little unclear to the reader. It doesn't imply that the previous district boundaries were reasonable.		What it does say flat out is that in Republican-controlled states Republican candidates won 53% of the vote and 72% of the seats, versus the 65% of seats they would have won under the old already-Gerrymandered district lines.		It also says flat out that in the Democratic-controlled states, Democratic candidates got 56% of the vote but won 71% of the seats. That is an increase from 61% under the previous already-gerrymandered district lines.		In fact, the article you linked to doesn't contain a single instance of the word "gerrymander" or "gerrymandered".		The statistics you posted indicate some very substantial increases of the difference between the percentage of seats that would have been won based on voting percentage versus the percentage that were won based on the new district guidelines. This seems to me like a very good indication that gerrymandering is being used effectively to make the results not match the votes. And again, yes, the study I originally linked to was for North Carolina specifically, but it did indicate that there were almost no way that certain particular things could have happened without gerrymandering, like saying	> Nonetheless it is interesting to note the racial makeup of the districts created by	our model and compare them to the current figures. Figure 7 gives the results for	the African American and Hispanic populations. Our samples never produced a majority	African American district. 		So when creating a system to draw district guidelines based on possible priorities that could be used and that were not specifically intending to isolate African-American voters into just two districts, their models  **never** produced a majority African-American district.		Saying that nationally "The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under the old district lines," is **not** the same as saying "The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under reasonable district lines."		And this isn't to say that Democrats didn't gerrymander. The fact that Republicans gerrymander does not mean that Democrats didn't gerrymander where they had power. The "only six seats" thing is a red herring in so many different ways. It's also not like "Well all seats are districted reasonably, except these six gerrymandered seats." The "six seats" thing is such a useless bit of information for this discussion.		And really, "It's been done since 1812 and it should be done that way because it's always been that way," is **not** an argument.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"theedgeofoblivious","name":"t1_cqus7ql","parent_id":"t1_cqurf8l","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430465427,"created_utc":1430461827}
