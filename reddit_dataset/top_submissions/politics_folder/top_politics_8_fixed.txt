{"body":"There's a difference here.  Apple and Beats (one company now) back up hefty branding with quality hardware and, in Apple's case, a tight focus on user interface.  In short, their branding is what they do _after_ they create substance.		I can't speak for millennials, just for me.  However, if I'm going to describe how I pick stuff, it's simple: I weigh it against the other options.  Whether or not there's branding around it makes no difference if there's substance there: the branding is just entertainment I may or may not watch in the hopes there's more information there.  		Generally, I see branding and marketing as attempts to get others to make a choice.  Sometimes, if that choice matches my own choices, I'll share the branding: the choices I've made, I've made because I think they're the best options; why wouldn't I want to promote those options to others with similar needs?		I say all this as a Linux / Roll-your-own guy.  		Of course, this is assuming that by "millennial", you mean, "people born in or after the early 1980s", which may or may not be the definition you use, since the term doesn't have a fixed starting point (the border is alternately, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1986, etc).		Anyway, I'm a cusper; I was born at the end of Gen X, and am millennial by about half of the definitions of "millennial".		I'm told by my marketing-related-career wife that I decide like a millennial in the sense that, "millennial-targeted strategies" are targetted towards the sorts of things I look for when looking to make a purchase.  Meanwhile, I don't have an aversion to the label.		I also never really identified with the X'ers - they were snotty teens when I was a kid, and the weirdly sarcastic-yet-unskeptical assholes with delusions of grandeur from middle management positions when I was a teen.		So honestly, I may be a special snowflake after all.  I guess that makes me a millennial by the ageist definition of the term.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fordiman","name":"t1_crva3wt","parent_id":"t1_crv1xyc","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433428986,"created_utc":1433425386}

Off duty, sick, the patient just murdered his daughter.  Pick any scenario, but you are attempting to control the narrative with that statement.  It appeals to feelings but lacks substance.

{"body":">The efficiencies or inefficiencies of the government agencies does not tell us whether government is necessary to protect people unless you assume it a priori.		Yes, that was an outside assumption. Traditional conservatives accept some limited government despite inefficiencies, such as Nixon and the EPA. It is only under the assumption that the government is inherently negative, not just inefficient economically, that government must be made as small as possible. That libertarian assumption discounts the possibility that government can be positive. My argument is that democratic control can sustain a positive government.

The idea of regulatory capture is accepted, but that it can be mitigated by participation of the non-elite. This follows the argument that we have government favoritism, corruption, useless subsidies, and whatever else because of the decline of politically oriented trade unions--i.e. the strongest organization of non-elites. With an empowered working class the government can be influenced enough to control elite power, which is arguable the opposite of regulatory capture. Overall this has to do with organization and collusion. The elite are united; the non-elite are not. Whoever is more powerful has more sway over the government.		I'm aware the libertarian view says get rid of government so it can't be used against the other class, but this ignores the utility of government to reduce the elite, who are inherently more powerful.

I believe if it was considered inherently negative it would be seen as something that should be eliminated. Being made as small as possible would be due to thinking there are a limited number of things it is good at and limiting it to just that.		> My argument is that democratic control can sustain a positive government.		Can it though? If 55% get their way, and the other 45% are diametrically opposed, a nontrivial portion will see it as a negative. Further slavery was found to be okay at one point democratically, so surely limiting what should be up to democracy is part of the discussion.		>The idea of regulatory capture is accepted, but that it can be mitigated by participation of the non-elite.		I disagree. The greater the regulatory power, the greater the incentive to capture that power for one's own ends. Even back in the day when higher voter turnout it was the railroads that wanted regulation to keep their fees high, and sold the idea to the masses by saying the "other guy" wants to come in and shake things up. Big business loves regulation when it's about keeping competitors out.		>This follows the argument that we have government favoritism, corruption, useless subsidies, and whatever else because of the decline of politically oriented trade unions--i.e. the strongest organization of non-elites.		Again I disagree as to why. The FLSA was passed when unionization was around 15%, not much higher than it was today. This speaks to overstating the role of unions in the political process-not that I'm opposed to union formation.		>With an empowered working class the government can be influenced enough to control elite power, which is arguable the opposite of regulatory capture.		Unions are still firms whose actions are  representing their member's interests, even to the detriment of non-members. They are essentially cronies of another name, just cronies with more members; interestingly they're allowed to do this because their lobbying has allowed them to be immune to anti-trust laws. Unions in the US are not as noble and devoid of corruption as their portrayals of themselves would have us believe.		>I'm aware the libertarian view says get rid of government so it can't be used against the other class, but this ignores the utility of government to reduce the elite, who are inherently more powerful. 		Except there's an important distinction: Outside of violence or fraud, their power can only be derived from providing goods and services people demand.

The owner/operator wakes up in the morning, decides what he's going to work on, does so, and owns everything he produces.		Capitalism -- a capitalist owns the means of production and trades a laborer for wages.		In modern capitalist states, a worker is typically indebted in some way (like owing rent for housing or a mortgage, or some other form of debt).		He is *forced* to find a way to trade his labor for money. Assuming he finds someone willing to make this trade with him (an employer), he then shows up to work *when* the employer tells him to, *doing what* the employer tells him to, and typically *using the means* the employer provides to do this work (although in some instances the employee provides his own tools). The employer owns everything produced by the employee.		It's really baffling that somehow think that modern capitalism is the epitome of a "free society".

You say you moved to Europe, than describe a system of government which appears to be inherent to all of Europe (its not).  /gloube was trying to be clever but also had a very pertinent point which is, there is no 1 European government, they are in fact different, we cherry pick pieces for specific issues and claim "Europe" while ignoring the faults of those systems.

These political ads prove that, they're all flash and no substance.  Political campaigning in most areas means placing billboards and signs up with nothing more than the candidate's name and party affiliation, not "I stand for X with regard to <important issue Y>."  The message is "Vote for me because you've seen my name more often than the other guy!" or "Vote for me because I have an <R|D> next to my name."		In reality what we as a society need to do is start encouraging people to actually put a couple of hours worth of research into the candidates.  Spend 15 minutes to go look up their voting history with regard to what is important to you.  Take a look at their campaign fund sources and see who is really calling the shots.  Take a look at their public records and see if they've been charged with crimes that could indicate what kind of a leader they will make.

This isn't a popularity contest like it was back in high school when you picked your class officers, but unfortunately that is all the majority of voters really understand.

After all, the tobacco companies do not force people to use their products, people willfully buy them. The *only* reason tobacco companies are profitable is because people voluntarily spend their money to purchase their products. People value their products more than they value their money.

They are nothing of the sort. Markets cannot be shortsighted, unconscious, or driven. Only humans can have those characteristics. Markets are simply a feedback mechanism that show what people want, and at what price they want it. 		>I believe a healthy mix of public and private ownership will maximize freedom for the individual which I think is most people's goal when discussing the government, markets, and society.		I do not think the government should be offering or selling products, as they do not have to play by the rules of the marketplace, namely, they can and will ignore those feedback mechanism that show what people want and how they want it. Though as a relatively moderate libertarian, I do think the government should protect people, and I believe in sensible regulations when it is shown that people are getting hurt that aren't voluntarily taking action in those contracts. If people choose to hurt themselves or engage in harmful contracts, then go ahead, but if non-participating, third parties are being hurt, the government has a role to step in and regulate.

Libertarian ideals often rest on the assumption that everyone is or can be 100% informed and therefore make informed decisions about their purchases. This is and can almost never be the case.

More freedom here is good.		Anyone is free to marry anyone.  What you're talking about is the legal right to sign a marriage contract which provides tax breaks and benefits to whoever signs that contract.  I agree we should open up who is allowed to sign the contract, because I think more benefits to more people would, well, be beneficial, but already couples are free to enter a lifelong committed relationship.  Not even straight couples have a "right" to the legal contract or its benefits.

Let me first say I'm a social Darwinist, just to preface this, but I think overall it's good if members of society who can't be productive and provide for themselves are... not "removed" from society, but allowed to phase out.  Live and let die.  Right now its mostly poor and uneducated having children because they can, it's subsidized.  While upper middle class families are not because they know how expensive it is.

You pay membership dues, which are then spent by the club. This is what "indirect" means.

It also benefits you, hence the positive externality. If you have a business and the guy who lost his job next door is able to benefit from some collective assistance temporarily, that person has money to spend in your store to 1. survive and 2. increase your sales. You benefit from not having your neighbor poor and homeless on the street. Humans evolved to form societies and collectives because pooling resources and skills ensures survival.		> I'm still forced to pay into charity when I don't have enough for myself.

For example, you don't have the freedom to arbitrarily murder whomever you want.

Wage labor is forced by far more extreme and violent means. 		The state, by the way, has been the primary driver of the economy in every functional (state) capitalist society. Just go through the list of major industries existing today, like computers, telecom and the internet, aerospace, energy, etc: they were all founded on mountains of direct and indirect subsidies, state R&D, procurement, protectionism and trade barriers.

Capitalism requires the subordination of the productive classes to the class interests of proprietors.

I don't believe you're trolling and are genuinely interested in my opinion. I'll invest the time...		Aside from the fact that B.S. (an appropriate abbreviation IMHO) wants to over-tax the wealthy because he subscribes to the false *"rich aren't paying a fair share"* doctrine. (It's false because the top 10 Percent of income earners **pay 68% of the U.S.'s entire federal income tax**), the reason I don't like him as a candidate is simply because his tax plan not only will not work but it will destroy this country.		Though his goals are genuinely positive seeing as though he has stated that he would like to fund social programs and infrastructure investments, the tax plan would be a disaster for the economy and would lead to even greater economic stagnation than what we currently have.		A 90 percent marginal tax rate would allow the wealthiest investors to keep only 10 cents of every dollar they earned on those marginal investments. After taking into account additional income taxes from states like New Jersey, where the highest marginal rate is about 9 percent, investors could pay up to 99 cents in taxes on every dollar they earned, depending on how federal taxes are deducted from state tax calculations.		Suppose high income investors earned an additional $1,000. If the tax rate were 40 percent, they would pay $400 in taxes and have $600 to re-invest back into the economy. This new $600 investment would have a multiplying effect on total income earned in the economy because workers would be hired and equipment would be purchased. Assume a multiplier of 4; the total new income generated would be $2,400.		Additional tax revenue would be 40 percent of the $2,400, or $960. With the initial $400 tax, government???s total revenue would be $1,360.		If the marginal tax rate were 90 percent as B.S. would demand, the investor who earned an additional $1,000 would pay $900 in taxes and have only $100 to invest back into the economy. With a multiplier of 4, this would generate $400 in new income. Taxing this at 90 percent raises $360 in tax revenue, for a total of $1,260, less than the $1,360 in revenue generated by the lower tax rate.		Worse is the reduction in economic growth. Under the 40 percent tax rate, there would be total economic activity of $3,400; under the 90 percent rate, that falls to $1,400. Under the 90 percent rate, government revenues fall because the pie they come from is so much smaller. This means fewer jobs, lower personal income tax collections, more spending on social welfare programs for the unemployed, reductions in corporate profits that pay into retirement funds, and so on.		Sanders argues that the maximum tax rate in the 1950s was 90 percent and the economy grew faster than when tax rates were lower.		He's actually correct in saying this, but ???		In the 1930s, the economy imploded in the Great Depression. In the 40s, the economy boomed with the production of tanks, ships, planes and bombs???but not houses, cars, refrigerators and shoes. Consumer goods like tires, sugar and chocolate were in short supply.		By the 50s, a larger population flush with cash that it earned building war goods and that it couldn???t spend on consumer goods was ready to forget its privations of the last 15 years and buy. Houses, cars, refrigerators and clothes???it bought. It went on a consumption binge that lasted a generation.		In the 1950s, there were no robots and no computers. Most production was labor intensive. Automobiles, for instance, were built on assembly lines with workers putting the cars together. A capital shortage would have little impact on growth. Today, things are different.		The technology revolution means that most production, except in countries where labor is cheap, is done with large investments in capital goods. A modern automobile manufacturing plant is itself an enormously complex machine; it has few workers and an assembly line of robots. The result is better cars free from human production errors. The cars are produced at much lower cost than a labor intensive car plant could achieve.		Capital is more valuable now and more important than in the 1950s. Growth in the 1950s was fueled by huge pent-up demand, and it was satisfied by a huge pool of labor, not capital.		Everyone, even economists and politicians, knows that economic growth should be America???s top priority. Income re-distribution and attacks on ???greedy??? (economists would call them ???rationally selfish???), successful business people who are the backbone of the American economy should not be a priority.		A 90 percent tax rate at a time when the economy is trying to grow its way out of the Obama stagnation won???t ???grow??? the economy; it will kill it. If your goal is to get back at the successful for their success, that might be just the ticket. But it might be better just to hand Sanders a candlestick and let him run amok in the billiard room.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kellymcneill","name":"t1_crw3gr2","parent_id":"t1_crvyhgr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433479006,"created_utc":1433475406}
{"body":"You do realize that the economy is driven by consumer demand.  You admit as much in your exhaustive and exhausting post. You point out that production follows consumer demand.  This is a basic tenant of Capitalism.		Then the modern group think takes over and despite all the evidence that consumer demand would spur production and move the economy there is an almost mystical belief in discredited "trickledown" theories and their derivatives.		So powerful is the desire for serfdom amongst some individuals that during the American revolution the economic argument against independence was that no one ever got a job from a peasant.

{"body":">"economy is driven by consumer demand"		Correct however one person's purchase translates to another person's payment and thus additional purchases and payments from others down the road. When the government receives the increased levels of that return it is no longer reinvested as efficiently and as directly. That is the very nature of trickle down economics. It's been proven to work in countless economies. When people are allowed to keep more of their money, they spend it, thereby causing to to increase economic growth.		>"That 90% tax rate works. It would put people to work."		It works if you feel the government is capable of spending your money more effectively then you are. Unfortunately government has proven time and time again to be dramatically inefficient.		Let's provide a few examples. Which of the following would you prefer:		public pool / private pool	public education / private education	public transportation / private transportation	public roads / private roads		I can go on and on but the point is clear. In every one of these examples, the private sector consistently outperforms the public one. Not only do private businesses do things better, they do more with less.		This is not to say that the government ought not have a role in spending our money. They should. Taxation is necessary. One example... defense. A primary necessity of our taxes is to defend citizens from external threats. Another example is securing our borders. Another example would be a moderate and limited level of security for those who find themselves suddenly unemployed. there are several examples where taxation is necessary but none of these require the level of taxation we're currently at and absolutely not anything like Bernie would otherwise prefer.		Coincidently, all of this can be achieved by way of a consumption tax. We don't even need to tax income to fulfill all the requirements of government. As a matter of fact,  it's been roughly only within the past 100 years that the government started taxing income.			>"Unlike your theories. I live in a real world where real solutions for the Bush Depression are needed."		The economy started falling under Clinton. Bush (a president for whom I am absolutely not a fan of) spent money like a liberal progressive. Obama has exponentially increased Bush's massively inflated spending. We have not entered a depression (yet) as both administrations keep using inflation to get us out of it however this will not work for much longer.			>"We know it works because we have hard historical evidence that it works."		Would you mind please providing some examples of this level of taxation resulting in increased liberty and economic increases. I'm curious which ofd these you might regard as success stories.","depth":10,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kellymcneill","name":"t1_crwrgbf","parent_id":"t1_crwba0v","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433534900,"created_utc":1433531300}

{"body":"The AWB isn't "pants-on-head retarded".  Ignorant, perhaps, but there is some reasonable thinking behind the notion of limiting features on firearms that increase their lethality.  Increased magazine capacity?  More shots between reloads, which in the case of a gunman opening up on a surprised crowd really can make a difference in the number of people who die in the encounter.  Barrel shroud?  It exists to dissipate heat, allowing for a longer duration of sustained fire.  Folding stock?  Allows our gunman to tuck a rifle into a standard duffel bag, making him less likely to be noted as a threat before starting his spree.  Not allowing a bayonet mount? Renders our gunman momentarily less-lethally armed during a reload, reducing the rifle to an awkward club rather than a spear should someone take advantage of the reloading window to try to wrestle him down.		All these things have *some* rational justification behind them.  The real problem with the AWB isn't that it is entirely stupid, it's that it isn't really justified on a cost/benefit basis - the kinds of shootings where these features would make a substantial difference in the outcome are incredibly rare, the ban is incredibly easily circumvented by anyone determined to wreak mayhem (rendering any possible benefit likely moot), and the vast *vast* majority of people who would suffer for the ban are law-abiding citizens who would never use their weapon in a crime.  But then, even if the ban were enacted, the inconveniences to those affected by the ban would be relatively small - it would be more inconvenient to bring your rifle to the range without the folding stock, you'd have to pause to reload a bit more while shooting, and so on....which would do very little to stop you in the lawful use of your gun.  On the whole, I think the ban is not useful and so I oppose it, but if it were enacted it wouldn't be the end of the world, especially with the largest lobbying group in the country frothing for its repeal over the next several election cycles.
