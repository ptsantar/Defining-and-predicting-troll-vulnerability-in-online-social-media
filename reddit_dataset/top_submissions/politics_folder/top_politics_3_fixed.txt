The historicity of Jesus is a controversial topic which may never be satisfactorily resolved, but the lack of any records outside of the church suggests to me that his existence is apocryphal. At the time that Jesus is supposed to have lived there were innumerable messianic figures which attracted followings of various size and influence. It's entirely possible that the figure which we came to know as Jesus grew out of the remembrance of a particularly successful leader of one of these cults, but the fact is that we don't know.

The hilarious part is that the new no-earmarks policy, which everyone and their brothers loved on paper, has been a major contributor to Congressional dysfunction. 		Without money to bring back home, representatives had much less of an incentive to be pragmatic about compromising on bills.

And it made it way, way easier to unseat long-time incumbents, because after all, what have they done for you lately without pork?		That is why most riders attached to bills you see these days are ideological (the anti-abortion rider attached to the recent human trafficking bill, for example). Strutting your adherence to the ideology is the new currency. And in that environment, *not* passing a bill is actually *better* than getting one through because then you can bravely declare that you refused to compromise your principles.

{"body":"I'm trying to even fathom what it would mean if such a bill was passed and signed into law.  		The Patriot Act first became law around the same time I finished high school and became an adult.  It's hard to have a context for what life was like before because my context was through the eyes of a teen and not a fully politically-aware adult.  I've essentially lived my entire adult life under this law.		I do remember that there was a big to-do about library records when the act first went into place.   When the act passed my local library along with many others decided to stop keeping new patron check-out records and destroy old ones.  Thus they would not have any records to turn over to the government if asked.		I also remember big impacts on airport security.  My region is filled with lots of little airports.  Some have one a few flights daily.  Therefore secure areas in some airports are closed for portions of the day because there are no flights at those times.  In others, the areas remain open only to connecting passengers who may exit security at any time, but entry for new passengers is not opened until about an hour prior to takeoff.  IIRC prior to Patriot Act, the ID-checking portion of airline security used to be handled by ticket agents that did double duty after checking passenger baggage.  It was an efficient use of time for one person to do both job duties.   Now these same airports often have TSA agents and airline ticket agents who work split-shifts or part-time, unable to get steady full-time work because of this division in duties.  		Perhaps the biggest impact was the bulk collection of phone records.  In 2001 relatively few people had cell phones.  Of those that did, the phones were pretty [simple](http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/78/Nokia_5110.jpg).   What private citizen then could imagine how phone technology would advance over the next decade?  Who could imagine how reliant we'd be on phones to stay connected: checking email, using maps, playing games, and browsing the internet from the palm of our hands. With families going from 1 or 2 landline phones for the entire household to 1 phone per preteen-to-adult family member suddenly the [NSA's 3 degrees of separation](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/28/nsa-files-decoded-hops) became a lot closer.","depth":0,"score":40,"ups":40,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DontRunReds","name":"t1_cpq0jqe","parent_id":"t3_306jsr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1427270718,"created_utc":1427267118}

{"body":">Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism, the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals. Racists believe that all individuals who share superficial physical characteristics are alike; as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups. By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called 'diversity' actually perpetuate racism. Their intense focus on race is inherently racist, because it views individuals only as members of racial groups. Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism. Modern liberalism, however, well-intentioned, is a byproduct of the same collectivist thinking that characterizes racism. The continued insistence on group thinking only inflames racial tensions. The true antidote to racism is liberty. Liberty means having a limited, constitutional government devoted to the protection of individual rights rather than group claims. Liberty means free-market capitalism, which rewards individual achievement and competence, not skin color, gender, or ethnicity. In a free market, businesses that discriminate lose customers, goodwill, and valuable employees- while rational businesses flourish by choosing the most qualified employees and selling to all willing buyers. More importantly, in a free society every citizen gains a sense of himself as an individual, rather than developing a group or victim mentality. This leads to a sense of individual responsibility and personal pride, making skin color irrelevant. Rather than looking to government to correct what is essentially a sin of the heart, we should understand that reducing racism requires a shift from group thinking to an emphasis on individualism.

Wouldn't you as a consumer rather know who the racist businesses/business owners are? If you do, then you can take your money elsewhere.		> He has, strangely, claimed that without regulation, the free market would eliminate discriminatory businesses in the long run; as if racist business practices didn't prosper for most of this country's history.		Strangely? Why? Because you can't see why more regulations only serve to prevent you as a consumer making choices? Who exactly was propagating these racist practices throughout "most of this country's history"? I suggest to you it was the government. It was the governments that created the slave trade, and governments that perpetuated it. It was individuals and the civil libertarians (read rights) movement, originally in Britain that put pressure on governments to stop slavery. Civil libertarians got there government to buy the slaves off of their owners and then had them made free men. It wasn't the British government that freed the slave, but people like you and I who stood up to government and said "these people should be free men". The US government could have freed the slaves too, in the same way Britain did, rather than have a Civil War. It would have been cheaper and you wouldn't have lost 600,000 lives. Slavery was doomed anyway. Free men are far more productive than the enslaved.		The only reason racist practices "prospered" is because of governments not in spite of them. Take the Jim Crow Laws. The Jim Crow laws mandated the segregation of public schools, public places and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was also segregated, as were federal workplaces, initiated in 1913 under President *Woodrow Wilson*.		Government did that. Not the people. Here's a little article by Thomas Sowell (he's black BTW) that I think you'll find interesting:		>Rosa Parks and history Oct 27, 2005	> The death of Rosa Parks has reminded us of her place in history, as the black woman whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, in accordance with the Jim Crow laws of Alabama, became the spark that ignited the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.		> Most people do not know the rest of the story, however. Why was there racially segregated seating on public transportation in the first place? "Racism" some will say -- and there was certainly plenty of racism in the South, going back for centuries. But racially segregated seating on streetcars and buses in the South did not go back for centuries.		> Far from existing from time immemorial, as many have assumed, racially segregated seating in public transportation began in the South in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.		> Those who see government as the solution to social problems may be surprised to learn that it was government which *created this problem*. Many, if not most, municipal transit systems were privately owned in the 19th century and the private owners of these systems had no incentive to segregate the races.		> These owners may have been racists themselves but they were in business to *make a profit* -- and you don't make a profit by alienating a lot of your customers. There was not enough market demand for Jim Crow seating on municipal transit to bring it about.		> It was* politics* that segregated the races because the incentives of the political process are different from the *incentives of the economic process*. Both blacks and whites spent money to ride the buses but, after the disenfranchisement of black voters in the late 19th and early 20th century, only whites counted in the political process.		> It was not necessary for an overwhelming majority of the white voters to demand racial segregation. If some did and the others didn't care, that was sufficient politically, because what blacks wanted did not count politically after they lost the vote.		> The incentives of the economic system and the incentives of the political system were not only different, they clashed. *Private owners* of streetcar, bus, and railroad companies in the South *lobbied against* the Jim Crow laws while these laws were being written,* challenged them* in the courts after the laws were passed, and then *dragged their feet in enforcing those laws* after they were upheld by the courts.		> These tactics delayed the enforcement of Jim Crow seating laws for years in some places. Then company employees *began to be arrested* for not enforcing such laws and at least one president of a streetcar company was threatened with jail if he didn't comply.		> **None of this resistance was based on a desire for civil rights for blacks. It was based on a fear of losing money if racial segregation caused black customers to use public transportation less often than they would have in the absence of this affront.	**	> Just as it was not necessary for an overwhelming majority of whites to demand racial segregation through the political system to bring it about, so it was not necessary for an overwhelming majority of blacks to stop riding the streetcars, buses and trains in order to provide incentives for the owners of these transportation systems to feel the loss of money if some blacks used public transportation less than they would have otherwise.		> People who decry the fact that businesses are in business "just to make money" seldom understand the implications of what they are saying. ***You make money by doing what other people want, not what you want***.		> Black people's money was *just as good* as white people's money, even though that was not the case when it came to votes.		> Initially, segregation meant that whites could not sit in the black section of a bus any more than blacks could sit in the white section. But whites who were forced to stand when there were still empty seats in the black section objected. That's when the *rule was imposed* that blacks had to give up their seats to whites.		> Legal sophistries by judges "interpreted" the 14th Amendment's requirement of equal treatment out of existence. Judicial activism can go in any direction.		> That's when Rosa Parks came in, after more than half a century of political chicanery and judicial fraud.		It's a different point of view to what most people have been taught to understand, and I think it makes a great deal of sense as to what really were the motivating forces at the time. Don't you?		Do you know what really changed things at that time? Black's began to wake up and realise their power as a people, and importantly, as a CONSUMER. When Rosa Parks stood up against these GOVERNMENT laws and the community took action, businesses started to lose money. That was the real historic change in the black movement, not the civil rights act which followed. During those following weeks black's decided to walk to work, or find other means of transport during that time. During that time, many other buses businesses started up and provided transport for blacks. The white bus owners were going out of business very quickly. It was hurting their bottom line. THAT'S what forced the government's hand into doing something, the power of the black consumer, but what should have happened is government should have just repealed the Jim Crow law and left the blacks to determine for themselves which bus companies they would use, and they would have chosen those businesses that didn't segregate the people.		What people have been schooled, is not what actually happened. It was about Black's discovering their power as a people, and their power as a consumer.		> His concern for property rights does not appear to extend to the people who were wronged by the government's enforcement of slavery.

We would recognise these people today as Crony Corporatists.

Now not all people are honest, but the consumer knows how to distinguish between good businesses and bad. The good stay in business because customers will choose to use them (not by force, which is what government does in league with the businesses you were referring to above) and the bad will fail because people will choose not to use their services or buy their goods. When you take the Crony Corporatism out of the equation, ie government is not allowed to interfere in the market, then that means others can come in an compete against those incumbents on an "honest and decent basis" and a much fairer footing.		Think about those business in America that had slaves to do their work. They were losing business to businesses that weren't using slaves. Why?

The Robber Barron's became rich because they served their customers needs and the profit they made was in return for providing exactly what their customers wanted.

Those Crony Corporatists lobbied (note the word lobbied) the Gvnt of the day to prevent businesses like SO from competing against them. Protectionism. They wanted government to oust Standard Oil and then to give them, the Crony Corporatists a government protected Cartel. By the time the government introduced its anti-trust legislation to protect this cosy little cartel of lobbyist businesses (which you seem to be all in favour of) SO had lost most of its market share anyway through competition & not thievery.		From the [Truth about Robber Barron's](https://mises.org/library/truth-about-robber-barons)...		> "Standard Oil's superior efficiency (and lower prices), the company's share of the refined petroleum market rose from 4 percent in 1870 to 25 percent in 1874 and to about 85 percent in 1880.[27]		> As Standard Oil garnered more and more business, it became even more efficient through "economies of scale" ??? the tendency of per-unit costs to decline as the volume of output increases. This is typical of industries in which there is a large initial "fixed cost" ??? such as the expense involved in building an oil refinery. Once the refinery is built, the costs of maintaining the refinery are more or less fixed, so as more and more customers are added, the cost per customer declines. As a result, the company cut its cost of refining a gallon of oil from 3 cents in 1869 to less than half a cent by 1885. Significantly, Rockefeller *passed these savings along to the consumer*, as the price of refined oil plummeted from more than 30 cents per gallon in 1869 to 10 cents in 1874 and 8 cents in 1885.[28]		> Because he could refine kerosene far more cheaply than anyone else could, which was reflected in his low prices, the railroads offered Rockefeller special low prices, or volume discounts. This is a common, ordinary business practice ??? offering volume discounts to one's largest customers in order to keep them ??? but Rockefeller's less efficient competitors complained bitterly. Nothing was stopping them from cutting their costs and prices and winning similar railroad rebates other than their own inabilities or laziness, but they apparently decided that it was easier to complain about Rockefeller's "unfair advantage" instead."		His customers were very happy. It was his competitors who weren't. But, I'm sure you were never schooled about that, or even bothered to find out the truth of it.		> This idea that we have to think about others before ourselves is outdated, and really is socialism.	> Debate is about supporting opinions with facts, not repeating unsupported opinions. Here's a fact. Humans started as hunter-gathers; the most libertarian existence possible. At some point we collectively made the decision to have government. Over time we've frequently chosen to expand it's role. The record of human history would seem to suggest that it is libertarianism that is outdated.	> But, if you choose to live a libertarian existence, there are some great property values in Somalia.	You tell I need to support my opinions with facts and then write *that.*. So much fact. 	> 	 	Not so. Hunter gathers wouldn't have been following the NAP (Non Aggression Principle), which for a start goes to show your ignorance about what libertarians are about. No one made any "collective" bullshit non-existent agreement; The imaginary Social Contract! LOL. Before governments you had tribes. The leader of the tribe tended to be the one who could kick the ass of, or outsmart, anyone else thinking about being in charge. It was all about how do they maintain their power over their people. People stayed with their tribes because they knew they could not have survived on their own. Societies aren't socialist by nature. They are individuals who come together through a common cause. Like survival.		[The Origins of the State: Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raqzZhAj7AM)	[The Origins of the State: Part 2 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbzeaIvFeAc)		People aren't given a choice as to having a [government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A). Governments are imposed upon the people through the use of force and coercion. Governments are NOT a voluntary act. If they were then taxes would be voluntary. People become part if this "idea" of government because they happen to be in the geographical area controlled by a select few others who use violence, force and coercion to maintain or gain their power. You don't choose to allow your government to expand its power. Your government just does it by using force and coercion. There is no voluntary in government. FACT. If you want to prove the legitimacy of that then stop paying your enforced taxes (taxes are not voluntary) and then see how much choice you really have.		Somalia? Compared to what? Compared to its government controlled neighbours Somalia is doing very well. It can be argued that Somalia is a better place to live now, just look at the United Nations stats on it compared to its Statist neighbours, longer life expectancy, better education, healthcare, mortality rates, and even their mobile services are one of the best in the world, but it never was libertarian in its past, as it was BRUTAL SOCIALIST DICTATORSHIP, and isn't a libertarian example now, even though it has no central government and its citizens have a lot more freedom and prosperity now compared to what they have ever had before.		Although libertarian philosophy has its origins going back to people like Socrates, the libertarian movement really only started in the industrial revolution period and onward. Compared to the "record of human history" which has been mostly thousands of years of oppression and slavery of the masses to the satisfaction of the few, it's only the blink of an eye. As I said before, it was the civil libertarian movement that stopped slavery, gave women the right to vote, brought about many of the rights today that you ignorantly take for-granted. Even the founding fathers designed the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to limit and RESTRICT government, and not to restrict the rights of the people. But, as you can see with those in power, power corrupts. Government always finds a way expand, and that's usually because of Statist lackey's like yourself who allow it to happen.","depth":12,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BanjoBilly","name":"t1_cps0d3g","parent_id":"t1_cprbl5t","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1427419666,"created_utc":1427416066}

{"body":"Just to add to that as I can't go past 10,000 charaacters:		That's why government stepped in and got behind the Civil Rights movement; because they were losing power. Think about that for a moment. The government realised that black's were finding themselves and were *effecting real change*. This was dangerous for the government. They were concerned that this movement would expand throughout the country, and it was, but government wasn't behind this change. It was people, individuals, not those in power. THAT'S why they got behind it.		> as if racist business practices didn't prosper for most of this country's history.		Look to your history. Prior to the industrial revolution, most people were slaves, or serfs, subjects of a minority. The industrial revolution brought about change that allowed the masses to break free from their servitude. These people were able to take their skills, their crafts, and their ability to do things and start their own businesses thanks to the freedom the industrial revolution provided. The industrial revolution allowed goods to be produced for the masses at very low prices. It gave people the ability to earn money and to save money and to spend that money on the goods being produced by people like themselves and to buy property which prior to that was ONLY owned by the aristocracy. The entitled, the landholders. It helped redistributed the wealth away from the few, allowed millions of people to be fed inexpensively, and even created the middle classes.		PEOPLE, not just blacks had been up until that stage in servitude to the very few, for thousands of years. Is it not clear that the first to unshackle themselves from servitude would be those that were more similar to their masters? The whites. And that spurred more change. You had massive changes, not just in technology and what it did for the masses, but in thinking. People began to understand that as individuals they had RIGHTS. That they weren't subject to others, that they could be and should be free men. The anti-slavery movement came from the civil libertarian movement, woman's rights form the libertarian movement and all the rights movements we recognise today. The civil liberties movement itself, which is no longer taught in schools because governments don't want you to recognise that you are a free person.		Racist practices can occur but they can only be perpetuated by governments. As Thomas Sowell said	> These owners may have been racists themselves but they were in business to make a profit -- and you don't make a profit by alienating a lot of your customers.		The market doesn't care what colour your skin is. But governments do. Otherwise they wouldn't be asking for your ethic background when you fill out those forms. Yes, yes, no doubt someone can come up with some perfectly valid reasons as to why they can ask such questions and you and I can't, but *really*, why do they have the right to ask and we don't?","depth":9,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BanjoBilly","name":"t1_cpqu7rt","parent_id":"t1_cpqt47c","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1427332259,"created_utc":1427328659}

{"body":"It's crazy how many upvotes you're getting. It's like people have no clue what governments actually do or how the American one, in particular, work.		One basic thing- only laws can be repealed. That makes a lot of your statements silly on their face. Why, you might ask?		> not international spying of allies and other friendly governments.		State sponsored espionage against foreign parties has never been illegal. It never will be. It's part and parcel of what a wise nation does when it is dealing with other nations. There's also no particular law to repeal here, unless you repeal the laws that created the individual intelligence agencies of the US, and issued new law to make illegal the intelligence arms of the Department of Defense.		That's not going to happen. 		> It is also not repealing anything related to drone strikes (either foreign or potentially domestic).		Drone strikes are administered by the Department of Defense at the order of the President of the United States, using a power he's had since the constitution was created. No law to repeal there, either, unless you intend to strike the President's foreign power and Commander in Chief capacities.		> Does not declassify the united states as a warzone.		The US was never actually classified as a warzone in the first place. The article you gave doesn't even say that except as a euphemism. The fact that you used the article you linked as a source (which has many, many of its own problems, including being outdated) tells me a lot about what you consider as factual information, though.		> Does not repeal arrests without trial (ie: Guantanamo Bay level of shit).		Can't repeal an arrest, obviously. Also since the captures of persons in Guantanamo were all under an Authorization of Military Force during combat or in combat zones, those people are all 'enemy combatants'. They are considered prisoners of war under international and military law.		Secondly, no arrest requires a trial. Extended detention, however, for American citizens, requires a trial. Indefinite detention is for non-American citizens, is codified in the law, and *that* can be repealed.		> This just smacks of "feel good" shit that really doesn't change the meat of what makes the Patriot Act so fucked up...

{"body":"You are missing the main point of her talking about the threat of force/force, and are possibly not knowing of what many libertarians' rights system is. 		Libertarians, closely associated with the Classical Liberals of the 19th century, should know well that of course law requires force. It was Frederic Bastiat, arguably the best Classical Liberal, wrote a long paper ,a small book truthfully, about law and what it is. The book is called, fittingly, "The Law."		Bastiat explicitly shows that he did indeed know that the law required force, "...the law???which necessarily requires the use of force..." Many Libertarians have read his book, and even if they have not I would doubt that any Libertarian would say that law does not require force. 		The issue comes when the law uses *aggressive* force, or force that violates one's natural rights. To be more precise, aggression is necessarily the first redirection of means. Julie is pointing out that these laws violate one's natural rights. She uses the "threat of force" because when used by the government it is truly an overt act of aggression.		We can observe that a threat of force used by the government is not just some worthless threat, but one backed by a long history of fulfilling these threats and using aggressive violence without threats. We can safely say that by issuing a threat of force it is an act of overt aggression, and per a natural law ethics perspective someone might justifiably defend themselves against such an act. 		That is just a quick, rough run down of why you might be missing the main point. Libertarians are aware that the law requires force; they are concerned with whether that is aggressive force or not.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Heartgold22","name":"t1_cppx21p","parent_id":"t1_cppvbse","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1427260405,"created_utc":1427256805}

My point is that Libertarians seem to throw the force card around a lot for laws that they disagree with, but are rather silent on the vast majority of laws that the public is perfectly ok with being enforced by force.
