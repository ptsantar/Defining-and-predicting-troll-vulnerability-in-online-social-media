{"body":">Having proposed to myself to treat of the kind of government established at Rome, and of the events that led to its perfection, I must at the beginning observe that some of the writers on politics distinguished three kinds of government, viz. the monarchical, the aristocratic, and the democratic; and maintain that the legislators of a people must choose from these three the one that seems to them most suitable. Other authors, wiser according to the opinion of many, count six kinds of governments, three of which are very bad, and three good in themselves, but so liable to be corrupted that they become absolutely bad. The three good ones are those which we have just named; the three bad ones result from the degradation of the other three, and each of them resembles its corresponding original, so that the transition from the one to the other is very easy. Thus monarchy becomes tyranny; aristocracy degenerates into oligarchy; and the popular government lapses readily into licentiousness. So that a legislator who gives to a state which he founds, either of these three forms of government, constitutes it but for a brief time; for no precautions can prevent either one of the three that are reputed good, from degenerating into its opposite kind; so great are in these the attractions and resemblances between the good and the evil.

{"body":"IMO once your population gets above a certain amount, and certainly at the amount the US population has grown to, republicanism becomes impossible to work effectively without become oligarchical.  Enough of the population will give their passive consent to maintain the status quo that politicians are largely given carte blanche regardless of their corruption.		The idea of breaking up America into smaller countries has been growing on me for a few years now.  Regional autonomy with strong trade and defensive agreements.  Instead we seem to be heading the other direction with things like the TPP and TTIP.		Somewhere on /r/Mapporn a while ago there was a breakdown of America's 11 political regions.  If you broke America up based on political views we'd be 11 different countries.  You could probably divide it even more if you wished.  Maybe into something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/dgiDxeO.jpg) (map of the 20 air traffic control zones).		People can argue that we are stronger when unified, but there's no reason for the military unity to go away.  And the smaller the country the more truly representative the government is.  In 1775 (American Revolution) the population of the 13 Colonies was 2.4 million.  Minus slaves it was 2.1 million.  Take men only (because women couldn't vote) and it was about 1 million.  Minus out children and you're around 800k voters.		Currently we have 235 million eligible voters in America.  When you are 1 of 800K, your vote matters a great deal.  When you are 1 of 235 million, not so much.  It roughly works out to having 300 times the voting power.  Imagine if your vote counted 300 times as much as it currently does... wouldn't you be a lot more compelled to vote?  Wouldn't you believe you had a lot more power than you do to influence the system?

The idea that one vote out of ten is somehow 'worth more' than one vote out of a million is an illusion. No one's single vote counts more regardless of the population rising or decreasing. Your *voice* and your *wealth* might decrease in worth, but a vote is an approval process. In any vote you either win, or you lose.

{"body":"One I can see, but it sounds like you are saying we should allow it to happen to those portions that let it... and I don't think that's a good idea. The republicans would grab some part of the midwest or south and try to run it like an oligarchical "libertarian" paradise and then just need everyone else's bail out in the end anyway.		Two is just wrong. I think you are just thinking of the value of a vote economically, while it doesn't work like that. One vote in ten on any decision has the same weight and outcomes as one vote in 3 or one in 3 million. Maybe you mistake the idea of having the "deciding vote"... this is not real... Even in a vote of 3, one side wins or the other does, and it does not matter if it was 3-0, or 2-1, no vote "decided" the outcome, the same as no vote in 50 million or whatever. Votes worth does not change. 		I think you are mistaking the idea for your *voice*. A vote decides for or against a certain position or a certain candidate, but your voice is what decides which positions or which candidates the votes are for, does that make sense? Think about it in terms of the fact that we vote by country on only issues which effect the entire country, state issues are decided on only by the people in that state, etc. So when you go in to vote on changes to your local water authority tax, you say yes or no, and you win or lose, but your vote is only worth one person's vote...It can't be less, and it can't be more. If you have candidates on a ballot, it does not matter whether the pool size is 5 or 500, your one vote still counts exactly the same: It is worth one person's vote, no more and no less. A vote is just a single thing that a person has in a system. What you are saying makes the same sense as saying that your nose is worth less, when measured nationally, rather than just by my city. It really does not follow unless you somehow put a market value on it, like a dollar amount, and there are great lengths taken to make sure that is not happening, because votes are not intended to function that way.		Do you see? One vote only ever counts as 1/everyone (the decision effects). You could easily argue that your *voice* in political dialogue is washed out in larger pools by offering up new ideas or candidates, but a vote is only ever one thing per person... population size really has nothing to do with that.			Now, *who* we allow to vote has changes to what you are saying. We do not let foreign citizens in our country vote for obvious reasons, but our laws effect them, so it silences their votes. We don't let children vote, nor felons, because we think these are people with bad (or as-yet-undeveloped) decision making skills, and this silences their votes while our laws effect them. These types of things weaken their votes altogether, and certainly boost the 'value' of our votes in the sense of effecting more people than the voting population. 		It helps to stop thinking of it as 1/300 million vs 1/20k, and start thinking of it as (almost) always 1/100% vs 1/100%. Another good example would be the votes that a senator has.

That, again, is the entire point.		What I've said is that whatever the hurdle you set is - however many individual donors a candidate needs to get a check from to meet the expenses of running a campaign - an incumbent will always, nearly without exception, have a much easier time of reaching that hurdle.  		If you tell a member tomorrow that starting next year his stable of reliable maxed out donors will only be able to give him 1/2 as much money next year, what happens?  		First - it might not even matter, since most members raise more than they objectively need to run a race anyway, in order to have an impressive war chest.  		But lets say it does matter - lets say he needs every penny.  		What next?  Among other things - 		1) His campaign committee (DCCC or NRCC) is going to help him.  They exist to help incumbents.		2) Leadership is going to help him.  You wouldn't believe what donors a member has never met come out of the woodwork to write a check when his fundraiser features the Speaker or Minority Leader as a "special guest".  		3) His buddies - ie other members - are going to help out.  While it doesn't quite have the cachet of having leadership in the room, members will often introduce their reliable donors to their friends.  After all, if a donor is cutting a check to a member's drinking buddies, odds are they'll like him too.		Now what if you're a dark horse challenger? How do you reach that hurdle?  It's a hell of a lot harder.  		You're starting from zero, on multiple levels.  Zero money in the bank; zero donors in the database. So whatever amount you need, however many donors you have to get checks from, it's a lot harder to get there from zero.  		Now - and all this is assuming this hypothetical race is an R v. D race (primary challenges are becoming much more common given the lopsided nature of redistricting, and feature much bigger hurdles) - what about the rest?  		In short - first, you pretty much have to prove you don't need the money to get money/help from your party campaign committee.  They have limited funds - they're not going to blow them on a lackluster candidate.  So you have to have a decent chunk of money in the bank already, and of course you have to be in a "winnable" race.  		Leadership and other members?  First, at it's most basic level, you don't know them.  They don't owe you.  They don't want to back a loser - so again they'll often focus on people in winnable races who have proven fundraising ability.  		TL, DR: It really comes down to this - do smaller caps affect everyone? Of course.  But they're devastating to any number of folks who could have otherwise raised the funds to run competitive races as challengers. 		They're a speed bump for an incumbent.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"congressional_staffr","name":"t1_cs08e82","parent_id":"t1_cs06gzm","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433825375,"created_utc":1433821775}

That's precisely my point.  Corps, individuals, whatever.  But an incumbent has LOTS of these people in his rolodex already.

Trust me - it's not.  		Any person with the wherewithal to actually be elected - the combination of appropriate political views for the constituency, the right r??sum??, and charisma - could easily raise that 750k from one or a small number of VERY high dollar donors, MUCH easier than he could raise $500 from 1,500 people.

{"body":"I'll defer to you as to conversations you've been a part of.

I think that's one of the reasons that Adelson seems to be failing - he's trying to wield clout to get the bill he wants passed, passed, the preferences of members and their constituents be damned.  His money would be much better spent educating those conservative members (and maybe their constituents) about why online gambling is the spawn of Satan or whatever - sooner or later they'd be clamoring to pass pretty much exactly what he wants.  		Note that I did draw a distinction - the Kochs and their ilk on either side are never going to have much effect on a vote by vote basis; they're not going to impact a vote on this particular bill or that particular bill, by and large.  Because after all - a member with constituents already partial to their view was probably already going to vote their way; a member whose constituents oppose their POV is likely going to say "thanks but no thanks", as he values holding his seat.		But what they are able to do is build an infrastructure that provides an "education" - and that is the impact they've had at the state level, for instance via groups like ALEC (not sure off hand if the Koch's fund ALEC, but it's still the best org to make my point).  		The average state back-bencher is a part time legislator with some other full-time job that he takes a couple months leave from for sessions.

The candidate that wins - typically by a plurality - then makes the rules. Without the plurality of votes, the candidate will not be awarded a position into office and therefore cannot make the rules.		If an overwhelmingly majority of Americans want campaign finance overhaul, then they could easily *not* cast a vote for candidates who spend large sums of money or who are backed by Super PACs and other independent expenditure groups. Instead, that majority of Americans could cast their votes for those candidates who are either publicly financed or financed by small, independent donations. Collectively, this vote for lesser financed candidates would result in an abrupt change to the status quo. In other words, candidates seeking office, and campaign strategists, would soon learn that higher spending is actually correlated with a lower vote percentage. Future candidates seeking office, and thus votes, would thereby need to modify their behavior so that their actions are in accord with those factors that are correlated with increased vote shares.		tl;dr: American voters can overhaul campaign finance on their own by not rewarding candidates who spend excessive sums of private money, or who are affiliated with independent expenditure groups, with their votes. While this path to change is possible, it creates a variation of a collective action problem in that D's and R's risk losing an election if they switch their votes to lesser financed candidates. Thus, everyone throws their hands up in the air out of frustration and wants a central adjudicatory body to solve the problem.		tl;dr was tl;dr: Voters are the most powerful political force in this country...but individually they believe they are helpless.

{"body":">They don't care what the voters think anyway.		To support this cynical claim you cite a Vox article that discusses a journal article from *Perspectives on Politics*; a pretty good journal, but definitely not a top-tier journal in the field of political science (ie, *American Political Science Review*, *American Journal of Political Science*, and *Journal of Politics*). I'm familiar with the journal article because /r/politics seems to love citing it to support a blanket claim of "they only care about the rich." Actually, that's a lie. I've never seen the actually journal article cited, only a citation to a secondary source that is editorializing on the contents of the journal article. Apparently no one is capable of, or interested in, reading the actual journal article and interpreting it for themselves. The journal article itself is pretty interesting, but given the way it operationalizes "economic elites" (and this variables high correlation with non-economic elites), and that substantively small effects of the correlation coefficients, I'm not really convinced that it solidifies a theory of economic elites driving policy; as opposed to other theoretical explanations. It certainly adds some insight into the debate over theories of policy making, but how does one article in a vast body of literature result in a statement that "They don't care what the voters think anyway."		But, therein lies part of the problem in that cynical voters, like yourself, cite one Vox article (editorializing about a journal article) and then claim that politicians don't care what voters think. One article in the whole body of literature on theories explaining policy making, and you're convinced that your cynicism is well grounded. This cynical belief then leads to the belief that you, as a voter, are helpless. That goes back to my original statement in that voters individually believe they are helpless. But, how exactly do you think candidates get elected into office? Do you think you are the only vote that isn't "bought off," and that everyone but you is engaged in a conspiracy and is selling their votes?		>I like this solution to getting lobbyists out of congress more so, solves the campaign finance issue too.		I clicked on the link and was taken to a YouTube video that is an hour long and starts with a guy saying solving democracies problems is easy and can be done for as little as $5. If you want to convey an idea that you think provides a good solution, summarize the idea in your own words and provide the link backing up your claim (although I don't think YouTube is a primary source). You'll have to forgive me, but I'm not going to sit and watch an hour long YouTube video of a guy saying how democracy can be fixed for $5. You have not provided me any indication what his *solution* is, nor have you convinced me that his *solution* is of such value that I should expend the time to watch his video.		tl;dr: your comment confirms my claim that American voters, as individuals, believe they are helpless.

Even I thought Hillary was even worse than Obama.		> too bad he was willing to sell us out.		This is where I find fault with you libs/Obama-ites.		You *should* have known he would betray you. That he had been bought and paid for already. Otherwise, why was the Establishment/MSM (which you *knew* was corrupt, insane, no good) giving him the "realistic" candidate treatment? Instead of giving him the Dennis Kucinich or Ron Paul treatment?		The people running the show, and their propaganda/sheeple-manipulation organ servants, are all closer, have better "access" etc, to the politicians. They know them far better than we peasants do. So if you see the Establishment/MSM treating a politician as if he or she is "acceptable" (or respectable, not crazy, not a crazy long shot, etc) and you think that he or she may be "okay" (as in, willing to buck, work against the interests, of the Ruling Class/Establishment/people who run the show), you should assume that *you* are the one who is wrong.		Because they know the politicians far, far better than you do.		In this case though, just Obama's campaign rhetoric should have disqualified him for you, from a liberal perspective. How can even a President do all the thing liberals wish, hope would get done, without first drastically altering the political landscape, filling the Congress with representatives and senators who will cooperate? And how can you do that unless you change what the American people think, want in terms of policies, find acceptable, etc?  And how can you do that unless you move the Overton window, find politicians willing to say radical, formerly extreme-seeming things, and a bunch of people back him, making it clear that there is a substantial demographic willing to back such ideas and policies?		And Barack Obama did none of this. He didn't preach full-blown unadulterated progressivism like Dennis Kucinich did.  Instead, he used carefully calibrated rhetoric that placed him just a touch to the left of Hillary during the Dem primary campaign phase, then right smack in the "respectable" centrist middle during the general election phase.		And by voting for this you liberals basically said "yeah ok don't move the Overton window. Let's keep the landscape of ideas right where it is." You placed all your hopes on what a leader (and you were hoping you were sneaking in a real progressive, under the guise of centrist rhetoric) could do for you if you managed to sneak the "right one" into office, under the noses of the Establishment/plutocrats and their servants in the political class. 		Which was insanely naive and unrealistic a plan. 		> You lack a point or a coherent argument. 		Well, I hope the above makes clear my position. That you Dem partisans and liberals thought totally wrong about voting, and did it wrong.		You got fooled and you screwed the pooch.		> How are Obama voters to blame for his lack of convictions and respect for personal liberties?		You are to blame for not understanding precisely how bad, rotten, corrupt the Establishment really is, and how powerless even a president would be, unless you first lay the groundwork that constrains, compels the Establishment/Ruling Class to yield on key issues.		Even kings get overthrown or assassinated. Are you really sure they're telling the truth about JFK?		Furthermore, you are to blame for not seeing how issues are connected and related. And how it's simply impossible to win on stuff like personal liberties unless you first end the Empire.		How can you win on personal liberties if there is a Terrorism threat (or even a "National Security" Establishment able of mounting False Flag ops that can be blamed on terrorism)? And terrorism is blowback for American imperialism, so how can you end the terrorism threat without first ending imperialism?		And voting for a guy going "I will escalate the Afghanistan war!" is the way to end imperialism?		Did it not occur to any of you to examine and think carefully about the real differences between e.g. Dennis Kucinich/Ron Paul's foreign policy vision, and Obama's? 		> how were we supposed to know?		Well, I suppose you didn't have the privilege of having me around trolling the fuck out of you on the internets around that time.  But the Dem partisan wanker Obamaloon shitheads I *was* trolling around that time on the internets should have known. Cause I friggin' told them.		Sadly, it's not a knowledge or logic problem. It's an emotional/irrationality/brainwashing problem.		There's the frightening, terrible truth. Liberals and Democrats are just as badly brainwashed, emotionally manipulated, irrational, etc as Bush-wing Republicans.		> Mccain spent		You don't stop an insane fascist like McCain by voting in your own fascist. That kinda... defeats the whole purpose.		> what were we supposed to do?

However, there are ways around this hurdle, even if I don't know the specific route we as a species should take.

Its just my opinion that people would be more willing to read about who to vote for in the comfort of their own homes. Perhaps sending out the information on each candidate along with the mail-in ballot would be a good idea. It would get the information in the homes of every US citizen, which I feel would be a good thing.		Now if they don't have access to the information at home, they could always go to a public library. If they don't have access to transportation to get to a public library, then they should get free transportation straight to the voting booth where they can get the information they need. Some people will just take time, something I would prefer over winging it. There could be a separate "thinking lounge" for those who are conflicted on who to vote for, filled with hard copy pamphlets that have all the relevant information on it.

I don't believe the swiss vote every week on stuff (maybe they do, I don't live there... feel free to chime in Swiss redditors). Even if they did, we could create a smartphone voting app so people could get alerts and vote on issues that matter to them. I've thought in great detail about a smartphone voting app:		I'd like to think the majority of problems with true democracy has always been technological.		With the advent and proliferation of smart phones, I believe true democracy is more possible then ever as technology addresses the critical flaws in this form of government.		First, lets look at the three main issues with True Democracy:		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy#Democratic_reform_trilemma		*Participation* 	___________________________________	The internet connects the species in ways we never could have imagined (especially in the time of direct democracy's origin). Smart phones are getting cheaper by the day. Even if we wanted to avoid spending the money giving these devices to all citizens over 18, Public libraries are in most towns in the USA. (or at least they used to be)		*Deliberation*	_______________________________	Using said smart phones, posting videos to the internet to make your argument heard is a non-issue. Bonus points for having the internet right there for people to fact check your argument against knowledge available to all citizens. Immediate rebuttals are available for opposing views.		*Equality*	__________________________________	Truly the hardest part of making a large direct democracy work. How can everyone's voice have a equal chance at being heard? Exposing the ideas to the same amount of viewers. IMO, we can achieve this with a voting structure much like reddit. People are free to sort by new, controversial, or even popularity. (IMO sort by new should be default) Every one's posts in a particular subreddit gets the same exposure to voters. Ideas that reflect the people the best will rise to the top. 		I know everyone is worried about how heavily I've borrowed from reddit. Yes I have seen what the default front page looks like. The problem with reddit's front page is demographics, as it is comprised of primarily technologically savvy young males with excess testosterone with no sexual outlet in which to channel such energy. Include all citizens and perhaps discussion and voting patterns will normalize.

{"body":"Its a very good idea. But the article you link states the true problem behind the trilemma. It isnt addressing the trilemma itself, its addressing the solution proposed. Any solution proposed to fix the trilemma, is in it of itself a very unwieldy difficult solution to implement.		The internet connects us but theres a growing argument its actually disconnecting us in a different way. Civic engagement was largely more positively viewed prior to the internet. Its the dilemma of the first worlder and those who grew up comfortable who do not view their right to vote as something important.		Look at reddit already, sure lively and positive fact checking and the rebuttals are happening, but they are happening in almost near echo chambers. You can tailor your front page to show you waht you want to see, and I dont see your system being able to over come this as well. Your system will only promote those already interested in dissertation, it wont encourage or change those who arnt.		Lastly, how can everyones voice be heard? Personally, I dont want everyone's voice to be heard. Morally, they should be, but only if theyre educated and informed and might actually be able to test my arguments and assumptions in a true debate. The problem however, isnt getting people to voice their opinions. Those who want to voice their opinions do. We are in what I call the opinion age of information. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, plenty of websites and tools let you and I emphasize this point,*** DIRECTLY*** tell someone your opinion. You can right now, tweet at any governor, senator, movie star, scientist your personal opinion about anything. Voice is NOT an issue when you can kickstarter or fund anything, when you start a protest or begin a online petition and rally people across the states.		None of the trilemma is a problem together, they are individual problems related to almost one root cause.		I have always been and will be for small structural reform over a period of time to achieve it. You have to address each of the trilemmas individually, with small modular solutions. Only these will be palatable in our current politic environment. Save an act of god, I dont think we will have any sweeping changes to anything. Especially if it looks like its changing any core values such as our current voting procedures. The majority in control of laws right now feel like its a pretty solid system. All we need to do is vote. No matter what the environment is like, the most engaged will vote no matter what. They will stand in rain, hot sun, herded around like cattle, to vote. The problem isnt the system, its the engagement. Those who arnt interested just arnt interested. How do you interest someone in something, they have 0 interest in, regardless of how easy it is to vote.		We already have that argument, its so easy to vote right now. I signed up online. I drove to my school on the day I needed to during lunch and happen stance it took me a little over and hour and I had to stay later.		The only problem is the individual. They arnt engaged to go sign up on the easy online voter application. Its not convenient or possible for them to take off. They arnt educated enough to make an informed vote so they either vote poorly or not at all.		These are all systemic problems that have roots not just in voting. I think the two best things we can do for voting right now is simply make it a holiday and have advertisements for just going and showing up at the polls. The rest are inherent in other major problems like education, labor laws, poverty, gerrymandering and political manipulation. 		I think if you focused your ideas towards engagement, rather than reforming systems and current traditions, youll have a much better perspective on the issue. The changes to systems will come like the ones you proposed here, but they will only come when the demand is there. Currently we dont have that demand.

Their term will be one year long and for their service they will receive a years salary and the guarantee that they can't be fired from their jobs.

A randomly selected legislator might just be bitter and refuse to do any work, like average people show apathy toward jury duty.  	  	And there's elected officials to oversee them? How is that fair? Who picks these people? How do they get into the system and what makes them qualified to have that power over Congress? Citizens can introduce legislation any time they like, and it's basically the same as your proposition.	  	As for the Supreme Court, their lifelong service is exactly what makes it a fair system. How many  overly conservative laws have been declared unconstitutional because of the backing Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave to the opposition? How many overly liberal laws were ended because of Antonin Scalia? If you elect the justices, you end up with a system just like Congress in 2012 where its packed full of Tea Party whack jobs, or whatever political ideology happens to be at the time. The Supreme Court works because it holds lasting political influence from generation to generation, and so that no one sitting president or political party can have the power to influence the court completely one way or the other.  	  	We do need money out of politics. We need laws that make it so that campaigns can't be run on billions of dollars. Candidates can get in front of crowds to speak on their own merit. That doesn't mean we have to eliminate all business interest from our government, because surely some of it is good in the global economy we live in. They just can't have more power than a determined group of concerned citizens. Put strict spending limits so that citizen groups can compete. 		Congress is corrupt. But we have the power to remove our elected officials from their jobs any time we like. That's why it's a democracy. People are biased towards their representatives because they bring back stuff to their districts their constituents like. But if people really didn't want to re-elect somebody they wouldn't do it. Just like with the presidency. But voter turnout is so astonishingly low we can't do it unless we change how Americans think. Fixing the system is fairly simple, and it involves two basic things: remove money from politics, and get more people to vote.","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GrilledCyan","name":"t1_cs001rt","parent_id":"t1_crzwu8z","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433810285,"created_utc":1433806685}

{"body":"I doubt corporations would hand out tens of thousands for one piece of legislation. There should be a "mechanism" that if enough signatures are collected, that person can be censured by their own state. They won't be able to vote on anything in Congress for a short period of time while a vote for them to remain in office is cast. 	 	Say Rep. Jimbob from Kentucky just voted to ban the banning of strip mining. During his election campaign he said that he would vote to end strip mining forever. Things didn't jive. If the signatures of 50% of registered voters on a petition to censure Rep. Jimbob are collected, he no longer represents his district as of that day when the number is confirmed. Then a vote on whether or not he will continue to serve as a representative takes place with a super-majority to kick his sorry ass out.	 	I think the major problem is that Americans love to forget painful or unpleasant things in regards to our system and representatives. So whenever a politician fucks up, give it a month or two, and everybody forgets. If swift and immediate action can be taken, this discourages politicians from thinking they can fuck the people in March and be fine by the time November comes around.	 	Setting up post-Congressional restrictions on investments, jobs and other things that can be leveraged while in office would be a good policy too.

{"body":"Check [this](http://www.thenation.com/article/174151/reverse-revolving-door-how-corporate-insiders-are-rewarded-upon-leaving-firms-congres#) out.		Not exactly what we were talking about, but it does show you that working for the best interest of corporation via politics results in a person being rewarded quite well.  Feel free to look up any congressman that was a corporate shill and see what he/she did after leaving office.  They rake in speaking fees from those corporations they did favors for, they get positions from those organizations they helped, they are placed on boards of directors.  It is likely that they get stock and/or insider trading from those they helped.  Even two years in office can allow a politician to vote for many bills that favor corporations and rich individuals.  Also, Congressmen don't actually write bills.  They hire corporate lawyers that draft the bills and once the bill is drafted, the lawyers quit and go back to working for the corporation.		As for Jimbob, we know that voters rarely do what you  propose (kick them out midterm).  But, let's say that this was a common occurrence.  Jimbob's bill is still passed, so all those who strip mine owe him for life.  By defying the voters he gets more wealth than if he sided with voters.  What about the guy who replaces Jimbob?  Well, if he (sorry for being sexist here) gets voted in just ban strip mining, he could do that.  But then next election he might have no money to go campaigning and his opponent would have millions. He would then not be re-elected.  However, if he violates his promise to the voters, then he also will be taken care of by the mining industry whether he stays in office or whether he is voted out.		As far as forgetting is concerned, we have limited cognitive capacity.  Many bills are passed, some of the lines in some bills benefit voters.  Many of the lines in many of the bills benefit the 1% & corporations.  People forget about the strip mining because the politician made some anti-abortion comments that one time or because they voted for some popular bill that one time.  		Most of us want campaign finance reform.  Yet current politician (each of which is opposed to campaign finance reform) was voted in by the voters.  Because there are other issues: education, gun control, abortion, gay marriage.   I personally feel that most of the issues I care about would be taken care of if campaign finance reform happened.  So for me, that is the single most important criterion.  For most other people, it is not.		>Setting up post-Congressional restrictions on investments, jobs and other things that can be leveraged while in office would be a good policy too. 		Absofuckinglutely.  If we ever get around to campaign finance reform, we better also include laws that restrict post-office favors.

Most politicians will tell you that they don't actually enjoy spending 30-70% of their productive time raising money.

Executives really do have a lot of personal power, and can become imposing figureheads that basically run the show themselves, like Mayor Daley (father or son), or various presidents of newly independent colonial states across the world, or even as FDR could have, had he not been a relatively decent person.		But legislators have to write law, which is inherently a more detail-oriented task that takes a lot of familiarity with how the law works, compared to many of the duties of the executive. Many of the great things that Barney Frank or Ted Kennedy were able to do were due to the fact that they had a staff that had worked together for decades, knew the other power brokers in Congress, and knew how to creatively unlock a compromise with Republicans while doing something interesting and innovative. It's very rare that you see a freshman Senator or Representative spearheading an intricate and important bill, unless it comes fresh from some lobby group or other (since they do have staff that can work together over decades to craft something that will work).","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"easwaran","name":"t1_crzzpd3","parent_id":"t1_crzluc8","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433809657,"created_utc":1433806057}

{"body":"Then any discussion between representatives and lobbyists should become public knowledge.	 	Edit: I'm not saying audio recordings. More along the lines of minutes taken at corporate meetings. The outside party would not have to explicitly identify him/herself personally, but rather as a representative of a lobbying firm or company (e.g. Rep from Steal, Your, Government & Laugh, LLC in at 3:00am to discuss Pipeline Fuck Poor People) The transcript of the minutes could be placed on the congressmen's website or stored on a separate federal website. Text files are not large at all so costs for something like this would be very minimal. This would also allow independent companies, non-profits, political organizations, whoever, better access and tracking of political stances. Not only would we have sharper eyes on our representatives, but it would help curb corruption.	 	You can argue that it could be used as a tool to harm any politician like, pro-life representative Jimbob from Kentucky met with Planned Parenthood. But... that's kind of the point. Not necessarily to hurt a politician's career, but to give it more of an identifiable shape of their personal policies and stances. In this Kentucky Jimbob instance, a political opponent could use that meeting as a way to paint Jimbob as a liar, pro-choice, baby killer. BUT, and just like with 99% of the bullshit that gets spewed all over campaign ads, if you look into it and read the minutes of that meeting, Planned Parenthood wanted to work with Jimbob to find a way to continue to help women without being shut down completely because of abortion services. The purpose, discussion, and tone would paint a better picture. So Jimbob is still seen as pro-life, but also pro-women's health. 	 	On the other hand, say Jimbob met with Evangelical Representatives of Christ's Great Salvation of Humanity to discuss a harder pro-life movement and stripping federal funding for women's health non-profits, and offered $25,000 as a political donation as well as front pew seats every Sunday, this would be put in the minutes (yes, I believe some people would be stupid enough to outright say those kind of things, and some people are smart enough to figure out how to get around them) but it would shed a light on how ERCGSH does political business, and if Jimbob starts pushing hard against Planned Parenhood, we now know why.	 	Not that many "regular" people would actually take the time to look up meeting minutes on their senator or representative, congressional leaders might go for it.

{"body":"OK, I need to make a few corrections, though your general thrust was correct.		First - 80 million does not just sit in the bank.  You put quotes around 'in the bank' so I know that you understand that but the analogy for those who don't will go off the rails quickly.  This needs to be clear for my second point though so I'll try to sum up.		Once you have more money than the FDIC insures then there is no reason to put it in the bank.  If the bank goes under you will not get your money back and the interest rate the bank pays you is well below inflation.  I.E. you are losing money every day because it's just sitting there.  The important distinction is between your personal cash, used for operating expenses like food, shelter and clothing, and capital, which is money that you will not spend any time soon - if ever.  Savings is considered cash unless you invest it, then it's capital.		Ok, now the problem with capital as I noted is that inflation eats away at it every day.  This is by design because without inflation you have no reason to keep your money doing something.  If we have no inflation, or worse deflation, then your best bet is to park your capital somewhere as safe as you can get it - like in the form of cash under your mattress.  This does nothing for the overall economy and is in fact detrimental to the economy.		Thus moderate inflation is good.		OK, now we've defined capital as money you're never going to spend on yourself or your family that you don't want to lose value due to inflation.  Thus you need to invest it in something that will have a higher return than inflation.		The safest bet is US Treasuries.  You know this is the safest bet because of two reasons:  1) They have a yield that is about the same as the inflation rate (resulting in a near net-zero) and the US is by the Constitution prevented from defaulting on them.		The problem with Treasuries however is that first part - they only give you as much as you're losing in inflation.  That means you could park your $80m in Treasuries but you would make next to nothing on it.  No where near that 12.5% that you noted.  To get those kinds of yields you next turn to increasingly more risky bets - and don't get me wrong once you're out of the treasuries you're into gambling.		The riskier the bet the higher the reward if it pans out.  Keep that in mind and the various markets suddenly make a lot more sense.  Probably the riskiest thing you can do with capital, other than actually spend it which has a -100% return, is to create your own business with it.  If it works out then you keep all the profits.  If it doesn't then you've lost your capital.		Now back to income inequality.  The problem isn't that capital compounds.  This is part of capitalism and is the carrot to inflation's stick to keep it working.  The issue is that it compounds faster than working for a living.  If you have $80m in capital and you've invested reasonably wisely for the long haul you can expect to be able to beat inflation by enough to continue to stay ahead of inflation and draw about 2% in income off it.  That means that your $80m in capital returns after all expenses a living wage of $1.6m per year, increasing as inflation does.		What jobs could you work that not only give you $1.6m in income but are reasonably assured - barring another 2007 - to continue that way not only for your whole life but that of your children, grandchildren, etc.?  Yea, none.		Thus why attacking income inequality needs to come in multiple areas and directions all at once.  If you miss one then capital will flee through that loophole and you'll end up with either a much poorer US or you'll get nothing for all your effort.		How to combat income inequality:		1) Tax Capital Gains as Income.	2) Get rid of all the major loopholes like carried interest etc.  They're accounting gimmicks to limit the tax liability of those who make tens and hundreds of millions per year.		Then you need to pick a direction regarding corporations.  Either they a) have rights under the Constitution, or b) they are not people but rather made up of people.		If you go with a then merge the corporate and personal tax codes.  That way they can pay for their rights just like the rest of us.		If you go the other way then get rid of the corporate income tax entirely as it's just a VAT with some paint on it to make it past the Constitution's forbidding of any taxes other than income taxes.  In exchange you treat all capital gains like income and you will make up the difference in the amount of capital that suddenly rushes back into the US.		There.  That's the plan.  Now if we can implement it?  No idea.  I doubt it at least until we get another generational shift in politics.  For sure no current GOP candidate nor Clinton will move on this.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Delwin","name":"t1_cs0mh39","parent_id":"t1_cs0jde0","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433865486,"created_utc":1433861886}

Every year people have spending power of (Income + Savings). A taxpayer should pay the same whether they started with $0 and earned $10 million, or started with $10 million and didn't earn anything.		Philosophically, yeah, they already paid taxes on the $10 million, but over the course of every year, the military, police, and rest of government continually protect those assets and their owner's way of life.

If on the macro scale a country's populous doesn't have enough savings then it is very possible to enter a liquidity trap when  supply side forms of liquidity (read debt) vanishes.  This is exactly what happened in 2007.  You want to have a decent amount of savings in the system as it provides demand side (non-debt) liquidity.		Now wealth is measured usually as total liquidation at current market prices of all capital along with any liquid assets, minus any debt.  If you try to tax wealth you will quickly find that capital is very skittish to taxes and it will gladly travel to anywhere it can to avoid them.  I think if you try a straight wealth tax you'll find that anyone with the means will suddenly have huge debts to overseas shell companies that offset all of their wealth.  The ones who have local capital and no means to offset it - like say your small business owner, the engine of the US economy - will get screwed and end up paying all the taxes.		If you don't take debt into account then you will see a flight from debt and you will get 2007 all over again, but a lot worse.  Remember in a fiat currency debt is wealth - your wealth is someone else's debt and visa versa.		OK, I think that's all I have to say on this unless there's more to explore.  As noted I will simply agree to disagree on your viewpoint on inflation.","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Delwin","name":"t1_cs17qip","parent_id":"t1_cs132s9","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433899010,"created_utc":1433895410}

I fundamentally disagree with idea that, simply because someone doesn't have the significant amount of money necessary to even have a serious chance at large scale elections, it's not in society's interests to give them a shot at a place in politics.		The requirement of money to effectively run, no matter how good your platform is, is a necessary evil. Simply surrendering to it is pretty shortsighted, to my mind. Levelling that playing field and making the process of political election *as much about people's actual politics as possible* is surely of obvious benefit to society as a whole. To the point where I'd argue it isn't a luxury, but necessary for a healthy political system. Which the current one clearly isn't, nor would millionaire campaigns be even if donations were heavily limited. Campaigning costs simply because the basic process relies on private business, and I don't think I'd have *that* part any other way, but if you not only provide those funds but make them uniform or at least democratically proportionate, people can compete on their political talent rather than their established wealth.		Another way to go would be to implement spending limits as well as donation limits, meaning that being incredibly rich wouldn't mean you can spend 10 or 100x times your opponents' budgets. The issue here is that you either have such low spending limits that campaigns themselves are basically gimped, or you have a sensible limit but one which still presents a very high barrier to entry in wider terms.		That's why I'd argue that, much as I do see why you'd object to having yours or others' income used in the process at all (and appreciate that this is indeed a principled stand and not simple partisanship), it's simply a necessary cost for what is basically the central public system of our democratic society itself: the voting process.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePegasi","name":"t1_crzqsl9","parent_id":"t1_crzmp5u","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1433794771,"created_utc":1433791171}

Intentionally dump money (pay more than another company, when spending excess money buy from particular companies, etc) into companies donating to causes we approve of and tell them why we're doing it.  Also, actively encourage up-and-coming companies to donate to causes the people approve of.  Finally, stop giving money to companies doing shit we don't like and let them know why.  When I closed my accounts with Chase and opted for credit unions, I wrote to them to let them know what I was doing and why.

{"body":"Yes. The specific issue was whether or not the government could ban advertisements for a documentary/political hit piece about Hillary Clinton. The government argued that they could ban these advertisements because of the McCain-Feingold Act, but Citizens United argued that it was a restriction of their first amendment rights.		It seems very clear to me that their speech was being restricted based on its content, because if it was a non-political documentary there would have been no issue. The government lawyers in the case even argued that they had the authority to **ban books** if they were paid for by a corporation.		Also, the ACLU filed an amicus brief in support of Citizens United, and they have a long record of "getting it right" when the first amendment is involved. [Their stance](https://www.aclu.org/aclu-and-citizens-united) is pretty reasonable if you want to read it.		As for the article you linked specifically, here are my problems with it:		>1 ???Independent??? Spending Farce Leads To SuperPACs 		Yes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. SuperPACs cannot buy votes, they can only add to the political discourse, and the fact wealthy people are funding them really does not matter one bit.		I do agree that the coordination laws should be better enforced or explained.		>2 Legal Money Laundering Increases Secret Spending 		Anonymous speech is still speech. 		>3 Corporate Money Distorts Democracy 		They state this without providing any evidence, other than a poll commissioned by a liberal advocacy group. 		>4 Court is Blind to Reality of Corruption 		Yes, the possibility exists for corruption under this system, but that in itself is not a good reason to limit speech. Politicians could also be getting direct campaign donations as a quid pro quo, but does that mean nobody should be allowed to donate to a campaign?		>5 Citizen Voices are Drowned Out 		"One person, one vote" is not relevant to speech. It is not feasible to let everyone be equally heard, as it would involve banning newspapers, celebrity twitter accounts, political TV shows, etc. 		Your voice is no more drowned out than before; anyone can write a letter to the editor of your local paper, anyone can call their senator, and most importantly everyone **still gets one vote**.		>6 Money Is Still Not Speech 		Nobody is arguing that all money is speech, otherwise income tax would violate the first amendment. What is being argued is that money **spent on speech** is speech. 		Would you support limiting the amount one citizen can spend on buying posterboard to make signs? What about how much newspapers can spend on printing presses? These would very clearly be limiting speech, even though they target the money and not the speech itself.		>7 Open Season on Remaining Money in Politics Protections 		They argue that other limits will soon fall, but there's no evidence of this. Yes there are "some calling for" it, but there are simultaneously some calling for any number of other things that will never happen.		There is only one Supreme Court Justice out of 9 that supports unlimited direct contributions (Clarence Thomas), and he's likely to stay the most conservative Justice for awhile.		>8 Increases Corporate Power 		This one is probably true, but again it's not a good idea to restrict *everyone's* speech just to stop a few dozen corporations that are politically active.		>9 Unlimited Corporate Spending is Bad for Business and Shareholders 		Irrelevant. Drafting a RB in the top 5 is bad for NFL teams (a business), but there shouldn't be a law against it.		And are they really arguing that corporations are doing this despite it being bad for the bottom line?

{"body":"Okay, it seems your argument boils down to:		1) Money isn't speech.		2) Corporations aren't people.		3) Billionaires control too much of the political discourse.		So here would be my arguments against those specific points:		1) All money isn't speech, but restricting how you can spend money on speech restricts speech. 		I'll go back to my previous example of a printing press, which costs a lot of money. If Congress passed a law that corporations could spend no more than $5,000 on printing presses per year, would that be okay or constitutional in your mind?		2) Corporate personhood is not a new or particularly bad idea. It dates back to [1819](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College_v._Woodward) in the US, and it allows people to sue corporations like they would people. This way, if your child is killed in a car accident, General Motors can be held liable instead of some random engineer that will just file for bankruptcy.		3) Do billionaires control political discourse? That's not what I'm seeing in the primaries so far, because on voting day it is not billionaires but average citizens that will decide who wins. 		Certainly billionaires have more power, political and otherwise, but that was the case before *Citizens United* and would remain the case if it was overturned.

It's a wonderful legal fiction when it comes to liability, but allowing a corporation to spend unlimited money for political purposes allows said corporation to essentially buy elections.  Yes, yes, everyone still has one vote, but advertising *works*, and if you only ever ads for one side of one issue, guess which way that vote is probably going to go?		>Do billionaires control political discourse? That's not what I'm seeing in the primaries so far		The primaries have barely started - people are still declaring their candidacy (or in the case of Jeb Bush, intentionally not declaring it so he can get around campaign finance regulations).

That's only a very small part of the story:  yes, he got a lot of outside spending, but Barrack raised more money, specifically from large individual contributions, than Romney did by far.

My generation has been told time and time again that we don't matter. Our votes don't matter, our voices don't matter, and there's nothing we can do about it. And that's simply not true. We are the people. And if we realize that, stand up, and fight for what we believe in, no matter what that is, we will win. When the people stand up and fight, they always win.

No matter how many times laws are reformed to prevent chicanery and corruption, people find ways around them. Anywhere from routing donations through every single one of your relatives to avoid individual contribution limits like they did in the first half of the 20th century, to the modern "soft" donation tricks (where my donation to any one candidate might be subject to limits, but I can donate infinite money to the various "Committee to Destroy the People I Disagree With" PACs. Obviously this doesn't mean we shouldn't try to make reforms and address certain issues like Citizens United, which occurred before I wrote my thesis, but I don't know how we can ever expect to achieve this via legislation without a major change in attitude about what elections are going to cost.

Specifically to the topic at hand, the majority of people want to have the campaign finance reform at the Federal level. It is the congressional and presidential candidates that make the most difference. They also have the most corruption of monies given their broader reach. As such, I think that the Federal government has to put in rules around how Federal employees are elected. It's the same way that Federal rules bar states from setting term limits. It is a Federal position. The state literally has a seat, but little say over the particulars of filling it. In someways indignation is valid since it is the state's.
