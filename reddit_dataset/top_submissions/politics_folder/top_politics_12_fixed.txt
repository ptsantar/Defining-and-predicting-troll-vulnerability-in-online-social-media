{"body":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III		Big banks have to hold more capital on the sidelines as a "buffer" against huge losses in bad market conditions. The amount of capital required depends on the risk-weighted assets of the bank. So a bank that holds safe government bonds has to hold almost no capital compared to a bank full of risky assets. A previous problem was that once markets became stressed, risky assets became even more risky and the rules required banks to hold more capital. To do that, they had to sell some of their assets, which made the markets even more stressed and risky - creating a positive feed back loop. They've tried to address this too.		Complex structured products, like the ones that caused the Financial crisis, are no longer treated as safe mortgages but as risky derivatives. This means you need more "buffer" capital when holding them.		Some other measures have also been implemented which aim to make sure that banks have enough cash at hand to survive short extremely stressing situations, giving them enough time to sort their shit out (Lehman might've survived if they had more time to sort their stuff out).

This has happened before without catastrophic effects (BCCI, EF Hutton, Continental Illinois, etc). The danger is a failure that's due to structural or market issues.		But those issues impact small banks as well as large banks. Breaking up large banks gives us no protection against the economic impacts of a major bank failure of this sort, because it only leads to many small failures instead of one large failure. And if a bailout is required to keep the economy afloat, it would be about the same size, but with the money going to several medium sized banks instead of a couple of large banks.		The most recent recession, for example, was not caused by bank consolidation. It was the result of structural weaknesses that were exposed when the real estate bubble burst. The failure of many smaller banks would have had the same impact as the failure of a few large institutions, and the size of the bailout required to keep the economy going would have been about the same in either case.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gordo65","name":"t1_cpbyrdu","parent_id":"t1_cpbegfk","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1426118153,"created_utc":1426114553}

The FDIC DIF (Deposit Insurance Fund) currently carries ~$63 billion in reserves for the purpose of paying out depositors in the event of a bank failure.

They certainly can't put the institution into receivership and pay out depositors. They can merge institutions, but this is only a viable option if a larger, healthier institution that can absorb impaired assets exists. If the largest banks are facing insolvency, there's no partner to marry them off to.  The only viable options left would require a significant influx of capital from the US Treasury.

Give a massive bailout to a few large banks, or give a massive bailout to a lot of small banks.

Department of ed gets ~$70 billion, and IMO is one of the least effective areas we have. It seems like an administrative money pit.

You mean that all the bank demand deposits (money) created will eventually be redeemed for cash (which they promise to convert to at par), leading to the conclusion that they never created any money? 		Where do you think the cash comes from? Cash is just an IOU from the central bank, equivalent to reserves (what they call a checking account at the central bank) in physical form. And here again the same logic applies: banks can borrow reserves from the central bank, which is an act of creation, keystrokes on a computer: loans create deposits. 		If the economy is booming and the commercial banking system as a whole is massively increasing the money supply through lending and credit creation, and then in your scenario everyone wants to turn those bank deposit accounts into cold hard cash, then the banks just borrow reserves from the central bank (borrow into existence) and convert them into cash to pay out. As long as the lending was profitable and well underwritten, the banks are making a profit on the spread between the interest rate they're paying to the central bank and the interest rate they're charging the customers.

{"body":"The 'freedom force' link is just entirely wrong, based on the old refuted 'fractional reserve' concept of money as a thing. The other two links explicitly refute this as incorrect.		Example: 	> The bank creates $9000 based on $1000 reserve and loans it to Trendy Wendy, who takes it as a deposit in her checking account. At this point, the bank has an additional $9000 in assets (money on deposit in Trendy???s checking account), but that is offset by $9000 in liability because, once again, the bank does not own this money. 		What really happens during a $9000 bank loan is that Wendy and the bank trade IOUs: the bank promises to pay Wendy $9000 upon demand, and this IOU is called a demand deposit. It's the bank's liability, and Wendy's asset. Meanwhile Wendy promises to pay the bank $9000 over time with interest, and we call this IOU the 'loan'. It's the bank's asset and Wendy's liability. This was all an act of signatures on paper and crediting account entries. The $9000 entry on the computer spreadsheet didn't "come from" anywhere and it wasn't "based on" anything, let alone some unrelated $1000.		They go on to keep saying that checking deposit account totals are the **bank's** asset, so it's really too confused to even bother taking seriously. The BoE piece explains this all quite clearly, and fractional reserve 'multiplying up' stuff is outdated logic that *could* exist for some system, but doesn't apply to ours.		Same with your picture there. A bank can create a loan & matching demand deposit of $90 on its own if it finds any credit-worthy borrower willing to sign their name on that loan at the interest rate offered. The $90 doesn't have to "come from" anyone's $100. If the bank literally doesn't have the reserves to exchange for cash, they borrow it from the central bank at a lower rate than they're lending the $90.

{"body":"> Actually the provision that let them merge probably saved the economy. 		They dumped the cost onto the public. The only reason the housing market went under is the Republicans forced Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to go public (and thus charge higher interest on the poor), and the relaxing of Glass/Stegal combined with the Credit Default Swaps meant banks were bundling loans with insurance, treating those as deposits, betting the value on the CDS market and then another bank would bundle this "value" with insurance and repeat the process.		The housing market only defaulted a few more points even with the predatory loans on credit poor homeowners -- the problem was over leveraging.		And yes, the Ratings system was wrong because Flagstar and Countrywide were lying, (and we were told by Right-Wing media this was because of anti-redlinging laws but of course those don't apply and with smaller banks who bundled the loans and sold them), while Chase and other banks took the loans knew they were sub prime -- then the Bonds rating agencies were giving AA rated bonds to their clients, making more money on consulting than ratings so they were lying. Meanwhile the mortgage backers were not covering their insurance policies so there wasn't any liquidity to cover the PMI on mortgages because otherwise, banks aren't too hurt by a loan default.		So no, mergers do NOT make these banks more stable -- it just means they can have more influence to overleverage and make the problem worse, and then force congress to have the public pay for it.

{"body":"Honestly, I don't see unemployment due to automation as a long term problem.  It's an short term problem.  It's just an extremely bad short term problem.		The thing about automation is that it drives down cost of production.  As cost of production goes to zero, the price of goods gets cheaper and cheaper.		In an **ideal setup** with automation, clothing, food, housing, and transportation would cost almost nothing because production costs are so low.  Even poor people would be pretty well off.  Riches would be for the purchase of luxury goods.  People would be able to support themselves working 15-20 hours a week, doing operator jobs (if unskilled) or specialized skilled jobs (IT, programming, plumbing, design/drafting, etc).  Even working part time, you'd be able to afford all your basics- a place to live, internet, food, and transportation, because everything that is mass produced would be cheap.  Used goods would be particularly cheap.   Unemployment wouldn't be an issue because "full time" would become 15 or 20 hours a week and thus there'd be a lot more jobs available.		Luxury goods would exist for people with money, of course.  High end products or items produced in low quantities or hand-made items would be so expensive (comparatively) that your average person would not be able to buy them.   Unskilled people would have no problems with food, transportation, living costs, etc, but they wouldn't be able to buy high margin products or low-production goods, or go on vacations- but they'd only have to work part time.  Skilled tradesmen would make (comparatively) a ton of money and could buy their higher end cars and computers that are produced in lower quantities.		This is, however, long-term.  The problem is the **growing pains in getting there**.  Jobs will be lost faster than prices drop, so you'll see more and more unemployment.  Non-progressive countries like the US won't institute either basic incomes or lower the legal requirements of full time jobs, so you'll see a huge rise in unemployment until it gets so bad things get restructured.    One of the biggest problems is the barrier to entry to going to college in the US.  It should be subsidized or at cost like in other countries because it actually increases our economic output to have skilled people.		Automation will result in an overall improvement long-term for everyone (assuming we don't destroy the environment in the process), but a huge problem short term as it disrupts our current economic framework.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NPPraxis","name":"t1_cpblbi0","parent_id":"t1_cpbjo07","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1426097825,"created_utc":1426094225}

{"body":"Because humans have yet to experience how true AI will impact society, let alone understand the nuances of algorithms, let alone conceptualize what it will do to jobs in the next 30-50 years. This isn't like horses being replaced by steam engines or cars. Nor is it  tractors making farming more efficient and abundant for all. Tell me where there is rule of economics that says better technology makes more, better jobs for horses. Sounds absurd right? But swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right. 		No... what we're about to experience is entirely different.		**Physical Labor.** 		Newer supermarkets, what used to be 30 humans is now one human overseeing 30 cashier bots. And what about the hundreds of thousands fast fast food employees and baristas? there'a robot coming for your job. Sure I love my coffee made from a french press and hand but millions more don't care because they're limited by time and don't have time to sit in a barista and read the morning news for an hour, so they need their coffee now and want it good. This isn't science fiction, it's already happening now. As a corporate CEO, I'd be salivating at the thought of removing one-third additional labor cost to impress the investors at the next quarterly report. 		**Transportation**		Truck drivers, taxi cab drivers, all of them are under threat of automated cars within the next decade, and that's 3 millions jobs in the United States and world wide roughly 70 million. Google's self-driving car has already succesfully clocked [700,000 accident free miles](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/181508-googles-self-driving-car-passes-700000-accident-free-miles-can-now-avoid-cyclists-stop-for-trains) and they're striving to get a working model by 2018. What this means for corporations in the long term is the negation of human error: Less accidents. Insurance costs goes down. Efficiency goes up. Careless mistakes goes down. It's a boon. Insurance companies love this idea because their perfect driver are the ones who pays their small premium but never gets into an accident. Pay attention to this industry because it is going to be the first to really change society. Look no further than the controversy surrounding cab drivers and Uber, that's just the beginning.		**White Collar**		Software is much cheaper than hardware and we're seeing so many advances in terms of algorithms, operating systems, coding, 3d visualization, the list goes on and on. These jobs are typically more expensive to corporations, so their incentive to automate that job is much greater than a low skilled job. And that is what programmers do in one sense, they simplify jobs through software which impact our lives on a day to day basis, you know the saying, "there's an app for that" damn straight there is. Another example is the stock market which, in many ways, is no longer a human endeavor. It's highly accurate and sophisticated programs that trade stocks, trading stocks with other programs that teach themselves. The programs are the ones making the decision and what to buy and sell on their own and as a result every time you're watching *insert your favorite financial news show* it looks like Neo's wet dream of his server room.		They're even learning how to write. If you've picked up a newspaper lately you've probably already read a story written by a program. There are companies that are [teaching programs to write anything](http://www.narrativescience.com/quill): Sports stories, TPS reports, even say, those quarterly reports that you write at work. And guess what jobs are listed in this category: Paper work, decision making, and even social information gathering. Imagine what this same type of software will look like 15 years from now.		**Professions**		Talk to any lawyer and they'll say discovery has has always been a hated part of their job because of the copious amounts of paperwork and time it requires to sift through and analyze all of the relevant information pertaining to their case. And that also requires human labor. But for many firms now, there are research programs that easily navigate through millions of emails, memos in hours, not days or weeks. Then we have Watson: nevermind the fact he Ray Rice'd humans at Jeopardy, the implications *he* (to not offend Watson when he turns psycho on humans) will have on jobs will impact everything. It's getting to the point where Google Fu'ing a medical diagnosis has improved dramatically in the last decade, almost to the point when you go to the doctor, it's quite common to know more about medical nature of your condition than they do, and I've personally experienced this myself more than I would care to admit sadly. 		But is that a bad thing? I would argue this will be an immense tool for doctors who need access to the latest scientific publications from North Korea and have it assimilated, analyzed, and processed through Watson in a digestible form within a couple hours, instead of having to wait 6 months for it to appear on the latest Scientific America Journal. But also being able to keep track of patients not just locally, but also world-wide is already ubiquitous with influential people with deep pockets, but I digress. Watson obviously has a long ways to go and he'll be prone to errors, but all *he* has to do is do it better than a human. The same with cars, all it has to do is prove that it will cause less accidents, learn and minimize its mistakes, free up congestion on highways, decrease the carbon footprint automobiles have on the eco-system. 		**Innovation**		I used to think creative design jobs could never be replaced because our brain is the most complicated machine in the 616 universe, but that won't stop humans from reverse engineering it. The caveat is there are such a small and marginalized number of poets and writers out there due it's highly competitive and arbitrary nature and they only represent a fraction of the labor force. There is [music currently being written by virtual composers](http://arstechnica.com/science/2009/09/virtual-composer-makes-beautiful-musicand-stirs-controversy/) which during a blind test, people couldn't tell the difference between human composers nor robot based counterpart. But I would argue though creativity will be the most challenging part of AI to master, but I'm constantly seeing technological updates that make me question that.		**I AM A MEAT POPSICLE**		We can continue to ignore the technological breakthroughs and we can easily dismiss this revolution for the same as all the others, but at the current trajectory we're heading towards, and there's nothing to indicate it's not stopping, we're fully creating an unemployable society. Technology in the last 20 years has exponentially increased so fast, that what was once science fiction and conspiracy theories is already ubiquitous in our society. It's difficult for the layman what exponential really means, so I'll use this analogy: Take a person living in 96 B.C. and throw him 1000 years into the future in the same place and there's a good chance he'll be able to function in that society with his current skill-set, albeit with some language difficulty of course. Then take someone living in 1400 A.D. France and put him somewhere in the middle of the 19th century and same country, then  things become exceedingly challenging from his narrow point of view: new continents have been discovered, the printing press, more complicated politics and social structures, not to mention the medical and scientific breakthroughs. His situation becomes tenuous at best and his future uncertain with so many concepts that he can barely fathom. But since they're still speaking French, he'll slowly assimilate to this new culture, but chances are he'll be able to negotiate his way into a low skill hard labor job, so it doesn't matter if he doesn't know how to write yet. Hell, he even still might get laid.		Consider now an American from 1900 and throw put him in today's society. Between that time we split the atom, made TV sets, developed microprocessors, mapped our genetic code, able to create 3d worlds through cgi, nano-tech, bio-tech, Google, and fucking black holes dog. He simply cannot process all of this information because for the average American today assimilates more information in one week than he probably would in 30 years. Whatever skill he possesses has long since been outmoded and outdated, The culture is infinitely more complex and dangerous I might add, he'll easily be labelled a crazy person and thrown in a mental hospital or worse, shot by a Albuquerque police officer. I would argue his chances of being shot are more likely, statistically speaking. Nevermind being a functional member of society at this point. 		The pace at which technology has increased so much it has outpaced our humanity, and we have to start admitting to ourselves that automation  is inevitable. By default technology is neutral and this is a good thing because it frees humans to explore their own happiness and creative endeavors so we want more unemployment. And that is where the problem lies, while we should be embracing this idea of unemployment it cannot co-exist under the rules of Capitalism, not while robots are making humans irrelevant in the work force. So we desperately need to have a *realistic* conversation how to handle massive populations of unemployed humans in the future, but there's nothing to indicate, to me at least, that we'll be able to address millions of unemployed humans under this current system... except^maybe^through^basic^income?		**But hey if you want me to be blunt... my silly Elysium scenario is much more in the realm of *plausible reality* than your silly [sun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/) scenario.**","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"S_K_I","name":"t1_cpbxts5","parent_id":"t1_cpbo5gz","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1426116666,"created_utc":1426113066}

Sorry, but it actually sounds like you're trying to have a conversation about a topic in which you're only well-versed in political talking points.  Evidence...		> These banks are hiding taxable funds and **laundering billions in drug money** with no more than a slap on their wrist. 		This represents a complete misunderstanding about the intricacies of the money laundering cases (HSBC).  **HSBC did not launder money.**  HSBC failed to employ a Bank Secrecy Act program that was sufficient to identify suspicious activity (such as money laundering). They had been given numerous, repeated warnings about the insufficiency of their program. They had formal documents issued (big no no in banking) against them, yet they still failed to act.  The regulators escalated the fine to a historic amount to punish HSBC for their ignoring a law or regulation (12 CFR 21.21).  		Think of it this way:  HSBC is to Money Laundering, as a Clerk who doesn't check for ID on alcohol sales is to a kid who gets drunk illegally. 		>  the fact that the main argument for large banks is more money seems somewhat shallow because it's what is being done with that money that is important to me.		This is not at ALL the argument for large banks.  Large banks, believe it or not, offer benefits to society that small, community banks lag on.  Large banks were the first to roll out mobile banking, atm deposits, etc. They have funds management capabilities for businesses almost as a matter of policy, where as small banks typically can't handle that level of risk.   		They also provide institutional financing for thousands of large businesses...like Fortune 500 companies and the like.  A lot of these companies will need working capital from time to time. Large banks have a legal lending limit, especially when pooling via participation, that can meet the needs of these massive corporations.  It would literally take 100's of community banks to coordinate to offer that same service, and even then they wouldn't have the expertise to facilitate such a deal. 		edit: I love it when I present what should be seen as a highly informed opinion about the industry and people downvote me.

You can easily get a measurement of diversification by comparing an amount invested into one entity against the entirety of your assets, as you have stated many times.

Going back to the original statistic, comparing the size of a country's risk to that country's GDP is a reasonable way to assess whether the level of diversification is appropriate for the country.

Feminists talk about sexism as being institutionalized, and it's at this point that statisticians close their ears and turn away.		It's absolutely true that men and women are in different jobs. While there are a lot of jobs that are evenly divided, many others have much larger splits - 75/25 or even 90/10 or higher.		Women tend to occupy jobs that have lower salaries.		But doesn't that also mean that jobs with women have lower salaries?		While women can gain prestige and power by entering male-dominated fields, it's also true that women's involvement in certain fields lowers the prestige of those fields. It likely depends on how, why, and when the gender shift in certain fields occurs.		I wrote about this awhile back, I don't have the time to dig up the links, so the proof is in the google.		Before World War I, being a bookkeeper was a low-career rung for the aspiring businessman. It had a great deal of upward mobility. But when the men went off to war and women started filling up jobs, including that of a bookkeeper, there was little upward mobility for them. When the men came back, bookkeeping remained a female-dominated job . . . one that was outside the career path of business person and instead being a low-paying, low-advancement job.		Similarly, when computer science first started to emerge, women made up half or more of the employees working in the field. But once computer science and programming started to become seen as "hard" and as prestigious or valuable to the advancement of society . . . women were nudged out of it and it became male-dominated.		On an unrelated note, here[1] is an article on a time when women were perceived as wanting sex more than men. Their position as second class never changed, only the reasons for why they belonged there.	All of that aside:		Why do men and women go into different occupations?		Some might say biotruths; feminists will say patriarchy.		Little girls are raised with low expectations. They're told to aspire to be nurses, not doctors. They're nudged toward pursuing educations and careers that are lower status and lower paying. STEM fields create a hostile environment for women, setting up additional challenges.

We've jumped from the field of facts to the field of opinion. Who decided that female involvement in a field lowers the prestige of a field? Are Ph.D. degrees any less prestigious now that women make up a [majority of awarded degrees](http://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2012-for-4th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-141-to-100/)?

Is being an astronaut any less prestigious because of female participation?		I'll add my own *opinion*, now. Fields with less prestige are filled with women not because women flock to them, nor because female participation lowers their prestige, but because men flock *away* from them. With low male participation, you end up with higher female participation, by default. Men choose jobs like nurses and secretaries less because there is **strong** cultural and societal pressure to be a high achiever--to make a lot of money, to be upwardly mobile, and to gain prestige and influence. Society shuns and deems as failures, to an extent, men who are not strong--whether it be in the social life, professional life, or personal life.

{"body":">Families should plan ahead for having children, that was the WHOOOOOLE philosophy behind planned parenthood. Such as, saving money, making sure the place you work will provide maternity leave, understanding what it takes to raise a child.		Many families do plan ahead, but there are many circumstances that do not allow them to go ahead with their plans. Time and money are two of those circumstances and are often intertwined.		My wife and I are both studying to get our Ph.D.'s, but in the meantime we are both broke as hell. When we both get our degrees and have jobs we will both be close to 30 years old. That doesn't leave us much time to save up money (not to mention paying off student loans) before my wife starts moving into the high risk pregnancy part of her life. As a result we won't be able to be super picky about an employer who has great benefits either. At the end of the day my wife doesn't want to be exempt from working just because we want to have a kid, she just wants to know she will have job security.		I know my example is specific to myself, but there are plenty of people out there want to have kids but can't due to a variety of circumstances. The last thing people want is to have to choose between work and a family. 		Lastly, as an employer, would you mind explaining to me how almost every other first world country out there manages to provide guaranteed paid maternity leave and still have thriving businesses? What is so scary about providing that option to your employees?","depth":7,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Exnihilation","name":"t1_cpbt7oa","parent_id":"t1_cpbsies","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1426109726,"created_utc":1426106126}
{"body":"Because most other first world countries are federalist republics/socialist republics, meaning that government plays a much bigger role in their lives.  As Americans we have a limited government, though it's still federalist republic/democratic republic, we've created a more limited government.  Now, don't get me wrong, I think reallocating funds to be more compassionate towards parents/families would be a good thing, but that's not how it works.  A lot of people are also afraid to have government too intertwined with healthcare, not just republicans mind you.  Americans do not like our government in our business, which is easy to tell because of the outrage people have(despite the apparent complacency) about government going through our personal information.  But it boils down to dollars and cents, I cannot afford it.  Most small business cannot afford to do things like that.  Those countries have federal regulations regarding those things and in turn taxes are MUCH MUCH higher.		If you are both Ph.D. Candidates in an even remotely lucrative field then I doubt you'll have any difficulty finding an employer who would give you time off for that.  That said, you've made a HUGE life choice by pursuing a Ph.D., making that choice prioritizes your field of work/study over things like children.  I think it's perfectly fair and logical for both of you to realize that pursuing a career will get in the way of raising children.  If both of you are working high end jobs, will you even have time to raise a child after you have it?  Is that the way you want a child to live?  I'm not judging you but I'm pointing out that there's a choice made, and you can't have everything you want, that's part of life.  If you have children, one of you will have to take a hit in pay and work less hours.

However, those businesses proved to not be a problem during the financial crisis. Not saying they won't be in the future. 		>had invested depositor's money into very-risky "no risk" assets, such as CDS.		Glass Steagall would not have prohibited such behavior - banks were permitted to purchase government (including agencies like Freddie and Frannie) and investment grade securities for proprietary accounts.

But on the other hand, banking is now a worldwide business. Banks aren't only competing locally or nationally, they're competing internationally as well. We have foreign bank presences in the US (BBVA Compass is the first to come to mind) that are competing for loans and deposits with our domestic banks. Larger banks can afford a smaller spread on their loans (because of the volume of loans they can make), meaning they can generally always undercut a smaller bank.

Yes it is something companies aim to do but it's part of a bigger thing called Rent Seeking.  Monopolies are part of Rent Seeking.  It takes regulations to stop them.		No it takes competition to stop monopolies. Writing a law that makes monopolies illegal is not the same as taking actions that allow competition to flourish. Through rent-seeking, companies must seek the help of the govt to turn themselves into monopolies. Without influencing politics and regulatory bodies it is near impossible to control 100% of the market for an extended period of time.

Of course these companies don't WANT to compete. Competition is hard on the competitors, but leads to good results for us, the consumers. But again you're ignoring what CAUSED Cox, Comcast, and TWC to get so big in the first place. Do you know when the govt first began regulating the cable industry? It was in the 1960s and it was done in an attempt to stifle cable providers and protect the existing broadcast networks. But the cause of these companies becoming so huge today is largely from their interactions with local govts. The local govts decide who gets to run cables in which areas, and which players get to build their networks. With the localities picking who can participate in the market and who can't, there is a natural push for a system of kickbacks, with one cable provider getting the sweetheart deal over the others. Now with the go ahead from the govt, the cable company can charge whatever fees they want because they don't have to worry about a competitor offering a lower rate than them.		>The government is not stopping them.  They do not want to compete.  In fact Comcast wants to buy Time Warner.  why?  They make more and more money and they will not have any real competition.  		Yah, obviously. Buying competitors is easier than competing. But whats even cheaper than acquiring a competitor is getting in bed with the govt. Why would they do that? Because the govt helps them achieve there goals of reducing competition in their industry through burdensome regulations that they design, and sweetheart deals that would not be found in a truly competitive market.		>It sounds like you are yet another government hater and you will do all you can to put all the responsibility for all that is wrong with the world on the government.  		I'm not saying that private companies aren't bad actors sometimes. People do bad things whether they're in govt or not. But you have to follow the trail of influence to its logical conclusion. It starts with the companies, but it always ends with the govt.		>Bankers and the ultra rich love people like you.  It make their job so much easer.		Ha, uh no. They like idiots like you who demand more govt intervention and more control over industry. You're playing right into their hand and the end result is good for the existing players in charge. You just said that companies hate competition, and I'm telling you I am adamantly in favor of competition in every market.

But it's never the ultra riches' fault.  They can do anything they want with their money.  it's just the government fault. 		I'm not saying they don't create an incentive for politicians to become corrupt. They absolutely do. But its up to the politicians to do what's good for the people who elected them. But politicians are just as greedy and self-serving as these rich CEOs (which is why I don't think they should have such power to affect enterprise in such an overbearing way). So why do you think they are not as much to blame? 		>How many more millions / billion can they pump into the system to get exactly who they want in government?   But again it's not their fault. They just want more and more.  It's not like greed has any issues. 		People have a right to spend their money any way they wish. If a corporation spends money on politics, it better be in a way that benefits the shareholders or they're going to lose investors.

An example of bad regulations and laws.  Yes those are out there like I have stated.

For Comcast to do that they have to get the government to agree to let them buy their competition.

Until recently they stopped doing that.  		> reducing competition in their industry through burdensome regulations that they design		Again you think all regulations are regulatory capture.

Its not a bad thing to want to be the biggest and best in a competition." - you from an earlier comment. 		So being the biggest is not being a bad actor?  It's nice you put in the best in a competition but to be the real best one needs no competition.   See the best is the company that makes the highest profits.  It's not about customers.  That's not what the free market is.  It's about higher and higher profits.  It's called the profit motive.   It's not called the be the best motive.  It's the profit motive.   Removing competition does that. 		The phone companies tried to do it to the cable companies by keeping them off their telephone polls and the cable companies try to do it by size.  No new player can come in.  If they do the cable companies just drop their price in that one area and unless that company can spend billions and take a loss most of that time they will lose.  		Google is the one exception and that's because they are also content and they have to do it.  If they do not and the cable companies are allowed to be unregulated they will also lose large amount of money to fast / slow lane.  The cable companies will squeeze all content providers because they can.  Don't like it consumer?  Who cares.  Go else where.   Oh wait there is no real other choices.		Google knows that that's why they are rolling out their own cable.  		AT&T stopped rolling out FIOS.  It stopped about 2 years ago.  Why?  They where still making a profit but the cost was cutting into their profit.  Profits where not high enough.  		Here's a really good book on the subject.

{"body":"I understand that the concept of banks being "too big to fail" is not ideal from the perspective of the US government bailing them out, but are there not many benefits to banks being large, and a natural selection towards large banks?		It seems to me like there would be many benefits to having few large banks as opposed to many smaller banks. Economies of scale would presumably allow for cheaper banking, and the larger the asset pool of a bank, the more they could spread out the risk of the loans they make. Additionally larger banks with larger assets would be able to spend more money on infrastructure like ATMs, faster transaction processing systems, mobile banking, etc.		On another note, isn't it the natural tendency of markets to produce fewer large companies than many small companies. Even if we split these banks that are "too big to fail" into many small banks, it seems like we would eventually end up back in the same situation. Some of the banks that are split out are naturally going to be better than others, people will deposit at those banks, and they will grow again. For example if Google was too big to fail, and was eliminated from the market, the next runner up would just pick up the market share and then become too big to fail itself.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"almondmuncher","name":"t1_cpc4h5q","parent_id":"t3_2yoe4z","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1426129116,"created_utc":1426125516}

Aside from your misguided "fuck Wall Street corporate thugs" wannabe-socialist rhetoric, I will bet you have absolutely nothing of empirical substance that can convince someone why breaking up the bulge bracket firms will do any good in the short and long runs. 		Banking is the foundation of our economy:  fledgling firms have an idea but they need capital, they go to an investment bank.  Banks attract capital through roadshows to facilitate an IPO.  Company achieves funding, inside shareholders gain in the short term, and history tells us that retail investors like you and I gain in the long run.  Who loses?

The fact is that asset bubbles are the biggest threat to the domestic and global economy.  They are the real enemy, not big banks.  Banks (now) contribute very little to spurring these bubbles, rather it's investor sentiment that is the real driving force.  Breaking up big banks will not stop asset bubbles now, or ever.

Somehow they get us to play off of one another into thinking the other side is the reason why we can't do it and we use that as an excuse why we didn't pull it off.  The real reason we didn't pull it off is because we didn't try.		If you are very lassie-fair about economics then you view the banks as a cartel propped up by government regulation and the federal reserve.  If you are liberal you hate the banks for reasons I have never fully heard articulated... they have money...		Part of the issue is that you do need institutions to replace them.  Purposely crashing the banking sector and leaving in regulations that shape that business model to be the go to for all financial services is just irresponsible.		We need to first nurture, and first allow, more diversity in consumer level financial services.  We need an environment where many more credit unions pop up on their own and credit unions have less regulation so they can chase any new need that shows up in the market when the market is changed after breaking up the banks.

The total assets in a country is a heck of a lot higher than than its GDP, and many of the banks' assets are in other countries. Still, two things are true: "The U.S. banking sector is really big relative to the economy (off the top of my head, probably only beaten by Switzerland, once-upon-a-time Iceland, and possibly UK)." and "The biggest banks in the world are really, really big".	- When the banking sector in a country becomes really big relative to the economy, you risk ending up in a situation where the country can't afford to bail them out. This is less of a concern for the U.S. since the Dollar is so dominant, so the U.S. can pretty much print their way out of many issues. It's a huge concern for Switzerland.	- When individual banks get really big, we end up with "Too Big To Fail" problems where we might be forced to bail them out when they fuck up.

{"body":"While smaller banks can bid on the troubled assets in bankruptcy court, the whole process takes time. That's why I was reluctantly in favor of the bail outs in 2009. The people who are immediately harmed by a bank failure are it's customers. If someone like Wells Fargo had gone bankrupt, everyone who had any sort of deposit account with them would have their money frozen until things got sorted out by the FDIC and the court system. Until then, how are those people supposed to pay for their groceries or other living expenses? How are businesses who used Wells Fargo as a clearing house supposed to take payments for their goods/services? While idealistically I think it's totally wrong that any business should be "too big to fail", when you have a bank so intertwined in every aspect of the economy, allowing it to fail would cause a ripple effect that would do more harm than simply saving the bank and figuring out how to better regulate it in the future. I think where the bailouts failed though is that numerous executives and managers were allowed to keep their jobs and didn't face any civil or criminal charges for their actions.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dcampa93","name":"t1_cpbktbh","parent_id":"t1_cpbhmj8","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1426097037,"created_utc":1426093437}
{"body":"Bankruptcy courts could EASILY make allowances for smaller accounts and even larger accounts.		When Roosevelt declared the Banking Holiday in the 1930s, credit arose immediately through the use of trade receivables and other "non-banking" activities.		As far as the liability side goes, with FDIC insurance and a bankruptcy administrator the small user can easily be protected.		Clearing house transactions can be accomplished through competitors to ACH, etc. Many large banks already clear outside the Fed and ACH because of participation agreements.		The idea of "too big to fail" is ridiculous and some failures will certainly add discipline to the system.		The major players on the deposit side are money market issuers and receipts depositors who can easily "spread the wealth" of their business activities among additional institutions and while this will raise costs a bit it will also distribute safety.		Many many many of the "executives" did not face charges because NO LAWS were broken.
