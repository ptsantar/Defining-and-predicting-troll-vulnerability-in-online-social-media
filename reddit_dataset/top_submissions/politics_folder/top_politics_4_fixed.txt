So what I was thinking was pretty simplistic, but at this point, and since people want to get involved, I think we can put something really cool together. I'm going to put together some requirements and map out how this would work.

This ruling was frequently characterized as permitting corporations and unions to donate to political campaigns, or as removing limits on how much a donor can contribute to a campaign. However, these claims are incorrect, as the ruling did not affect the 1907 Tillman Act's ban on corporate campaign donations (as the Court noted explicitly in its decision), nor the prohibition on foreign corporate donations to American campaigns, nor did it concern campaign contribution limits. The *Citizens United* decision did not disturb prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates, and it did not address whether the government could regulate contributions to groups that make independent expenditures. The *Citizens United* ruling did however remove the previous ban on corporations and organizations using their treasury funds for direct advocacy.

{"body":"Reserve requirements which you're describing are an old artifact from the days of the gold standard. They are completely meaningless in reducing bank risk or as a capital buffer because bank lending is **not constrained by the amount of deposits**, as there are other sources of financing such as the central bank. Neither does the amount of deposits determine the risks the bank is facing. The risk is mainly determined by what kind of assets the bank has, for example how risky the loans it gives out are. The only reason reserve requirements are still used in the US is to make overnight lending at the Federal reserve easier, though it's being phased out too.		In today's world we're concerned with capital requirements. While reserve requirements means you hold a certain percentage of your deposits as cash or cash equivalents at the central bank, capital requirements refer to having enough risk capital (equity capital) to absorb losses. Once risk capital goes to zero you're bankrupt, going to the central bank for loans will not help you. Hence it's crucial to have enough of it.		The Basel rules force you to hold risk capital relative to your risks. The issue thus far has been to correctly calculate these risks. In the subprime crisis the risks of MBS CDO's were horribly underestimated and almost no risk capital was held against them as protection.		Another way of putting this is that in today's banking world we want a bank to have enough shareholder money to take the hit of market turbulence.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fluffiebunnie","name":"t1_csxo6ot","parent_id":"t1_csxmoej","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436469333,"created_utc":1436465733}

It's pretty clear you have no notion of how finance works. The fact that Swap notionals exceed the money stock is a meaningless metric. The value of all the Swaps in the world cancel out each other, meaning they have a total net value of zero. The huge swap numbers you see mentioned are essentially multipliers, not actual wealth.		As a simplified example: a Euro-US dollar currency swap with a notional of $1 000 000 generally has a value of $0 at outset. If the Euro goes up against the dollar by 2%, one party has a gain of $20 000 and the other has a loss of -$20 000. These sums are pretty small and they cancel out each other.

This means that the health insurance companies do compete to a degree, but at the corporate level and not the consumer level.		The result of this is that there is no incentive at either the medical level or the insurance level to keep costs down; you get sick, you go to the doctor without much choice and the doctor charges what the doctor charges and it gets paid by the insurance company and what the insurance company won't pay they bill you for.

Modern risk management rules such as the new Basel rules address issue directly by forcing banks to hold capital reserves relative to the risk they're taking.

Of course the models of these rules could still be a lot better, but they're constantly evolving. Glass-Steagall is hopelessly outdated.

As to which side of the conglomerated bank a trading loss is booked in is simply an accounting technique, an intercompany ledger. It's an indisputable fact that segregated depository institutions would not have been exposed to the risk, nor would the amount of risk be leveraged by using the deposit base. Also, they would not have been rescued or TARPed, as they would not be credit parties to these investment and speculative transactions. Additionally,  the Glass Steagall repeal was supposed to bring the banking and credit costs down, while it achieved just the opposite, where banks now need to keep higher liquidity via BASEL requirements. Bank were made to become parts of these systemic risk fault lines, but they didn't have to be. Certainly, the entire crisis may not have been avoided, as we cannot legislate prudent activity in the inherently risky investment brokerage houses, but banks did not have to be held hostage to the risky derivatives trading which would have limited the scope of the fallout and required zero bailouts. One could further argue that would have minimized the scope of the crisis itself. I am speaking from the trenches as a treasurer for one of the multinationals.

It is clearly very important to ensure adequate regulation exists to prevent another crash stemming from terrible risk management. A lot of regulation - both global and national - has been/is being implemented to do exactly that.		But that need for regulation doesn't mean that *all* regulation is correct, intelligent, or helpful.

As a bit of background for my opinion on this, I worked in whole bank risk management for one of Canada's largest banks during 2010. Canada's large banks are **all** combined investment/commercial banks. None of them collapsed or had to be bailed out during the crash. Why? Because being a combined bank is not an indicator of risk.

{"body":"I've seen this before. It is an extremely poorly argued piece. This "causality" is effectively an article-length version of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. The core of the bad argument is here:		>In 1999, Democrats led by President Bill Clinton and Republicans led by Sen. Phil Gramm joined forces to repeal Glass-Steagall at the behest of the big banks. What happened over the next eight years was an almost exact replay of the Roaring Twenties. Once again, banks originated fraudulent loans and once again they sold them to their customers in the form of securities. The bubble peaked in 2007 and collapsed in 2008. The hard-earned knowledge of 1933 had been lost in the arrogance of 1999.		To support the thesis beyond the bare fallacious argument he makes at the core, the author provides some atrociously bad other supporting arguments:		>One bank supporter says you cannot blame banks for fraudulent loan originations because that was done by unscrupulous mortgage brokers. This is nonsense. The brokers would not have been able to fund the loans in the first place if the banks had not been buying their production.		This has nothing to do with G-S. Banks were free to buy mortgage-backed securities before G-S was repealed.		>Yet another big bank spokesman says that nonbanks such as Lehman and Bear Stearns were more to blame for the crisis. This ignores the fact that nonbanks get their funding from banks in the form of mortgages, repurchase agreements, and lines of credit. Without the big banks providing easy credit on bad collateral like structured products, the nonbanks would not have been able to leverage themselves.		Banks providing easy credit to banks based on balance sheets full of toxic securities was absolutely a key problem in the financial crisis. It was also in no way enabled by the G-S repeal.		Do you see a pattern here? He's not wrong about some of the causes, but he is absolutely wrong that those causes were enabled by the repeal of G-S.		The most incredibly inaccurate thing he says:		>Yet, the fact that there were so many parties to blame should not be used to deflect blame from the most responsible parties of all???the big banks.		The big banks were absolutely not the most responsible parties.

{"body":"Here's a thought...think of regulation a bit like gun-control.  Past a certain point you are only hurting the law abiding.  The criminals who want guns will get guns and the average law-abiding civilian is the one who suffers for the regulation  So instead we have a system that says "show us you can be trusted with a gun and we will let you have a gun...but do something wrong with a gun and you are held responsible"  For most responsible citizens, that works and we lock up the rest.		Think of financial regulation in similar fashion. We have a lot of people whose job is to make money and the more they make, the more they get paid...and then we create a regulation that says "see this way of making money?  don't do that!" and most of them are going to be tempted to push the line as much as they can and some will work to go over the line and not get caught.  What if instead, regulation was not based on "don't do that thing you want to do"  but instead based on "you can do that if nobody gets hurt....for which you will _personally_ be held responsible" and then enforcement instead of being cat and mouse of who is doing what they shouldn't be doing becomes a matter of "show us that you are taking adequate and appropriate or responsibility for the lives of the people whose money is at stake, or we take away your license to operate".  So now the regulatory motivation moves from "don't do this thing you want to do" to "protect those who entrust their money to you"		It's just a rough sketch of some thoughts I had this morning but it's always seemed to me that we look at regulation through a lens of "how much is enough, how much is too much?" but you have a bunch of very smart people whose full time job is too figure out how to get the most they can within the system and around the system so piling "do not do" on top of "do not do" is an exercise in futility.  I've always felt that the answer to effective and socially conscious regulation was to turn regulation on its head and establish an environment where doing the profitable thing is _also_ doing the right thing and doing the wrong thing is unprofitable.

There were many failures that led the federal government to believe banks offered too many financial services/products.

The unintended consequence was the formation of Financial Holding Companies, firms that own multiple financial service providers. The GSA was then repealed in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, eliminating branching or service restrictions. (The branching restrictions of the 1927 McFadden Act were repealed in 1994 by the Reigle-Neal Act) Since the repeal in 1999, banks have been more efficient, rates on loans have decreased and rates on deposits have increased.

Look at the most recent housing crisis. Do you think the majority of the people who were given bad loans *knew* they were being given bad loans?

"Qualified" to the layman translates as "I can afford this," when in reality they really *couldn't* afford it, but the short-term gain for the company being able to sell the bad loan to someone else was more valuable to their profit margins than the long-term return of the interest on the mortgage. In this instance, the free market didn't work out all that great because financial institutions were taking advantage of consumer ignorance in combination with a lack of regulation to pull some seriously shady shit.

No, but enough to collectively matter. 		> they have all the guns and they tell me what rules they impose upon me		Unless they point those guns at you and tell you not to vote, or have a voice in our political process, then you are not really at their mercy. 		>Is collapsing todays corrupt system really all that bad? 		Every system is corruptible, and or corrupt to some extent. The only way to get out of something like that would be in a fantasy land, or maybe at some point in our future we weed out the genes for greed. But let's say we let the system fail, a lot of people would end up dead/starving, likely lead to war at some point, and or massive unrest. The system that replaces it, who's to say it will be any better? Given the concentration of power right now, I'd say it would be one of the absolute worse times to let a system fail because who are going to be the ones to rebuild it? The ones with the most power and resources right now, so it would almost certainly be built to benefit them, not us. 		>Have you seen the corporate corruption and rising income gap recently?		Yes, and I am for raising the minimum wage, tie it to inflation, and adjust for cost of living, etc. Hell I am for limiting CEO compensation to around 30x the lowest employee's salary. But these are things that would help the problem within the system we have now, and or change the system. Not completely rewrite it. Think of it like taking a wrecking ball to your home, then with the pieces that are left, maybe a few more that are laying around, you are tasked to rebuild it. Could it be better than it was before? Sure, but is it likely, or at least probable? Not a chance. 		The only logical path forward is find a way to reduce the banks risk reduce the size of the banks, break them up to where any one, or multitude of failures would not cause a financial collapse. A bill like this will not do it all on it's own, but it would be a decent step in the right direction.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lxlqlxl","name":"t1_csxq536","parent_id":"t1_csxpipd","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436472334,"created_utc":1436468734}

{"body":">If voting changed anything, then it would be made illegal.		That's an interesting way to look at things, and at times it seems like yeah that could be true, the reality however is that it's not. It's defeatist talk to allow for an excuse, to excuse yourself from the process and take a hands off approach, like hey you all are so fucked up, I can't do anything. Yet, that kind of thinking, leads to these kinds of problems. 		>Consider this, the voters of California made gay marriage illegal, yet now there is legalized gay marriage. Voting is meaningless.		Considering the whole thing was fucked with to hell and back by special interests, like the mormons, I think it was the right decision. The will of the many can't override the rights of the few. That's why we have a constitutional republic, not a true democracy. If we did have a true democracy, how long do you think something like slavery would have lasted? 		>Do you know what havoc the current minimum wage has on Puerto Rico? If you raise the minimum wage any more, you might as well shut down all employment there.		I think you missed a very important part of what I said.. "and adjust for cost of living". Meaning somewhere like NYC would be a higher minimum wage than say a small town in Kansas. So that completely obliterates any notion of the minimum wage effecting a place like Puerto Rico. 		Now with Puerto Rico in mind. The issues they are facing are not necessarily minimum wage related, meaning it's the problem. Their economy is shifting to allow for the higher wages. Also an economy that large can't just shut down, it will just morph into something different, be it good or bad. Some jobs, and or a lot of jobs that were profitable no longer are, so they are lost, but the jobs that are, stay. A higher wage than that would likely result in more jobs shedding, and people leaving. What is left, would be more stable, and more money and investment will eventually start to come back. 		>Wasn't that the same thing that was said back in 2008? If the government had any intention of changing this, don't you think Obama would have done something?		Obama doesn't have some magic wand he can say well I want this this and this, and bam, it's done. Also the notion of the "super majority" was never really there, not like how conservatives like to claim at least. He had just enough political capital to get the ACA through anything more than that would have been tough as hell. Also even when they sort of had 60 votes, more than a few of those 60 were "democrats", but not really. Look up "blue dog" democrats. Mainly conservative, and or elected in conservative areas. No way would they have voted for anything that limited the banks.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lxlqlxl","name":"t1_csyb29v","parent_id":"t1_csxqizp","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436510340,"created_utc":1436506740}
{"body":"> the reality however is that it's not.  It's defeatist talk to allow for an excuse		I wouldn't call it defeatist, but realist and scientific. There have been studies done that show that our opinions (i.e. votes) doesn't change the behavior of the ruling elite. I think it's important to not count success for things that happened to coincide with what the elites wanted all along. For example, we wanted no iraq war or we wanted gitmo prison to close, but these are denied to us.		> Considering the whole thing was fucked with to hell and back by special interests, like the mormons, I think it was the right decision		Whether you agree with it or not is not the point, it was anti-democratic. If this was a presidential election decided by the courts (e.g. 2000 bush-gore), then people would be upset about it just the same. So the point is that a small group of elites are making decisions that are entirely outside of our control.		> If we did have a true democracy, how long do you think something like slavery would have lasted?		We still have slavery. Here is the 13th amendment:		* Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime**		So the change is that they create bogus, victimless crime laws and they still get slavery. Taxation is slavery by the simple reason that it's a crime not to pay tax.		So you're not truly against slavery, you're only against one particular form of slavery. In your support of government, you're decreasing one type, but enhancing another type.		> Meaning somewhere like NYC would be a higher minimum wage than say a small town in Kansas. So that completely obliterates any notion of the minimum wage effecting a place like Puerto Rico.		please explain your reasoning here. I suspect you are not exactly familair with what is happening in puerto rico. The cost of living there isn't high, it's actually low. So even with todays $8 federal minimum wage, people that have this rate live like kings. It's very expensive to hire anyone for this reason, because it's equivalent to paying a janitor/maid $100k in the US. If minimum wage is increased again, then janitor/maids will be making $200k. How does that make any sense to you? You're forcing businesses to pay employees extremely high salaries.		> A higher wage than that would likely result in more jobs shedding, and people leaving. What is left, would be more stable, and more money and investment will eventually start to come back.		Unemployment by the admitted official numbers is already 20% and the participation rate is only 40%. If you're admitting that jobs will be lost, then how do you figure making these numbers worse is good for anyone that lives there?		> Obama doesn't have some magic wand he can say well I want this this and this, and bam, it's done. 		Same thing for Sanders. Voting for him is not going to get you what you want, because the ruling elite have to want something before you can be allowed to have it.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aletoledo","name":"t1_csyhame","parent_id":"t1_csyb29v","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436533072,"created_utc":1436529472}
