{"body":"First bill, first evening is CLOSE GUANTANAMO that is breaking International Law and freakin' constitution.  FIRST DAY.  Yes, messing around.  Sure, lots of important legislation was put forth (bailing out the auto industry when on reflection they should've been forced in Chapter 11, bailing out Wall street instead of bailing out citizens like Iceland did, etc.), but when you control both the House and the Senate, you push through legislation you know would not succeed if you didn't have that level of control.  It isn't brain surgery.  		Guantanamo is still open not because Obama couldn't negotiate with Republicans, it was Democrats who turned down Obama's request for $80 million to close Guantanamo in 2009, because he wanted the prisoners tried in US courts and Democrats were concerned with that liability - that insufficient evidence would lead to their freedom, and returning to the battlefield they would kill soldiers, be identified and then the Democratic party would get the blame.  Obama should've negotiated better and earlier with his own party, and found a solution whereby his own party would support him. 		Then, when it comes to Obama negotiating with the Republican Party, he would mention in press conferences ahead of negotiations that he would meet them in the middle, and then the GOP would end up negotiating with his starting point in the middle, so invariably they got 75-80% of what they wanted.  Time and time again, it was infuriating.  That said, yes, the Republican Party is the worst and most ridiculous party in several generations, and I wouldn't be surprised if the party all but comes irrelevant until its completely destroyed and rebuilt to respect logic, science, and the majority of the constituents they are supposed to represent.		Where do I learn this stuff?  Reuters, AP, BBC, Al Jazeera, The Guardian, first hand sources - all either neutral, best available, or if anything, progressive/left-leaning.  I'm a socially liberal fiscal conservative who has never voted conservative/right-wing in his life, so you might want to check your compass. 		We're in agreement Rand Paul is a joke.  10% great, but then he'll go and destroy your hope by making some jackass statement as he always does (e.g. size of government has grown under Obama - it hasn't, life begins at conception, will tackle carve-outs but makes sure Kentucky gets its pork, etc.).  He is a walking contradiction who often believes some of the nonsense his party propaganda.  		As for your statement of people voting for candidates who have no chance... at some point people have to hold candidates accountable and break the status quo of mildly corrupt vs very corrupt.  People voted for change in 2008, they voted on faith for a first-term senator, and they didn't get it (real change).  Now they have a chance to vote for real change, because a certain candidate has decades of history of votes and public opinions to back up his words.  Surely the best time to do that is when the opposition party is the biggest joke it has been for decades.

We've filled up so many prisons with non-violent offenders that we're building prisons at a faster rate than schools or hospitals.

Our police forces now look more like a military force preparing for martial law. We've handed the authorities power to monitor everything from our phone calls to our location at every second.		We are now witnessing the synthetic overhaul of our drug industry and have no way of keeping up with the hundreds of new compounds currently being manufactured in China and shipped to stores everywhere offering people highly dubious but legal alternatives to substances with significantly less health risks.		We are actually at a point where we are starting to question state's rights to create their own legislation. We allow the Federal government to gloss over the hundreds of scientific research studies that underline significant medicinal value of cannabis and continue to let them call cannabis a schedule one substance even though more states currently have medical cannabis than don't at this point.		I can't even understand how we're still talking about this as a legitimate issue. In one cultural shit we can take care of our swollen prison population, eliminate many of the legal cases clogging our courts, curb a major cartel industry, relax relations between police and the public, allow for greater medical research, and provide a shift of an industry operating in the billions annually to finally become fully above-board so revenue from sales actually matriculates in to the economic system without the use of civil forfeitures and legal proceedings.

{"body":"**EDIT 1**		It should also be mentioned that, while pot is less harmful than many if not most other drugs, one can also build quite a dependency on it as well as a tolerance. This is EXTREMELY exacerbated by consistent concentrate use, and anyone that's convinced themselves that their need of, "even just," a couple dabs daily and that that is not extreme or that it is fine, is deceiving themselves. The fact that one may notice something like, "flowers just aren't doing it, I need a concentrated version," should be enough for them to say, "time for a T-break!" Seeing people CONSISTENTLY take excessive amounts of dabs and shit like that sickens me. It is simply irresponsible and shows a break in strength of character to allow oneself to be consumed with these things. Celebrating in excess annually is one thing, but using grams of oil per week is a problem.		This is referring to RECREATIONAL USE! If you're using CBD heavy concentrates or similar to treat illnesses, keep doing what you gotta do.		This is also where one can see actual physical withdrawal symptoms more often. Strong headaches, worse stomach pains (The endocannabinoid system in our gastrointestinal system is impacted more), and other pains are common. And while the processing of these concentrates is improving, many still only have access to improperly manufactured material that has unwanted chemicals in it, even if some like Butane are considered fairly safe to consumer by the FDA in small amounts, they cannot be better than just fresh air and a healthy diet, or even instead choosing to make edibles or vaporize flowers.		I was only 13 at the time looking for some excitement for my quickly approaching 14th birthday when I began to question all the propaganda that had been stuffed into my mind before then. I spent a good month or two researching it nearly every night before I even decided to give my friend some cash and asked him to purchase me some pot. 		I feel that, while I may have still started younger than I should have, I had a very good introduction to drugs because of this curiosity, for I was immediately introduced to ideas such as, one should moderate their use of ANY drug. I just got ahead of myself for my age. But, I am extremely thankful for the internet and the wealth of knowledge it provides!		**/EDIT 1**		I'm a huge advocate of pot, and I started smoking at a young age.		Well, there are good and bad things about exploring limits young.		I've seen the over-sheltered that don't know how to handle it, and as soon as mommy and daddy release their grip on the now adult, they instantly pick up a sexual/drug/violent/etc. addiction of some kind, it's very textbook. Look at the common societal reactions in rigid societies. It almost will always come out in people in a weird/addictive way if they are, "overly parented."		A person's desires must be tempered.		I wish I had tried pot at maybe 17 instead of 14, maybe even 18 or 19. 		**EDIT 2** 		I should add that not only did I try it at that age, I began using it more than experimentally since that age, and I have had several sporadic periods ranging from several months to a year or two of non use. 		My grades never suffered, but I cannot help but question it's consequences when I read (writings from pro-cannabis individuals/doctors/etc. mind you :P ) about the noticeable changes it seems to have on kids that use it consistently before fully developing. I never became socially anxious or experienced any huge setbacks or anything, but I do believe it had an impact on my development. It is hard to tell though, because maybe certain types of kids that may have matured just the same had they not used it excessively, are the ones that are more likely to try it at those ages, etc. 		But, again, I personally believe it does change a person going through a time in their lives where their bodies are trying to develop a balance of what chemicals, etc., are necessary, which are not needed. Also, that by taking ANYTHING in excess, these substances disrupt the body's development and it becomes a more permanent change than if they had used the same amount for the same duration, but later in life. 		**/EDIT 2**		I look at what is noticed about kids that smoke young and it's a lot of nodding on my end. I'm not fucked up, I'm not psychotic, etc. but I know it effected me and I wish I could go back to perfect my development at the time.		Human's bodies go though such a (naturally occurring in one's body) chemically heavy time developing during these years and one's body begins to, "cement," this balance, and I've seen so many examples of people taking various drugs during this time and see how it effects them permanently.

I cared about and opposed the anti-drug war in the US in the late '70s and early '80s, but was most concerned about nuclear weapons proliferation and the economy dependent on constant war. I and many others nonviolently blockaded nuclear bomb factories and research centers, and later in the '80s blockaded Federal buildings and weapons facilities and streets in big cities to call attention to the horrors that US military/economic policy was doing to Central Americans.		I suppose I got busted at least 50 times, and convicted a few times of infractions and misdemeanors, and spent maybe a total of eight months in jails at different times during the '80s.		In 1986 I sent a letter to the IRS Comissioner explaining that I could no longer in good conscience pay federal taxes until the US stopped producing nuclear weapons and waging war on poor people in other lands. Eventually, in the early 1990s, the goverment started garnisheeing the money from my paychecks (I worked as a contractor, thereby having responsibility for my pay rather than having it automatically deducted by an employer).		So I moved to Mexico, and have lived here ever since. The Mexican government sucks, but it only oppresses us here in Mexico, not the rest of the world. I would really be freaking out if I had to spend part of every day working for money to kill people in foreign lands.		So obviously I and the rest of my American nonviolent co-rebels of my generation failed and maybe I copped out by leaving rather than living without an honest income and perhaps resorting to violence to end the horrors the US government perpetrates.

{"body":"Economically he wants to remove the oligopoly of big banks by breaking them down, "If they're too big to fail they're too big to exist." Sanders also wants to close tax loopholes that the billionaire class has been using to avoid paying taxes because as he says if you want the benefits of being an American citizen you're going to have to pay you're taxes like everyone else. By introducing legislation to make college free he would remove the economic bar on higher education as well as the burden of college debts from much of the younger people in the middle class. A lot of his platform is about reducing strains on the middle class that were caused by the mistakes made by the billionaire class (government bailouts and avoiding taxes are the major examples).		Socially he is very liberal, pro choice and pro equality in regards to race, sexuality, and gender. He's never voted against equality in his 40 years in public office, something not many government officials can say. That said he is careful about legislation on gun control, he is a senator from Vermont after all, so he understands the importance of keeping guns legal, but regulated		Sanders foreign policy is all about aiding our allies in dealing with the problems in their region rather than have the United States be so directly involved. He voted against the failed war in Iraq back in 2001. He's said that our allies in the Middle East have to be the ones leading the fight against ISIS, not the US.		Those are some of his major stances on hot button issues but the truth is it's sanders voting record that's so important.

It literally doesn't matter.  Total discretionary spending is split between military Spending at $622 Billion, and all other spending at $508 Billion.  Rand wants to increase military spending by $76 Billion, which leaves $432 Billion, which is spread over Food and Agriculture, Transportation and Highways, Science, Energy, International Affairs, Housing, Veteran's Benefits, Medicare and health, and government.  We'll pretend he already cut the department of education, that's how he paid for his military increase.		But under his taxation plan, he's got $300 Billion less to play with, so he has to cover all other discretionary spending with just $132 Billion.

This is what I'm not understanding. Can you describe just this better for me? I understand if you ADDED this VAT that this would happen. But I don't understand how REPLACING our current corporate tax system and payroll taxes with this VAT creates a 14.5%. How does eliminating some taxes and adding 14.5% taxes create a 14.5% increase? That just doesn't make sense.		> Progressive taxation has a definition, it is a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases, how does that happen with this plan?		Rand's plan has two tax brackets. 0% for $0 to $15,000. And 14.5% for $15,000+. This creates an effective tax rate that continues to increase as income rises. JUST LIKE OUR SYSTEM NOW. It just doesn't have as many brackets and isn't as progressive. Our current system stops at a certain point.

And even if I'm somehow wrong, you should see what he said the deduction was. $25,000. That's wrong.

Current corporate tax rates are about 2.9%  So, just quick math says that companies will have to pay 11.6% more in taxes.  Which means that effectively he will create a VAT system, since they'll pass that onto consumers, so all your consumption, everything you buy, will now cost 11.6% more.		$23,442 * .116 = $2719 in potential new taxes.  You probably won't spend that, things subject to consumption tax typically make up between 30-60% of someone's expenditures, so best case, $815 in new taxes, though at that income level, more likely about $1300 in new taxes, since people making less than $50,000 spend a higher percentage of their income on consumables.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"floodcontrol","name":"t1_csln6to","parent_id":"t1_cslm1ji","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435523208,"created_utc":1435519608}

If he believed it were baby murder and not baby killing, he would actually be crazy since murder requires a component of illegality. It really doesn't matter when life begins; we already have exceptions for lawful killing, such as self-defense. And it furthermore does not matter if there is a consensus on when sentience emerges, so long as there is a consensus that an entity at a certain stage is not sentient. Personally, I'm a proponent of post-natal abortion. A child isn't really conscious until at least 6 months after birth.

It doesn't infringe on my freedoms in any substantial or meaningful way, and it empowers my government to protect me.		>We just had the supreme court rule it a natural right so nothing he can do about that even if he really wanted to.		Actually, they ruled it a Constitutionally protected fundamental right. Not a natural right. Natural law and natural rights are nonsense and always involve an appeal to a God. Again, the issue is the appointment of Supreme Court Justices.		>The right to bear arms is a natural right same as choosing your partner. How long has Iran been trying to get a Nuclear weapon? Yea no ones making that in their garage, not to mention the fact the Gov has control over Uranium		There are no such things as natural rights. A limited right to bare arms is recognized by some interpretations of the US Constitution. However, I think the Courts misinterpreted the word "Arms" by not addressing the definition, which at the time was referring to Coats of Arms used for regulating troop movements. Furthermore, they erred in ignoring the conditional statement that a well regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free State since the state's have National Guards and Congress has allocated a standing army. Just as until Friday, the nation was blind to the fundamental freedom of same-sex people to marry, the nation is currently still blind to the simple fact that within a society like ours, there is no right to carry or own modern firearms. This will be rectified, and guns will be confiscated. And the other basic component is that a position against gun control setting any standard includes being in favor of allowing citizens to have military grade weaponry, including missiles and nuclear weapons. It's not an issue of whether anyone has attempted to construct them currently (most billionaires probably could without US gun control laws), but a logical conclusion of the position.		>He doesn't believe the government can force a medical procedure like that,		I do.		>Can't argue that a lot of people are, he wants patient choice, inexpensive healthcare, and no mandate.		What?		Regardless, I want single payer or at least a public option.		>a good thing this country was founded on federalism and the 17th amendment destroyed it, that's why the Fed can push states around with highway funding.		The Constitution allows for its own amendment. The nation being founded on State's rights is irrelevant, given Interstate Commerce and the 17th Amendment. I have no issue with the Federal Government pushing States around. Most have their heads up their asses.		>With a Std deduction that would result in poor people paying no tax, fully funding the Social Safety net first, and keeping the EITC while also eliminating the payroll tax.		Still a highly regressive tax structure which lead to overall lower revenues. What does fully funding the Social Safety net first mean exactly? How big is his standard deduction? $45k? $50k? I believe in exempting the first $40-50k in income from taxes, then set a target amount of revenue and a target maximum income (say, $10 million) and create a logarithmic equation to generate the necessary revenue. We should also treat all income equally, including capital gains / investment income.		>The Federal government has no right to regulate those things anyway per the constitution and will save the government money		Sure it does. The Education and Environment both effect interstate commerce. Have you even read the Constitution?		>Not sure how this is a big issue....		Embryonic stem cell research. Huge issue for research into degenerative diseases. Plus we should already be cloning humans for organ / tissue replacement, etc...

Both were clearly beneficial to the nation.		>What's the credible argument to go trillions into debt vs balancing the budget and keeping the Government small as intended.		As intended by whom? What does that even mean?		The argument is we have projects we want to invest in, and we don't currently have the willingness to raise taxes to the point necessary to offset with annual revenue. Whether its destabilizing the middle east or investing in our citizens growth, we need more than we're collecting. It's that simple.		>A living breathing 2 month old baby should be killed according to you... wow can't even respond to that. 		Could be killed according to me. Not should be. Why can't you respond to that? The Netherlands has this practice, including up until children are much older. (http://www.bioedge.org/bioethics/after_birth_abortion_already_exists_in_the_netherlands/10499)		You have to respond to it. It's a valid point. Just because you don't like my ethics doesn't mean you can write them off.		>The Supreme Court can't just meat one day and say "well we have the numbers lets overturn Roe v. Wade.		They kind of can. They just grant Cert to an appropriate case.		>NSA hasn't stopped one terrorist attack and is in violation of the 4th amendment.		I disagree that the NSA acts in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and you would never know whether or not they stop terrorist attacks. Given that the German's were threatened with being cutoff from access to NSA data if they granted Snowden asylum, and backed off from the idea, it would appear the Germans believe the information has value.		Regardless, the idea that metadata your phone broadcasts into the public sphere could ever reasonably be considered private is silly. Furthermore, the data the US Government collects is not about you or anyone else, but about five telecom companies' networks, and is done so under warrant. Really, there are only five entities who can even challenge this. Finally, the new revised version of USA FREEDOM is certainly not in violation of the Fourth Amendment, even if you somehow argued that the original Section 215 was a violation of the First Amendment (under chilling effects), not under unreasonable search and seizure, which you won't win.		Regardless, the NSA's tactics are not limited to terrorism. They are about providing informational advantages over our adversaries to our allies and associates. This whole "terrorism" argument is really irrelevant.		>Look to Hover if you want to know what happens when a Government Agency acquires too much power and information.		Hoover wasn't subject to the same checks and balances the NSA is. It actually appears our checks on the NSA functioned quite well. The scandals exposed by Snowden paint a pretty good picture of the NSA taking breaches seriously and removing people who had improper access.		>I'm from NY as well.		NYC? Manhattan? Where?		>No just no. Read any of the Framers, founders or state representatives comments on the issue.		You'll need to be more specific. Because a lot of Framers, Founders, and State Representatives comments make it sound like they're addressing the problem that the Nobility in Europe could protect territory through raising a militia and using Coats of Arms to direct troops, while the mercantile class could not do this (hence the illegal Pirate flag).		>Also includes overthrowing a Tyrant.		You'll have to explain this more. Who is the tyrant? What are you talking about?		>Yea we have 300 million guns, let them try.		Sure. I'm willing to call in Russian and Chinese troops to help out if our own boys won't light em up, but I think we have enough loyal soldiers. Plus, with drones and shit like that, we can just take out the worst offenders from range. It'll be no different than the Civil War, and the country would be better off without the gun-toting element.		>Nuclear weapon isn't even an argument, how long has Iran been trying? No ones making one in their garage.		These are not counterpoints to my statement above. This is a practical rejoinder, not a logical rejoinder. Arguing to nuclear annihilation is a standard debating tactic. You have to show how your perspective doesn't get there, or cede that you would be okay with Americans having nuclear weapons.		There is clearly a social interest where the right to bare arms has a limitation: no nuclear weapons. So we can have some form of weapons control. After that it is a discussion of where to draw the line. I draw the line at firearms.		>Yea no, those don't fall under the commerce clause. They fall under "general welfare" which like the commerce clause has been construed to mean anything they want.		They also fall under Commerce. And yes, the Constitution can be broadly construed to grant massive federal powers, especially given the concept of Judicial Review. Isn't it wonderful?		>The DOE has had no noticeable effect on our School system		Because its not big enough. It's like saying gun control has no effect, when I want gun prohibition. I want a completely federalized education system.		>and more Federal control of eduction is borderline infringing on the freedom of thought.		What? How so?		>That's exactly what his plan does.

{"body":"The long-term incarceration of minorities for drug offenses didn't start with the Clinton administration, though it certainly got worse with the institution of 3-strike laws and mandatory minimum sentencing. 		The drug war was started by Nixon, it was he who tied drug use with crime and instituted incarceration of drug users with the primary goal of incarcerating minorities. The Nixon administration (and the Reagan administration) was behind a great deal of anti-drug propaganda. 		Every president there-after had to get tougher on drugs or be seen by the majority of Americans who bought into the lies as weak on the issue and thus lose a lot of potential voters. President Obama is the first president in modern era to slightly curb all of this because he just happens to be president when the tide has really begun to turn and the majority of citizens begin to see the truth about drug addiction and criminalization, and especially on the subject of cannabis in general. But make no mistake, the drug war has still grown larger under his presidency just as it has under every president back to Nixon.		That said, I still strongly hope to see cannabis taken off the Schedule 1 drug list within the next few years, so that the industry can grow and prosper as it should.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Xaielao","name":"t1_csln28p","parent_id":"t3_3bdhx1","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435522964,"created_utc":1435519364}

{"body":"He never said they started it. His comments were accurate.		>The explosion of the prison system under Bill Clinton???s version of the ???War on Drugs??? is impossible to dispute. The total prison population rose by 673,000 people under Clinton???s tenure ??? or by 235,000 more than it did under President Ronald Reagan, according to a study by the Justice Policy Institute. ???Under President Bill Clinton, the number of prisoners under federal jurisdiction doubled, and grew more than it did under the previous 12-years of Republican rule,combined,??? states the JPI report (italics theirs). The federal incarceration rate in 1999, the last year of the Democrat???s term, was 42 per 100,000 ??? more than double the federal incarceration rate at the end of President Reagan???s term (17 per 100,000), and 61 percent higher than at the end of President George Bush???s term (25 per 100,000), according to JPI.		>Just before the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton famously flew back to Arkansas to personally oversee the execution of a mentally impaired African-American inmate named Ricky Ray Rector. The ???New Democrat??? spoke on the campaign trail of being tougher on criminals than Republicans; and the symbolism of the Rector execution was followed by a series of Clinton ???tough on crime??? measures, including: a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes; new life-sentence rules for some three-time offenders; mandatory minimums for crack and crack cocaine possession; billions of dollars in funding for prisons; extra funding for states that severely punished convicts; limited judges??? discretion in determining criminal sentences; and so on. There is very strong evidence that these policies had a small impact on actual crime rates, totally out of proportion to their severity.		>There is also very strong evidence that these policies contributed to the immiseration of vast numbers of black (and also white) Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder, according to the well-known conclusions of journalists, academics and other criminal justice experts. Federal funding for public housing fell by $17 billion (a 61 percent reduction) under Bill Clinton???s tenure; federal funding for corrections rose by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to Michelle Alexander???s seminal work, ???The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.??? The federal government???s new priorities redirected nearly $1 billion in state spending for higher education to prison construction. Clinton put a permanent eligibility ban for welfare or food stamps on anyone convicted of a felony drug offense (including marijuana possession). He prohibited drug felons from public housing. Any liberal arts grad with an HBO account can tell you the consequences for poor, black American cities like Baltimore. As Alexander writes, ???More than any other president, [Clinton] created the current racial undercaste.???		>As recently noted by Reason.com, Hillary actively lobbied for the aforementioned criminal justice reforms as First Lady and, as a New York senator, voted to expand grants that dramatically scaled up police involvement in anti-terror and homeland security efforts. She also said things like this, in support of a crime bill that would impose draconian new sentencing provisions:		???We need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders. The three strikes and you???re out for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets.???		- Hillary Clinton		http://www.salon.com/2015/04/13/the_clinton_dynastys_horrific_legacy_how_tough_on_crime_politics_built_the_worlds_largest_prison/","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jurkmeoffplease","name":"t1_csljui9","parent_id":"t1_cslex2s","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435516491,"created_utc":1435512891}

Nothing he said about Clinton was wrong.		>The explosion of the prison system under Bill Clinton???s version of the ???War on Drugs??? is impossible to dispute. The total prison population rose by 673,000 people under Clinton???s tenure ??? or by 235,000 more than it did under President Ronald Reagan, according to a study by the Justice Policy Institute. ???Under President Bill Clinton, the number of prisoners under federal jurisdiction doubled, and grew more than it did under the previous 12-years of Republican rule,combined,??? states the JPI report (italics theirs). The federal incarceration rate in 1999, the last year of the Democrat???s term, was 42 per 100,000 ??? more than double the federal incarceration rate at the end of President Reagan???s term (17 per 100,000), and 61 percent higher than at the end of President George Bush???s term (25 per 100,000), according to JPI.		>Just before the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton famously flew back to Arkansas to personally oversee the execution of a mentally impaired African-American inmate named Ricky Ray Rector. The ???New Democrat??? spoke on the campaign trail of being tougher on criminals than Republicans; and the symbolism of the Rector execution was followed by a series of Clinton ???tough on crime??? measures, including: a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes; new life-sentence rules for some three-time offenders; mandatory minimums for crack and crack cocaine possession; billions of dollars in funding for prisons; extra funding for states that severely punished convicts; limited judges??? discretion in determining criminal sentences; and so on. There is very strong evidence that these policies had a small impact on actual crime rates, totally out of proportion to their severity.		>There is also very strong evidence that these policies contributed to the immiseration of vast numbers of black (and also white) Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder, according to the well-known conclusions of journalists, academics and other criminal justice experts. Federal funding for public housing fell by $17 billion (a 61 percent reduction) under Bill Clinton???s tenure; federal funding for corrections rose by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to Michelle Alexander???s seminal work, ???The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.??? The federal government???s new priorities redirected nearly $1 billion in state spending for higher education to prison construction. Clinton put a permanent eligibility ban for welfare or food stamps on anyone convicted of a felony drug offense (including marijuana possession). He prohibited drug felons from public housing. Any liberal arts grad with an HBO account can tell you the consequences for poor, black American cities like Baltimore. As Alexander writes, ???More than any other president, [Clinton] created the current racial undercaste.???		>As recently noted by Reason.com, Hillary actively lobbied for the aforementioned criminal justice reforms as First Lady and, as a New York senator, voted to expand grants that dramatically scaled up police involvement in anti-terror and homeland security efforts. She also said things like this, in support of a crime bill that would impose draconian new sentencing provisions:		???We need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders.

So you get those times. Which makes complete sense to any normal thinking person - and is the same method that time is decided on no matter what the crime. 		Comparing murder to first time pot possession is stupid - and if this actually were true it'd be cause for concern. 		Perhaps what we should do, and good god how offensive is this to say, is to keep habitual drug offenders in jail and increase the time served needed for eligibility of parole instead of legalizing drugs AND letting murderers out early.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"imadetheinternet","name":"t1_cslca11","parent_id":"t3_3bdhx1","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435496576,"created_utc":1435492976}

If a law does not exist, it needs not be enforced. So the rest of the argument is really invalid. 		It's a basic structure of enforcement, of course the beauty is that it's loosely bent to accommodate the circumstances that someone was caught breaking it. People are in uproar about it - but it makes perfect sense. 		Person A was caught shoplifting. Person B was caught shoplifting. However, person B was caught shoplifting 2 times before. It stands to reason that although they both committed the same action, Person B should receive a stricter punishment than person A, because they are showing a pattern that is not conducive to a productive society. 		By reason of the example, replace Shoplifting with marijuana possession IN AN AREA OF MARIJUANA POSSESSION BEING ILLEGAL and people lose their damn minds. 		This article is click bait. Of course a 10th time offender is going to receive a stricter punishment than a 1st time offender - but it's presented like ole boy got caught with a joint and it doing 25 to life. Doesn't work that way. It's called "Persistent offender". There is no other way to enforce law besides this that I can think of that makes sense. 		If you want people to stop going to jail for drug possession, talk to your local representative about legalizing it. Don't be mad because people knew they were breaking the law when they broke it and suffered the consequences - it's not like they didn't know having a pound of pot was illegal. 		So same commentary. 		1. Increase the amount of time a convicted murderer must serve before being eligible for parole. (If they should be eligible at all). 		2.

That's not what I said, I said that laws that doesn't have a widespread moral foundation in the current society is harder to enforce. I didn't also say that *all* laws should be fought, that's just jiggery-pokery, the whole point is that some laws with no strong social support, or apparently discriminatory, has no moral standing to be followed. It would be up to the individual to decide if that law is moral or not, that decision can sometimes be wrong (Sovereign citizens) or can be justified (civil rights movement).

I saw soldiers and policemen grow weed in police and baracks garden and get high constantly. It wasnt a pretty sight and they dont do shit of a job.		Why is that? If I dont smoke, drink or use any substances I have no right to talk about it for what reason?","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hrulj","name":"t1_csm5cgh","parent_id":"t1_csm4j68","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435561426,"created_utc":1435557826}
