{"body":"Got a reply.  She legitimately thinks she can convince people that this is a good thing, posting here for shits and giggles:		What a pleasure to hear from you.  Thank you for contacting me to share your concerns regarding action taken by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the Internet. Hearing from constituents on issues of concern is important to me and our office as we work to represent our district.	 	There is significant discussion about the term "Network Neutrality." The debate focuses on how to foster investment, create jobs, and competition in both the physical broadband network and in the applications that ride over that network.  I believe that access to the Internet should remain open and free from the heavy hand of unelected federal regulators. The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) contend that they will be discouraged from undertaking costly and risky build-outs if their networks are subject to open access and/or non-discrimination requirements. On the other hand, independent applications providers argue that in order for them to best meet the needs of end users and offer innovative services they must have nondiscriminatory access to the physical network. In the absence of any case being made for market failure, to me, all Net Neutrality is, is a solution in search of a problem.	 	In the final days of the 111th Congress, former FCC Chairman Genechowski moved forward with a vote approving the FCC's ability to fully implement Net Neutrality. In response, Verizon filed a lawsuit contesting the legality of this move. On January 14, 2014, a Federal Appeals Court issued a ruling in Verizon v. FCC stating that the FCC had overreached its authority when issuing Net Neutrality rules.	 	It is my steadfast belief that any change of this magnitude to the communications industry should be made by Congress and not the FCC. Additionally, both Democrat-and-Republican led Commissions in the past have all concluded that broadband is not a telecommunications service as the FCC contends, but an information service outside the reach of Title II common carrier rules. We do not need to regulate the Internet under the same laws created in the 1930s for Morse code.	 	Allowing the FCC to regulate the Internet will lead us down the road of the federal government picking winners and losers by restricting the flow of information across the Internet, similar to the Fairness Doctrine. The Internet is the last open public marketplace and I have no doubt that its openness is the key to its efficiency and success. In today's on-the-go digital community the last thing we need is to unnecessarily impede the efficient flow of information by inserting the heavy hand of federal regulators.	 	On Feb. 26, 2015, in a 3-2 decision, the FCC voted to adopt what Commissioner Ajit Pai has termed, "President Obama's 332-page plan to regulate the Internet." President Obama has not only sought to regulate healthcare, housing, the banks, and the auto industry, now he's regulating the Internet. The Internet is not broken. A study conducted by the Progressive Policy Institute concluded that re-classifying the Internet like a public utility would result in $11 billion of new fees and taxes. Any time the government inserts itself into a business process, we see higher costs and less access. After the FCC's recent decision, I fear this is where the Internet is headed.	 	In an effort to preserve a free and open Internet, I re- introduced H.R. 1212, the Internet Freedom Act of 2015 on March 3, 2015. If enacted, H.R. 1212 would invalidate the FCC's new Net Neutrality rules by stating they shall have no force or effect. It would also prevent the FCC from reissuing new Net Neutrality rules in the future. You can rest assured that I will remain very engaged in the debate to prevent the FCC from regulating the Internet and implementing their new rules.

{"body":"There is generally a misunderstanding by the against camp.		You may have heard the claims "it isn't broken don't fix it!", but the telecom industry literally tried to break the system by throttling Netflix, and according to the law they could.  That was just the beginning obviously, so the FCC sued Verizon but Verizon won in court because the internet wasn't classified under Title II, so telecom companies could LEGALLY throttle data and discriminate it.  		That decision also paved the way for telecom industries essentially creating a "cable subscription" like model for the internet, which is also bad.  The argument is that these payments will destroy businesses that cannot afford to pay for "full speed access", thus stifling innovation in not only telecom but across the country because everything relies on the internet nowadays.		The courts told the FCC to come back with the internet classified as a utility so that it has to benefit the public good instead of some corporations bottom line.  The FCC did just that, all while excluding all of the bad things that could possibly come from Title II by using forbearance.  So the only parts of Title II that apply are that you cannot throttle data, you cannot prioritize a piece of data over another, and you cannot block access to something behind a pay wall like a cable package.		This will actually result in the exact opposite of what Blackburn thinks, it will result in MORE access and LESS restrictions.  The government isn't trying to restrict the internet, the telecom industry is.  She isn't trying to preserve the freedom of the internet, she is trying to preserve the profits of Comcast because she got paid by Comcast, AT&T and Verizon to do exactly what she is doing right now.","depth":3,"score":124,"ups":124,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cp9cmx3","parent_id":"t1_cp9cg5n","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425928951,"created_utc":1425925351}
{"body":"Another thing the "against" camp needs to understand is that Title II regulation, in some way, shape, or form, tells the carriers that they don't "own" the data flowing across their networks, and, as such, cannot shape, stop, impede, or prioritize that data at their will.		Much like a water utility -- they may own the pipes that deliver water to the homes, but they do NOT own the water that passes through their pipes.  They cannot slow the flow of water to my home to a trickle, for example, so that a big corporation down the street can have more water fed into their building.  They cannot selectively add or remove elements to or from the water as it passes to my home, while selectively adding or removing different elements to or from the water that goes to my neighbor's home.  They cannot charge me a significantly different rate for water than they can my neighbor.		The same should go for the internet -- you might own the big, network appliances that make the internet a reality, but you don't own the internet.  You don't own the bits of data that flow across your network.  You cannot impede my bittorrent traffic while allowing my neighbor to torrent day and night.  You cannot charge me $100 per month while charging my neighbor $10 for the same level of service.		Just because AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Comcast, Time-Warner, and whomever else put a bunch of money into big infrastructure things that connect to the internet doesn't mean that they now own the internet, the data flowing across it and through their network appliances, nor are they free to do what they want with that data.","depth":4,"score":48,"ups":48,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DiabloConQueso","name":"t1_cp9gqzg","parent_id":"t1_cp9cmx3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425935458,"created_utc":1425931858}

Keep your hand up if you have less than two. I think the case is made.		>Additionally, both Democrat-and-Republican led Commissions in the past have all concluded that broadband is not a telecommunications service as the FCC contends, but an information service outside the reach of Title II common carrier rules.		Interesting how she uses the words "Commissions" and "FCC" as if they're different entities. This is basically saying "Previous commissions had a different notion than the current commission" -- is that supposed to be an argument against it?		Additionally, if you look at the definitions of these classifications it's inanely obvious that broadband is misclassified as an "information service." The justification has been that the raw telecommunication access -- sending packets over the internet -- is useless without additional services that need to be provided by the ISP such as DNS, email, etc. But this is demonstrably false. I can get access to 3rd party DNS and email services that aren't provided by my ISP, as well as write an application that uses the internet without touching any of those services (as long as I know the IP addresses of where I'm going). It's been a fragile classification for a long time, only held in place by industry pressure, and I'm glad to see the FCC finally reconsidering it.		>Allowing the FCC to regulate the Internet will lead us down the road of the federal government picking winners and losers by restricting the flow of information across the Internet, similar to the Fairness Doctrine.

{"body":"You are correct, but I think that when rational, intelligent people try too hard to be fair to nonsensical or maliciously false opinions, those who have internalized these ideas will be free to convert them into firmly-held beliefs, which then become the basis for actions that are harmful to society.  "Factually misleading" is fine as an analysis, but must not be the end of the response.

I believe that the correct response is the judicious use of mockery whenever rational counter-argument becomes impossible.  This is the brilliance of the Daily Show, the Colbert Report, and now John Oliver's show Last Week Tonight.  They show us how to properly respond to propaganda, corruption, Dark Age moralities, and anti-scientific nonsense - *by pointing to and laughing at it*.  To social animals such as ourselves, shame is a puissant antidote to harmful beliefs. 		To reverse the process by which traditionalism and materialistic greed is rapidly overcoming Enlightenment culture, it is the duty of all rationally-minded people to mock, satirize, and lampoon every notion that is not supported by an honest argument.  Stop trying to spare people's feelings and start showing them why their ideas deserve to be laughed at.  Let their feelings of exclusion cause them to question irrational beliefs.  And when they *are* ready to question their irrationality, calmly explain why their beliefs don't even qualify as ideas, teach them to use their minds to form supportable beliefs, and then enthusiastically welcome them back to the society of reason.","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GnomeyGustav","name":"t1_cp9omcq","parent_id":"t1_cp99t5i","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425948074,"created_utc":1425944474}

{"body":"here has been my most successful sale of net-neutrality to the conservative masses:		1. Right now US Internet companies can charge what ever they want for whatever service they want. and in most places throughout the US, including my own neighborhood, internet companies hold a monopoly on service, meaning that they can literally charge any price, and it would be my only option. In the US, you literally have to sign a contract for internet, and the cost/month is almost guaranteed to go up. In other 1st world countries, such as Korea, internet companies PAY YOU AN INCENTIVE to subscribe to their service, and the internet speeds are regularly 100x (no exaggeration) ours for less than a quarter the price.		2. Also, Many years ago, the government gave internet companies multiple hundreds of millions of dollars to lay fiber lines across the US. however, in the agreement, the ISPs found that they were only *required* to lay the backbones, and not actually send the fiber lines to the end user. so they pocketed the money, just cause.		3. Furthermore, without net neutrality, ISPs can monitor and throttle any internet access they so choose, and then charge either us or the companies to allow their service through their tubes. Comcast already does this for Netflix, they literally told Netflix that if they didn't pay them a fee, then their access would be throttled for all comcast subscribers. (Did you notice your netflix sub keeps getting more expensive, or more commercials are showing up on pandora? that cost is sent to us ON TOP of already paying an exorbitant fee to access the internet.) On to p of charging companies, without net neutrality an ISP can monitor your traffic, and then next billing cycle begin to charge you for the sites you access most, and if you don't pay up, they can simply slow down or even block your access.		So. that's the state of the union. What does the FCC ruling mean?		1. Regulated pricing scheme much like your electricity/water/gas. only one company can provide it, so they are not allowed to over charge fair market value. on top of this, as it can now be classified a utility, now people cannot be denied a certain level of access. you can't deny someone the gas they need to heat their home in the winter, simply because they live on the outskirts of town, now you can't deny internet access to anyone		2. The Government already technically owns the backbones, so now they can regulate it, and make sure that everyone gets a fiar share of the speeds originally promised. The US, as a matter of fact has the slowest average internet speeds of any 1st world country, and on top of this is more expensive/MB than most internet-accessable countries. THERE ARE COUNTRIES IN THE WAR-TORN MIDDLE EAST that have faster, cheaper internet than us.		3. With the internet traffic being deemed "Neutral," internet companies are now no longer allowed to discriminate/throttle/charge for using the backbone that they didn't even pay for.		All in all, this was the first step of many to come that should overhaul our broadband accesses and actually bring us into the 21st century.

You don't pay Netflix by the day, you pay by the month. Likewise, you pay for your HBO by the month.

And please do not just toss two words at the end of an unsupported statement and try to pass that off as support, it wastes my time to correct it. 		When you pay for TV, you are informed of exactly what you can watch.  If you wanted to watch more channels, you pay more to get passed the paywall to access the channels.  		Under your logic, since CBS put the most recent episode of NCIS online, they are required to present the whole series and every episode.  But its blocked by a paywall from the content owner.  So that isn't true.		In reality, that paywall is the same for TV, both are limited by the content owner.   The same as in online, where the content owner can limit via a paywall.   If NCIS decides to play an all day NCIS marathon on a cable channel, they aren't required to provide it to the over-the-air customers in marathon form or online in marathon form.    		As for ads, no clue why you thought that was a delimiting factor and not the content ownership.

There is a pretty strong correlation between union membership and how well the middle class gets paid.

{"body":"Let's agree on the fact that joining a union is good for a worker's wages. Why should a law exist that requires a worker to join a union against their will? You are free to encourage people to join a union all day long. You shouldn't be able to force them into it against their will.		I read the 2015 Act 1 in Wisconsin (Right to work passed here today). This language is in the law; "Employees shall have the right of self???organization and the right to form, join or assist labor	organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives	of their own choosing, and to engage in lawful,	concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining	or other mutual aid or protection"		The crux of your argument is false; right to work doesn't eliminate unions.		The law's language clearly states employees are still free to assemble into unions and collectively bargain under the full extent of federal law. It also states in the Wisconsin law that employers cannot "encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization, employee agency, committee, association, or representation plan by discrimination	in regard to hiring, tenure, or other terms or conditions of employment". 		Nothing there is DIScouraging people from joining a union; it's simply enabling people to choose. And there are plenty of negative consequences for leaving a union that DIScourages people from leaving and ENcourages people to join.","depth":9,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"derp_derpistan","name":"t1_cp9h0iy","parent_id":"t1_cp9et64","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425935843,"created_utc":1425932243}

So in essence, they are attempting to defund unions to the point that they will cease to exist. Or at the very least will be so broke that they won't be any kind of political threat.

I don't think there are two succeeding generations with greater contrast than Baby Boomers and Gen X. Baby Boomers were the Hope of the West. After record low birth rates during WW2 many people finally had their babies post-war. These babies were mollycoddled and spoiled, with dad earning more than ever before and mom staying home. Everyone who wanted to go to college got into good colleges. With or without college they entered a job market crying out for labor. Even my mom, who is a baby boomer, says men of this generation are the most entitled, sexist, racist generation of all time.	Gen X was born into turmoil. The first news story I remember was whites beating up blacks (Civil Rights Movemwnt). Many of my teachers were veterans of the Vietnam War. I remember us not being able to drive our car due to the oil embargo, watching children starve in Biafra, the ever looming threat of a nuclear WW3, the thalidomide scandal, etc. And when I was in High School only kids with the best grades got into college, the rest faced massive unemployment and wage stagnation. We were the first generation in history to be told we would probably be poorer than our parents. All of these factors have shaped us dramatically.	With regard to industry, I can tell you we Gen X are awaiting the Baby Boomers handing over the reigns. In the management groups I've been part of I have always been the one young voice (young at 49!). In fact a colleague pointed out that when he joined management the average age for management was 43, coincidentally his age. 20 years later the average age was 63.		Industry will probably always lean right, but I have personally witnessed how the advent of Gen X in management has at least ensured there are more voices highlighting values, ethics and corporate responsibility - and it is resulting in moderation.","depth":4,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cp9ado2","parent_id":"t1_cp96bov","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425925257,"created_utc":1425921657}

All you have to do is look at the stagnation of wages to cost of living since then. What your mom has to say concerning an entire generation is kinda, no is actually stereotyping. 	 Gen X born into turmoil, wtf? So you got to watch Baby boomers black/brown/white being beat down in the Civil rights movement, they were there, not sitting in front of their TV watching. Baby boomers didn't have teachers as Vietnam Vets, they are the Vietnam Vets. They didn't have the option to avoid it, there was the draft back then. What generation do you think fought the draft so you don't get a card in your mail saying your going to the middle east out of the blue?

Did you live through the Cuba crisis and how tense things were then, maybe study on that if you want to learn about 'real' reality of imminent thread. 	 I don't know where you got the idea Baby boomers with low grades went to college. Baby boomers have had to live with wage stagnation while raising families, once again thanks trickle down economics. 	 You have stated your belief that Gen X management is more voices highlighting values, ethics and corporate responsibility. I'll give you mine, I have worked with Gen X management and see no difference to Baby boomers, if anything they are more willing to throw each other under the Bus to get ahead. Human base traits don't change that much, and it's still the self preservation being the main driver. I haven't seen 'any' increased virtue, ethics or responsibility from Gen X concerning business decisions or suggestions to increase profits.

It is most common for social change to be started by individuals in one generation but the impact first materializes on the next generation. I agree most of my examples were movements and events instigated by a few individuals in the baby boomer generation, but their impact was greater in Gen X than their peers.		A more recent social change illustrates this. The people who started the computer era were mainly baby boomers and Gen x (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc). Your argument would mean that Baby Boomers and Gen X were the generations who experienced the social change of computers, Internet, etc. The reality is that the social change came with the subsequent generation that grew up with the change - the Millenials I guess.		Your point about stereotyping is silly. The topic of social change is always be about trends seen in a proportion of the population. That is the correct way to do it. Stereotyping entails implying that everyone in a group acts in a way that is commonly associated with a group - I did not do that. I spoke of trends		You don't see change in attitude between Baby Boomers and Gen X. I observe that a proportion of Gen X in management do reflect the social change they grew up with.

And the reason for that is because the ISPs are not expected to monitor and police the data that they are serving.

{"body":"It's not conservative or liberal, it's how corporate manipulation of federal agencies works across the whole spectrum.		I can't remember the exact name for the process, but it's something like this: crisis-response-manipulation.  		-- First, a corrupt insider exploits a situation and creates a crisis (e.g. ISPs trying to scalp and extort content providers and attack the bandwidth of the competition).  		-- Then, this eventually leads to a response, like the need for a federal agency to step in manage the public good or resource that's being exploited/abused by the corrupt insider.  		-- At this stage, the corrupt insider who caused the problem in teh first place hijacks the response process and uses it to craft legislation or regulation that cements its exploitation and/or advantage legally and stifles its competition even more.  Then, the legislative/regulatory response that their initial exploitation necessitated becomes an additional leverage that benefits the same insiders.		A good example is the food safety bill issue:  We had terrible food safety and agricultural industry management under Bush.  Obama gets elected, in part by promising overhaul of food safety, health and FDA/USDA regulation of poor food choices.  Instead, once Obama is elected, the food safety bill is hijacked by food/agribusiness insiders to make it harder for the growing organic markets, artisanal food processors, and others in the growing sector of speciality health foods to compete with them.		You never win on an issue of corrupt insiderism or exploitation of some market/public resource, until the corrupt insider's attempts to hijack the response process are beaten back successfully.

Whichever party has the most people in the House or Senate will have control of it. If Republicans control House and Democrats control Senate, not much will get done, since things will get proposed and maybe passed in half of Congress, then handed to the other and not passed. Hence our last several years. Even if Congress does pass something, the President (Dem) can veto it. So specifically with this net neutrality thing, the Dems are for it, Rep against.

{"body":"The Fox News crowd believes the consumers should be the ones in charge of regulating the internet. They believe if a company treats its customers poorly, jack prices, reduces quality and limits competition that the customers always have the power to stop buying from that company and therefore alter its business practices to favor the customer. 		And in theory it is supposed to work just like that. In practice it doesn't work anything like that. People are lazy. People tend to be polite and they don't like to rock the boat. People have busy lives and they don't feel like taking up crusades everyday. People don't like depriving themselves. 		All of this adds up to a nature. It's in our nature to tolerate little things and only complain when things get really bad. Large companies know this. That's why they make changes slowly. They add a little charge to your bank account, a little fee to your insurance, a little change to your contract, a little more advertising, a little less content... And all the while, most just take it and keep doing business with them. They don't boycott. They don't use the almighty dollar vote to force change on companies. Hell, most people don't event vote, period; let alone with their dollars. But you expect them to rise up in a unified force and push companies like Comcast to play fair. In theory it should work, but in reality doesn't.		In reality what you end up with is a population of people who bank with companies they hate, shop with companies who outsource their jobs, buy insurance from companies they hate, buy fuel from companies that rape them, use phone companies they hate, deal with mega-box stores that don't give a damn about them as an individual, and work for companies that.		People are not that vigilant. They are not going to rise up and protest every little change that every company in their lives makes. Sometimes they get pissed at Home Depot and the march up to the manger's desk and they swear they there are never going to do business with them again, and then they drive across the street to Lowes. The trouble is there's an equal number of people who just stomped out of Lowes and drove over to Home Depot. They ping-pong like that between BP and Exxon, Walgreens and CVS, AT&T and Verizon, Bank of America and CitiBank... And it does absolutely nothing. Bank of America got away with charging 6% to cash personal checks, and soon enough all of them do it. Changing companies won't do any thing anymore. Now you have to boycott the whole industry. You would have to stop buying gas altogether, close out your bank accounts, cancel all your insurance, shut down all your phones, kill your cable and internet accounts, and go home and sit in the dark until everyone got the message.		In theory it would work, but in practice it's not gonna happen. But they still cling to the idea because it sounds nice. It sounds like you are the one in control. You are the customer and you are always right. It sounds clean and simple. If you don't like the company, you just won't do business with them; except that you ignore the fact that you always do anyway, everyday. 		What it ultimately means is they won't regulate the market themselves, but they won't let anyone else do it either.","depth":0,"score":57,"ups":57,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aaronby3rly","name":"t1_cp98q7k","parent_id":"t3_2yfped","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425922611,"created_utc":1425919011}

{"body":"Is the dollar vote working? Have you decided to boycott some company practice and seen millions join with you to cause real change in an industry? Are there companies you deal with and wish you didn't have to, but ultimately do nothing about it except complain? Are you going to lead the cause by shutting your internet off first and waiting until the masses join you?		I don't know about you, but my entire livelihood depends exclusively in internet sells. If I shut my internet access down, I'll go broke. I'll run out of money in two months and I won't be able to buy food or keep the electricity on. I can't boycott my ISP because I'll be living under a bridge if I try. While I'm waiting on the masses to shut their internet access off too, I will literally go under. If you don't need internet access to survive, then maybe you can lead that charge, but you are faced with a reality that not everyone will be able or even willing to join you. When systems were smaller it worked. You could get a community to boycott the local bank or hardware store, but we don't have those small systems anymore. We have global corporations that don't care about you because they don't care about individuals. They care about percentages and market shares. Keurig doesn't care if their coffee pods create waste and if that bothers the environmentalist. They aren't marketing to that percentage of the population. Keurig only cares about this one segment of the population and everyone else that would boycott them can go screw themselves. They make so much money off this one segment of the population that they don't care about the bitching, moaning and boycotting of the rest of the population that hates them. Thats why the idea of the dollar vote doesn't work anymore. Some Christian group gets all upset with Disney because the have a gay pride day, so they are going to boycott. Do you think Disney cares? No. Because they have millions and millions of people who will still show up in spite of this one segment of the population that tried to stop them from doing something. The company looks at it this way: there are a million dollar votes that don't want us to do X, Y, or Z, but there are a billion dollar votes over here that don't care. They will take the billions and tell the millions to get screwed. 		And besides all of this, the fact is the internet cut its teeth on title II regulated phone lines. You used to plug a title II common carrier phone line into the back of your computer, your modem would make some funky noises and you would use to to connect to the internet. It didn't kill innovation. The internet grew in spite of those government regulated lines. And no one told you what emails you could send, what blogs or websites you could create, or what porn sites you could visit. Classifying these new lines as common carriers won't stop innovation either.

Realistically, net neutrality is policy the US had already been living with for years until a court struck down the FCC's Open Internet Order.  At that point, the open internet policy was attacked by the telecom industry and the politicians they bribe with donations, leading to the proposals that would fundamentally change the internet as we know it (like the Internet Freedom Act being discussed here today).  To preserve net neutrality, the FCC classified ISPs as common carriers, effectively making them utilities.

The power to tax, the power to regulate is also the power to extort.   No private monopoly has more power.  At times, for brief times, some monopoly might wield a similar level of power.

This game costs far more than any savings the occasioned "fair" regulation might bring.   		The less regulation the better, and the less government regulation the better.   For private businesses can regulate themselves and set standards. too.   Both forms of regulation tend to be exploitive of current consumers.  Self-regulated private industries will collude to set pricing and limit consumer choices.  Governmental regulation seems like a fix to that collusion?  Well, sure, but only for a brief while.  Long term, mid-term even, the established corporations quickly come to collude with avaricious or less-smart regulators to set regulations that EXCLUDE competition.

But, "They have been mailed off to unemployables, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant Betty Furness found very like 'giving sugar to diabetics'."  These mass mailings were known as "drops" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population.		Wikipedia missed it, but the real hot target of that BoA operation was HOUSEWIVES.   Stay at home housewives whose husband's limited their available spending cash.   That was the era where that was common.  Sure, it helped liberate the housewives, but many,many of them ended up spending TOO much, being unfamiliar with having a lot (comparatively) money to spend.   To the predators of lending that's exactly the borrowers they want, if they collect a reasonable percentage back.   		How did your wonderful bright shiny new CFPB put it?		>It updated existing regulations to make it easier for spouses or partners who do not work outside of the home to qualify for credit cards.

{"body":"The Internet Revolution is a lot like the Agricultural Revolution 10,000 years ago. I understand we're still trying to figure out how to use it (in reality). The potential is there to do amazing things with it.		The Agricultural Revolution started feeding people's bodies and allowed them to focus on new trades like the sciences, which led to the development of nearly everything we take for granted today: the printing press, the internal combustion engine, even electricity. The Internet Revolution is just beginning and has allowed a wealth of people to get information in seconds on nearly any topic.		We can now learn what a Higgs Boson even if you don't have a physics background. You can quickly learn about material sciences or learn many types of math in just a few minutes of searching. You can find out what's happening in London, Africa, Russia, and Japan simultaneously while watching sports in New Zealand and reading an article about the spiders in Australia.		The internet isn't just a thing, or a concept. It's a fundamental change in the way humans process information and pass that knowledge on to the next generation. We must stand up to protect it. 		Bills like that proposed by Marsha Blackburn and her colleagues are akin to pouring salts on the first farms and fields of agriculture. Ms. Blackburn and her bill is the poison of the 21st century's agricultural revolution. We must stand up and send a clear message - that these politicians cannot be left in office and that the internet does not belong to a few companies. It is ours. It is mine and yours. The internet is my children's and my great grandchildren's. It is humanity's new printing press, our new steam engine, our new electric light bulb, and our new farm. It is revolutionizing how business is done and should remain open and toll free to anyone that wants to join.		Without the internet we lose all the strives in collective human knowledge that have led us to here. From the discovery of how to make fire to the accumulated knowledge that led to putting a relic of humanity into interstellar space everything every human has done has helped achieve the interconnectedness of the internet. 		In the past, to connect, people had to build roadways or sealanes. Then it was phone lines and radio stations. But now, on a scale unlike anything ever imagined, you can communicate and exchange ideas across oceans and through the language barrier. Ideas come to life and inspiration can be found in all nooks and crannies. 		Help tell your congressmen and women that the American people want to be part of humanity's future. We want to be the first to benefit from the internet. We want our grandchildren to prosper and the world to finally start healing all historical wounds and we want all generational wars to stop. We want to share ideas with people in China, Russia, Cuba, India, Madagascar, Iraq, and everywhere else. We want everyone to have a full plate of food, a full glass of water, and a safe place to eat. 		The internet can spread the knowledge to do that. It can tell us in real-time where the problems are and organize world-wide efforts to solve it. It can bring together the greatest minds - regardless of language and location barriers. It can connect builders to engineers and engineers to scientists and scientists to the problem. It is the world's future and if we limit the internet now, we are nothing short of opting America out of the future, sealing her future to a page on a history website as a once-great nation instead of the nation she should be.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Regel_1999","name":"t1_cp9fsh3","parent_id":"t3_2yfped","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425933975,"created_utc":1425930375}

{"body":"OK- my attempt.  I will get downvoted into oblivion, but I will try. 		Internet companies want to consider the option of charging different prices for different services depending on how much bandwidth it uses. 		Some think this is unfair.  There should be one set price regardless.  		Thus the FCC steps in and they create "net neutrality" whereby they decide to regulate the internet like a utility.  So... now rather than an evil corporation setting the price (because reddit HATES corporations) government will be setting the price.  		Because look at all the other industries government regulates and how good they do.  Like, the FDA is great at giving us cheap drugs in an agile manner... 		And the price of food has tripled because the Ag department is so good at setting corn prices. 		In NYC we only started getting a water bill 20 years ago.  Someone in government decided we needed an EXTRA tax- and they determine how much water I deserve- and if i go above it, I pay for a penalty.  Wait... that sounds... kind of like... Net Neutrality!! 		So- by turning the internet over to the FCC, what we've effectively done is ruin the internet.  It will take time.  It's not going to happen over night.  But it will happen.  Remember the Department of Education was only started in the 70s.  Before that- somehow- schools existed.  Even the children on Little House on the Prairie managed to get to school... and just look at the quality of America's public schools since the 70's.  Nothing but downward drop across the board. 		So- the House proposed a bill to NOT let this happen.  To tell the FCC that as an unelected body they have no rights to assume control of the internet. 		Can you imagine if the House passed a bill saying "we are going to take control of the internet and put this government body in charge".  Reddit would go NUTS.  But you blame the evil corporations and you call it "neutrality" and they all fall in line. 		Somehow government assuming control of something private is applauded. I tend to think that we have so few banks because we have so much government.  And we have so few trains because we have so much government. And we have only 3 real drug companies  because we have so much government. And we have so few refineries and so few oil companies and so few internet companies, etc etc etc.  		Good luck online gaming in 5 years when the FCC decides you are using too much bandwidth.  Comcast would have just charged you more.  The government... well fuck, they will just shut you down or turn off your "utility". Because they are in charge now, bitches.  		Congrats.  Same guys that talk about "start a revolution" just ceded the only free thing left in America to the very institution that enslaves them.  You think the GOP is bad?  Me, too.  I think the Dems are worse.  I think they are all government, and the more we have, the worse we are.  Even Elizabeth Warren asks why we have fewer, bigger banks now than BEFORE the crash of 2008.

{"body":"Net Neutrality is the idea that all traffic that traverses the internet should be considered equal by the networks that it traverses. The problem is that not all internet traffic is equal, as we will demonstrate.		1. Streaming video takes up more bandwidth than just accessing a text and graphics based webpage.		2. Text and graphics based webpages take up more bandwidth than most video games.		3. Netflix, for instance, makes up fully a third of all traffic that traverses American ISP networks during peak hours. Add the top four streaming services??? traffic together, and more than 50% of all internet traffic during peak hours is streaming video. In speaking with a network engineer, we have learned that Netflix alone often makes up 50% of his networks peak hours traffic.	This is the reality internet service providers must deal with. In order to provide the best experience for all their subscribers, ISPs have to shape traffic to best suit their subscriber's needs, and the videogame player, who pays the same as the Netflix user, is just of deserved of his experience as any other subscriber.		Part of the business model that keeps internet service relatively affordable to the general public is called oversubscription. This is the idea that all internet users don???t use their connections at the same time, so ISPs oversubscribe their infrastructure and put more customers on a connection than the connection can logically manage at one time. Oversubscription is a very important concept to understand. Oversubscription is why ISPs don???t guarantee residential connection speeds, they only say that they ???Guarantee up to ???X??? Mb/sec.??? This means that at any given time the subscriber could get, say, 20 Mb/sec downloads, because the connection technically can handle that from a single subscriber, but that a subscriber could also get significantly less throughput at any given time, based on network congestion and depending on how many subscribers are currently using their internet connection. ISPs oversubscribe their networks in order to keep "build out" costs down, thereby keeping subscription costs relatively low and affordable for the general public.		Throttling, which we have shown is necessary for an ISP to have a sustainable business model, is one of the three major contentions of the ???Net Neutrality??? crowd. Another is the idea that some ISPs will block access to websites based on ???pay to play??? schemes. (Meaning they will charge service operators -whether that be a website or a streaming video service - money to not have their service blocked.) Let us emphasize that there are no reputable reports of this ever having happened. This contention is based solely on gross speculation, and nothing more.		The other major contention of the ???Net Neutrality??? crowd is the veritable monopolies that some of the larger ISPs have, particularly in major urban areas. While not as prevalent as some would have us believe, unlike the other two contentions, there is an element of truth to this argument. Many times these large ISPs have been entrenched for decades, and have effectively lobbied to make it difficult for new competitors to build out their own infrastructure by getting local municipalities to restrict public right of ways, restrict the granting of easements, or implement other red tape that discourages competition. This is certainly a legitimate grievance, but just recently Google issued a press release informing local governments that all they have to do is get out of the way and it is willing to build fiber gigabit networks all over the country. Therefore, even in the instance where the ???Net Neutrality??? crowd has a marginally legitimate concern, the government need only get out of the way and competition would spring up, compelling large ISPs to compete and curtailing any proclivities they may have to throttle or block services to their subscribers.		Lastly, it should be acknowledged that, even with the aforementioned realities, average connection speeds have increased year over year for some time now, and this trend shows no sign of slowing down. These ISPs spend millions if not billions of dollars to build out, maintain, and upgrade their networks. These are, for the most part, private entities, that are deserving of using their networks in any way they deem fit. They have a vested interest in providing their subscribers with the best experience possible, and opening up competition, not burdening the entire internet with regulation, is the way to address all that the ???Net Neutrality??? crowd is concerned over.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"You_smell_like_poops","name":"t1_cp9gj73","parent_id":"t3_2yfped","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425935115,"created_utc":1425931515}

Mrs. Blackburn thinks that NN does the exact opposite of what it actually does, and would allow the government to choose whose traffic is routed as high or low priority.		Of those who understand both how telecom networks function, and what Network Neutrality is, the educated objections fall into two categories:		1) Possibilities of poor implementation by the FCC.  It is certainly possibly that they could screw it up.  I'm pleasantly surprised at the moment at how well the rules appear to be designed, but I'm waiting for the full text to make sure there isn't a serious error in it.		2) Possibility of preventing legit situations where prioritizing traffic should be allowed.  For example, 9/11 calls can be blocked during widespread emergencies due to people calling their families and overloading cell towers.  I think there is a reasonable case to be made that emergency traffic should be allowed a prioritized fast lane.		For another example, certain new technologies may need priority to function reliably at all.

Problem is, this is a bunch of buzz-words and wishful thinking.  For several reasons:		1, the voters don't necessarily 'not decide' b/c it's the FCC writing regulations instead of Congress.  It's entirely fair to say that the voters got their say when they elected Obama; he's not expected to handle every little thing himself, but instead to appoint people to do it for him.   That's the system working the way it's supposed to; nobody's prerogative is being taken away by this.		2, the 'internet freedom' GOP is a rump of their own party.

{"body":"> Option 1:Grant the FCC the power to create and regulate their own executive/federal orders. They do not have to disclose the full information until after the vote.		The FCC is not creating and regulating their own executive orders.  They are applying a subset of the rules congress allows them to enforce per the Telecommunications Act to an industry historically regulated even more harshly than this new rule set.  They do have to disclose a considerable amount of information prior to their vote, including a months long public comment period they are required to respond to.  I do agree that the lack of requirement to make public the final draft prior to voting should be changed; it appears to be due to conflicting rules from the 70's which would make passing any rules impossible due to a recursive loop - make draft rules available for public comment, update rules with comment count and responses, make new draft rules public for comment, update rules with comment count and responses, etc, etc.  That will need to be resolved before this long-standing FCC policy can be eliminated.		But why make a new law when the existing law already does exactly the thing the new law would require?  We live in a republic, and don't vote directly on laws - we elect representatives to vote on laws for us.  Why is there such a problem with those representatives selecting their own representatives to implement the day to day application of the laws they pass?","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"river-wind","name":"t1_cp9bdlo","parent_id":"t1_cp955wt","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425926864,"created_utc":1425923264}

You'll have to show me some of those.  "Pro-Internet" Republicans *say* they are for internet freedom, but tell us that deregulation and the "free market" will get us there all by themselves.

{"body":"Hate to be in the minority here but I sit in a lot these FCC hearings and congressional debates as part of my company and frankly a lot of people do not have even a remote clue what just happened last month by placing the ISP's under the 1934 Telecommunications law. 		I represent AARP and low income groups so I can tell you it is absolutely the worst thing for the internet access provisions currently in place. I am a supporter of local ISP's and free citywide networks etc. Smaller is better. I also lobbied against pipe prioritization abilities so before anyone starts with the "Carrier Shill" stuff that is not my place. I am not against carriers but I am against things like laws that block access in areas to independent and new start up companies. I am also very involved in the build out side of the industry because it affects those that I represent a lot. Multiple access points and competition are critical in my book.		First, Keep in mind the formal release of regulations has yet to be completed (likely June/July) so I am saying this based on a detailed reading of the 1934 laws vs. today's situation. 		What the FCC did was in effect nationalize all ISP access to the Internet. Not by taking ownership of, but by placing all corporate and terminating points, as well as Fees, charges, build outs, equipment, access control, and customer servicing under it's authority.		Under the 1934 act (which basically ended up eventually creating a single servicing organization (AT&T) ) all ISP's are basically now under total and complete regulatory control out of Washington. It is just  that simple. 		What exactly the FCC means by stating it has modernized that law has yet to be seen. They have formally stated however that they do not intend to exercise certain portions of the law such as ordering build outs, setting access fees, creating local utility boards etc. What worries everyone here on the hill is that they still reserved the right to do so and people here said we could keep our doctors too.		That alone makes for an almost impossible business climate. Imagine for example your a small startup ISP and want to raise and spend 50 million building out a portion of a city to compete with Comcast. Now you have the possibility that the FCC might decide to set your rates 20-25% lower than you had planned on for recovery of investment. These kinds of things are now in play. 		Already we have heard from ISP's who have verbally been told that they can no longer prioritize ANY traffic. Really, no prioritization of any kind? What happens when you have a 911 call and it's breaking up due to last mile congestion and from streaming. That's a pretty big deal. BTW, Nobody wanted Netflix to be able to buy a high priority channel but look at it the other way around. A high priority pipe is still a fixed pipe. As it stand now there is no limit on on how much last mile bandwidth streaming traffic can now take.		For now everyone is in a wait and see mode. One thing is clear. Making ISP's a regulated utility has huge, huge consequences and costs that my constituents simply will not likely be able to afford. All we wanted was certain traffic in the pipe not to be prioritized. Nobody cared if Netflix could buy and set up a pipe as long as it wasn't prioritized over anyone else s. What we got was in fact a regulatory wholesale takeover of Internet access. 		To be fair it remains to be seen how all this will survive the inevitable court challenges and congressional "tweak and destroy" attempts but it sure doesn't looks from my perspective like a disaster waiting to happen.","depth":0,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"majorneo","name":"t1_cp97tph","parent_id":"t3_2yfped","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425921078,"created_utc":1425917478}

[Wrong.](http://www.cnet.com/news/us-fcc-chairman-net-neutrality-rules-nothing-like-utility-style-regulations/)		> First, Keep in mind the formal release of regulations has yet to be completed (likely June/July) so I am saying this based on a detailed reading of the 1934 laws vs. today's situation.		[Read Title II here.](http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf)		> What the FCC did was in effect nationalize all ISP access to the Internet. Not by taking ownership of, but by placing all corporate and terminating points, as well as Fees, charges, build outs, equipment, access control, and customer servicing under it's authority.		No. I will assume you're lying unless you can back this statement up with evidence.		> Under the 1934 act (which basically ended up eventually creating a single servicing organization (AT&T) ) all ISP's are basically now under total and complete regulatory control out of Washington. It is just that simple.		That's not what Title II does. Did you know that mobile phone service has been classified as Title II since 1993?		> What exactly the FCC means by stating it has modernized that law has yet to be seen. They have formally stated however that they do not intend to exercise certain portions of the law such as ordering build outs, setting access fees, creating local utility boards etc. What worries everyone here on the hill is that they still reserved the right to do so and people here said we could keep our doctors too.		Again, they already did this with mobile phone service and that industry has completely exploded and changed the world.		> That alone makes for an almost impossible business climate. Imagine for example your a small startup ISP and want to raise and spend 50 million building out a portion of a city to compete with Comcast. Now you have the possibility that the FCC might decide to set your rates 20-25% lower than you had planned on for recovery of investment. These kinds of things are now in play.		[Small ISPs want the FCC to regulate *even more* so they can compete with the telecom monopolies more easily.](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/SonicNet-CEO-Lets-Bring-Back-Unbundling-While-Were-At-It-131325) The FCC has said over and over again that they do not intend to regulate rates.		> Already we have heard from ISP's who have verbally been told that they can no longer prioritize ANY traffic. Really, no prioritization of any kind? What happens when you have a 911 call and it's breaking up due to last mile congestion and from streaming. That's a pretty big deal. BTW, Nobody wanted Netflix to be able to buy a high priority channel but look at it the other way around. A high priority pipe is still a fixed pipe. As it stand now there is no limit on on how much last mile bandwidth streaming traffic can now take.		This is completely wrong. Traffic prioritization has existed since the beginning of the internet. Paid prioritization is a completely artificial construction on top of existing bandwidth management tools.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Astranc","name":"t1_cp9ayrb","parent_id":"t1_cp97tph","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1425926199,"created_utc":1425922599}

{"body":"You're finished?  Ok, allow me to retort.		So, Dish Network, SPRINT, Amazon.com, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo, AOL, Level 3 communications, Vonage, Hulu, The Christian Coalition, Mozilla, BitTorrent, Writers Guild of America, the ACLU, and the EFF are just a few of the companies and groups that support the FCC regulating ISPs as Utilities.		The only ones opposed to the FCC rulling?		Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, Time-Warner, Cablevision, Charter Communications, CenturyLink, CableOne and a bunch of regional ISPs. Not a single website or online service is against Net Neutrality.  		The Geeks who run the internet, be it the back bone or the content, know exactly what Net Neutrality means.  		You learned about this issue just recently.  		Most geeks have known about it since 2004 and they know the issue inside and out. In fact, most geeks with even half an education in IT were vocal supporters of the FCC regulating ISPs.  Sure you can find a geek here or there to support what you believe but the vast majority are not supporting the ISPs or this bill. Look, even the Christian Coalition is for the FCC taking over regulation of ISPs.  		Fact is, I trust the government to regulate ISPs more than I trust ISPs to regulate themselves.  We had banking regulations in place but when they were removed, we had the S&L crash, the Housing Market Bubble and the Banking bubble.    		You would trust companies not to pour toxic waste into our rivers and oceans based on their word.  You trust companies to not use chemicals on our food known to be extremely toxic.  You trust companies to make sure that Aircraft are properly maintained.		It must be wonderful to live in a world where you never question the intentions of corporations.		Ok, so what might happen without Net Neutrality being enforced?		 Without net neutrality, ISPs can block or slow down any website or service they want. They can block news sites for any reason, be it commercial or ideological. For example, Comcast could block NYTimes.com or slow it to a crawl because the online newspaper published an op-ed in favor of net neutrality or even reported something negative about the company.		Time-Warner could decide to block your access to Reddit because reddit refused to pay a fee to Time-Warner. If every ISP charges content providers fees for reaching its customers, many websites will simply decide that certain markets aren't worth reaching.		 	 The large ISPs already have a major influence on politics, with Verizon alone spending $53 million on campaign donations and lobbying since 2010. However, without net neutrality, there's nothing to stop the ISPs from influencing elections even more directly. Your broadband provider could block the website of one candidate while speeding up that of another. It's happened.		 Back in 2007, Verizon initially refused to send out text messages from a pro-choice group, but backed down under bad PR and customer pressure. What if AT&T decides one day that it only wants to support Republican candidates so they block the site of any liberal candidates? What if 702 decided they only would support liberal candidates and blocked any conservative candidate's website? 		They can affect elections more directly too as ISPs could selectively block government websites that provide voter information like polling locations and registration forms. If they succeed in lowering voter turnout in certain areas, that could change the course of an election. 		Let's say you always talk to your Mom on Skype, but then CableOne signs an exclusive deal to make Google Hangouts its only allowed chat service. Meanwhile, Mom's ISP, Comcast blocks Hangouts, but gives Skype its fast lane. This scenario may sound crazy, but without any legal constraint, your ISP has every incentive to swing priority access deals with some messaging services while blocking others.		 There's already a precedent for blocking messaging clients in the world of wireless broadband. Back in 2009, AT&T blocked the iPhone from making Skype calls on its mobile network, but relented under pressure from the FCC. In 2012, the company also blocked Apple FaceTime on the iPhone.			 If you decide to open up a restaurant and a gang demands you pay them money not to destroy your place, you'd call the police. But if your business lives on the Internet, you could have as many as a dozen different ISPs in the U.S. shaking you down with no legal recourse against them.		 The most important question raised by net neutrality is not "should the government regulate the Internet" but "should a dozen ISPs be allowed to control thousands of other companies?"		 Whether you're trying to start up the next Facebook or you have your own small, online homemade jewelry store, you could be forced to pay broadband providers in order to reach their customers. If you can't pay, providers could slow your site or service down to the point that nobody wants to use it. It could end up shutting down social media sites as well.			 You like to do all your shoe shopping at Amazon.com but your ISP, Midco, has an exclusive deal with Walmart, so it slows down Amazon.com so badly that each page takes a minute to load and you get timeout messages when submitting your credit card information. You'd stop using Amazon.com		 You've been using Gmail as your primary email address for years, but your ISP decides to slow down that service and speed up Microsoft's Outlook.com instead. How long will you stick with the slow email over the fast one?		 In a world where ISPs can slow down or outright block whatever services they like, your freedom to choose everything from your email provider to where you shop to what you view to your online university...all of those choices could disappear.		 This is why Net Neutrality is so very important.

Today the Commission takes an important step to preserve the Internet as an	open platform for innovation, investment, job creation, economic growth, competition, and free	expression. To provide greater clarity and certainty regarding the continued freedom and	openness of the Internet, we adopt three basic rules that are grounded in broadly accepted Internet	norms, as well as our own prior decisions:		>i. Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network	management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their	broadband services;		>ii. No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications,	services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful	websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony	services; and		>iii. No unreasonable discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably	discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.		>We believe these rules, applied with the complementary principle of reasonable network	management, will empower and protect consumers and innovators while helping ensure that the	Internet continues to flourish, with robust private investment and rapid innovation at both the core	and the edge of the network. This is consistent with the National Broadband Plan goal of	broadband access that is ubiquitous and fast, promoting the global competitiveness of the United	States.1			Please tell me how these rules contribute to the "beginning of special and corporate interests" and "goverment take over of the internet".

I agree that free market should take care of these sort of issues, except that in many areas there's no such thing when it comes to broadband. If I recall correctly part of this problem in our area is what communication companies "own" as far as the easement for their particular services. When some of the wireless internet providers came around the argument was that the wireless waves encroaches their easement and because of that it's a violation of their agreement. They eventually lost that argument, but only after intense lobbying. I suppose it sorta makes sense, in some sort of twisted sorta way. 		I do believe that if no providers will service an area then local government (or communities, which is my preference over government) should be allowed to roll their own ISP.
