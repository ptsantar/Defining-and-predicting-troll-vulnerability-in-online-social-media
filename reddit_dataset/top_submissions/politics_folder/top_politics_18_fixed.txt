Unfortunately, it undermines some real negotiating power that the U.S. has--even if another candidate opposes war just as unflinchingly as Paul does, the country is better off if other countries aren't necessarily aware of this.		There are similar issues with TPP. Crazy things that the U.S. might ultimately not want are going to be floated and even agreed upon before being taken back out.

Why have secrecy around things like this? Certain things that are put on the table could be politically damaging, even if they were never meant to be included. If I put something on the table as a bargaining chip that I knew the other side would balk at, say oil production subsidies in another country, the oil companies would be pissed, even if I knew they wouldn't be included at the end. Feelings may be hurt, industries of workers could be needlessly worried about their jobs, etc. that do not need to happen. I completely understand initial secrecy from this aspect. The original premise of the deal and overall goals should be public, but details can stay secret while they are truly speculative.		However, there should only be secrecy to an extent. At a certain point, you have to let these documents see the light of day, regardless of the political ramifications.

{"body":"I think the real danger to the NHS is the long existing GATS and what is effectively GATSII, TISA- so when they say xyz wont be in TTIP, you should consider that they may be saying it will be in TISA instead. I think thats a safe assumption because TISA is all about services and NHS is a service, a financial service- its health insurance. 	Not long ago i stumbled across a site that links to a great many of the [web sites of patients](http://www.kaiserpapers.org) of a large US HMO that seems to have been involved for years in talks that is hoping to enter the UK market soon. 		UK healthcare expert Allyson Pollock has written about this push to privatize the NHS and GATS for a long time but it seems to me that many people have no or just the foggiest idea of what GATS does- you should read this, [GATS and Public Services](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm).. and [Putting Health First](http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National_Office_Pubs/putting_health_first.pdf)- both are self explanatory- I think Canada's approach is the smartest and most likely to be able to make it through GATS and TISA attack- but its too late for the UK and the US to adopt.. ([this document- is especially interesting](http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf), **an examination by a US state on what they could and could not do for their people on health insurance in the face of GATS!**- its old, its from 2006, but it mentions what were later to become the TISA negotiations- "friends of services" as being a potential threat to them even doing what they discuss there.. And it is, its the coup d' gras to finish off any hope of new public health care in 50 countries.. and a committment to dismantle what they have now.. (see GATS's standstill and ratchet clauses, which are adopted lock stock and barrel in TTIP and TISA- I think- at least from the first public document on TISA which [endorses both concepts explicitly](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FTEXT%2BTA%2BP7-TA-2013-0325%2B0%2BDOC%2BXML%2BV0%2F%2FEN&language=EN).  Also see the TTIP so called "mandate" document (Its on europa.eu) read the fine print, it just borrows GATS's definitions- very very bad because [GATS is a disaster](http://policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/facing-facts) for the people's public interest. (Check out the http://policyalternatives.ca site - especially Scott Sinclair's work for lots of clear, readable writing on what must be one of the most difficult to understand areas of international law anywhere- its up there with IP as being almost impossible for non-practitioners to understand, and like IP, thats intentional.		So, Friends of Services talks at the WTO is is what would bcome TISA was called then.. basically, its what they wanted GATS to become- But even now, GATS ties US states hands to the insurance system, and TISA is such a shameless endorsement of it it seems, the leaked portion has a bombshell, TISA may [borrow GATS standstill - even its dates](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/20/a_plan_only_banksters_will_love)!		its really fu*** up.

If everyone fended for themselves we'd have our own 12 feet of road we could afford to pave ourselves, but that road doesn't reach anywhere important. We'd make shoes in our home but nobody would buy them, so we'd also have to herd cattle and grow crops. I think Socialism is so intentionally bastardized thst the societal advantages are taboo to speak of. It's a shame because aside from our intelligence, opposable thumbs and ability to share knowledge, society is one of the biggest factors in the survival of humankind. Taking advantage of each other will get us so far but helping each other will push us much further as a species. 		Edit: it is important to note that the people that speak ill of socialism or social programs are those that stand to benefit the least. Namely the wealthy and the politicians.

There are clean energy programs,  more environmental protection programs, and various other things trying to keep big businesses in check and society cared for.  It's not a lot, but it's enough to make visiting the 'deep south' feel like visiting a different country.				To add to the frustration of what goes on federally, I pay roughly 1/3 of my income to federal income tax.  As a common person I have virtually no say as to how those funds are allocated. To some extent this is a good thing, many people (at least Americans) would never choose to have their tax dollars go to social services and infrastructure creation/maintenance (don't get your hopes up, neither does congress).

The Senate version of ACA contained the Public Option as well, but was filibustered by the 40 Republicans plus Joe Lieberman, meaning that it would not pass. 	3.

In order to gain Lieberman's vote and prevent the Filibuster, the Senate version is rewritten to exclude the Public Option. 	6. The senate version passes, before Scott Brown can take office.	7. The Democratic Senate Caucus now sits at 59, meaning that the Republicans can effectively filibuster any bill the Democrats put forward. 	8. The Republicans loudly announce that they will filibuster *any* Democratic attempt to pass health care reform, no matter what.	9.

From the new republic, [just so you don't scoff at the source:](http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/breaking-health-care-reforms-finished-draft)		- Produce more deficit reduction, so that the package as a whole saves government  $130 billion in the first ten years and $1.2 trillion in the second ten years.		- Provide more generous subsidies to middle-income Americans, at least for the first few years of implementation.		- Provide health insurance to an additional 1 million people, so that 95 percent of the population would have coverage by the time the bill is fully implemented		- Close the donut hole in the Medicare drug benefit, so that seniors get more assistance buying prescription drugs.		- Delay imposition of the benefits tax for all workers, rather than just those with collective bargaining agreements.		- Apply consumer safeguards and higher standards for financial protection to more private plans; the Senate plan had a "grandfathering" clause that would have effectively exempted many insurance policies from some regulation.		- Eliminate the Cornhusker kickback, so that all states get the same assistance on Medicaid		- Require the wealthiest Americans to pay Medicare taxes on non-wage income		- Boost Medicaid payments to primary care physicians 		This of course was all from the streamlined reconciliation process that they used. They would have liked to include more changes, but as is they were really stretching the definition of  what "reconciliation" is suppose to be. As you recall they didn't have the votes to pass it otherwise. 		I think that qualifies as "radical".		> All bills were publically available, they simply werent finalized.

Well we all but got rid of our middle class here, and if that wasn't enough take your pick of the countless atrocities Americans could rightly be pissed off about the government doing other than the tpp. Such as Bengahzi, the torturing of innocent people, the fema death camps all over the US, allowing Corporations to become people, the killing of american citizens abroad with targeted drone strikes, the surveillance of everyone's data, taking videos of children being raped in front of their mothers, the roughly 2 billion hollow points rounds that they aren't legally allowed to us in war thus leaving only us to fire upon, the militarized police force rolling down the suburbs in tanks and firing on citizens with tear gas against peaceful protests... please stop me when you have heard enough for a "Real outcry." Because two dead cops in new york, two shot in Boston today, the two shot at in dade county and the cops who got shot at in Furgeson probably wasn't enough to qualify since it wasn't about people starving.

If you make just a little bit more(the middle class) your premiums double for just about the same "coverage" which is most times less than what they had before but now with higher deductibles. I've seen 10k,20k deductibles quoted. The middle class is picking up the tab for low income families. The top 3% have pretty much all kept their private insurance opting to pay the higher premiums. So now you have the middle class running around with health insurance that they can't really use. Couple this ACA pocket robbing scheme, the upwards of 8% cut in take home pay (for the bottom 60%), increased food costs and you have the middle class crumbling. With factories shutting down, promised infrastructure jobs being nonexistent, the record number of small businesses that shut down over the past 6 years and you have the reason why the middle class can no longer afford it. Not to mention kids are now staying at home longer which also puts a hurt on their pockets.

{"body":"Humanity has, since it's beginnings, gravitated away from an anarchistic form of existence towards a more social/tribal one. They always tend to fall prey to groupthink and allowing others to dictate their actions, whatever their own thoughts on the subject might be. After all, considering all of the crap that each individual has to deal with during the course of their lives, trying to fit in any sort of active participation in governance and social matters would produce a system frozen simply due to lack of time. 		I agree that a sea change needs to happen, whereby governance is imposed to fight the natural tendency of people to allow others to talk them into following along with a particular party line. The only way this could feasibly work would be to abolish government, establish a common set of rules (which generally is what the Constitution was intended to be), and then have delegated councils that create, but do not vote on, laws, regulations, and treaties which are published blindly to the Public at large, who then must review them and vote on them. 		Representative government is a great idea under the idea that it allows delegates to come together and hash out important legislation. however, it's anathema to the public good to leave the final say on subjects up to a few who can be manipulated by interested parties rather than by the populace themselves.  Socialism at its finest, I guess?		The only way to create a society where the people come before self-interest is to remove the possibility that self-interest can control the vote. 		It would also be helpful if legislation were published before a vote and given 30-60 days for public commentary. Let the people of Reddit and the country tear it apart and hash it out, mark it up with commentary and such, and then let the people vote according to their conscience.		Granted, even with this, there's no way to get a person to read, understand, and vote honestly, since some people are just too dumb to understand anything above the Cat in the Hat. On the other hand, if we wrote legislation in plain english with clear and specific meaning spelled out in such a way that even a 4th grader could understand it, we might avoid future generations bickering over the wording as we do now over parts of the Bill of Rights. 		Likewise, it would make the Supreme Court far less powerful by rendering them incapable of doing anything else than looking at the bill, comparing it to what the law says, and deciding whether or not the bill violates the law.

It is a nearly complete failure. Healthy people, wealthy or not, are now going to be paying for super sick people to receive substandard, less than medicare-level care now and it is going to cost US citizens more, not insurance companies, not eliminate taxes or waste in the HC field but it is going to cost more for everybody for everybody to receive shittier care.
