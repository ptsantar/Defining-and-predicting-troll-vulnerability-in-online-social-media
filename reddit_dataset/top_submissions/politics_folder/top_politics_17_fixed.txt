Especially Phil Gramm and his dickhead of a wife.		"In an apparent response to a 1992 plea from Enron, Dr. Wendy Gramm, then chair of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, moved to exempt the company's energy-swap operation from government oversight. By then, the Houston-based Enron was a major contributor to Senator Gramm's campaign.		A few days after she got the ball rolling on the exemption, Wendy Gramm resigned from the commission. Enron soon appointed her to its board of directors, where she served on the audit committee, which oversees the inner financial workings of the corporation. For this, the company paid her between $915,000 and $1.85 million in stocks and dividends, as much as $50,000 in annual salary, and $176,000 in attendance fees, according to a report by Public Citizen, a group that has relentlessly tracked Enron, which in turn has called the report unfair.		Meanwhile Enron had become Phil Gramm's largest corporate contributor???and according to Public Citizen, the largest across-the board donor in its industry. Between 1989 and 2001, the company tossed Gramm just under $100,000."","depth":2,"score":486,"ups":486,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fuzzypubiz","name":"t1_csvtie6","parent_id":"t1_csvscx4","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436330411,"created_utc":1436326811}

The merger was technically illegal at the time (banks were not allowed to merge with insurance underwriters), but Rubin - who had become an executive with Citicorp following his departure as Treasury Secretary - lobbied Congress to pass the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act so that regulations would not get in the way.

A thought experiment, if you will. Imagine if the will of the people was something that was clearly contrary to the ideals of the nation.

In the run-up to 2008, a lot of things changed (i.e. the Tea Party) and all of a sudden a lot of Republicans found themselves wondering wtf happened to their party. A lot of Republican voters ended up going for Obama, but McCain could have attracted a lot of democrats and Independents based on his earlier "I'm a reasonable dude" presentation; instead, he went completely batshit. He'd always been a bit of a loose cannon, but he had a couple of pretty bad anger flare-ups, and his choice of Palin as VP made him seem downright unreliable. 		My dad was a lifelong democrat; the only other republican presidential candidate he'd ever voted for was Nixon (and he's mentioned that as a cautionary tale my whole life), but he was going to vote for McCain over Obama until McCain went insane. Instead, he just stayed home in 2008. My husband (also a republican, at that point) voted libertarian because he wouldn't vote for a McCain/Palin ticket or a republican party that was so religiously oriented and batshit crazy. He's now more of an independent - the religious right really turned him off.  		You're not wrong that the republicans will go to the right for the primaries and then appeal to the center during the general, but the democrats do the same thing. It's part of the general partisan strategy; that's why some candidates (like Kucinich, way back when) get into the primary race so they can move the conversation a bit and hopefully get their issues noticed. It's also why if Bernie Sanders gets very far in the primaries, he's going to have to work on his bipartisan appeal; his views, while consistent, are pretty easy to put in the "social democrat" slot, which is well to the left of your average US Democratic candidate.

{"body":"Naw, it's not really related. There were serious issues prior to Glass-Steagall. And we know the most egregious issues in our financial markets leading up to the crisis were unrelated to Glass-Steagall regulations (e.g. shadow banking and off-balance sheet conduits financing ABS/MBS), as well as policies subsidizing assets. All the major banks that played a role in the financial crisis wouldn't have been affected by Glass-Steagall anyway. Bear Sterns, Lehman, Goldman etc did not have traditional banking sides, but received tons of money all the same from traditional banks investments.		Traditional banks will still purchase just as many risky assets from other banks, and will still invest and store their money with investments firms and hedge funds. The only difference is they won't be part of the same corporation, which honestly empirically don't been a big deal, since there has been no financial research to suggest traditional banks will be unable to find and invest their money in high-risk assets just because they are not connected at the hip.		It's a huge popular misconception that Glass-Steagall would be important in our modern banking system. But for people such as myself that work in financial regulation and academic research, it's pretty clear it won't add any protection.		What actually is helping though is complicated and multi-dimensional, and it's not something that can be so easily marketed towards constituents or wrapped up in a single term.

{"body":"The CFTC was created in 1974. It was attempting to regulate swaps based upon authority granted to it under the legislation that created it, not under any authority granted under Glass-Steagall. It released for comment proposed rules in the summer of 1998 that would give it authority to regulate swaps. It did not yet have such authority, but it was attempting to claim that authority. That is how the rule-making process works (see FCC net neutrality rules this year.) That is when the financial sector went apeshit and pushed back, eventually resulting in Congress expressly prohibiting swaps regulation by CFTC. Glass-Steagall is entirely irrelevant to the regulation of swaps.		GS is relevant to the size and complexity of the financial institutions that were threatened during the Great Financial Crisis.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dsmith422","name":"t1_csw5d45","parent_id":"t1_csw1qjh","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436365797,"created_utc":1436362197}

{"body":"I believe they were addressed somewhat under Dodd-Frank, but they were expressly not completely regulated under legislation. CDSs are usually (and were originally exclusively) "bespoke" agreements that are not standardized contracts, so they are not freely traded in the way that stocks, options, bonds, etc are traded. Part of the reason that the financial crisis was so bad was the opaque language used in these contracts. No one could tell what risk the other financial entities had because the contracts were not open to everyone to read. You might think that a company like AIG was financially sound in 2008, but it actually had $100 billion in CDS exposure that was hidden at AIG Financial Products. This is what caused AIG to almost go bankrupt.		>[The Dodd-Frank Act divides regulatory authority over swap agreements between the CFTC and SEC (though the prudential regulators, such as the Federal Reserve Board, also have an important role in setting capital and margin for swap entities that are banks). The SEC has regulatory authority over ???security-based swaps,??? which are defined as swaps based on a single security or loan or a narrow-based group or index of securities (including any interest therein or the value thereof), or events relating to a single issuer or issuers of securities in a narrow-based security index. Security-based swaps are included within the definition of ???security??? under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933.](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/derivatives.shtml)		>The CFTC has primary regulatory authority over all other swaps, such as energy and agricultural swaps. The CFTC and SEC share authority over ???mixed swaps,??? which are security-based swaps that also have a commodity component. 			So it looks like both the CFTC and SEC are attempting to regulate them, but doing it under the rule-making process. This means that each entity proposes rules, groups comment on them, the entity modifies the rules, and then eventually votes to adopt them. Both the CFTC and the SEC are heavily lobbied by the financial industry, so expect that any rules will still tilt heavily in favor of the industry. And the industry benefits more from opaqueness and hidden knowledge. You could buy a stock from any brokerage house and know exactly what you, your broker, and the seller are getting out of the deal. You could shop around for the best deal. A CDS would not necessarily work the same way. An open, free market lets all individuals know the particulars of a deal, so there is less opportunity for the middle-man to extract payments.

Probably someone who's actually a strong progressive, to try and scoop up as many disgruntled Sanders supporters as possible and bolster her legitimacy with that bloc.		Bernie, if he wins, would likely choose a bit more of a centrist running mate as opposed to Warren, as he has little to gain in demographic coverage by tapping her and would desperately want as many allied progressives as possible in Congress to overpower the Third Way Democrats. For the life of me, I can't think of anyone good that comes to mind, as he'd try to avoid choosing any establishment politicians and most of the centrist Democrats are, well, part of the neoliberal establishment. It's possible he could go full-blown double progressive in case he dies in office, but the man is in exceedingly good health and a sitting U.S. Senator; the age concerns in 2008 were unwarranted with McCain, and they're unwarranted today with Sanders.		Nobody else is worth considering, honestly. Chafee and Webb are blips, and Biden wouldn't really have enough to overtake Clinton if he did announce (although I could see him splitting enough of her support with centrist Democrats that it causes a 3-way split, making it easier for Bernie to win the majority of primaries).		In any case, Warren will remain where she is. She doesn't fit the demographic checkboxes either way, her focus is narrow but incredibly effective, and she's a good partner to have in Congress either as "a fellow woman fighting the establishment" on the off-chance that Hillary actually keeps her progressive rhetoric upon winning, or as "a fellow progressive who is incorruptible and shares my platform" if Bernie snags the underdog win.

In urban areas, yes, guns are used to kill people and are usually illegal to fire within city limits. So it's understandable that most there don't understand the purpose and want to enforce more gun control and bans. But in rural areas, we don't even think twice. We are responsible with our weapons, and we don't see a problem with *owning* them. There are very few firearm accidents, and I'd be willing to bet homicide rates in rural areas are also much lower than urban areas. So they err on the side of freedom.

In the city, if you're living in a high rise or something, noise complains piss off all your neighbors, etc. In the country, it doesn't matter how much noise you make.

By repealing GS further by removing sections 20 and 32, they essentially gave these "shadow banks" the go ahead to keep up with their risky behavior. Furthermore, while Glass Steagall may not have prevented the crash, it most certainly would have prevented people from losing their savings and "nest egg" to the banks that convinced them to invest it because deposit and investment banks were now legal and they had a conflict of interest (should have been promoting safer savings practices but bc hunger for more capital, gave risky advice instead). I am a statistics major with a minor in actuarial sciences (finance & stats) and  while I recognize that you are correct that aspects of the subprime mortgage debacle were legal well beforehand, the dangerous gambling with depositor funds and the changing from 1:12 to 1:30 leveraging for banks is absolutely a significant factor in what caused the crash.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"itstriche","name":"t1_csw6bch","parent_id":"t1_csvxhz3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1436367633,"created_utc":1436364033}

Bill Clinton was ashamed of DOMA, and didn't have the power to stop it. It was fast tracked, and voted too popularly in both houses for him to veto it. He didn't hold a signing ceremony, and worried it would inflame hate for the gay community. Too may people whitewashing history here. I'm not a big fan of Hillary; I'm voting for Sanders, but Bill isn't the DOMA guy. He may have officially held the common stance, but he was by no means an "enemy" of the gay public.   		>Though his official political position was against same-sex marriage, Bill Clinton criticized DOMA as "unnecessary and divisive",[28] while his press-secretary called it "gay baiting, plain and simple".[29][30] However, after Congress had passed the bill with enough votes to override a presidential veto,[30] Clinton signed DOMA. He claims that he did so reluctantly in view of the veto-proof majority, both to avoid associating himself politically with the then-unpopular cause of same-sex marriage, and to defuse momentum for a proposed Federal Amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex marriage.[30][31] Clinton, who was traveling when Congress acted, signed it into law promptly upon returning to Washington, D.C., on September 21, 1996; he refused to hold a signing ceremony for DOMA and did not allow photographs to be taken of him signing it into law.[22] The White House released a statement in which Clinton said "that the enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination, violence or intimidation against any person on the basis of sexual orientation".[22] In 2013, Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary at the time, recalled that "[Clinton's] posture was quite frankly driven by the political realities of an election year in 1996."[30] James Hormel, who was appointed by Clinton as the first openly gay U.S. Ambassador, described the reaction from the gay community to Clinton signing DOMA as shock and anger.[32] On Hormel's account, Clinton had been the first President to advocate gay rights, push for AIDS funding, support gay and lesbian civil rights legislation, and appoint open LGBT people to his Administration.

From the start of Glass Steagall to 1980 we had very few bankruptcies for banks and no housing bubbles or real estate bubbles as compared to 1989 and 2008. I would like to add that the idea of selling mortgages is a terrible idea and the packaging of mortgages is one of the worst ideas ever. It keeps banks making bad loans and selling them, and the no one knows the people who made the loan. My mother used to call people who were behind in payments and knew the people by first name.
