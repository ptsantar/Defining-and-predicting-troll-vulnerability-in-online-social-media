{"body":"It feels like Bernie is one of the only politicians that gets any media coverage that is openly saying "Corruption is rampant in Washington", "Gay marriage should be legal", "Marijuana should be legal", "Corporations are the driving force behind fuckhead politicians." So many politicians receive a $10,000+ check and vote in favor of lower standards for citizens. Lower standards for health, for rights, for accountability, for transparency, for freedoms. These fuckheads are voting with the dollar, and Bernie seems to be a loud voice over the nonsense. If he gets elected I think President Sanders will be a name that will be remembered. I will vote for him. In my phone's calendar I have put, on November 1st, "Voting day November 3rd.", on November 2nd I've put, "Vote tomorrow you asshole" and on November 3rd, I've put "Vote today you lazy complacent shithead." Sanders and Elizabeth Warren feel like the only people who aren't shoveling obvious shit-covered lies into my ears.","depth":1,"score":1149,"ups":1149,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Brandongo","name":"t1_cqtmjtj","parent_id":"t1_cqtcnft","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430382132,"created_utc":1430378532}

Edit: (Looks like this is not the case, see below)		Political Party Declaration Forms		A registered voter currently affiliated with a political party who wishes to change their party affiliation must file a??Political Party Affiliation Declaration Form??55 days before a Primary Election.		A registered voter currently not affiliated with a political party may declare their party affiliation up to and including Primary Election day.		You can print and complete the Political Party Affiliation Declaration Form and mail or deliver to the??Commissioner of Registration??in your county or you can also file it with your municipal clerk. These cards are also available at your local Commissioner of Registration Office.		The Commissioner of Registration cannot accept faxed copies or an electronic transmission of Party Affiliation Declaration Forms, since an original signature is required.		So if you're registered independent I guess that means you're not affiliated with a party and you could change to democrat day of and still vote in the primary.

{"body":"Sure. In my state, the Democrats have a voting primary and the Republicans caucus. The rules in my state allow me to switch registration and participate in both. 		The caucus is held in a large meeting space. Once you sign in, all of the voters are separated into precincts - at mine, it was one precinct per table. We talked about the strengths of each candidate and ultimately held a vote as a fair way to choose the candidate that we wanted to advance. Then we talked about delegates. The delegates are the people who represent our precinct at the county, state, and eventually national conventions. We chose one and two alternates, and then we were done! We turned in our selection to the registration table. I'm not sure what happens with them after that, but delegates attend County and State conventions where more voting for platforms and candidates happens. 		Turnout for these events is super low, and there were only 8 people at my table and only two of us were under 60. Some precincts only had one or two people show up. If that happens, you get to choose the candidate yourself and automatically get to be a delegate. 		The delegates are expected to vote for the candidate that the precints agreed to, but theoretically they could do whatever they wanted. I was out of town and didn't attend the county convention so I didn't get to go further, but I hope I can make it all the way this cycle.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"squeel","name":"t1_cquogkc","parent_id":"t1_cqtqs6a","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430455571,"created_utc":1430451971}

{"body":"First, try not to resort so much to ad hominem. Your arguments are better than that.		Second, we should split this into two arguments, since you have misunderstood my meaning by a fair bit.		1. Is it better to vote for the 'lesser evil', or no one at all?	2. Is Hillary Clinton a lesser evil than the Republican candidate?			I have only been arguing the first; again, I haven't made any case for Hillary. My same argument (that voting for a lesser evil is a relative good) applies regardless of whether you hold Hillary or the Republican candidate to be the lesser evil. If you want to discuss the second, feel free to PM me, but my comments are made in the spirit of GOTV, don't waste your votes, not for the aim of promoting Clinton.		As to the lesser of two evils argument, I would like to know what portion you have an issue with. I don't know how my math can be 'false' (-3 is clearly higher than -10; if you disagree with the values assigned to a particular candidate, this is an issue of the second argument, not a fault of the two evils argument); and I don't see what is childish about taking the less of two bad options. This is a common issue of ethics, known as the trolley problem: the question of whether it's better to murder a murderer, or let him murder innocents, and so on. There is argument to be had here, there are some cases where most people find the 'greater good' to be morally repugnant (for example, murdering a healthy man for the organs you need to save numerous sick patients), there are controversial cases (murdering 'terrorists' in the name of preventing future attacks), and there are relatively widely accepted ones (choosing to steer your bus into one person or a crowd).		Practically speaking, the choice of which candidate to use is somewhat like finding your neighborhood on fire. Preferably, you would have foam or water. Unfortunately, your HOA never secured those options. Your neighbors are now arguing about whether to fight the fire with sand blasters or gasoline pumps. Clearly the sand blaster is not an ideal solution; it might be ineffective, even cause more damage than it prevents. But the gasoline is *clearly* going to cause even more damage than that, intensifying the fire. Voting for sand blaster, if nothing else, keeps your gasoline wielding neighbors from inflicting harm. Voting for neither doesn't stop the damage that will be done, it just increases the chance that the voters for gasoline will win (since otherwise, sand would've been your vote). Sitting on the sidelines while the neighborhood burns down doesn't do any good; sand blaster is at least good relative to the alternative.		If you want to argue whether Clinton would be the sand blaster or gasoline candidate, feel free to PM me, but otherwise, I don't understand your objection to voting for the lesser of two evils. It's a logical result of the way our electoral system is set up, where voters should spend their vote in the way that is most likely to lead to a favorable result. Where there are issues of 'spoiler' candidates, it illustrates the need for the system to be reformed; where the system has evolved to the point that there are only two mathematically viable candidates in a general election, it clearly has deprived the people of a full range of choice. However, choosing not to participate leads to the system being further closed off (as you allow smaller and smaller groups of voters to determine policy, policy will naturally move to support those small groups), leads to candidates who don't worry about your group, as you are classed as non-voting (and thus irrelevant to their winning), leads to systematic move away from the results you want.		In the Iraq War example, not referring to Clinton herself, but all we can vote on are the present candidates we have, not the past representatives we wish we'd had. If the man who was anti-war all along loses the primary, and you have an option between 'I supported the war, but now it should end', and 'Turn the entire middle east into a smoking crater', clearly the former is going to move the system in a way closer to your desired ends. When you vote for the latter, or don't vote, you are signalling that you are either apathetic to or supportive of not just the war continuing; but the attitude that supports continuing the war. The system shifts to support that view (in the military, by deploying troops and engaging in more conflicts; in civilian life, by altering policy to support such military actions, appointing bureaucrats and judges who will carry out such policies, and encouraging politicians to continue to move further toward that ideology to gain votes). The former candidate may still have made terrible decisions, but what matters is the military, domestic policy, political/judicial appointment, and tonal (given they have the bully pulpit) decisions they will make going forward.		The ultimate end game is to get to the point where you can reform the system, so that people have more power in guiding government and voting for their candidate, instead of voting against the other guy. Until you get to that point, though, the aim is to move the system to the point where that is possible, while minimizing damage along the way.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ifkl","name":"t1_cqtp0yw","parent_id":"t1_cqto54n","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430393119,"created_utc":1430389519}

Bernie has an outstanding voting record and votes his consciousness, not for his sponsors needs. You may not agree with him on everything, but unlike other candidates he doesn't sugar-coat, he doesn't try to be as bland as possible to appeal to everyone. No candidate will agree  with you on every issue, but some will pretend to. What's more important to know is who has influence over that politician and even if you don't always agree with him, Bernie's only influence is what he believes to be right for the people.		Can he get everything on his agenda done? No way. With the house and senate still controlled by followers of the oligarchy, he will be forced into compromises and he will be denied the changes he wants, but he can make serious progress in electoral reform and lead  the US out of servitude to political sponsors.		It's a chicken and egg problem. You can't get electoral reform without someone inside to push it, and you can't  get someone inside  without the reform. But Bernie might be able to break that. If he can become POTUS elections can be reformed and we can see waves of fresh politicians who can actually support doing the right thing for the american people, presenting a great example also for the rest of the world.","depth":2,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"creepy_doll","name":"t1_cqtnhse","parent_id":"t1_cqtkwof","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430385979,"created_utc":1430382379}

Remember that in voting, swing voters are the people that REALLY matter. There is a large percentage of people that will ALWAYS vote Republican or Democrat, Labor or Conservative, seemingly no matter what their representatives actually do. It doesn't matter how many TV adverts or newspaper adverts these people see, they're not changing their mind; so the campaign money isn't directed towards them. It's the small percentage of swing voters who don't make up their mind and change their vote each election - the people that ACTUALLY decide. Swinging that 1% In the right, carefully targeted areas of the country, can change an election. The money does have power.		EDIT: I guess my perspective is a bit more Australian, where voting is compulsory. So that swinging vote is even more important.

{"body":"Fucking *yes*. A snippet of Bernie Sanders highlights:		_________________		[Click here to read Bernie's voting record](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm)			**Public disclosure and transparency**		Sanders supports the DISCLOSE Act, which would make campaign finances more transparent and ban U.S. corporations controlled by foreign interests from making political expenditures.		**Media reform**		Sanders has been a leader in calling for media reform and opposes increased concentration of ownership of media outlets, as well as being a contributing author for OpEdNews.		**Health Care**		Sanders is a staunch supporter of a universal health care system, and has said "If you are serious about real healthcare reform, the only way to go is single-payer." Sanders is a social liberal, supporting LGBT rights, same-sex marriage, and pro-choice legislation. In the House he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act.		**Budget**		On September 24, 2008, Senator Sanders posted on his website a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, against the initial bailout proposal, drawing more than 8,000 citizen cosigners in the first 24 hours. On January 26, 2009, Sanders and Democrats Robert Byrd, Russ Feingold and Tom Harkin were the sole majority members to vote against confirmation of Timothy Geithner to be United States Secretary of the Treasury.		On December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an 8??-hour speech against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the proposed extension of the Bush-era tax rates that eventually became law, saying "Enough is enough! [...] How many homes can you own?" A long speech such as this is traditionally a filibuster, but because it didn't block action, it was not technically a filibuster under Senate rules.		**National acclaim**		On January 19, 2011, Sanders announced that his "filibuster" speech would be published in February 2011 by Nation Books as The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class, with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.		In response to his "filibuster," "activists across the country started talking up the notion of a 'Sanders for President' run in 2012, either as a dissident Democrat in the primaries or as a left-leaning Independent." Hundreds of people signed online petitions urging Sanders to run, and pollsters began measuring his support in key primary states. Progressive activists such as Rabbi Michael Lerner and economist David Korten publicly voiced their support for a prospective Sanders run against President Barack Obama. At that time, Sanders disavowed any interest in a presidential run, saying he was "very proud to be Vermont's Senator," and maintaining that "I am very content to be where I am, but I am flattered by that kind of response."		Sanders hinted at running for president in 2016, and had been making public appearances in various states, as is typical of potential candidates. On April 30, 2015, Bernie Sanders announced his 2016 bid for presidency.		Sanders won the 2014 Col. Arthur T. Marix Congressional Leadership Award from the Military Officers Association of America for his leadership in support of veterans.		**2013 U.S. government shutdown**		??? The real issue here, if you look at the Koch Brothers' agenda, is: look at what many of the extreme right-wing people believe. Obamacare is just the tip of the iceberg. These people want to abolish the concept of the minimum wage, they want to privatize the Veteran's Administration, they want to privatize Social Security, end Medicare as we know it, massive cuts in Medicaid, wipe out the EPA, you don't have an Environmental Protection Agency anymore, Department of Energy gone, Department of Education gone. That is the agenda. And many people don't understand that the Koch Brothers have poured hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into the Tea Party and to other kinds of ancillary organizations to push this agenda.??? ???Senator Bernie Sanders, MSNBC News (October 7, 2013) 		**2015 Saudi demand for U.S. to fight ISIS**		???I find it remarkable that Saudi Arabia, which borders Iraq and is controlled by a multi-billion dollar family, is demanding that U.S. combat troops have ???boots on the ground??? against ISIS. Where are the Saudi troops? With the third largest military budget in the world and an army far larger than ISIS, the Saudi government must accept its full responsibility for stability in their own region of the world. Ultimately, this is a profound struggle for the soul of Islam, and the anti-ISIS Muslim nations must lead that fight. While the United States and other western nations should be supportive, the Muslim nations must lead.???	???Senator Bernie Sanders, US Senate (March 6, 2015)		Sanders introduced the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 (S. 893; 113th Congress) into the Senate on May 8, 2013. The bill would increase the disability compensation rate for American veterans and their families.		Sanders co-wrote, with Senator John McCain, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014, a bill intended to reform the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in response to the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014.		HIV/AIDS advocates have praised Sanders for a bill he introduced in 2012 that aimed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for HIV patients.		**Netanyahu speech boycott**		On March 3, 2015, Sanders declined to attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress. He said that the address, arranged without consultation with President Obama, improperly interfered with the President's role. He also argued that it was inappropriate for Netanyahu to use the U.S. Congress for his own political purposes so close to the Israeli legislative election. After the speech, Sanders released a statement supporting the Obama administration's diplomatic effort to address Iran's nuclear program and regretting that Netanyahu's speech did not offer "any serious alternatives" to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.","depth":0,"score":73,"ups":73,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cqtpw8b","parent_id":"t3_34cai1","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430396520,"created_utc":1430392920}

I really despise when people vote because of things like this rather than taking a look at what the candidate has done in the past. The good thing is that this is changing. For example, tumblr has a huge feminist base and is exactly the demographic who would probably vote for Hillary. However, there are many posts going around on tumblr about the shady things she has done in the past, and she'll only get their vote if she makes it to the general election (vs. the Republican candidate, who will most likely be pretty right wing). I think that's a definite step in the right direction. In the 2008 election I was in middle school and, if given the chance to vote, would've voted for her because she was a woman. Now that I'm older, I have a much better understanding of the situation and don't base my vote on how the candidates were born. 		Maybe someday I will see a female president.

{"body":"In my opinion, gay marriage and weed are both evidence that it's possible to change overall political opinion by simply beating people over the head with the facts. No one "sweet talked" the right into accepting gay marriage, the discussion simply became loud and concrete enough that there were no ways left to dispute it. The ambiguity fell out the bottom, and once people realized gay people were gay _people_ (as opposed to _gay_ "people"), there was no basis left to block progress except on grounds of bigotry and religious dogma.		Marijuana, same thing: the facts have simply been repeated long and often enough that all arguments against now are clearly seen as empty and hollow, as well as clearly driven by the privatized prison industry and political interest in maintaining inequality.		So, the issue of "socialism" should be discussed with the facts first and foremost. There's no way to "sweet talk" people into accepting it if they still think it's something other than it is (just like people who think all gays are pedophiles will never accept them, or people who think marijuana is deadly addictive will never allow its legalization). The only way forward is a clear and open discussion about _what socialism is about_, and in how many ways it would actually benefit US society.		Honestly, I don't think any issue before has had a lobby opposing it as strongly. Gay marriage is about religion and values, marijuana is about power and control, but socialism is largely about _money_. It's the antithesis to the cold, hard capitalism espoused as all-but-religion in the US today. It runs counter to the values of the American dream itself. The kind of socialism I live in, here in Sweden, maintains the truth that "not everyone can make it, and those who can't deserve government-run help of society around them". You seem immediately how that runs counter to the "anyone can make it" mentality of American culture, and how no amount of sweet talking will change that unless we discuss what "make it" means and whether or not the possibility to actually do so even exist at all today.		I'm ranting. I still think him merely being in the debate can be a strong force for real change in the way politics is seen by voters. If someone who actually discusses real policy and hammers down uncomfortable truths as fact can make himself heard at all, people will take notice. They'll hear the difference between that and the same old tired talking points of every other carbon copy candidate, and demand actual answer from them.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Endemoniada","name":"t1_cqtsajn","parent_id":"t1_cqtqx7u","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430403015,"created_utc":1430399415}

That _is_ how a democracy works. 51% will always say "fuck you" to the other 49%.

{"body":">That's not how democracy works Sweden.		Well, evidently it is.		Still, it's just an _agreement_ between the parties, and not in any way actually legally binding. The only thing keeping it up is political capital.		Also, nothing _beside_ the budget is being covered by this agreement. The minority block's policies can still be voted down in parliament.		Also, the ruling block is only in minority when compared to the entire rest of parliament. That's the wrong way to look at it, since the corresponding _block_ (the alliance) has fewer votes, and the remaining two parties (the lefts and SD) aren't really members of either block. Without SD deliberately voting for a budget they _in no way whatsoever_ actually support (in fact, they actively _oppose_ it), the minority government would actually have won the budget vote. The December agreement basically ensures the same result as if SD either didn't vote, or actually voted for their own budget proposal. Since SD is intent on sabotaging the government, despite doing so actually being against their own politics, the agreement offsets _that_ particular anti-democratic tactic.		So you tell me: how is one party with 13% of the votes deliberately voting for a budget none of their members _or_ voters actually like or want any more democratic than agreeing to offset that tactic by the opposition block laying down their votes?		None of this would have happened if SD had respected the democratic process to begin with. The December agreement is, currently, a necessary evil to protect the government from deliberate sabotage by a malevolent, rogue party.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Endemoniada","name":"t1_cqtrzbt","parent_id":"t1_cqtrqhs","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430402295,"created_utc":1430398695}

Example: I'm an independent, however the area where I live is so Republican that in our local elections, only Republicans run for office.  I had to register as a Republican for the primary so that I could vote, as the winners of the primaries run unopposed in the actual election.  In my case, whoever wins the primary wins the election.		As one can gather, closed primary elections are one of the prime examples used to demonstrate a bias towards a two-party system in the US.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"just_tryin_to_help_b","name":"t1_cqtqbkx","parent_id":"t1_cqtohmg","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430397932,"created_utc":1430394332}

{"body":"OK, I'll give you facts		**1) These are his current campaigning points:**		* Rebuilding of Crumbling Infrastructure	* Addressing Climate Change	* Introducing a Real Tax Reform		*At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we need a progressive tax system in this country which is based on ability to pay. It is not acceptable that major profitable corporations have paid nothing in federal income taxes, and that corporate CEOs in this country often enjoy an effective tax rate which is lower than their secretaries. It is absurd that we lose over $100 billion a year in revenue because corporations and the wealthy stash their cash in offshore tax havens around the world. The time is long overdue for real tax reform.	Protecting the* 		* Protecting the Most Vulnerable Americans with a safety-net		*Millions of seniors live in poverty and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country. We must strengthen the social safety net, not weaken it. Instead of cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and nutrition programs, we should be expanding these programs.*		* Health Care as a Right for All	* Taking on Wall Street	* Making College Affordable for All	* Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers	* Pay Equality for Women Workers	* Raising the Minimum Wage 	* Growing the  Trade Union Movement		*Union workers who are able to collectively bargain for higher wages and benefits earn substantially more than non-union workers. Today, corporate opposition to union organizing makes it extremely difficult for workers to join a union. We need legislation which makes it clear that when a majority of workers sign cards in support of a union, they can form a union.*	*		* Creating Worker Co-Ops		*We need to develop new economic models to increase job creation and productivity. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations which ship our jobs to China and other low-wage countries, we need to provide assistance to workers who want to purchase their own businesses by establishing worker-owned cooperatives. Study after study shows that when workers have an ownership stake in the businesses they work for, productivity goes up, absenteeism goes down and employees are much more satisfied with their jobs.*		**2) These are the political views based on his past voting records:**		**Strongly Opposes -> Opposes -> Neutral -> Favors -> Strongly Favors**		**Strongly Opposes:**		* Strongly Opposes topic 4: Keep God in the public sphere 	* Strongly Opposes topic 6: Privatize Social Security 	* Strongly Opposes topic 7: Vouchers for school choice 	* Strongly Opposes topic 8: No 'rights' to clean air and water 	* Strongly Opposes topic 9: Stricter punishment reduces crime 	* Strongly Opposes topic 13: Support & expand free trade 	* Strongly Opposes topic 14: Maintain US sovereignty from UN 	* Strongly Opposes topic 19: Never legalize marijuana 		**Opposes:**		* Opposes topic 15: Expand the military 			**Neutral:** 		* Neutral on topic 10: Absolute right to gun ownership 			**Favors:**		* Favors topic 12: Pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens 			**Strongly Favors:**		* Strongly Favors topic 1: Abortion is a woman's unrestricted right 	* Strongly Favors topic 2: Legally require hiring women & minorities 	* Strongly Favors topic 3: Comfortable with same-sex marriage 	* Strongly Favors topic 5: Expand ObamaCare 	* Strongly Favors topic 11: Higher taxes on the wealthy 	* Strongly Favors topic 16: More enforcement of the right to vote 	* Strongly Favors topic 17: Stay out of Iran 	* Strongly Favors topic 18: Prioritize green energy 	* Strongly Favors topic 20: Stimulus better than market-led recovery 		**3) He cannot be bought.**  Bernie Sanders does not accept any contributions/donations from Wall Street or Super PACs - all of his campaign money is donated from individuals.

{"body":">Who the fuck wants Joe Biden as president?		10% of the people polled. And why not? Obviously the current Democrat voters thought he was a good choice for VP. As a Democratic strategist, I'd honestly be scared for the coming election, if your current voters are disapproving your current polices, by not wanting what is seen as a continuation of the current Democrat in office. That would mean that somehow the party needs a radical change to even win the voters who would just vote for a Democrat, because they had a (D) beside their name. Also, there is a lot of tradition for VPs to run for President, I'd suspect that a lot of his support is because of name recognition of the fact that he is VP, more than anything.		This data isn't worthless. It's showing that more moderate or right leaning Democrats have more support than someone like Sanders. Remember, a party doesn't need to win support of their base, they need to win support of the swing voters to win. Data like this shows that even among their own party, a candidate like Sanders has little to no support compared to the more right leaning Democrats, which would pull more of the swing voters in.		A lot of Americans in the middle choose the lesser of two evils when it comes to politics. Data like this is showing that your average Republican would pull more of those swing voters that someone as left as Sanders wouldn't. To be honest, polling with this much disparity, could even show that Democrats might even lose part of their base to a moderate Republican, if a far left candidate like Sanders somehow makes it to the general election.","depth":7,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"YankeeQuebec","name":"t1_cqtp5pl","parent_id":"t1_cqtowcj","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430393701,"created_utc":1430390101}

Two, he got minorities to vote because they had a candidate they could identify with. Three, a lot of people voted for him because he wasn't Bush. Four, we were in two money sucking wars people wanted out of.		Sanders is not young, he's a baby boomer senior citizen. He's white, and won't pull the minority votes like Obama did. We also have no wars sucking away our money at an incredible pace like we did in 2008, so people will have other issues on their minds, like taxes they want lowered, and Sanders wants raised. And, people tend to vote against the former party generally over the past 60 years, like how Democrats got people to vote against Republicans because of Bush. Republicans will pick up a lot of votes just because they don't share Obama's Democratic party views.		While he may have won 2008 decisively, he actually lost a lot of votes in 2012, and Republicans picked them up. His policies have also lead to Republicans taking over the house and senate both midterm elections. His Presidency is oddly like Clinton's, where healthcare and gun control lost control of Congress, and a lot of people voting against Gore in 2000 because they didn't want another Democrat in office.		While Obama may have been the most liberal candidate at the time, he has turned out to be anything but liberal, which will hurt a lot of the swing votes, and have disenfranchised a lot of people from voting for Democrats, as we just saw a few months ago. 		Also, while Obama may have seemed liberal, his rhetoric, views, and pandering to the swing voters wasn't extreme at all, he pretty much seemed to be your average Democrat, which is what we got.

{"body":"> Unless you don't like what they might choose eh?		A woman should be able to do *whatever the fuck* she wants with her own body without the state (what you Americans usually call "government") telling her what she can do with her body. States telling women they cannot get abortions is a far more egregious violation of the civil rights in the Constitution than the federal government changing laws on their end to allow women to do whatever the fuck she wants with her body, even if it somehow violates the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.		A man or a woman should be able to marry *whoever the fuck* they want regardless of the gender of their partner without the state telling them who they can or cannot marry. States telling men women they cannot marry people of the same gender is a far more egregious violation of the civil rights in the Constitution than the federal government changing laws on their end to allow men and women to  marry whoever the fuck they want, even if it somehow violates the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.		>States being able to decide for themselves what is considered legal is more freedom, it's less centralized control, and that's a good thing.		In my view the individual rights set out in the Constitution trump the separation of powers or states' rights any day of the week, month or year. A war was fought over this, and those who thought that states rights should trump civil rights lost decisively.		>Realizing that some (many) issues are too important and too polarizing to leave up to an elite few in Washington is being a friend to freedom.		Except that "elite few" are also known as the "Founding Fathers," and they tried to build a liberal (as in "liberty") democracy with a robust set of civil individual rights. Allowing states to violate those rights is contrary to what the Founding Fathers would have wanted, it is anti-liberty, it is allowing the state (as in "government" and as in "state in the union") to quash civil rights over some pathetic turf war with the federal government.		>He's saying it's not up to him and a handful of politicians in DC to decide, and that's the correct position to take.		Actually., Rand Paul is **against** both abortion and gay marriage. He is **against** liberties and civil rights. He simply tries to frame it as a "states' rights" issue because gullible people buy into that rhetoric and still think he is a "libertarian" despite the fact that he wants to actively deny people liberties.		>It makes no difference how he personally feels about them. 		This is a bad excuse to give someone who shouts "freedom" and "liberty" from the rooftops, yet is against freedom and liberty for a huge portion of the population a free pass.

The other is completely rooted in religion, and shouldn't even be in the political realm, and I'm sure Rand would agree, his father certainly did.
