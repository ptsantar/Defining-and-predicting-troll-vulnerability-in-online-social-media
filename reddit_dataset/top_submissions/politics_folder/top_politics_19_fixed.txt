{"body":"Just out of curiosity, because it irks me when people put weed on a pedastal over opiates, why do you think pot is so much better and opiates are so bad? Most opiates, besides methadone and suboxone, are natural and come from the poppy plant. It isn't some crazy thing made up in a lab.  Like pot, it grows out of the ground. In the wrong hands it can be addictive sure, but so are a lot of things. Opium has been around for thousands of years, just as long, if not longer than cannabis. Sorry your friend had to go through that. As a chronic pain patient, I say take what works. If it is pot, go for it, if it is morphine or oxy, whatever. Some people really need that stuff to live a normal life, me included. I am just getting tired of opiates getting labeled some evil drug specifically made by big pharma who is trying to make money and cause addiction. This stuff has been around for thousands of years before they came around and made oxy. Mainly because like pot, it comes from a plant that grows incredibly easy almost worldwide. It seems like maybe you should open your mind a bit because you def are propping pot up, and knocking narcotic pain meds down. When there exists ample research showing the benefits of these medications. They are not bad in themselves. I take them and don't have a problem, just like a lot of people. This mentality of, smoke weed and don't take pills because weed is natural and better is absurd. They are both drugs that come from a plant, both natural, both been around for thousands of years, and both will be around for another thousand years. Not trying to get down on you. Just been seeing lots of these types of posts lately. I beg you as someone who needs these meds, can we please stop demonizing them? It is getting harder and harder for people like me to just have our meds we need.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"probpoopin","name":"t1_cnnm11l","parent_id":"t1_cnn1sjd","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1421163321,"created_utc":1421163321}

There are speculations on how this happens, but nothing concrete that can lead us to efficient and safe treatments. Especially in the long term. I do feel bad for tour loss. However, blaming the doctors for filling a script is wrong IMHO. They took the pills, no one forced them to do it. Unless they took them not as prescribed, there is no reason they should have died.

Well that's the point of the show -- that it's not literally all legal, nor would it ever be.

This can very easily lead to an increase in poorer performance in the workplace and increased unemployment. On the other hand, legalization may cause a decrease in getting the drug on the street which will no doubt raise the cost of buying the drug.

The laws for property seizure in drug busts, the amount of money paid into the legal system through attorney and court expenses, the back taxes fined for siezed narcotics, and the amount of budget allotted to police task forces dealing with narcotics is an industry dealing with billions of dollars.		The fact that pharmaceuticals have persisted in claiming that cannabis is a dangerous substance, yet continues to pursue isolation of cannabinoids to patent medicine is just...right there on the surface.

In order to buy pot, you have to enter the underground black market of drugs, where pot is thrown around with other drugs ie. coke, heroin etc..

Making it legal and having someone purchase pot through a controlled, licensed vendor will remove that problem.  So there is nothing inherently "gateway" about weed, just the prohibition.  If alcohol was illegal it'd be the same thing. 		edit:  Also worth noting, it's interesting how pot falls into "drugs" whereas alcohol is in it's own categories.  For instance, you never hear someone saying "he was addicted to drugs, it was alcohol", instead you usually hear the phrase "alcohol and drugs".  When someone sees that a relatively harmless substance like weed is associated with the term "drug", he or she may feel that since this so called "drug" isn't as bad as the propaganda is making it.  Then maybe these other substances really are not as harmful as they seem, and hey, if DARE taught us anything, it's the some of these drugs will provide pure feelings of euphoria and ecstasy (no pun intended), so why not try it while we're at it.
