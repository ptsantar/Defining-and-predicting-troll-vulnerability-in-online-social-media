{"body":"Bernie Sanders' track record on civil liberties is impeccable.		He voted against:		* [The USA PATRIOT Act](https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/8289#.VUPCnvlViko)		* [The FISA Amendments Act of 2007](https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/17101#.VUPBcPlViko)		* [FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2012](https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41654#.VUPCBflViko)		That's the beauty of the fact that he's been in our national legislature since 1991.  You can cross-reference his speeches and his voting record, and determine whether he means what he says.		I encourage everyone to check out his [voting record](https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/27110/bernie-sanders#.VUPFK_lViko) and, if you like what's there, to contribute to his campaign.		Edit: Thanks for the reddit gold, but only if you've already donated to Bernie's campaign.		I donated about a month ago and then [again yesterday](http://imgur.com/OE5aB3D).  I hope some of you will be joining me.		[Here is the link to donate to his campaign.](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lets-go-bernie?refcode=homepage_topright)		Obligatory--thanks for the reddit gold, but Bernie's campaign needs the money way more than my comment does.  Please stop gilding this comment and donate the money instead.		Edit: the mods here removed this comment without notifying me of the removal.  I asked them about it and they said the removal was because I solicited donations.  However, other people in this thread and elsewhere have been doing the exact same thing.  They've finally reinstated it, but there were a solid 10 or so hours during which this comment was missing.","depth":0,"score":3689,"ups":3689,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CarrollQuigley","name":"t1_cqv9ll9","parent_id":"t3_34jf21","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430508679,"created_utc":1430505079}

Purely "in the smoke of its own fat," however, leads me to say that we would be unlikely to call such meat "barbecue" - but we'd happily eat it. Plenty of great steaks and burgers cook that way every summer. 		Confounding the issue is that Californians (and some varieties of Yankees) think that grilling is barbecuing, and call a party at which they grill food a "barbecue" - while no one from the south or southwest would say that of simply grilling or cooking outdoors.

{"body":"I'm just gonna copy-paste an old post on this subject as it is quite relevant to this.	-----------------		There hasn't been "pure" socialism anywhere any more than there has been "pure" communism anywhere, so it's a little difficult to set up an example if you're after any kind of pure system.		We have historically tried somewhat pure capitalism (it was dystopic for many people, at first), but it begun working better, socially, when we started taking care of [market failures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act) and caring for the underprivileged with safety nets. Today, the US is lagging behind and fucking up things again by ignoring the problems with pure capitalism.		The closest thing we have to "pure" socialism, I would say, is [Norway's democratic socialism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) It still has many capitalistic features, of course, but it also has many socialistic features.		[Scandinavia in general](http://www.vexen.co.uk/countries/best.html) is pretty similar, as well.		In the 1920s, the economy was pretty bad in Europe, and the situation in Norway was no exception. In addition to dealing with the fallout of other nations' economic problems in various ways, Norway had mass-produced wares for World War I, and suddenly there was no demand (among other problems like increased inequality and lack of industrial materials). 		The deflation that followed was absolutely devastating, and no amount of individualism would solve the problem: the individual farmer or fisher had no other choice but to try to increase production to sell more, but that only drove the prices down and forced people to increase production even further. For the industrial worker, refusal to accept the much lower wages due to deflation resulted in strikes met by lockouts and strike breakers.		There was no other choice but to cooperate, and so people came together and formed the dairy product cooperatives, for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tine_(company)		This forced cooperation throughout the workers due to the deflation crisis set the stage for what was going to be the Norwegian way of doing things even to this day.		[The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions) became a prevalent force, and it has been closely connected to the Norwegian Labour Party ever since its inception (and they have extremely close ties even today in 2014).		Meanwhile in the 1920s, the extremely left-wing Labour Party in Norway went through a bit of a change and split up into various factions: the Communist Party, the Social Democrats, and the Labour Party.		In 1927, the party merged with the Social Democrats again, and they actually formed the government for 18 whole days in 1928. The king asked them to form government as they were the biggest party, but because Norway has negative parliamentarism, they were taken down by a no confidence vote by the Norwegian parliament: Stortinget. 		After this, they realized that complete reform was off the table, and so they calmed down their radical, revolutionary sentiment.		In 1933, they put out an [extremely well-done propaganda poster](http://i.imgur.com/PaiT7oy.jpg) all over Norway. 	("City and land, hand in hand. The entirety of the people at work.")		They handily won the election as democratic socialists under the name "The Norwegian Labour Party", which is what they were called until very recently when they changed their name back to just "Labour Party". (DNA: Det Norske Arbeiderparti).		It wasn't until 1935 that they had a "pure" government, however, and since 1935 they have been in charge of Norway almost the entire time. The Labour Party took Keynes' new theories to heart, just as Roosevelt did with his New Deal, and things improved dramatically for Norway up until the German invasion.		The years after World War II are considered the "golden age" of the Labour Party with a supermajority control of the government. The prime minster from this period, Einar Gerhardsen, goes by the nickname "Landsfaderen" (the father of the nation) for his fantastic work in rebuilding Norway after World War II with the help of Keynes' economic theories.		After finding oil (the Ekofisk discovery in 1969 was a pivotal find), the profits were socialized through the state owned company Statoil in 1972, and the economy was boosted as a result.		This find helped Norway secure an emergency fund for lasting through crises, which is one of the major reasons why Norway has survived so well through the 2008 depression.		In total, there were only 16 years since 1935 that the Norwegian Labour Party was not in charge, and they have been socialistic the entire time.		---------		Now, a couple of points on Scandinavia. First of all, if you link me to historical revisionism from mises.org, I might punch you over the internet.		Furthermore:		1) Size is a poor excuse. A higher population makes things more difficult but by no means impossible. Besides, you could easily make the comparison of the EU as a whole compared to the US in arguments such as universal healthcare, etc.		2) Homogeneity is certainly helpful, but not anywhere near as important as racists claim. What's more important are factors that interact with and reinforce homogeneity across cultural borders: [equality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) and [overall peace.](http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/global-peace-index) These factors play off of each other along with homogeneity, but to claim that homogeneity is the sole cause or something is ignorant.		3) The oil argument is libertarian / conservative propaganda.		The social safety net in Norway has historically been paid for by **high taxes**, not the Government Pension Fund (oil fund). If it were paid for by oil money, it wouldn't be sustainable in the least (the fund, even though it is huge, would be gone in a few short years).		It is against the rules to spend more than 4% of the fund per year. Since it is an emergency fund, it is taken care of well. Some years (like 2007), it's not touched at all and just grows.		It is a myth that it is simply oil money that lead to the success in Norway: sound fiscal policy, spread wealth, technology building, nationalization of the energy sector, high education, stable global region, close situation to the market, predictable and stable government, balanced mix between taxes and benefits...the list goes on.		Furthermore, Norway, ever since around 1850s, has never been poor in relation to other countries. Even before Norway found oil,  it had a better standard of living and GDP per capita than for example Sweden.		That Norway has historically been extremely poor is bad history that you'll hear all over the place, but **it is wrong.** If you want to argue this point, take it up with [this professor of economic history.](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Honningdal_Grytten)		Here's [one link to his book](http://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/71b541ce552753e1f72b328437e87bad.nbdigital;jsessionid=06CDCD2F18069EDBDAC7027175119C53.nbdigital3?lang=en#0), but I'm not sure if you can access it.

This needs to be addressed. Do you know which other European nation is against austerity at the moment? Greece; and look how well that's going for them. You cannot simply deny being poor and ignore it, you have to do something about it and not screw over future generations. 		The Conservatives are planning on 15% of our energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. From 2002 to 2011 there has been a 1181%-change in energy produced by renewable means in the UK.	 	As for disbanding the armed forces; this sounds like a very good idea to a very narrow minded type of individual. Yes, the armed forces are sometimes called upon to enforce sanctions/ legislation/ the will of the UN Security Council abroad. Yes, they sometimes get it wrong by accident, however, this doesn't even slightly cover the good that they do. Search-And-Rescue (land and sea), humanitarian aid (Ebola, the Australian bush fires and Nepal most recently come to mind), oceanographic mapping, standing in for any of the emergency services when they decide to go on strike, escorting hostile aircraft from our airspace, assisting civil powers in times of need (Iranian embassy siege/ when flood defences fail to hold)... The list goes on! 		Remember, when voting for an individual/ party you are not voting for a cherry-picked few of their policies, you are voting for ALL of them.

Cameron was a disaster as a PM, and he's got no compassion for the disadvantaged. The wealthiest 1,000 have doubled their wealth, whilst real income has stagnated for years.

Private schools losing their charitable status - Considering things I've seen like stuff like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbQv-YSA_rI) I can't say I'm 100% opposed to that idea either.		No new airports or runways built - well that seems a little silly, I think we should focus on making technology cleaner rather than turning our back on it.		Being a member of Al Qaeda not being an offence - Don't you think we should judge someone on their actions and not on their political affiliations?  If someone actually commits an offense yes let's lock them up, but I can see not wanting to charge someone with a crime simply for being affiliated with an organization, no matter how heinous.		Leaving NATO - Well Britain doesn't really need it anymore, but I do think the pros in being a member of NATO out weigh the cons.		Disbanding the armed forces - Do they actually advocate that?  That sounds crazy, what happens if some people invade?  I find it hard to believe the greens actually just want to stick their head in the ground and pretend nations don't need militaries.. but if you say so, I'm gonna go google it.		I'm pro nature reserves so if you were gonna do something with former military bases nature reserves isn't a bad way to go.		So overall, I'd have to say the greens don't seem *too* out there.

{"body":"Banning mags over 10 rounds: Let's start with this and I'll use a story from Lindsay Graham's testimony on the Senate Judiciary Committee. A girl had her house broken into and she grabbed a revolver. The attacker was trying to rape her so she fired every round into the guy. It took all 6 to bring him down. Now what if was two guys? The other guy might continue the attack. What if there were 3 people? What if she missed? She would be out of ammo and her life might have ended. Now Sanders wants to ban mags over ten rounds. 10 rounds might not be enough to save yourself. If I have a 30 round AR-15 I could fend off pretty much anyone. I have a much better chance of survival. Most civilians only have one magazine loaded at a time for defense and generally not in the gun.		Now let's look at the criminal aspects. Criminals will get mags regardless of legality. They already get illegal guns. And having a smaller mag is not an issue for a criminal. They aren't being suddenly attacked and have time to plan and pack extra mags. You know you can switch mags pretty fast and you can tape two ten round mags together for a quick reload effectively giving you 20 rounds. How does banning these magazines help anyone? Why the fuck would a criminal even concern themself when they can buy them illegally. 		All the ban did in Colorado is force out Magpul and make people unemployed. I haven't heard of any drop in gun crime. The gangs still have thier old mags.		I have other issues, but I'm mobile and tired of texting.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HEBushido","name":"t1_cqvlmtx","parent_id":"t1_cqvl5b6","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430530752,"created_utc":1430527152}

You can't just devastate the country and then leave saying "sorry for the 2+ million dead and that terrorist state tumor that we inadvertently created" (although we did that anyway). So I think that might have been why he didn't want to just pull out.		If you wanna talk about Syria, then yeah. I don't know exactly why he wanted to go there. Probably some perverse reasoning that had to do with eliminating an enemy of Israel and generally keeping the region unstable. So fuck McCain for that.		But to just say that he wanted to bomb/invade to resolve every international crisis I think is a bit of a simplistic interpretation of his views.		I would also bet that we would have had a very definitive anti-torture bill passed by now under McCain. We haven't had anything approaching that under Obama.

As long as Citizens United is still the law of the land and insurers have 15-20% of the single largest segment of the American economy (medicine) at their disposal, it will be hard to get those profiteering 'foxes' out of the public's tax-paying henhouse.		I *despise* the ACA for the fact that we, as citizens are legally required to subsidize the incomes of elitist investors and CEO's in the for-profit *private* insurance industry at the same time the Medicare spending curve is being pushed down to allow tax subsidies to remain for their benefit. When our business is guaranteed by law, why does anyone in the insurance industry require a large income, it is not as if they have to actually provide a decent quality of product or even *work* to get customers - we have been handed over to them to profit off of, like the human chattel that we are..		Pay mind to the quality of care brokered by insurers. 54.9% rating found by the studies and assessments reported in the New England Journal of Medicine and 55% when the Rand Corp., looked into it.		If Bernie Sanders can push us toward a Medicare for all system that delivers better care and holds costs down at the same time the front-end of medical need - *diet* can be addressed, (let's get rid of the corn subsidy - do we really need HFCS at the number 1 food extender in the processed things we stupidly eat?) by holding the FDA and the USDA to task for allowing certain chemicals and refined ingredients into the food supply, it'd be a great start.

{"body":"I've also noticed that some socialists can get very angry when people cant view things from their perspective. I think its kind of like atheism, in that they feel as if they've been lied to their whole life, and they get angry when others can't see the "truth."		(I'd like to point out that whats true to me may be false to you, and that what's true to you may be false to me. Truth is very subjective.)		The problem with free association is that its not entirely free. You need to work in order to survive. Sure, the worker may be able to work for someone else, but he is still (in a way) forced into working for somebody. They often choose the lesser of the available evils in regards to their employer. 		The main problem that socialists have with this scenario is that you are "exploiting" the worker. This means that the worker may be producing $40 worth of product an hour, but he is only paid $20 an hour. Of course, he cannot receive the full profits of his labor, since some of the profits have to go towards maintaining the farm. Some of his profits would be going towards the capitalist in this situation, he who owns the farm. The capitalist does no labor himself, but is still allowed to take a portion of the profit just because his name is on the deed. 		Socialism does not appeal to the capitalist, but to the worker. It says to the worker, "Why should the capitalist profit off of your labor, while doing no labor himself? Youre the one who is out here all day picking crops while he sits at home and does whatever he likes all day!"		Just like how politically the will of the people isn't really executed when one person rules over everyone else, socialists think that the will of the workers (the majority of the workforce) isn't executed when one person rules over the workers. Many socialists advocate using direct democracy, or at least representative  democracy in the workplace.		I don't really want you to all of a sudden become a socialist from reading this, I'm just trying to explain the reasoning behind socialism. But if this has gotten you interested in learning more, there's a bunch of subreddits out there dedicated to socialism and leftist movements. /r/communism101 and /r/anarchy101 are pretty good places to start.

This means that the worker may be producing $40 worth of product an hour, but he is only paid $20 an hour.		But he agreed to that wage.  And the $40 of value per hour wouldn't be possible in the first place if it wasn't for the owner.  If I own a car, and let someone else use it as their taxi service, I would still want a cut since it's my car that's being used.  Even if I don't do any of the labor to earn the extra money, I still earned that car in the first place.		>Socialism does not appeal to the capitalist, but to the worker. It says to the worker, "Why should the capitalist profit off of your labor, while doing no labor himself? Youre the one who is out here all day picking crops while he sits at home and does whatever he likes all day!"

Nuclear is not a solution for the expensive power generation, because you cant just ramp it up or down when needed.		My point is solar and nuclear compete for the same segment of the energy delivered. People use much less energy at night. Regardless of weather you use nuclear or solar, you still need the expensive energy generation, or a lot of storage.		Say a consumer requires X energy at night. During the day they require X+Y. During peak hours they require X+Y+Z. Now this is mostly speculation on my part, but can Nuclear really be used to supply anything other than X? My understanding is you can't just turn a nuclear plant off at night.		Maybe the best thing to do is have a nuclear plant provide X 24/7. Then you have solar with a small home battery to provide Y and Z. Or, we could dump the entire grid, and have localized micro grids and use solar plus a local battery array to provide X+Y+Z to a neighborhood, with a small gas back up generator.

{"body":">My understanding is you can't just turn a nuclear plant off at night.		The nuclear power plants onboard naval ships constantly alter power to answer whatever bell the bridge is asking for. They are fundamentally the same design as many civilian reactors. 		The problem is not that it can't throttle, but that it costs pretty much exactly the same to run the plant at 100% throttle or if you're sitting in hot standby. The costs are in construction, and manpower. Fuel is only 5-10% of the cost of electricity from a reactor(and would be considerably less if using breeder designs that don't leave 95% of the fuel sitting unused in the spent fuel rod). 		They could easily be used during the day and shut off at night, but that would be expensive power. Our current nuke designs are really only competitive when operating at nearly 100%. Other designs could quite likely be built for much cheaper(a huge portion of the cost is purely because we use pressurized water, which adds so much complexity its not funny. But the navy wanted light water moderated reactors for reasons), and have commensurate reduction in cost to operate, but nobody really wants to front the billions the new designs would cost to create. Except the chinese and indians, so we'll likely be buying from them in the future. :/		>Maybe the best thing to do is have a nuclear plant provide X 24/7. Then you have solar with a small home battery to provide Y and Z.		Indeed. I never suggested, or intended to suggest, that wind and solar were valueless. They will certainly play a major part in our energy infrastructure. But if they don't play the whole part, then we're still burning coal and ng. 		>Or, we could dump the entire grid, and have localized micro grids and use solar plus a local battery array to provide X+Y+Z to a neighborhood		This could work in some areas, but highly concentrated cities are simply not going to have the surface area to meet demands. One of the most major drawbacks of renewables(aside from geothermal and hydro) is how diffuse hey are. They simply require a ton of space. 		Also, solar is of pitiful use in many areas. Where I live, we have strong wind resources, but our solar is crap. Winter irradiance is 1/4 that of summer, so basically solar is shit 4 months of the year. But wind sucks in cities(turbulence, iirc), and small wind turbines just suck, regardless of where you put them. Which means giant utility scale turbines being set up many miles from the customers.		And finally, while household batteries will likely be a thing in many areas soonish(and indeed, can be in some right now), those are simply going to be infeasible for industry applications. 		So we'll still need plenty of grid for much of industry, and a lot of residential.

For example, one of the reasons HSBC might be leaving London, is because of the uncertainty of whether we are staying in the EU or not.

The main arguments against EU membership are Immigration and Laws. We have to abide by some laws set in Brussels which some people are strongly against. The immigration problem is if you didn't know, anyone with a passport of a country that is a member of the EU can live in another country that is in the EU. When this first came into place, we had a large influx of Polish immigrants and more Eastern-Europeans.

At the moment I don't know how it's going to swing.

Medical procedures are way way way overpriced... in a free market those prices fall and that 80 year old can afford some type of insurance and care that is better than what it currently is.		so the bottom line is that I don't think we need to be giving corporations or billionaires any breaks or special treatment... but I also dont think we need to be taxing them or jamming them up with red tape regulations 		I know you're going to disagree but thats where I stand","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SoullessJewJackson","name":"t1_cqw1527","parent_id":"t1_cqw01nz","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430579971,"created_utc":1430576371}

They could use any and all this info to their advantage in so many ways, they could strong arm you into something you dont' want to do with blackmail, they could place you in the vicinity of a crime and try and pin it on you based on your profile, especially if it is a high profile case and aren't likely to catch anyone- they're gonna need a fall guy for PR purposes and dont' think they won't just look for someone to fill that role that  they could prove "could," have done it- not to mention the PR hit you would take personally from that. The examples are too numerous to get into here, but with years of information derived from your internet use, they could basically tell you what you had for breakfast on any particular morning....how can you be ignorant to the danger in that?","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"oldboot","name":"t1_cqved08","parent_id":"t1_cqvbqbv","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430516618,"created_utc":1430513018}
