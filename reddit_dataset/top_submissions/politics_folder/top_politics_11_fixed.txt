Now that he had surveillance on the Democrats he knew that, in fact, they were NOT rigging the elections. 		Now at this point a reasonable and honest person would stop the dirty tricks and rigging. Not Nixon. He doubled-down, and the rest of the Republican Party doubled down with him.

He has since put more troops back there to help "advise" the Peshmerga and Iraqi Gov't forces fighting ISIS again maintaining the status quo on global indefinite, ill-defined war.		The timeline for Afghanistan was already established and there was a long time where he was posturing to extend the timeline.

I'm sure Ukraine would beg to differ. Saudi Arabia as despicable as they are have done more to curb Russia then anyone else.		>Had a hand in the Syrian conflict 		That turned out well, let's not forget where ISIS spawned from and gained such combat experience, Combat hardened guerillas armed to the teeth don't just spawn out of thin air.		>Supported Arab Spring		See above, I'm not sure Libya is very thankful either being pinned between CIA backed militias and Islamist militias. Not to mention the ramifications it has has on the wider North half of Africa.

{"body":"Even if you think it was rightly decided, I'm sure you recognize that the Supreme Court made the Supreme Court's decision.  That's the important point there.  Blaming the GOP, Obama, or the Man in the Moon doesn't make any sense when it comes to this topic.  So long as they can, and the courts assure them that it's the legally sound thing to do, all politicians will take advantage.		And you're right, by the way.  They did make the right decision, whether I like it or not.  Were this something that were in theory about to be in front of them, then my stance would be that my ideal is exactly what they decided but that it would be terrible and harmful to the nation.  Not every ideal outcome or technically correct legal interpretation actually is good in its effects.  That's the difference between ideals, overly broad legal theory, and reality.		As it turns out though, the law supports the ideal here.  So, whatever the effects, we're strapped in for this ride.  And if we have a constitutional convention that changes this, then my ideal would change with it.  The topic is too complicated for absolute opinions. 		But don't tell anybody on Reddit I said that.  We wouldn't want them to find out that respect for the law, pie in the sky ideals, loyalty to our founding document, and a realistic awareness of effects can each be distinct things that don't always agree.  If that happened, then they might realize that the people who regard political spending as speech and defend it accordingly are just as honorably correct as those who see its corrupting influence and seek reform.  Then people might (*shudder*) get along and collaborate to work out solutions.  Can you imagine?		This is a multi-faceted thing, and whatever happens, it will be complicated.  If nothing happens, then it will be complicated.  There's just no escaping that aspect of it at this point.  If it changes, then the decision will be regarded like the discovery of a bug in code; except the code is law.  And if it doesn't, then hopefully our citizens can be entrusted to embody enough discipline and wisdom that it won't be enough to turn us into a banana republic.  Either way, the sky doesn't necessarily have to fall.		The SCOTUS was aware of all this when they wrote their opinions.  But either way, it's just as silly to pretend the decision is nothing but good as it is to pretend that it's nothing but bad.

{"body":"> Term limits remove career politicians		This is not true, not true in the slightest. The key mistake you're making in thinking about this is the assumption that politicians are solely those who hold office, therefore meaning that by adding term limits it would be impossible for one to make a career out of it. That view is incorrect. To be a politician one does not necesarily be directly involved in government, one simply needs to be active in politics. In your theoretical world where term limits are imposed, political parties would still exist. In fact they would have to exist, otherwise there would be very little unofficial internal organization to steer debate and control the shifting of power (seniority would presumably replace parties if parties were abolished, but with mandatory term limits seniority becomes moot). So we would still have parties, and those parties would need leadership. The DNC and GOP are extremely well funded, broad, powerful organizations; their organizational and internal hierarchy will not  go away. In fact their hierarchy will only become more important, as they will quickly become the most powerful voices in the party. They will be the "new" power brokers (I quote that because there's really nothing new about that, they already are power brokers), and will help fund statesmen, organize platforms and strategies, and secure post-office (not post office, though funnily enough post-master general was a coveted position to have) jobs in the private sector.		Sound unbelievable? We already had a system of unofficial bureaucrats and power brokers that ran the political infrastructure in American communities, they're known as party machines. Tammany Hall and her contemporaries operated exactly in this structure, and they flourished. What I'm saying here is that a term limit system wouldn't remove career politicians, it would just revive an old form of politics that many contemporary political scientists believe died.

United States in 1919, **which held that the defendant's speech in opposition to the draft during World War I was not protected free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.**		>The paraphrasing does not generally include the word "falsely", i.e., "falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater", which was the original wording used in Holmes's opinion and highlights that speech which is dangerous and false is not protected, as opposed to speech which is truthful but also dangerous.		But that's not even the standard that's used these days. Schenck set a "clear and present danger" standard. No the standard is "inciting imminant lawless action." 		>Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.[1] Specifically, it struck down Ohio's criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence. In the process, Whitney v. California[2] was explicitly overruled, and doubt was cast on Schenck v. United States,[3] Abrams v. United States,[4] Gitlow v. New York (1925), and Dennis v. United States.[5]		So the original ruling which noted the "fire" metaphor actually did significant damage to the first amendment, and was only fixed when it as essentially overturned 40 years later.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Falmarri","name":"t1_colxnmr","parent_id":"t1_cokwuof","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1423981314,"created_utc":1423981314}

{"body":"I've had this bullshit excuse for logic thrown at me before, so I've had time to find ways to refute it.		Probably the easiest way is to use it in a situation where its failure to hold up becomes obvious. Bonus points if you use the logic to argue that they owe you something, so they can't say, "That example you gave was also logical." For example: "I don't care that the deed for this house has your name on it, it doesn't change the fact that the house is mine and you are trespassing." 		I also had time to figure out WHY the argument doesn't hold up logically. Basically, your evidence doesn't NEED to make your point true because it's ALREADY TRUE. What evidence does is PROVE your point to be true, which is pretty much the whole point of arguing.		If they are saying, "I don't care about your evidence, it doesn't prove you right," then the logic falls apart because the "doesn't prove you right" part, which the entire argument depends upon, is false.		Now if they say, "I don't care about your evidence. Your wrong," then at this point they are not even arguing, but simply asserting that they are right, while dismissing your evidence. They do not attempt to justify the assertion that they are right, or the dismissal of your evidence. Because an argument is an attempt to justify a claim, you could say that they are not even making an argument here.		However, if they are saying something like this, then they are probably so set on their opinion that nothing you do will ever change their minds, and the best you can do is convince (more rational) bystanders. If you are trying to convince the person you are arguing with, then you are wasting your time.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"princekamoro","name":"t1_cokly7l","parent_id":"t1_cokjklb","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1423858593,"created_utc":1423858593}

Our claim was already true to begin with.		When they use the word PROVE instead of MAKE, they are basically challenging the relevance of you evidence. For example, "I don't care how many pictures of cats you have, it doesn't prove that god exists" makes sense because pictures of cats have nothing to do with whether or not a deity exists.

In my mind freedom of speech shouldn't apply the same way to corporations as it does to citizens.

Our federal government is for the people, by the people. When corporations back candidates who don't act in their favor they threaten to cut off funding or find someone else willing to play ball. Our elected officials should not be basing their decisions on making their donors happy, they should be working towards the goals of their constituents.

Was very clear about how I feel about the Hillary movie.  I'm not against the court's ruling in regard to the specific case of the movie.  I'm against the second and broader ruling.  But we'll come back to that later, because discussing the Citizens United case alone misses a lot.		So, let's talk about this statement which I think illustrates where me and you differ quite a lot.		>Quid-pro-quo corruption based on donations to candidates or their campaigns are already HEAVILY regulated in the US, and the Supreme Court has upheld these regulations.		Who is talking about Quid-pro-quo?  Nobody.  Surely, you don't think anyone familiar with the topic is discussing this.  We have been keeping this type of direct corruption in check since the Gilded Age.  It's not an issue in 2015.		However, there is corruption in Washington on a massive scale.  Which comes in the form of campaign dollars.  But does Exxon or the AFL-CIO have to tell you what they want?  Of course not.  As a politician you already know.  You know and they know.  Everybody knows.  And if they contribute to your campaign and you want to stay in office you better do what they want.  Just because it isn't Quid-pro-quo doesn't mean the effects aren't the same.		The Citizens United ruling is one small part of the larger picture.  In fact, it aggravates me a bit when people just want to talk about this issue.  However, I'm familiar with it and am willing to do so.  So, here we go.		When Justice Roberts asked for the case to be heard again he really opened the flood gates.  I don't know about you, but I see a massive difference in a 2 hour (or however long) documentary and millions of dollars being poured into 30 second snippets that take over the airwaves.  It gives such a massive influence to special interests.		>ban the publication of books		This was never at stake in Citizens United.		In conclusion, I think too often we get hung up on certain court cases.  Citizens United is one part of the topic of corruption.  I hope people band together and try to get this government back.  Because right now our government is sick and I hope you at least agree with that.		By the way, there are plenty of solutions to resolving some of the corruption in Washington without limiting speech.  One such proposal looks something like this: Every citizen gets $100 dollars on their tax return.  They have a few options of what to do with that money.  They can give it to an individual candidate or to a party.  If neither of those are chosen, the money goes towards funding polls and registering voters.  Edit: I forgot to add that if a politician wants this money they have to give up the right to any other form of donation.  I believe something like this is already in place in Connecticut and a couple other states.		In relation to the specifics of the affects of Citizens United: It is certainly trickier.  However, I am of the opinion that 30 second commercials can only be put forth if sponsored by and paid for directly from a candidate if political in nature.  The law could look something like this: If political in nature and in paid commercial space of television or radio, and of 5 minutes or less: the production of, cost of commercial space, and all other related expenses must come directly from a political candidate if within 3 months of a related election.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Scope72","name":"t1_col1t5f","parent_id":"t1_cokymb0","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1423892262,"created_utc":1423892262}

You're not even putting any effort into your argument.  The court never ruled that speech is money, the court ruled that speech is speech . . . including speech that costs money.		Taking someone money away is not taking their right to speech away.  That's like saying taking someone's money away is taking their right to abortions away, because some abortions cost money.		Actually, abortion is a good example.  The government could not ban spending money to perform abortions, because that would be restricting the right to abortion.  Does that mean money is abortion?

That's completely false. Under the current system you say "I don't want my house knocked down," go to court, have your case and Company X's case put up to a jury of your peers, and they decide.		Also, under the current system, you *can* spend just as much as the rich by creating an interest group with you and like minded people so that you can match the money of the rich.

Slander, libel, lying under oath, incitements to riot - all are speech - but they are restricted or banned due to the great public interest served by doing so. 		It has already been [proven](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9354310&fileId=S1537592714001595) that the only people whose preferences currently affect policy outcomes are the rich. It has also been shown that the candidate who spends more wins the vast majority of the time. Both of these facts (or either, really) could easily be construed as anathema to the idea of a representative democracy. As such, there is a good case to be made that the government has a vested interest in restricting this type of speech to some degree (as they already have in the case of the $5000 limit). You can compare it to the idea that you have the right to bear arms, but not the right to own a nuclear warhead.

Maybe I've just been corrupted by my bias, but I do feel that the Republicans are causing a lot of the lack of dialogue and lack of compromise in modern politics. Shutting down the government by not raising the debt ceiling was one of the most absurd things I've witnessed in the American government in my lifetime. And yet I still saw SO many Americans think that "raising the debt ceiling" means incurring debt, when in reality it is merely a rubber stamp for the Treasury to deal with the debt already approved by Congress in the last budget.		Congress approved a new budget recently. It was, no doubt, laden with debt, caused in no small part by things that Republicans love, such as military spending. Where were all the "anti-debt" campaigners when the debt was actually being *passed*? All I heard in regard to debt from the Republicans, when their Congress passed a debt-laden budget, was crickets.		It's these kinds of things that really bother me about politics as a whole. If people just stopped for a second and took a look at what was actually going on, politicians would actually have to explain themselves instead of always blaming the other guy. 		Besides Tea Party people or representatives from rural Mississippi, it really shouldn't be that hard for our politicians to sit down and solve problems. I get upset because I read something like the title of this post, and I know that such an amendment will never be passed in my lifetime.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dynamaxion","name":"t1_cokrzsl","parent_id":"t1_cokrlqs","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1423869666,"created_utc":1423869666}

Number two was used by many companies to cancel policies of people that were costing them lots of money in claims by combing over their application and looking for things that they forgot to disclose.

Because of that tomfuckery, a law was put into place that required insurance companies to honor "time served" with other insurance policies, so you wouldn't have to re-wait every time you got a new policy (or job).  _That_ fucked me over, too, when I was younger.		That law is why you now get a "Certificate of Credible Coverage" when you cancel your insurance policy, or change jobs, or some other crap.

The dems probably do the same thing but I can't think offhand of any examples. I expect they aren't hard to find. 		I think there is an issue with donations, not because it magically increases you're chance of winning, but candidates that do win end up in a position where to continue their career and get continual financial support they must represent those that finance them, occasionally against the wishes of those that voted for them.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rakig","name":"t1_cokf0d5","parent_id":"t1_cokcz9b","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1423846411,"created_utc":1423846411}

A lot of reasons.  It depends on who's giving.  You don't expect a candidate to cater to you if you give a $5 donation.  But if you give the current maximum amount or belong to a group or business that gives to multiple candidates, you're essentially buying that candidate(s), so that's a reason.

We have a congress, a supreme court, and multiple consecutive presidents who have shown a blatant disregard for privacy, a disregard for the rule of law and civil rights, and who have been blatantly owned and manipulated by monied interests for decades and the proposed solution is to allow them the authority to *amend the constitution itself*?		The only rational response to this suggestion is "What the fuck are you thinking?"		If someone has a proven track record of abusing all authority they wield the solution to that issue is not to give that person or institution more authority.		If you think for one second that the Koch brothers and their ilk, the pharma lobbies, the telecom lobbies, the health insurance lobbies, the DoD, CIA, & NSA and other organizations will not buy their way into this process you are sadly mistaken. They are lined up at the door, salivating and clawing each other while they jockey for position should this opportunity come to pass.		You think the potential harm from something like the TPP would be bad, but somehow a constitutional amendment process would be exempt from the run of the mill corruption and cronyism that is the lifeblood of our democracy? Somehow this one act will be an untouchable white knight of democracy and populism, secure on an island above all the filth and corruption? That opening these particular floodgates will bring about a pristine alignment of reason and goodwill that will wash away inequality and injustice?		The potential harm from this is immeasurable.

{"body":"I take your point. I don't know of a specific case of a PAC or anything buying up all the ad time, but do you catch my drift? I can vote, talk to my family and friends, even run for office, but my influence is limited to a human scale, while a PAC or lobby group has influence over legislation, elections, etc. on a scale that is hard to imagine. Sure, if everybody went out and voted together the cumulative effect would be 'the will of the people', but you can't really argue that special interests do not distort elections and the legislative process, or even influence 'the will of the people'. Advertising works, and political ads are advertising - changing people's minds to suit the advertisers' interests, whatever they are. 		New media seems to have a weird way of taking off in unexpected directions, ad the campaigns that catch on seem to rely on some kind of virality in the way they are packaged, like the ice bucket thing, or whatever the hell that Kony thing was. I don't use twitter so I can't really speculate there as to its usefulness as a voice of the people, but I doubt it is the place for a boring discussion about publicly funded elections, school budgets, foreign policy, etc. I don't know what the answer would be, but hopefully it would be some kind of positive organic growth from the system, as opposed to the uncontrolled growth of political engineering. 		Also, 20 million people yelling on the internet will turn heads, but if you're in a nice, quiet room, a whisper in the ear can sound just as loud.

{"body":"The complaints presented are often one of two:		One: Monopoly on communication. This is what you initially presented, and I refuted.		Two: Inequality in scale of communication. This is what your last reply talks about.		> can't really argue that special interests do not distort elections		Any distortion is minor, and neither good nor bad. I don't consider any interest, even special ones, communicating their ideas a bad thing. To deny advocacy is to deny the concept of free speech itself, and this is regardless of whomever the speaker is.		I say this in that speakers don't automatically cause people to agree with them. You aren't some idiot who never heard of anything before. People willing to go out and vote usually have their minds made up long before the first ad hits. Elections are increasingly about getting your already-secure base to the polls in numbers bigger than the other side is.		> Advertising works, and political ads are advertising		It disappoints me that you believe this is true. It's becoming increasingly apparent that ads are increasingly of limited utility compared to other GOTV efforts.		As another redditor once eloquently put it, a TV is not a magic box that makes you do things against your will.		>  and the legislative process		I have no problem with lobbying in principle, as I suspect you don't, either. Proper enforcement to prevent quid-pro-quo prevents corruption, no matter the amount of lobbying that takes place.		> New media seems to have a weird way of taking off in unexpected directions		I was speaking more metaphorically. The idea that you can drown out someone's message with a louder message doesn't hold up, because there's infinite ways to communicate ideas. If you want a concrete example, let's look at the 1994 midterm elections. Think back to 20 years ago, if you can remember back that far: The internet was barely getting started, and mainstream news outlets were supportive of Clinton's crime bill, which included an Assault Weapon Bans. Big Business supported the ban, Big Media did, Big Government did, and the polls shows that even the public did too. It should have been a slam-dunk for the Democrats to retain the House.		Gun owners were denied access to the influence powers that the Big X's had. So they organized- they used a low-level ground game that organized around gun stores to turn the 1994 election into a wipeout. They were denied influence across the spectrum, but pulled it off in an actual election.		A more recent case: Romney and his allied groups outself Obama in 2012, but Obama still won. Why? Elections are more than a factor of money. Romney had all the charisma of a wooden spoon in blue jeans, and all the money in the world wouldn't win the election for him.		> but it is obvious that large corporations, industry, and the wealthy have more sway over what happens in politics than regular people, and I believe that it is completely out of scale.		This has *always* been the case. In every society throughout history. It's what's known as the "Elites." You can't ever get rid of them. Even if you stage a bloody revolution and kill them all, a new group instantly takes their place.  It's the nature of government and humanity for some to have more influence than others.		Is ours out of "sync" historically? I doubt it. I can't think of any point of time where "elites" were put on the back burner. The closest we came was the New Deal, but even then, special interests in the New Deal Coalition were driving the agenda.		> I am arguing about proportion; the line has to be drawn somewhere, I personally think we are beyond what people should accept. Others might think that this line is far off in the distance.		And I argue that there can be no line if we still want to call it free speech- because it's not free anymore. Government stepping in and deciding which speech we want to limit (or ban) is a bad, *bad* idea. The law that was struck down in *Citizens United*, the BCRA, was used as a club to beat conservatives such that liberal voices stayed dominant. There's every indication that should *CU* be overturned that it would happen again.		I think the Supreme Court said it more eloquently than I can, in *Buckley v Valeo*:		>The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed 'to secure "the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources...

{"body":"Thanks for the well-thought out reply. I think we would agree on most of this stuff. Well, guess what, you changed someone's mind on the internet today! For the elections, at least. Can't argue with the Stevens. 		That's the part about getting people into office, and maybe ballot measures. What about when they are in office? I know that not everyone is corrupt, but there is corruption. I also know that there will be a certain number of corrupt individuals anywhere, and it would be impossible to weed them all out (I suspect that there are a few more in professions that come with some sort of real power). How would you limit the damage they can do while in those positions? Or do you just write it off as a cost of doing business, even when the stakes are so high? 		Sure, quid-pro-quo is a big no-no, but there are other subtle forms of manipulation. Normal people can't really take their senator out for lunch and pick his brain, or suggest a legislative move here and there. That might be my problem with the whole thing, that money can provide access at a level that is unavailable to most of us. I've written my city council, congressmen and women, senators, the president, FCC chair, all of that, over many issues, and only ever got a boilerplate back. Not that I expect anything more, but if I just gave some dude 20k for his next campaign I'd be expecting at least a liquid lunch, and to be able to chit chat about my pet issue. 		I know that there will always be that special access, but it doesn't have to be facilitated by unlimited money.

It says more about the congresscritters that we elect that they're willing to spend a lunch with the head of the AARP rather than you, John Q. Public. Remember, free speech is the right to speak and not about actually getting people to pay attention to you.		> How would you limit the damage they can do while in those positions? Or do you just write it off as a cost of doing business, even when the stakes are so high?		For starters, I don't think that gutting the 1st Amendment is a good way of going about it. 		I think that enforcing against quid-pro-quo is the best and most effective way, but it's not all we can do.		For example, it's been noted that major donors seem to end up with major appointments, like ambassadorships. It's hard to prove a quid-pro-quo in this circumstance, but it smells fishy. Instead of banning the donation, as some want to do, how about we ban the *appointment*? So, if Dick Cheney donates a million dollars to Obama's third presidential run, Dick Cheney could not become the ambassador to Mars for the length of Obama's term. Sound good?		Lobbying is trickier, but it's also highly regulated. I suggest you look up the existing rules on lobbying, because some of what you are talking about already are addressed with existing laws.		> Assuming you don't think our current state of affairs is ideal, what do you think is broken in US politics?		Federalism is dying. Problems that should be resolved by the states are increasingly being addressed by the Federal government, often at the expense of some of the states. I'm not a fan of having coastal Democrats telling me what guns I can buy, nor how to live. Coastal Democrats don't like christian conservatives telling them who they can marry.

The Liberal Party of Canada was bankrolled by giant corporate interests in Quebec's mining industry and Ontario's energy industry.		When Paul Martin became Prime Minister he ran into a minority government.  In order to get legislation passed he began adding in measures that would make voting fairer.  So he had to sell off his multi-billion dollar shipping company.  He was no longer allowed to buy memberships into the Liberal Party ([an allegation that still haunts the party to this day](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/bhullar-blames-dirty-tricks-for-liberal-ballot-bust/article22713961/)).		The final thing was to make an individual cap on campaign contributions.  These were tax deductible by 75%.  The shocking result was that the Liberal Party basically lost their funding and were unable to compete with the other two parties (Conservative and NDP) in the next few elections.

{"body":"I'm just spitballing here, but is it possible we're approaching this from the wrong end?  Decisions like McCutcheon and Citizens United make it clear that the Supreme Court deems political spending a protected form of speech.  Congress slipped a provision into the "must pass" CROmnibus; they're clearly on board with unlimited spending.  And the FEC has weakened their rules regarding finance equal time.  		Look at the options for fixing the money side:		Trying to pass a Constitutional amendment means getting past state legislatures.  Check your recent election results.  How many of your state and local races had unppposed candidates?  Even if you vote out someone who's against the amendment, chances are his/her replacement will be even more against it.		The President can't just sign an executive order contravening established case law, particularly not when it's been decided by the Supreme Court.  If you thought the GOP hated him for immigration, they'd definitely want his head for this.		No real change can come from the FEC as long as the commissioners are approved by Congress; they won't approve reformers.		There is, however, one regulatory agency that might be able to affect some change.  Travel around states like Florida, California and Texas can get expensive, but the single largest expense for any campaign is advertising.  The FCC already has the power to regulate basic cable, broadcast television, and terrestrial radio.  The have the authority to fine or revoke the license of a station/network that airs indecent content.  They also have the power to regulate how much educational or informative programming a television network must air.	Here's my proposal:  the FCC should exercise these powers and direct the broadcast media to give at least 30 seconds per primetime block to each candidate at no cost.  Failure to do so would result in Janet Jackson's boob type fines.  The networks would be free to continue charging 501(c)(4)s whatever they please outside of primetime, but those 3 hours per night would be strictly for candidates.		Again, I'm just throwing ideas out there.  I'm by no means a campaign finance or FCC expert.  But campaign costs and dark contributions are spiraling out of control.  We need some out of the box thinking because the status quo isn't working.
