He's voted in support of an NRA sponsored bill to prevent lawsuits against gun manufacturers for misuse of their guns by people who bought them, voted against the Brady bill, and voted to allow people to carry firearms in their checked baggage on Amtrak trains. But he's also for expanded background checks for people purchasing firearms and for restricting purchase of high-capacity magazines. 		Generally it seems that he believes people should have the right to own firearms, and that gun control should be left to the states, but some of his support of federal gun control measures seems to be aligned with reducing mass shootings (bans on high-capacity mags in particular). Specifically he's said that mass shooting are an issue with our lack of attention to mental health issues, but that some gun control is a stopgap measure essentially. 		Edit: He's rated F by the NRA, but if you actually look at his voting record that grade seems to be based on his political beliefs e.g. democratic socialism, and not based on his voting for gun control.","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PureOhms","name":"t1_cqs8t9e","parent_id":"t1_cqs7jym","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430280861,"created_utc":1430277261}

He didn't need anyone's approval for that (well, except maybe CSPAN) he just didn't do it.  He promised a waiting period for public comment on legislation.  Again, nobody could stop him from keeping this promise . . . he just didn't do it.		Simple things like recognizing the Armenian Genocide . . . particularly considering the recent anniversary . . . are really disappointing areas where Obama could have EASILY kept a promise, and instead chose to break it.  Promises on tax form reform, where all it would take is a simple change of IRS policy . . . no go.  Ending no-bid contracts?  That's as easy as an executive order . . . but it didn't happen.

The reasoning behind this (doesn't matter if you agree with this or not) is the same as voting for Clinton in 2008 as a Republican: to attempt to get an easily beatable president. Obama looked like he might actually be able to beat McCain so some of us voted for Clinton in an effort to make the democrat selection worse than what it could have been. It didn't work then, clearly. It would be very easy for news stations like FOX to link Bernie's stance as a democratic socialist to full blown communist as most people would not bother to look up what the difference was. Hilary is a recognizable person compared to any Republican, currently Sanders is not. We are not concerned he will challenge us as it is easy to ruin a candidates image to the general people.

We criticize politicians for proceeding bullheadedly along a certain trajectory long after it's become apparent it was a bad idea, yet we call them flip floppers and wishy washy if they change their minds later.		At the same time, a war is a pretty big thing to change your mind on. I mean, it's a good indicator you probably didn't have all the facts when you jumped into it, which isn't something you want to hear from someone in a leadership position regarding something as serious as war.		Also, how you present your change of mind also matters. If you say you were mistaken or new information had made you revise your opinion, then that's reasonable and you'd hope a president would be willing to do that.

For a third party, having votes in those other states helps a lot though: first, in many states, what fraction of the total vote a party gets can influence how the state treats them for balloting purposes, whether their candidates get to be in debates for state and local level positions, and whether people take their candidates seriously at a state and local level. If a third party gets 10% of the vote in a state at the Presidential election, that's a massive credibility boost for them when it comes to the internal elections the next time.

{"body":">That is not a source.		Oh come on, you know it's idiotic to ask for a source on an observation. Just look at the god d@mn comments...there are SEVERAL mentioning "I know a woman who's going to vote for her because she's a woman"		>I've never seen anyone mention that they're voting because they're white, male and Christian. And if they did I would absolutely call them out on it. I'm an equal opportunity dick.		This is what you don't get....when it's the majority and you belong in the majority, you don't actually say "I'm going to vote for so and so because they are so and so"...they just do it. But as I pointed out, if 20% of congress is women, then you would expect a 1 in 5 chance of women winning a primary and yet a woman has never won a primary. Almost as if men aren't voting for women. 		[Linda McMahon](http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/connecticut/senate/#.VUA__5Ob5UU) lost the woman vote 60-39!!! So women don't just vote for women. 		[Cynthia Dill](http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/maine/senate/#exitPoll) only got 16% of the womens vote while the 2 male candidates got the other 84%. 			http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/senate/#.VUA_65Ob5UU		Out of the 12 senate races in 2012 that  that featured only one women (so excluding woman vs woman), men only voted in the majority for women only 4 times and those were in lopsided races where the woman won by 21%, 34%, 20% and 16%!!! 		Men voted Republican almost 60% to 40% for Dems. So if I look at just the Republican women, I should expect about 60%/40% for Republican women running. There were 3 Republican women that ran against men. I couldn't find exit polling of Deb Fischer in Nebraska but for the other two Linda McMahon and Heather Wilson, both finished 50/50 among the male vote. 			http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/connecticut/senate/#.VUBBwZOb5UU		http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/new-mexico/senate/#.VUBCCJOb5UU			So point being, just because men don't say out loud as frequently doesn't mean they aren't voting against women.

From a legal standpoint in America, Jews can be classified as a race, especially in cases of discrimination. I believe that was a result of Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb. Technically, race is more dependent on shared physical traits, so Judaism is not a race. However, as a religion, there is more of a shared cultural background versus, say, Christians in America. 		When people refer to Judaism as a race, I think that they're generally using it as short hand for "cultural group." At least to me, this makes sense as to why some Jews will say that they aren't religious, but still self-identify as being Jewish. And on the flip side, I don't believe that every person who is a practicing Jew has to consider that as a part of their identity, outside of its religious implications.

{"body":"I should've specified and just put "vouchers" and "accountability measures" apply to public schools now, which are distinctively capitalistic, 'competitive' practices. But a more simplified version is something like this (formatting will be shit, as I'm on mobile):			1. For starters, there's a significant relationship between how much a school spends on a student (base student cost) and student achievement. Keeping that in mind, public schools are largely funded by local property taxes, therefore putting a significant portion of the school's collective achievement at the mercy of the local economy, social capital, wealth of the local parents, etc. Furthermore, public schools in impoverished areas don't receive the resources they need and suffer from poor performance due to, well, mainly underpaid and/or inexperienced teachers and the aforementioned collective lack of resources. Teacher turnover is a big problem in urban schools for some of these very reasons. 				2. Applying accountability measures only further exacerbate the problems because student achievement is low. It's basically shutting them down because the locals are in poverty. See, in certain areas, say, the Mississippi Delta (where I'm from), there might be one shitty public school in a district, but there will also be a private school (known here as a segregationist academy; no, for real) or a charter school (which is partially, but usually mostly funded by vouchers aka public tax money that belongs in a public school). Both charter schools and private schools are unfair competition for public schools, especially since they've been shown to be highly discriminatory in student selection.								3. Charter schools (think *Waiting For Superman*) not only bleed public school funds dry, but are largely unregulated vis-a-vis teacher standards and student achievement. There's also a massive corporate interest in making these suckers successful. Research ALEC (I personally love *The United States of ALEC* documentary from Bill Moyers) and learn how they influence politics in the U.S. It's nothing short of a goddamn conspiracy. These fuckers (read: "politicians") use the word "choice" as a selling point, but all it really is, is the exploitation of the poor in search of profit.							4.

And if he loses to Hillary, that's too bad, but you can still always just vote for her if you *really* don't want a Republican in the White House. But he won't be a spoiler. He won't cause a Nader Effect. And if you disregard all the stigma and misinformation, and just let his policies and 35 year history do the talking, the choice is obvious.

In a closed primary, only members of the Chess club could choose their candidate, only Drama club members could choose theirs, Dance chooses dance, etc etc. Every student can only vote once.		Now imagine an open primary, where you can vote for *any* club candidate, even if you're not in that club.

{"body":"Ron Pauler here. You will need to:		1. Raise tens of millions of dollars from grassroots		2. Don't expect that Bernie will know what to do with millions of dollars in campaign funds just because he's a "good guy." Ron Paul proved totally incompetent in effectively utilizing his millions in 2008 ([see this hilariously cringe-worthy ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30yxHqSUva8) and strategically unsound (though slightly more competent)) in 2012. In fact, what you really need is to divert some of those millions to a PAC run by someone competent and unafraid in the grassroots, who will say the hard-hitting things the campaign is afraid to say. Arguably the [most effective Ron Paul 2012 ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rv0Z5SNrF4) (done in response to the newsletter scandal) came not from the campaign but from one of the superPACs.		3. Know your enemy. If you want to have a shot in hell, study Paul's two campaigns, and know that your biggest enemy in defeating Hillary will not be Hillary's campaign or the super PACs, but the media. The media are the ones who will kneecap your candidate if he gains any actual traction. On the Democratic side, you've already seen this with Ralph Nader's campaigns. The Rand Paul grassroots (which I include myself in) is still searching for a decent strategy to prevent the inevitable media knee-capping of Rand.		4. In addition to moderate knee-capping all season long, expect the media to especially screw you over at crucial junctures. Again, see Ron Paul 2012 for examples: one week before the Iowa primary, with Paul #1 in all the Iowa polls, they manufactured the "Santorum surge" out of thin air while suddenly, randomly choosing to obsess over the newsletter "scandal" (without getting into another debate with newsletter trolls, regardless of your opinion on that "scandal," the timing of the media's decision to focus on it was incredibly blatant, given that this was an old scandal that could have been brought up at any fucking time over several decades or any time during the 2012 or 2008 campaign season).		5. ~~Profit!~~ Win!		Bonus step: Find an ideologically pure/un-corrupt millionaire/billionaire to help out. In 2012 the largest contributor to Ron Paul's campaign (via superPACs) was Peter Thiel, who donated a few million. Also in 2008 Peter Schiff, a well-known investment manager, acted on his conscience and [sent a personal letter](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:GAy9IIY82F0J:www.dailypaul.com/6092/investment-advisor-peter-schiff-appeals-to-60000-in-e-mail-blast+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) to all his clients urging them to support Paul.

As reddit users, many of us are accustomed to finding our information using a variety of internet based sources, some telling you only what you want to hear, some presenting pure B.S., some providing as close to an unbiased view that you'll get, and so on. But one thing we know we can't depend on for well, pretty much anything, is the mainstream media. With them seated firmly in the back pockets of other interests, they'll do anything to skew info in their favored direction. The problem is that too many people out there still rely on it and do not realize that what they are watching is strictly pushed agenda and entertainment geared towards ratings.

One who truly believes that market forces are able to self-regulate to the extent that government is no longer needed (a balanced state of anarcho-capitalism). There are no "corporations" as much as there are individuals trading amongst each other, in a state of trust (as in "I trust that nobody else will steal from me because everyone else has what they need" or "I trust that I can defend myself from someone who does try to steal from me" etc). This is what I know from studying libertarian literature from my late-teens anarcho-communist days.	2. American libertarians. They support deregulation because they equate it to paying less (or no?) taxes. They support state's (and individual) rights on almost every issue. In general, they tend to ignore the effect that corporate america will have on the country sans regulation and justify this by touting the "power of the boycott" if it comes up. They support privatization of *everything* because they think it will always, 100%, be more efficient than publicly run services (ignoring companies like Comcast).		Obviously I'm a bit biased against people who self-proclaim libertarianism in the US.

To backup a second, the labor market cannot be a free market in a capitalist society: to live you must have money, to have money you must have job; it's coercive (as far as what is and isn't a free market are concerned), even if it's our nature which is coercive. Hence, the basic income removes the coercive aspect of the labor market with only a minor manipulation as the last vestige of interference (assuming we remove the minimum wage, and a number of other things no longer needed).

Similarly, the communist parties in the USSR, the Soviet bloc, Cuba, and modern-day China diverged in other ways from the original revolutionary ideal of Marx, but also defined themselves under the blanket of "socialism."

State socialism is only one type of socialism and even discounted by many orthodox Marxists as well as socialist thinkers as "state capitalism", since the state controlled the national economy and still engaged in capital accumulation.  		Outside of the US, the term "socialism" encompasses a far wider range of beliefs in political discourse.

This is also why many of these social democratic and democratic socialist parties aren't concerned with being part of an organization called the Socialist International.

In Mexico, both the PRI and the PRD are members of Socialist International, with 41% and 21% of the Chamber of Deputies, respectively, with the PRI also being the party of Mexican President Pe??a Nieto.

Gotcha.		It's early and other candidates have time to step forward.  Hillary could always drop out too for a variety of reasons.  I seriously hope the Democrats get a better candidate than Hillary, however she has the big money behind her and all of the people who have bought shares of Clinton Inc. are doing what they can to get all of their political favors granted when the Clintons retake their throne.  I fear this has scared other potential contenders away.  No family, neither the Clintons, the Kochs nor the Bushes, should have this much power and control over the direction of the United States.  She may be the lesser of two evils by the time the primaries come around though.		The good thing about a Sanders / Warren ticket, or simply just a Sanders ticket, is that they contribute to the political discourse of our time.  Even if Sanders doesn't win the primary, his participation could get the country talking about important issues it otherwise would not be discussing.

In all seriousness though, please advocate and work tirelessly for (and don't forget to vote for) the candidate that you personally feel will be the best leader. That's one of the best thing you can do to help ensure a fully functional democracy.		HOWEVER 		If you want to have someone in the white house who shares most of your views instead of almost almost none of them, then what you want (maybe not now, but eventually) is not someone who will get the progressives completely and passionately on board, but someone who will speak to middle America. Much like the Republicans and the Tea Party, traditional Democrats don't want to get the progressive faction completely on their side but neither do they want to draw their ire so much they run their own candidate (something they would have been mildly concerned about if Sanders had run as an independent. But now that he's a Democrat, all he has to do is lose by the numbers.)		Pulling to far to the left will lose you the middle (just as pulling too far to the right does). If the Republicans run a center right candidate like Jeb Bush and the Democrats run a progressive like Sanders, that could lose you Virginia and Nevada and Florida. And if Walker runs as VP, that could be just enough to pick off Wisconsin and Michigan - and then it's game over for the Democrats and you've got a GOP House and Senate and President for at least a couple of years. And that scares the crap out of me.		Out of the 2 people on the left who are running for President, there's only one so far that fits the center left bill, and she's not THAT popular, so I don't blame anyone for seeking an alternative.

{"body":"Rofl, no. Your idea of "left" is completely at odds with reality. The US's Social Security programs aren't actually *that* large in comparison to most western countries (which is why i say you are much further right than the rest of the world).		In some ways, Europe is actually economically to the right of america, due to the massive austerity programs that EU countries have adopted while america didn't. Making massive cuts to public finances to work to reduce deficits, although for many EU countries this was a necessity due to the debt problems that would have occurred if they didn't.  		But to suggest that america, or even Europe, is left due to social security programs completely ignores any actual current or historical concept of left wing. The only real "left wing" parties in most western countries are center-left, and even then many on the left would say they aren't actually left since they accept modern "neoliberal capitalism". And the countries, and their electorates themselves are by no means left wing, since they continue to elect and support right wing parties.  		Take Britain, we haven't been a left wing country since 1979, none of our mainstream parties are advocating creating a socialist country in Britain anymore, the only proper socialist left wing parties are polling at like 4/5%. 		The only actual left wing mainstream parties are in places like Greece, which has come as a reaction to the austerity that has been pushed on Greece by the EU.		Your absurd definition of "left" just really shows that you are a component part of the absurd far-right in america, that the rest of the world laughs at. 		>will soon be paying even more for Obamacare. Any nation that institutes strong welfare and entitlements is to the left		I would also make a note about Welfare and Healthcare. Part of the reason we in Europe have these programs, such as the National Heath Service in the UK, is not because of current politics, it is because these programs were installed back when there were actual and genuine left wing parties, and when the neoliberal parties took hold, due to the public want for those programs, and the fact *they worked* they were never abolished. 		In the UK there are no parties, not even the really right wing ones like UKIP (the leader of which has been invited by Fox News a number of times, and always spouts his populist views and is complemented by Fox) would never even dare suggest that they would abolish the NHS, just because it is like a national religion in the UK.

Conservatives will come out in droves in the open primaries to vote for anyone other than her thinking the only way dems win in 2016 is with her. They don't want her running more than we do.

"Our country's political process is bought and if we don't fix it now it will be irreversible. There's a trillion dollars of unremoveable student loan debt that is an anchor around millions of recent graduates who have no opportunities to return that investment.

{"body":"I think it's pretty clear to every progressive minded voter that Bernie Sanders is by and far the best candidate for president in a generation (or several). Frankly, he is probably the only hope America has of achieving an equal and prosperous future. The country is literally at the brink and the ponzi scheme of crony capitalism is this close to collapsing - it's highly unlikely that it will last another 8 years. 		The problem is convincing a very large conglomeration of honest, hardworking, but - let's not mince words - simple people who's live are primarily focused on their own lives and their families, who don't travel outside their home states, who don't follow world politics or understand competing economic theories, who are informed by the occasional glance at newspaper stand or what they see for a few hours at night on Fox or MSNBC. They are just getting by and working hard and they don't really care if gay marriage is legal or abortion is illegal or how much a bank bailout costs or just, exactly, where Yemen is on the map. 		These are the people that need to be motivated - they are worlds apart from /r/politics. Granted, they will understand and probably agree with the message, but it's matter of getting that message to them and getting it there without it being warped by a dozen different pundits who are paid quite a lot of money to make sure people  are provided with doubt and fear and uncertainty. 		I guess what I'm trying to say is, Bernie Sanders might be best possible presidential candidate America can find, but he is going to face the most difficult and uphill battle potentially ever faced by a candidate. 		Hillary is by far an objectively worse candidate, but she is the definition of a shoe-in. Literally the only thing she has to do to win is not fuck up and let the GOP twist themselves into a meaningless, pasty white knot. The Democratic party's mission is to win an election, nothing more. They aren't interested in the best  candidate, they're interested in the candidate that will win. 		Don't get me wrong - it can be done. But Bernie Sanders and every single person who has any insight into the state of America will have to fit harder than likely any candidate has before to overcome every instinct of a short-sighted, for profit electoral system in order to win.

{"body":"As a libertarian, I hope that Sanders wins the democratic nomination. He is superior to Clinton on nearly every issue not involving the economy, and would be a better president in that aspect. I would love to have a president that leads to a less interventionist foreign policy, expanded immigration, decreased drug control, and increased civil liberties. It's also a major plus that he isn't a super corrupt politician bought off by special interests.		Of course, I strongly disagree with him on nearly every economic issue, gun control, and campaign finance reform. I would definitely vote for Rand Paul or Gary Johnson over him.

{"body":"Okay, I'll answer the question but I hope people aren't going to make my comment into a campaign finance reform debate. The original intention of my comment is that I have significantly different views on some issues with Sanders, but he's still better than Clinton. 		The reason I disagree with regulating how people can spend their money to further a political cause is because it is infringing on the 1st amendment right to free speech.		I think people should be able to spend their money on what ever they like so long as they are not infringing on the rights of others or putting others at a very high level of risk (such as paying a burglar or buying a bomb). 		People being free to spend their money on political activism is very important in a free society. Giving the government the right to limit this means they would be able to control how much people can spend. That power allows government officials to employ arbitrary limits, which is very dangerous.		Politicians would be able to limit campaign contributions in a way that could help expand their own political interests. The limits and regulations could lead to incumbents gaining more control as challengers may not be able to get enough funding to overcome the incumbency advantage. Limiting campaign contributions would lead to inequalities in the capacity of many political interests to raise money for their campaigns. 		I would rather deal with the consequences of having a large degree of freedom than deal with the consequences of having too little. 		If there's any reform that I would support, it would be for 100% transparency of campaign contributions. 		I expect that most people here will dislike my opinions and that's okay.

{"body":"Thanks for a normal reply. I took the time to write down what I disagreed with if you're inclined. 		>People being free to spend their money on political activism is very important in a free society. 		Agreed, but not by lobbying politicians. Groups can meet, raise awareness, and protest with their money, but buying politicians is completely different.		>Giving the government the right to limit this means they would be able to control how much people can spend, and that power allows government officials to employ arbitrary limits, and that is very dangerous.		How so? Campaigns would only have a set limit for everyone. It wouldn't be a wildly fluctuating number between different politicians. 		>Politicians could limit contributions to certain limits which could help expand their own political interests. 		What? 		>The limits and regulations could lead to incumbents gaining more control as challengers may not be able to get enough funding to overcome the incumbency advantage. 		No, that's literally what's happening now and why we need campaign finance reform. There is no more little guy or grassroots candidate. In order to play you have to raise a LOT of money.		>Limiting campaign contributions would lead to inequalities in the capacity of many political interests to raise money for their campaigns. 		No, that's exactly why we need campaign finance reform. There is no choice or political interests of the people being represented. We need to get the big money out of politics so that the people's concerns are addressed as well as giant corporations/super wealthy people.		>I would rather deal with the consequences of having a large degree of freedom than deal with the consequences of having too little. 		Buying politicians has nothing to do with freedom and everything to do with a corrupt, broken system.

However, I don't really think he's such an effective debater. 		In a debate with Michelle Bachmann, which was purported as something of an evisceration of Bachmann, he came off as closer to a rambler. Bachmann was able to make her points more concisely, and he had to concede a bit when he tried comparing our education/healthcare spending to Norway's, and Denmark's. This gave Bachmann the opportunity to point out that those countries are able to exploit their natural resources. What could Sanders say to that? 		I wish Sanders would've painted a more elegant or logical picture about the diminishing returns associated with tax cuts for the wealthy, instead of repeating how well billionaires are doing compared to the poor.

{"body":"No one is probably going to see this, but regardless:		As good of a candidate he is, Bernie Sanders will not win. His socialism will scare away conservatives and moderate democrats. 	But you know who is a good choice for president?	Jim Webb. 	Jim Webb is the (potential) candidate that you love but have never heard of. Let's start with his ethos and which votes he will attract.		Jim Webb is a Democrat senator from the state of  Virginia, and the former secretary of the Navy. He's extremely centrist. Already that has the attention of moderate Democrats who were scared away from Hillary and moderate Republicans who were scared away from Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. So that is the moderate vote. 		Also, this guy is a war hero from Vietnam. Two Purple Hearts, the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, and the Bronze Star. He has voted to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell, and he helped form the largest expansion to the GI Bill since it was created. He voted in favor of limiting service terms to 12 months for soldiers. So that must mean he's a War Hawk, right? **No**, Jim Webb fiercely opposed the Iraq War, (unlike Hillary, might I add) and has acknowledged that among other things, the War in Iraq has led to sectarian violence in the Middle East (Oct 2014), that the Iraq War created more terrorists than it destroyed, and that there would always be violence in the region as long as US troops were deployed there. (September 2006).		Remember the conservative support I said he would receive earlier? There's another reason for it besides for him being moderate. Jim Webb was the Secretary of the Navy under **Ronald Reagan**, and Reagan even praised Webb in his speeches. Webb left the administration in protest of cuts to the Navy budget. Now here's the part that Reddit may not like about Jim Webb, but it's the party that will solidify the moderate Republican vote: He is tough on immigration and pro-guns. For those of you who think it's bad remember that these are tickets to key Republican votes and states. Just because Webb is conservative on those issues doesn't mean he's unsuitable for Reddit. Take a look at his track record for social reform.		He's opposed to constitutional bans on gay marriage, and thinks that marriage equality is good for the nation, and he was against Don't Ask Don't Tell, and he is against employment discrimination of gays. There's the gay vote for him. (Let's not forget that Hillary used to be against gay marriage).		He is **very** pro-choice. He supports Roe v. Wade, and voted NO on laws that prohibited minors from crossing state lines for abortions, barring grants for organizations that perform abortions, and he is in support of expanding research to embryonic stem cell lines. That's the women's vote.		Jim Webb sees No Child Left Behind as a failure, and acknowledges that there have to reforms to the education , and has voted for more funding for public education.		Webb is great for the environment. He has voted in favor for expanding Cash for Clunkers, and in favor of reducing traffic congestion. He voted against barring the EPA from regulating Greenhouse gasses. He's voted for protecting the middle class from Energy taxes. He is in favor of removing Oil and gas subsidies, and in favor of incentives for more conservation. If you're an environmentalist, this guy is your vote. 		He is in favor of expanding Social Security, so that's gonna win the favor of elderly voters.				There is so much more to Jim Webb than what I can explain here, even though no one is going to see this comment. 		**tl;dr: Jim Webb not only has good policies, but he is attractive to many major demographics**		So please, put your vote behind a man who not only has policies that **you** can agree with, but when you vote for him, that vote won't be wasted.

{"body":"First of all, thank you for the thoughtful question and for not immediately calling me a douchebag for being a republican. The way you described stereotypical republicans is just that, a stereotype. It's a common misconception that republicans are old, rich, extremely religious, hating Muslims, or any combination of the above.		The truth is, I'm a 32 year old man, from a lower middle class family. I grew up Catholic, but I'm not crazy religious or anything. In fact, I'm more socially moderate than anything. I'm for gay marriage but against abortion. I won't elaborate on my stances because that's not what you asked.		I am republican for a few reasons. The first is because because I agree more with their stance in relation to the role of the government. I think the government should play as small a part in our lives as possible. The government should provide security and protect our borders from foreign threats. It should also be there to help the people who cannot help themselves, those who are unable to provide for themselves and their families because of medical conditions or other reasons that keep people from legitimately being able to provide. But I feel like entitlement programs have gotten entirely out of control and are badly hurting our country financially because too many people get too much government assistance. No one wants to see people living in poverty. Entitlement programs (social security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment, food stamps, etc...) help the poor but they don't get to the root of the problem. They don't provide a means to get people to stop relying on the government to live. I believe that money would be better spent investing in American business to create new jobs and get the poor back working and off of government assistance. Any social program we have should be aimed at getting people out of poverty. The problem is, any money going away from the poor and into business or any tax breaks given to businesses, democrats will usually cry foul, citing the "trickle-down" effect, and claiming it does not work. They will say the rich get richer, which brings me to my next reason why I'm republican. 		I don't believe the burden of supporting government run programs should fall on the backs of wealthy Americans. One of the common things you hear is that the rich need to pay their "fair share." What most people don't realize is that the top 10% of income earners in the US pay about 70% of the income taxes. The bottom 50% pay about 3% of the total income tax in the country. Yet, most democrats will tell you that the rich don't pay enough. I think, as a country, we spend too much, and taxing the rich to pay for it is completely unacceptable. And just to note, I'm not rich. As I mentioned, I grew up in a lower middle class family. I went to college and paid for it with student loans, which I'm still paying back. I spent most of my 20's working entry level jobs, sometimes two jobs at once, making ends meet, working my way up the ladder in my career, which brings me to my next point.		It appalls me that minimum wage workers feel they should be making $15/hour. When I graduated college, I started my first full time job at $8/hour, which was not enough. So you know what I did? I got a second job waiting tables in the evening to make ends meet. When I started making more money with my full time job, I kept the second job so I could put some money aside and also have some semblance of a social life. I didn't have many luxuries. I didn't make $15/hour until five years after college graduation. For someone to think they deserve that for doing a minimum wage job is disheartening. Nowhere in this country is it guaranteed that if you put in a 40 hour work week, you deserve enough money to live comfortably. If you have minimum experience, minimum education, minimum motivation to improve your situation, and your job requires a minimum amount of skill that could be performed by anybody, then you deserve the absolute minimum pay. I have a good job now that pays very well, but it took ten years of grinding it out, not living very comfortably, to get to this point. I have a good life and live comfortably now. I bought a house and invest my extra income (Quick note: This goes back to my earlier point that the wealthy shouldn't have to pay more in taxes to support the poor. I will be rich someday. I'm not now and I'm not close. But I am smart with my money and I invest rather than spend. I've never had a nice car. Instead, I have a rental property that provides positive cash flow. I will retire before the normal retirement age. From where I came from and the sacrifices I have made and will make in the future, it would not be fair to say that I should have to pay more when I am eventually wealthy. I will someday be among the top 10% in the country, and I don't think it would then be right to ask me to pay more in taxes to support the people who haven't made the same sacrifices or have worked as hard as I will have worked to get to that point. That's all, rant over.). Everything I have now, I worked my ass off for, and I feel like no one is promised anything in this life. You can either sit around complaining about the government and your lot in life, or you can go out and make things happen for yourself because no one is going to give you anything in life. Unfortunately, a lot of people who align with the Democratic Party believe that everyone is entitled to a comfortable life, even if they don't necessarily deserve it.		Some other (smaller) issues that make me align with the Republican Party are gun control, immigration, healthcare, energy, anti-special interest groups, anti-union, and a progressive outlook on race and affirmative action. Just a real quick note on each of these... I believe increased gun control is a waste of government time and resources. The bad guys will always have access to guns illegally. Gun control laws just keep firearms away from normal Americans and/or make them more difficult to get. I believe everyone should have to come to this country legally. It's unfair to those people who did it legally to grant amnesty to those who did not. Plus, illegal immigrants are a drain on our resources, and hard working Americans should not have to pay for that. The new healthcare law is incredibly unfair and, again, puts the burden of supporting the poor on the backs of the rich and the middle class. Quick note, my company-provided insurance premiums doubled when Obamacare was implemented and my parents' (also not rich) deductible went from $1000 to $6000, which is ridiculous. I think we should be actively pursuing means for renewable energy. However, until that becomes a reality, we still need to rely on fossil fuels. Projects like the recently vetoed Keystone Pipeline would make that less expensive. I do think climate change is real and man made, and we need to work to change that. But it doesn't mean we are going to quit using oil and coal overnight. I believe special interest groups are a hindrance to real governmental progress and that our legislators should answer to the people and not those aforementioned special interest groups. I think unions were instrumental in creating many of the labor laws that make working in our country safe and fair. However, I believe they have outlived their usefulness and that unions today simply drive up the price of doing business. Finally, I think that, even though there are still a lot of race issues in our country today, we have indeed come a long way to reducing discrimination in certain aspects. Race should not be an issue in college admissions and other places in which affirmative action gives people opportunities based on the color of their skin. 		Anyways, I know this was a long-winded response, but there really is no way to answer your question in a more succinct manner, and still provide thoughtful reasoning to these points. I hope you understand more now the reasons I align with the Republican Party and that I've been able to change some of the misconceptions you may have had previously.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"guy_in_the_sky","name":"t1_cqsaljn","parent_id":"t1_cqs5uqh","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430284342,"created_utc":1430280742}

{"body":"I see what you are saying but still think it is a far stretch. Doctors will not be forced into slavery.

You can say it about any job; create a hypothetical situation then justify it based on a completely different law where the government has power over an individual or business to scare people.		I think we all agree that Asset Forfeiture and Civil Forfeiture are being abused and need a serious rewrite, like many other laws. I think this is a problem with our government reacting too slow and/or bribery.		Healthcare for everyone is important, we are a 1st world country after all. Insurance companies can (and do) raise costs that leave people without insurance, Medicaid fills that gap.  Blame the rising costs of private insurance for the expansion of Medicaid. Blame the terrible trade agreements, loss of manufacturing jobs to China and the higher costs of living on the expansion and usage of social programs.		A business is a business, not a religion. If you want to spread your beliefs, go start a church. If you want to open a business, you serve everyone. Choosing who you serve and not serve is called discrimination and that is a bad thing.  You can cater your business to a group and they will likely come, but if someone outside of your desired group comes, you have to serve them.  It is just basic human decency and common sense. A business should be punished for discriminating.

{"body":"For everyone who is convinced that the American people are salivating at the chance to elect the first self-proclaimed socialist to the White House, you should probably review this Gallup polling data: http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx		At this point, only 24% of Americans even consider themselves to be *liberals*, let alone socialists. A full 38% of Americans identify as conservatives and 34% see themselves as moderate. Bernie Sanders is certainly not conservative or moderate -- if he was, no one in r/politics would be excited about him.		Those are the odds he would face in winning the presidency, with 72% of the country already seeing themselves as nowhere near as liberal as he is. Remember, Obama openly ran away from the term "socialist" and presented himself as a centrist. Sanders will proudly represent the left-wing of American politics and all of the connotations that come along with it. Whether or not he actually is a socialist is irrelevant; American voters aren't interested in nuance and many -- even moderate Democrats -- still equate being a socialist with being "un-American." Perceptions matter, and Sanders is going to have a hard time convincing enough people outside of college campuses and r/politics that they should vote for an almost 75-year-old "socialist."","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"uglyinchworm","name":"t1_cqsdxjs","parent_id":"t3_3470iu","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430292615,"created_utc":1430289015}

{"body":"Fair enough. My take on it was that having a small magazine was an acceptable compromise - I can still carry as much ammo as I might need, I'd just need to reload slightly more often.		And I think the idea for the magazine limit was that it wouldn't be possible to lay down a hail of gunfire (in one of those "crazed gunman" situations or more mundane crimes) without having to stop after a short interval to reload. It limits the immediate destruction and gives others time to get away or try to stop the gunman, I guess. Not sure how likely that actually is, but it seemed reasonable and the 10-round-per-mag limit didn't seem to be a significant burden on gun ownership.

Suicide is an impulsive act, the overwhelming majority of people who attempt suicide and live are happy that they did, and do not attempt it again. This is why they're finally building a fence on the Golden Gate Bridge, if it's harder to kill yourself you're less likely to do it.

Killing yourself with a gun is far easier than killing yourself by other means, and that goes for violence against others as well.
