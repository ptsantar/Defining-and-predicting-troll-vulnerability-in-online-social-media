This is why you can often see situations where predominantly black communities, that normally vote democrat are added into democratically controlled districts, as an example. It weakens the voting block in the other district while possibly causing a change in the democrat elected from that district. They may also choose to split a district down the middle that is normally an even district to create an advantage for their candidate. 		Both sides do this.

{"body":"Hi, I've worked in a Congressional office.  There's a reason for this.		During session, our office could expect five - ten phone calls a day (or more if something big is happening, like Ebola) from people advocating for one thing or another.  Around 30% of those calls come from people not inside the representative's district.  Some are paid to advocate to as many reps as possible, and will talk for upwards of ten minutes if you let them. Others are pissed off people from around the country/globe who want to take their frustrations out on your boss. All of those get brushed away, no matter how sensible or important the issue is. Not our constituents = Not our problem.		Of the remaining 70% of callers, around 30% are the elderly. They advocate for whatever issue is important on the major news networks that week. They've got the time to call in, they're fed the worst propaganda, they are a substantial voting force.  But they don't really ever advocate anything specific, just "stop obamacare" or "don't let the gays marry". We can't ignore those, but we respond to them with the same enthusiasm across the board. If it's not specific and you haven't done your homework, we're not really listening.		But that same form letter needs to be sent to everyone, including the other 40%, which are the people who actually care enough to know what they're calling for.  They know the issue they're supporting or not supporting, they state their piece, and then they dip out.  They've got stuff to do. We send them the same form letter to show we heard them, but most importantly it tells them *their vote has been tallied*.		That's all people are to a political office.  As an example, Minnesota's 5th district houses upward of 600,000 people.  A single voice is a drop in a bucket of water. A small group of people makes a small group of drops. We don't pay much attention at first (In one congresswoman's case, she often didn't even *hear* about single callers), but as more and more people take a notice and call in, then the ball starts moving.  Soon the intern tells the staff assistant that a lot of people are calling in. Eventually one person calls who is extremely knowledgeable about the issue and it gets escalated to a full member of staff. Now they're involved in the issue as well.		If it's a mild interest for the people of their district, they'll take a stance on it. It could be the Congressperson themselves who takes a stance, or it could be a senior staff member making it.  Regardless, the stance is taken and that's usually where it ends. If enough people from the district call and *keep calling*, maybe legislation will get drafted.  Most of the time it has zero chance of even making it out of the first committee.  It's only when big interest is occurring, with huge national attention, that a bill has a chance of getting passed all the way up to the floor, and that's when party politics come into play.		**tl;dr** The reason everybody just gets a form letter and an "okay, thank you, we'll add you to the email list" is because they're a tally mark. Little more than a line in a spreadsheet. It's a little cold, but the boss can represent hundreds of thousands of people, and might be watching out for millions.  It's only when there's a *lot* of tally marks that anything can actually happen.","depth":5,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"roboticphish","name":"t1_cqh7cyx","parent_id":"t1_cqh0fzp","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429422709,"created_utc":1429419109}

What actually happened is that the origional provisions were much worse; they actually would have *required* the US to take anyone arrested on terror charges into military custody, even if they were US citizens arrested inside the United States.   Obama threatened to veto that, and demanded that they remove the entire section.  They removed part of it, and Obama signed it.		The claim that obama "asked for the provisions" may be technically true, but it's very misleading; he asked for the whole section to be removed, and was willing to live with the compromise that eventually passed as being less bad then the original bill, even though he still disagreed with part of it.

{"body":"I think you're misunderstanding. 		The Senate version contained language specifically exempting American citizens. As per Levin According to Senator Carl Levin, "the language which precluded the application of section 1031 to American Citizens was in the bill that we originally approved in the Armed Services Committee and the **Administration asked us to remove the language which says that U.S. citizens and lawful residents would not be subject to this section"**		So maybe he rejected requirements, but he did specifically ask for the capacity to be allowed to detain American citizens. He didn't ask for the whole section to be removed. Some representatives wanted to require like you said, some wanted to make it clear American citizens would be exempted. He took a middle way out, which in my opinion is really not much better than requiring the President to detain American citizens.		With the section you gave...if you're trusting of the President's words, fine. To me, detaining indefinitely overseas is just as bad, but that's really incorrect. He could theoretically detain in the US.		[Anthony Romero, ACLU: ???The statute is particularly dangerous because it has **no temporal or geographic limitations**, and can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield.  The ACLU will fight worldwide detention authority wherever we can, be it in court, in Congress, or internationally.???](https://www.aclu.org/news/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law?redirect=national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law)		>The White House threatened to veto the Senate version of the Act,[12] 		The Senate version of the Act was far preferable. It actually made it clear that the act excuses American citizens.		>The provision that the President "asked for" was actually the one designed to limit the original law, to "preserves current law concerning U.S. citizens and lawful resident aliens detained within the United States". 		He still asked for the ability to be able to detain American citizens indefinetly. Simply not making it mandatory does not assauge my concerns.		When you're talking about existing law, it is possible the AUMF can be construed to apply to American citizens. If Obama had signed off on the American citizens language he would have clarified they are excuses. But I think he purposefully left it ambiguous. 		>In his Signing Statement, President Obama explained: "I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad, crucial services for service members and their families, and vital national security programs that must be renewed...I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists".		I honestly can't trust his signing statement for a second. Considering the fact he wanted American citizens to not be excused, I have a hard time taking his word.		Even if you assume that he is 100% honest, who's to hold President Cruz, or Bush, or Clinton, to be 100% honest as well? Even his signing statement is a bit vague. You can interpret as him having beef with the indefinite detention provision, due to the fact Americans may not be exempt or you can interpret it as him saying it doesn't give him enough power...which I construe it as. 		Not to mention his administration defended the section in federal court, so I don't think his statement is very truthful.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ben1204","name":"t1_cqhn4ay","parent_id":"t1_cqhjss2","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429470411,"created_utc":1429466811}

(It's worth mentioning that one of the arguments Obama used was that he thought the executive branch *already* had the authority to detain terrorists in Guantanamo Bay under the AUMF, and didn't think a new law to that effect was necessary.

Senator Levin is being intentionally misleading here, I think, to try to deflect blame.		Where is your source confirming this? Why is Senator Levin being dishonest? He also asserted in the same sentence the administration asked to get rid of the "mandatory" part, which makes them look a little better.		I think Levin has no reason to smear Obama on this and shift blame.		I mean, obviously you and I can't really convince each other what went on behind the scenes, but I think that judging from the context, it's entirely reasonable to infer that Obama wanted that specific option. 		>It's worth mentioning that one of the arguments Obama used was that he thought the executive branch already had the authority to detain terrorists in Guantanamo Bay under the AUMF, and didn't think a new law to that effect was necessary.

The AUMF does give the President the power to detain foreigners indefinitely. [The whole "existing law" part](http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/ndaa.asp) is very ambiguous as it applies to American citizens. The fact that Obama had a chance to clarify it once and for all as not applying to Americans and didn't take it, makes me think he wants to leave open the power for the executive to determine it applies to Americans.		>Yeah, that's what Obama said as well, and that's exactally why Obama was so opposed to it and tried to kill it. 		He didn't try to kill it though. I'm gonna need a source if this is true. He tried to kill the mandatory part you speak of, but there is ample evidence that he didn't want to clarify that American citizens were exempt. 		>Like I said, that's simply not true. He wanted that provision removed from the bill entirely, he didn't want the NDAA to say anything about detaining people at all.		Honestly, where is your source or assumption.		>The White House threatened to veto the Senate version of the Act,[12] arguing in an executive statement on November 17, 2011, that while "the authorities granted by the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, including the detention authority...are essential to our ability to protect the American people...(and) Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, the Administration does not believe codification is necessary and poses some risk".		If this is what you're citing...it does not make it any better. That's still the President explicitly passing on excusing American citizens.		>We can't. Everyone should be furious at the Republicans in Congress for forcing that provision into law.		Obama rejected an amendment to excuse American citizens. He's every bit as responsible in my eyes.	>"Moreover, I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens.

{"body":">Thomas Ferguson proposed an alternative that he calls the investment theory of party competition. In this model, candidates for political office and political parties appeal not to voters, but to investors, who are the fundamental constituency. According to Ferguson, ???**parties are more accurately analyzed as blocs of major investors who coalesce to advance candidates representing their interests.**??? The policy platforms of political parties reflect the interests of major investors, and which minor investor-voters are virtually incapable of affecting, save in the negative sense of voting ???no confidence???. As the cost of political campaigns have skyrocketed in the era of tele-democracy, the logic of money driven political systems has become more and more applicable. The investment theory expects that **whole areas of policy will not be contested**. This will occur as a matter of routine because **major investors across parties may have virtually identical preferences** on many policy issues. Since major investors will all hail from the upper classes and the bulk of the voters from the popular masses, **the theory expects a sharp bias in public policy towards the rich wherever class interests are at stake**.

{"body":"I'm not considering the heir point of view, only the entrepreneurs.  In my scenario, he's earned the money fairly according to the rules of society.  He should be entitled to use it to pursue his own goals. 		If he were to spend 100% of it purchasing watermelons that were just going to rot and be worthless the government would not care. 		If he spent 100% of it on purchasing commercial time on broadcast tv so he could read his favorite poetry to the world the government would be okay with that. 		So long as he spends it all they are fine. 		But if he wishes to give it to his kids, they say no you can't do what you want with all your  money you can only do that with this portion we've decided to give you free control over. 		Gift taxes are paid by the giver. If I gave you $100,000 dollars. (I can't I'm not a 10%er) then I owe taxes at my marginal rate on everything greater than 14,000. 		So youre not letting him pass on the money and it is a tax on him and the government is thwarting his wishes. 		But the lefts view boils down to me, that they will take what they want because they can.		A business which thrives in the market place where customers voluntarily exchange their hard earned dollars for whatever product or service does immense good for society. 		If someone has done this so successfully that they have more money to pass along than the current exemptions. (About 5 million I think) I think this person has earned the right to do what they want, whether they give  every person in America $1 or they buy watermelons to rot or they endow 1000 university chairs or they want to give it to their children or grand kids etc. 		This has nothing to do with the heirs, it's about respecting private property. If it was earned fair and square it should be yours to do with as you choose.		Anything less is basically saying it's not really yours, and I think that's basically how the left sees it and I can't empathize with that intuition. 		I don't see where they have the moral claim to tax a dead person things that he's worked a whole life to build that he's already paid taxes on. 		If they need more money raise taxes on the sale of the business, or the yearly distributions, or the salary, or something else.		Some people are like me and aren't any where near the inner circle of this experientially, but we understand the facts and respect private property and industrious behavior and hard work and the estate tax is in principal an affront to those values which are our values too, even if we don't stand to inherit $6mill plus. 		That's why the House feels comfortable with that vote. 		Are they adding to the deficit by not raising taxes elsewhere?  If so uncool and merits criticism. But I relate to why they have visceral reaction to the "death" tax. 		Again, the heir who may have done nothing to earn this benevolence, doesn't enter into the moral calculus at all.

{"body":"Fair play to you, that was an interesting read and a very interesting study. I will point out two things though. First, many illegal immigrants don't even qualify for welfare programs (including food stamps and medicaid) as these programs require either citizenship or proof of illegal immigration. Second, the study you cited is inherently flawed (and even says so itself in the prebuttal section) because it assumes everyone gets the max amount of aid available (which the study even admits is not true) and doesn't really account for the fact that people coming from welfare and getting those entry-level jobs can still qualify for some forms of welfare, bumping them up over welfare alone (in all but 8 states).		I'm not discounting the study, it still demonstrates a pretty dire situation, but I think it's less dire than at first glance. Also, given the fact that we are only going to have more and more people in need of welfare (due to automation of low-level jobs), it's important to find ways to ensure a welfare system that is robust and manageable for the future. Repealing a tax that generates ~$27B annually, to come full circle, is definitely not the way to do that.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BluthFamilyChicken","name":"t1_cqgzfhj","parent_id":"t1_cqgx6al","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429406009,"created_utc":1429402409}

[Here's why](http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/voter-turnout/what-affects-voter-turnout-rates/):		> Wealthy Americans vote at much higher rates than those of lower socio-economic status. During the 2008 presidential election, only 41% of eligible voters making less than $15,000 a year voted, compared to 78% of those making $150,000 a year or more. Studies have shown that this difference in turnout affects public policy: politicians are more likely to respond to the desires of their wealthy constituents than of their poorer constituents, in part because more of their wealthy constituents vote.		Now, there are fair ways to get people to vote. You could require people to register and to show up at the polling booth, even if they only selected "none of the above" for everything. You could *pay* people to vote, maybe by giving them a paid day off work if they went to vote. You could give them a tax deduction or credit. There are ways. You could certainly get it up close to 100 percent. But no moneyed politician (and that is most of them) wants to rock the vote.","depth":4,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"flimsy_evidence","name":"t1_cqgue81","parent_id":"t1_cqgpvlz","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429395511,"created_utc":1429391911}

These would usually manifest in the form of learning new skills etc. etc. which would enable them to sell their labour at a higher rate in the labour market. 		Personally I don't think it is ethical to subside civic engagement. You end up bribing people to vote.

{"body":"> Do you not think, though, there is an argument here that those who are more likely to engage in civic duty such as turning up to vote, are also more likely to earn more money?		No. People with money have the time and energy to "engage in civic duty" because they aren't working three physically tiring jobs and spending the rest of the time just trying to get enough rest to be able to go back to work the next day. People with money have someone to watch the kids while they go vote. People with money don't need to squeeze voting in between six other errands they have to do that day. People with money have a sweet ride to the polling station. People with money vote to preserve the status quo because the status quo has been good to them, and they want to make sure people without money stay away from the polls. People with money are motivated to vote for themselves or for people who look and act a whole lot like themselves. People with money pay other people with money to run for office. 		People with money imagine their opinions matter more than those of people without money. But in truth, the unemployed high school drop out sitting at home watching professional wrestling and the head of the law department at the local university have an equal right and responsibility to vote just the way they are, with all the ignorance and prejudices they each have. An election is supposed to be a snapshot of public opinion at that moment, and it is a very bad snapshot when most of the poor are not even in the frame. 		If the rich truly wanted the poor to be better educated voters, they would improve the public education system *and* make sure the poor got out to vote. But that's not what the rich want. The rich want the poor to stay at work or at home on election day, while the rich get on with the business of reelecting the representatives of the rich.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"flimsy_evidence","name":"t1_cqh59tu","parent_id":"t1_cqgxqdc","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429417821,"created_utc":1429414221}

The problem is we already do have capital gains tax on certain parts of estates, real estate being the big one. This is one of the taxes that middle class families are more likely to pay out of an estate, since it's based on the difference between the value of the property when it was inherited (date of death) and the date of sale. However, there is an overall net gain to the inheritor here, so it's pretty reasonable.		How do you calculate capital gains on the rest of an estate?

You may read "lowers the labor participation rate" as "counterproductive for the overall economy," but that misunderstanding is due to your ignorance of the  field. 		[Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/upshot/how-inherited-wealth-helps-the-economy.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0) is an economist's perspective on inheritance. Mankiw is one of the most well-known mainstream economists of our time by the way, he's as "standard" as it gets (his textbook is the most popular in introductory curriculum). The whole article is worth a read, but I'll copy and paste the last paragraph that proves your assertions patently false:		> Because capital is subject to diminishing returns, an increase in its supply causes each unit of capital to earn less. And because increased capital raises labor productivity, workers enjoy higher wages. In other words, by saving rather than spending, those who leave an estate to their heirs induce an unintended redistribution of income from other owners of capital toward workers.		> The bottom line is that inherited wealth is not an economic threat. Those who have earned extraordinary incomes naturally want to share their good fortune with their descendants. Those of us not lucky enough to be born into one of these families benefit as well, as their accumulation of capital raises our productivity, wages and living standards.		> N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.		Yes, there are economic critiques of his argument, and yes economists disagree with the mechanisms of these issue, but your characterization of the "economist's perspective" is completely false. It turns out the issue is much more complex than your understanding of the issue (surprise, surprise).		It's not your ignorance that offends me, it's the way you framed your argument. You start your post with "from an economists perspective" and then spout something completely uninformed. That wouldn't be acceptable in any other field, so why should it be for economics? If I said "From a doctor's perspective" and then spouted some baseless, uninformed assertions, how would that look to you?		I'm not an economist either. But I have a degree in economics and know enough to know when I'm reading something written by somebody who has studied the field. Most people can't do that. They read your post and literally think you are presenting the "economists perspective," so that's what makes me a bit salty.","depth":8,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SkittlesUSA","name":"t1_cqh76eu","parent_id":"t1_cqh6vey","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429422240,"created_utc":1429418640}
{"body":"Great, that's the other end of the continuum of economic perspectives.		But let's clarify: the range of perspectives in mainstream economics ranges from "inherited wealth is not an economic threat" to inherited wealth is counterproductive to the wider economy. The median perspective is what I described.		Furthermore, as a non-economist like yourself, I evaluate claims based on the evidence. Maybe that's not how you do things, but its how I do things. So, I don't care much about the theoretical claims in your linked op/ed.		Large inheritances are counterproductive because they put economic authority in relatively incompetent hands, the marginal utility granted is low ("large" inheritances), and they disincentivize productivity in heirs. Those are completely valid theoretical economic considerations, but what's important is that they *are borne out in the data*.		So, returning to the topic at hand: Should their be an estate tax? 		Capital transfers by large inheritances are, in an economist's perspective, somewhere between indifferent and harmful to the economy. Therefore, since we have to have taxes, and (nearly) all taxes cause economic harm, taxing large inheritances is one of the least harmful taxes (it may even be that rare tax that is a net positive, although that is arguable).		So, large inheritances should be taxed.","depth":9,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lyddea","name":"t1_cqh7o52","parent_id":"t1_cqh76eu","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429423506,"created_utc":1429419906}

No, it isn't the other end of the continuum (besides like I said, Mankiw is pretty much *as standard as it gets* on the continuum of economic perspectives).

None of the evidence you have presented supports your claims. But, you don't have the economic understanding to know that. 		> Maybe that's not how you do things, but its how I do things.		Eh, I'm a quantitative analyst so I do it for a living. I understand the complexity of these issues, which is what makes me shake my head at your "perspective" and "supporting evidence."		>  the marginal utility granted is low ("large" inheritances)		Totally false, and again a claim borne of your lack of economic training. The marginal utility is lower than their previous consumption, but saying "the marginal utility granted is low" is again a nonsensical claim borne from your misunderstanding of the basic premises of utility theory.		Look man, I'm not looking to change your opinion on the estate tax. I'm just offering you the blue pill or the red pill.		If you take the blue pill you can continue getting your beliefs and economic "perspective" validated on Reddit by posting bullshit and getting upvoted.

Or you can take the red pill. You can admit you don't understand the economic perspective on the issue at all (I promise you- you don't). You can take the time to actually understand the economic arguments on both sides (you don't understand the economic arguments of your own pro-tax side). Most importantly, you can stop pretending like you are speaking on the behalf of the perspective of "an economist" because some bullshit "make sense" in your head. 		My favorite quote on economics is- "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design." 		I'm giving you a gift.

You might be misunderstanding me a bit here.  Money just doesn't languish accruing interest. That interest is what fuels growth in the economy from which taxes are taken and which is then spent on infrastructure and social programs.  What the estate tax does is to circumvent that and lose those other benefits along the way.  The government still gets its cut but its over a longer period of time and the growth from the private investments increase the economy and therefore the tax revenue taken. 		Lets for the sake of argument suppose that next year no one who has accumulated wealth dies.  Does the infrastructure and assistance programs go unfunded because the revenue drops?

This CBO report ( http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/07-06-estatetax.pdf ) is a little dry but it's not too long. They raise questions about the effect the estate tax could have on saving/investment but more than a few things were not concrete at the time of the study. However, assuming I'm reading this correctly, we can see the tax rates being lower than the maximum...a lot lower, relatively few small businesses/farms being impacted in any case, etc. Further, they were using data from the old threshold of about $600k, not the $5.4M per person of today. That would lead me to believe that less estates of that nature are being affected (factoring in the amount and the lower likelihood of a huge increase in small businesses/farms worth more than 5.4 million dollars during the period between 2001 and 2015).

But when is the last time you saw a politician claim sales taxes were double taxation?  That's because the big money in politics don't care about sales tax (sales tax is regressive, the more money you make the less you pay as a percentage of income).		The only time you see politicians talk about double taxation is when it's in the form of taxes that disproportionately affect the wealthy (capital gains, estate taxes, etc.).		Double taxation isn't an issue.  There's no reason why money should only be taxed once.  It's the amount of tax that matters.  There's no difference from taking 20 cents from someone's dollar and taking 10 cents, and then 10 cents again.  		The only question is whether a certain tax is socially beneficial.

If we want to decrease government revenue, are there better revenue sources to cut (i.e., revenue sources that are more harmful)?		Estate taxes are, in my opinion, a good source of revenue for society because it targets societal capital that is generally illiquid, and it doesn't harm the incentive of private individuals to create wealth as much as something as an income tax would.

While I understand this $5.4M is above most, the disappointing thing is everyone has this thought that its only Wall Street CEO's who are benefiting from this, not the plumber who didn't graduate college, worked his ass off his whole life for 50 yrs, while starting his own business midway through, making 70k/yr and living like shit so his family could live a better life. 		What if we made the estate tax exempt for those who had $500k in savings, would the out cry be the same? Let's say it was some disabled person who could only make money wage and wanted a better life for their children and their children's children; the outcry wouldn't be there. It's only because we have this view that the only people who can make millions are those who in reality make million(s) every month, not the guy who worked 12hr days for 50 yrs and tried his best to support his family.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sub116610","name":"t1_cqh1yw2","parent_id":"t1_cqguagr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429410966,"created_utc":1429407366}

So, if the kid wants to farm after dad dies, he's going to have to sell almost $3 million in assets just to pay the tax bill, essentially selling off 30% of his farm to keep going, or taking out a $3 million loan to pay the taxes.

Gift tax on the other hand is a tax levied on all amounts given to an individual that exceed $14,000 per year.

It is predicted that someone entering the workforce today needs to accumulate something like $5m-$10m in their 401K in order to retire comfortably.  If you do it correctly you then don't spend that $5m-$10m at all.  Instead you put it in bonds and let it pay you a comfortable stipend every year, so you make money as if you were still working.		Then, you (should) get a nice benefit that when you die your kids get the huge chunk you were living off of.  They can live off of it too, or they can blow it on hookers and yachts or whatever.		> It is irrational to hoard that type of wealth. Why aren't people spending their money while they're alive? 	The trouble with life is you never know how long it is going to be or what its going to throw at you next.

Empire outstrips the fiscal resources of the state	2. Conflict between the Monarchy and the nobility over the ???reform??? of the tax system led to paralysis and bankruptcy.	3. The Enlightenment: impulse for reform intensifies political conflicts; reinforces traditional aristocratic constitutionalism, one variant of which was laid out in Montequieu???s Spirit of the Laws; introduces new notions of good government, the most radical being popular sovereignty, as in Rousseau???s Social Contract [1762]; the attack on the regime and privileged class by the Literary Underground of ???Grub Street;??? the broadening influence of public opinion.	4. Social antagonisms between two rising groups: the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie	5. Ineffective ruler: Louis XVI	6. Economic hardship, especially the agrarian crisis of 1788-89 generates popular discontent and disorders caused by food shortages.		You change the names to fit the modern climate, and you get our modern situation short of that last one. That last one is key, it usually is the kickoff for revolution. We just had a huge recession, and we're hitting our food supply with the 1 2 punch of climate change and booming population, both at an exponential rate. There is already a drought in California almost every year, citrus plants in Florida have started being hit by a freeze most years now, and these are just two of the recurring issues. Every year there's a new crisis with our food supply because of the changing climate.		Our country was founded on revolution, and people look up to the American Revolutionaries almost like gods. One of our most sacred documents is the Declaration of Independence which starts with those famous lines championing the very idea of revolution. To us, it's not a bloody, terrible thing to be avoided, it's something that we would consider an honor to participate in. The true horror of the civil war is already fading to most, those that aren't the good ol' boys that embrace it as a badge of honor and would welcome a chance to fight the federal government with their Texan brothers. We also have one of the highest guns/capita.		And then you have to take into account the digital revolution, a modern age where information and ideas spread exponentially more quickly than in any other time of history. Plus the damage one person can do with a computer.		We don't get our issues with the government out in mass protests like Europe, we just keep it bottled up inside. It's going to erupt before people know what's happening. There's a lot of thought I have put behind this. There's probably 15-20% of the population at this very moment that would fall in line if somebody stood up. I'd say we're a decade or 2 and a charismatic leader from a full scale revolt, so I give it about 40 years for resentment to reach critical mass and that person to come along.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SenorSativa","name":"t1_cqh02rn","parent_id":"t1_cqgvrnl","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429407191,"created_utc":1429403591}

{"body":"Ok but you're talking about something completely unrelated now.  There is a credit, but that of course applies against the existing 706 filing.  Lets look at the IRS official website:		> Estate Tax	> 	> The Estate Tax is a tax on your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death (Refer to Form 706 (PDF)). The fair market value of these items is used, not necessarily what you paid for them or what their values were when you acquired them. The total of all of these items is your "Gross Estate." The includible property may consist of cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, annuities, business interests and other assets.	> 	> Once you have accounted for the Gross Estate, certain deductions (and in special circumstances, reductions to value) are allowed in arriving at your "Taxable Estate." These deductions may include mortgages and other debts, estate administration expenses, property that passes to surviving spouses and qualified charities. The value of some operating business interests or farms may be reduced for estates that qualify.	> 	> After the net amount is computed, the value of lifetime taxable gifts (beginning with gifts made in 1977) is added to this number and the tax is computed. The tax is then reduced by the available unified credit.	> 	> Most relatively simple estates (cash, publicly traded securities, small amounts of other easily valued assets, and no special deductions or elections, or jointly held property) do not require the filing of an estate tax return. A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $1,500,000 in 2004 - 2005; $2,000,000 in 2006 - 2008; $3,500,000 for decedents dying in 2009; and $5,000,000 or more for decedent's dying in 2010 and 2011 (note: there are special rules for decedents dying in 2010); $5,120,000 in 2012, $5,250,000 in 2013, $5,340,000 in 2014 and $5,430,000 in 2015.	> 	> Beginning January 1, 2011, estates of decedents survived by a spouse may elect to pass any of the decedent???s unused exemption to the surviving spouse. This election is made on a timely filed estate tax return for the decedent with a surviving spouse. Note that simplified valuation provisions apply for those estates without a filing requirement absent the portability election. 	> 	> For additional information, refer to Instructions for Form 706.		So I see what you're talking about right here in the 4th paragraph		> After the net amount is computed, the value of lifetime taxable gifts (beginning with gifts made in 1977) is added to this number and the tax is computed. **The tax is then reduced by the available unified credit.**		But what I'm focusing on is the 5th paragraph		> A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $1,500,000 in 2004 - 2005; $2,000,000 in 2006 - 2008; $3,500,000 for decedents dying in 2009; and $5,000,000 or more for decedent's dying in 2010 and 2011 (note: there are special rules for decedents dying in 2010); $5,120,000 in 2012, $5,250,000 in 2013, $5,340,000 in 2014 and $5,430,000 in 2015.		The credit can reduce and possibly even eliminate the tax due, but the original tax is still borne on those estates that require a 706 filing.  A credit also implies that the net result can be a positive dollar amount, but this is prohibited by 26 U.S. Code ?? 2010 (d)		> (d) Limitation based on amount of tax	The amount of the credit allowed by subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by section 2001. 		I guess I can see where things get muddy because exemptions in large dollar amounts can eliminate a huge tax burden, lets say on an estate of $10 billion dollars.  I'm sure the wealthy can afford top accountants that can find creative ways to ensure a massive credit against the borne tax.  I'd like to see more concrete examples and studies of this however before I can certify it as a legitimate threat.

AND, government spending continues to be an utterly inefficient system where politicians basically funnel lucrative contracts to supportive constituents and campaign contributors, without any real correlation to market prices or product performance. and you think the solution is to take 7 out of every 10 dollars that a person earns, just because they accomplished the impossible task of generating abnormally high income? and you think someone smart enough to generate that level of income is going to be dumb enough to just sit around and get steamrolled by a bad policy, which was written and implemented as part of a shortsighted political strategy to gain public favor, even though it'll actually lead to the opposite of the intended outcome?","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Blergburgers","name":"t1_cqirl61","parent_id":"t1_cqind0o","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429559523,"created_utc":1429555923}

{"body":"One reason is that, generally, in a large estate a bunch of the value is unrealized capital gains of some sort. 		That is, Dear Old Dad bought some shares in that new fangled IBM back in 1962 and has not sold any since.		When Dad dies, the heir get what is called a stepped up cost basis for the shares.  That is the new value used to calculate capital gains on the heirs is the value of the shares the day that Dad kicked the bucket.  		On a split adjusted basis Dad bought his shares for $2.41 each (per yahoo finance), junior gets them at todays close of $160.67.		The $160.67 becomes juniors cost basis and if he sells some stock in a year at $175.00 he only pays capital gains on the $14.33 gain since he inhereted them.		Now, governments cost money to run.  Streets, defense etc. etc. etc. all cost. So taxes are a fact of life.  Someone has to pay for all the ordinance we expend in the middle east (or the health care for lazy out of work bums if you find that more offensive). So again, taxes are a given.		Taxes on stock are structured the way they are because the govenent thinks buying and holding is a better for the country than moving into and out of the market a whole bunch. That is why short term gains are taxed at a higher rate than long term gains. Also, that is why (among other reasons) you pay capital gains taxes when you SELL the stock rather than some estimated amount yearly or some other scheme.		Because Dear old Dad never sold the stock, he never realized the gain, so the government never got its cut.		For normal sized estates, that is estates that the majority of the population can expect to leave, the step up in the cost basis seems to be a pretty fair idea.  Dad saved money, passed it to the kids or grand kids, why would you tax it?  That is what Dad's are supposed to do.		But above some amount, it starts to look like the aristocracy figuring out ways to keep from paying any taxes on their increased wealth. 		What that amount is can be argued about until the cows come home but many (I wouild say most) people think that establishing a multigenerational class of extreme wealth is not compatible with a democratic society where we are all supposed to have equal opportunity to acheive success.		This is way too long, but I want to make one other point.  That $5.4 million is the NET estate.  So if you have a modest sized farm with a mortgage on the land (or loans for equipment etc.) that comes out of the gross before this calculation is done.  Likewise if you are a modest sized home builder or mechanic or whatever.  Most people (even 'rich') people are not sitting on a NET of $4.5 million.  		Edit:	It just occured to me that I am going to get a a bunch of crap from the real estate crowd.  If the real estate is a home it works the same way as stocks.  The heir gets a bumped up cost basis and some kind of exemption on capital gains when the real estate is sold (something like $500,000 for a couple).		Non-residential real estate is a whole other ball of wax and you could get whacked pretty good.		Of course, if you have that kind of money in real estate you are not going to be holding it in your name anyway, it would be owned by a family corporation or trust or something similiar, so there would not be any implications for the estate.  The ownership (i.e. stock) of the family corp would just get shuffled around.

{"body":"I'm not saying I do or don't think that this specific tax cut is a good solution. However, heavily taxing the upper class is not helping. In fact it is doing the exact opposite.  Let me tell you all a shot story (pls try to stay open minded). 			**Background**				My father (I'm still in school) grew up in a poor coal mining  family, he studied hard worked two jobs from his early teens through school. He graduated top of his class but was still told that he could never get into dental school (his goal). After being interviewed he told he would be the 31st person to be accepted that year... But they only take top 30.  A little while later the kid in front of him decided not to go and he got in. So he worked his but off, went to orthodontic school and then got a job (11 years of schooling after high school).  He decided to move and work with a guy he had met in school.  He got a job and after years became part owner.  He then bought the other half of the practice when his partner retired. He is now the successful owner of 2 orthodontic practices. 		**My point**		My dad worked to get where he is, but is also in the lower upper class now.  His employees are lucky to have him.  He would give them paid vacation time, full medical benefits, etc...  The current tax rate for him is 68%.  He no longer can offer full medical and has cut down to unpaid vacation time which is even less frequent.  He has also had to lay people off.  68 fucking percent. Where is the incentive to even work?  These taxes are might appear to benefit the middle and lower class, but it is really screwing up the job market.     Just think that if you made $100,000 a year you only get to keep $32,000.  That is before paying bills, that is why the economy is messed up.				**Edit to clarify**		**break down**		Federal income: 39.6%		Social security: 15% 		Obamacare stuff: 9%		State: 3%		Local: 1.5%","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aquaticsnipes","name":"t1_cqgz349","parent_id":"t3_331d5l","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429405323,"created_utc":1429401723}

{"body":">Who are, most likely, members of the famously infamous "1% which pays 35% of all federal income taxes but earns less than 19% of all Adjusted Gross Income. 		Note that you're only talking about income here.   When you look at total tax burden, local, state, and federal, the middle 20% pays about the same as the top 20%.  The top .1% pays much less then either.		The very tiny number of people this tax covers, the super-rich, actually pay a much, much lower tax then anyone else, because they get most of their income from capital gains and the capital gains tax is so low.   People bashed Romney for only paying a tax rate of 12%, but that's actually pretty normal in his tax bracket.  If anything he probably intentionally payed more taxes then usual that year because he knew he'd have to share his tax records.		The fact is, right now, the very rich simply aren't paying their fair share, by any standard.		Beyond that, taxing the poor obviously does far more harm (both in terms of the economy and in terms of actual human suffering) then does taxing the rich by the same degree.   Having a progressive tax system makes a lot of sense, it's a system that leaves the vast majority of the people better off then the kind of system we have now (which, like I said above, is basically flat, except the very rich pay a lot less).","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Yosarian2","name":"t1_cqgz4ya","parent_id":"t1_cqgud3l","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429405432,"created_utc":1429401832}

{"body":"My question to you would be why should the wealthy be penalized or somehow be forced to give more of what they have earned. That goes against my point to begin with of the government taking what you earn. Income tax to me is silly. "hey you just worked all day and I did nothing but let me have some of what you just worked for". If I personally asked you to agree to those terms there's no way you would do it. So why do we allow our government to do this with taxes that in many cases were instituted as a temporary measure many years ago with the promise they would be abolished once the hard times were past? Back to the original point and you somewhat reaffirm this, if we all pay the same PERCENTAGE then your "top 1%" where all that wealth is are paying a fair yet MUCH larger amount. How is that not fair? But somehow since they did better they have to put more in the pot? Back to our analogy that's like our agreement changing after you agree to it, it now is as follows "You work and I will take a part, but if you work hard and earn that promotion and finally get ahead I demand you pay me the same percentage as before (which is now larger) AND an additional amount". Again, you would be angry at this, as it is in no way shape or form fair. But it's easy to dictate what others should give when it's not your wallet being raided. I'm as far away from that end of the wealth pyramid as possible but I just cannot in good conscience think that somehow the rest of us are somehow entitled to their success any more than I think the government should be. That's just my view on it much of which comes from my personal belief that you don't ever take anything you haven't earned.

Consider that I would measure lifestyle quality in GDPPC/PPP...		Growth predication is a simplistic goal. Outright blind growth though, isn't necessarily good. I'm also not saying more schools, roads, buildings, and population quantities are bad, they are great... but they don't nessesarily make typical lifestyles any better...

{"body":"So now you don't know enough about that particular company, when originally you said:		> When multi-billion dollar companies and people leave to other countries... trillions are lost. Losing Halliburton was horrible for America.				Government spending can absolutely spur innovation. It's certainly not the only thing that does, but it plays a role. Having a strong legal framework with patent protection and intellectual property law is great for innovation. So too are research grants, public schooling, higher education and investment loans. Things like schools, roads, buildings and other things like internet infrastructure and power not only attract business, but they make doing business easier. Those are absolutely things that make "typical lifestyles" better, and it's part of the reason why technology companies are located in areas with stellar infrastructure and education and not in BFE. 		> wealth-redistributing markets		I have no idea what this is. Do you mean wealth-redistributing tax policy? Because that's what taxes are, at a fundamental level. Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are not. It doesn't have to be either or, but to claim that any redistribution isn't good for stimulating innovation is silly.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"prommie_k","name":"t1_cqh6fj0","parent_id":"t1_cqh4xzn","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429420432,"created_utc":1429416832}

Taxes function more like non-profit companies than a wealth redistribution mechanism.		Actually, you're correct, that was silly way to phrase it, a small amount of wealth redistribution is very arguably very good, I was referring specifically to using high taxes to fund infrastructure to spur growth, which inadvertently acts as an economic mechanism for wealth redistribution, by forcing transaction quantity. Again though, I'm for innovation not quantity of transactions. I would for example rather use an algorithm to redistribute some small percentage of money, then use those same dollars to build more public infrastructure.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IkeLives","name":"t1_cqh6ts7","parent_id":"t1_cqh6fj0","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429421360,"created_utc":1429417760}
