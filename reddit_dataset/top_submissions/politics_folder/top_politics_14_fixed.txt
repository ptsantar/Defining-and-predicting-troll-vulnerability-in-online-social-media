{"body":"People who philosophically reject the notion that reality (the Universe, Being, Ontology) is only understandable from the human perspective (popularized by the philosopher Immanuel Kant). Object-Oriented Ontologists (OOOs)claim that objects (things that are not people and don't experience consciousness like we do) exist independently of our perception of them. 		Kant's line of thinking basically says that if you have a hammer in front of you, the only thing you know about the reality of that hammer is based on your perception of it. The hammer doesn't really exist outside of your brain - your consciousness takes some sensory input and creates this idea of a hammer but you can't really say how that hammer exists outside of your interaction with it (or even if it does exist outside of human perception). 		OOOs would say that the hammer absolutely exists in the real world outside of your brain, that it has its own perspective and its own agency. Kantian thought says that objects only exist in the sense that they distort human consciousness - it's the relationship between your brain and the hammer that creates the hammer. The hammer is defined by the way it affects your brain, the impression it makes.  OOOs say that the relationship between the hammer and the nail has the same effect from the perspective of the hammer or the nail. Those two objects have a relationship that defines them outside of human consciousness - they interact with each other, distort each other, make impressions of each other. They exist in their relationship to each other divorced from human perspective. 		If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?		 Kantians might say - "How do you know there is a tree or a forest if no human is there to experience it? The sound is irrelevant - the tree effectively does not exist."		O.O.O.s might say - "I don't know about making a sound but I bet the ground would have something to say about the impression a falling tree leaves."		Does that make sense?

{"body":"...That's still an interaction with the 'hammer' though, and thus only reveals "the hammer" in the perception (image, impact, pain) of the subject.		Kant doesn't say there is no external, mind-independent world. Just that everything we can know about the totality of our world will always necessarily be in terms dictated (not necessarily exclusively, but certainly most importantly) by how our minds work, what structures of the classifications, categorizations and even direct perceptions are given independently of the things in the external world we 'perceive'.		So, Kant merely (and correctly) states that we can't know anything except through our conscious perception / judgement, and we can't actually prove or disprove any consistent claim that goes above the structure of our perceptive impressions, whether subjective or intersubjective.		And the mind is such that you cannot 'perceive' or 'imagine' - i.e. have any object-representation that is not 'colored' by the categories in which our minds naturally and necessarily think. Space and time for example - are certainly essential features of our cognition and consciousness. 		Now let's ask: given that these are categories that necessarily fundamental to our thinking and perceiving - how could we tell whether they are *only* that, and 'external reality' (if it exists, which we are going to assume - with Kant) must not have a structure like the spatial and temporal characteristics of our perception / imagination... or whether it is an accurate reflection of the structure of reality? There is no way to prove either - because by definition, we cannot get any information about anything 'external' except through our conscious perception in interactions.		This is true whether you're just naively looking at the world or taking readouts from the most complex measurement-apparatus.		More to the point though - let's assume there is an external world with objects in it with which we can interact. What we can learn of them will necessarily and per definition be limited to how they present to a conscious subject when that subject interacts with it in a certain way, which can be more or less direct - but is never entirely direct.		So given merely the reasonable premise that if there is an external world, we have no access to it except through perception in interaction - we arrive at the conclusion that if there is a 'nature' of objects in the world (i.e. there are properties it has) that do not determine *directly* how the object can enter into relations with other objects... there is no possible way to ever learn about them through interaction, and thus through perception - and thus: in general, for any subject.		Of course we can hypothesize so-far unseen mechanisms behind 'unified' phenomena of systems exhibiting certain properties... and we may be able to devise interactions which would have to show a specific outcome should the hypothesized mechanism exist, and thus strengthen our assumption of its "reality"... but that is affirming the consequent in abductive reason. That's how all empirical science works - and it's fine. It just categorically precludes actual proof (allowing only relative corroboration) and brings with it the problem of *unconsidered alternatives*... other theories with potentially radically different ontology but relevantly identical empirical consequences.		Realizing that the contents of perception and judgments about the world are due as much if not more to the things our minds presuppose and 'impose' even in 'ordinary perception' was certainly  hugely influential - and his epistemic points still stand.		We can be realist about the external world, and optimistic about our ability to know some things about mind-independent reality (though with important caveats - see [*Scientific Realism*](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/), [*Structural Realism*](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/)) - and all the while appreciate Kant's points.		EDIT: Many scientists realize some of the epistemic points in this - and are reluctant to speak of 'proof'. And with Hawking's and Mlodinow's book on their "Model dependent realism" (which is actually pretty much instrumentalism / constructive empiricism, not a form of realism), some renewed attention has been given to the issue among scientifically interested laypeople and some academic circles beyond philosophy-departments.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BlueHatScience","name":"t1_csq3vm3","parent_id":"t1_csq1f16","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435864315,"created_utc":1435860715}

Another point I feel is quite central to his epistemology / metaphysics is that we need a conception of *noumena* to account for *phenomena* - even though we cannot ever come to know them in interaction (by definition). But in metaphysics and epistemology and natural science, we can arrive at certain constraints for noumena and some insight into how our minds prescribe what perception will be like.		If you're coming from critical theory, you're probably intimately familiar with the way Kant has been used and abused in continental philosophy. Neo-Kantianism there does (or so it appears to me) tend to go from the Kantian position (which was a synthesis of empiricism and rationalism) to an extreme constructivism, and take that as a default.... unwarranted, I think - at least to that extreme degree.		In analytical philosophy of science, metaphysics, philosophy of mind and epistemology (my background -  together with philosophy of the neuro-cognitive sciences and of evolutionary theory), many currently discussed positions and arguments incorporate Kantian insights in a perhaps more realistic and modest fashion.		That's the amazing thing about Kant, though - he is a central figure whose works influenced pretty much all later work both in the analytical and the continental tradition.

So that would be reducible all the way down to quarks having agency by interacting with each other via the Strong Nuclear Force.		When an elementary particle has agency, it seems to me that we're no longer talking about the thing most people want to talk about when they use the word "agency".		>(since agency is really only measurable in effect through change)		I thought agency was about being capable of acting with intention or at least the illusion of it. If you're a strict determinist, as I am (well, mostly, anyway), then all of the choices made by a brain are reducible to natural physical interactions like the hammer hitting the nail, but there is still an emergent property that appears to have qualities like intention and purpose, and it's worthwhile to have a word for that.		> Judging the degree of agency a hammer possesses from our perspective of being isn't really fair - hammers have very low agency from the perspective of a person but I can't say how a hammer would judge it's own degree of agency.		Well, why does the hammer have an identity as a hammer at all in this discussion? We call it a hammer, and that has meaning to us. A hammer serves a purpose for human beings, but outside of that context, "hammerness" is not really a thing. A hammer is a purposeless collection of elements bonded chemically and/or physically together into a structure. There's no reason to suppose that the hammer *itself* possesses a sense of identity. Ironically, to assume so is, itself, pretty naively anthropocentric.		>We're creating a hierarchy of agency and automatically assuming we're in the top position		Well, I don't know about that. I'd certainly agree that we consider ourselves to be over some kind of threshold, but I for one can grant that there may well be levels of agency above and beyond our own.		>And we can't be sure that from another ontological perspective there isn't something looking at us and saying we have no agency, make no decisions, have no autonomy, no consciousness.		I'm fairly confident that if we had complete or even nearly complete knowledge about the function of the human brain and the laws of physics that govern the behavior of its constituent parts, that every behavior of a human would be reducible to the interactions of the constituent parts and perfectly predictable from basic principles.

If the question is: *"Does it cause a human experience of sound?"* then the answer is no.		But if the question is: *"Does it cause compression waves to travel through air and affect objects in ways that could theoretically be detected even later?"* then the answer is yes, according to our best understanding.","depth":7,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SushiAndWoW","name":"t1_csq45be","parent_id":"t1_csq0rdq","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435864718,"created_utc":1435861118}

Why his conclusion was so important is because Hume powerfully argued the following:  if we have no access to the world independent of our perceptions of it, then all human enterprises claimed to be built on objective fact is actually made up of habit and custom. Kant responds to Hume's skepticism by arguing that while we don't have objective access to the world-in-itself, we do have access to our perceptions of the external world.

From the [Albuquerque Journal](http://www.abqjournal.com/580107/news/dea-agents-seize-16000-from-aspiring-music-video-producer.html):		Joseph Rivers, 22, was traveling on Amtrak from Dearborn, Mich., near his hometown of Romulus, Mich., to Los Angeles to fulfill his dream of making a music video. Rivers, in an email, said he had saved his money for years, and his mother and other relatives scraped together the rest of the $16,000.		A DEA agent boarded the train at the Albuquerque Amtrak station and began asking various passengers, including Rivers, where they were going and why. When Rivers replied that he was headed to LA to make a music video, the agent asked to search his bags. Rivers complied.		Rivers was the only passenger singled out for a search by DEA agents ??? and the only black person on his portion of the train, Pancer said. Rivers was the only passenger singled out for a search by DEA agents ??? and the only black person on his portion of the train, Pancer said.		???I even allowed him to call my mother, a military veteran and (hospital) coordinator, to corroborate my story,??? Rivers said. ???Even with all of this, the officers decided to take my money because he stated that he believed that the money was involved in some type of narcotic activity.???		Rivers was left penniless, his dream deferred.		Sean Waite, the agent in charge for the DEA in Albuquerque, said he could not comment on the Rivers case because it is ongoing. He disputed allegations that Rivers was targeted because of his race.		Waite said that in general DEA agents look for ???indicators??? such as whether the person bought an expensive one-way ticket with cash, if the person is traveling from or to a city known as a hot spot for drug activity, if the person???s story has inconsistencies or if the large sums of money found could have been transported by more conventional means.		???We don???t have to prove that the person is guilty,??? Waite said. ???It???s that the money is presumed to be guilty.???		DEA agents may choose to ask the person whether his or her possessions can be searched in what is called a ???consensual encounter.??? If the subject refuses, the bags ??? but not the person ??? can be held until a search warrant is obtained, he said.		*here's the kicker...*		While travelers like Rivers still have to worry about DEA agents, state and local law enforcement in New Mexico no longer has these virtually unlimited seizure powers. Five days before Rivers??? encounter in Albuquerque, Gov. Susana Martinez signed into law a bill that bars state and local law enforcement from seizing money or property under civil asset forfeiture. The law takes effect in July.		*and this is where ~~the~~ your blood starts to boil...*		**But the new state law won???t supersede the federal law**, meaning federal agencies such as the DEA are still free to take your cash on arguably the flimsiest of legal grounds.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"S_K_I","name":"t1_csq75vq","parent_id":"t3_3bvaix","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435869213,"created_utc":1435865613}

{"body":"As always with these stories, if anyone has any questions, I went through this. The cops took my car, my money, and my phone and even paying a lawyer several thousand and going to trial was not enough to get them back.		I went to buy some pot from a friend like I had been doing for years. The cops were actually in the process of busting him and they intercepted my texts. They went through our previous conversations and mimiced his way of speaking and encouraged me to come by.		Once there I was arrested without actually getting out of my car or doing anything. I spent the night in jail where the next day I was released all charges dropped.		A week later they came to my house and tore the place apart and took my property. My lawyer said they were mad they found nothing in my car/on me/in my house and took my property to teach me a lesson.		I'm not sure how that sounds written out, but just know it destroyed me for a long time. Whenever the doorbell rang, I dropped down to hide from windows, my heart pounding expecting it to be them again at the door. My girlfriend would have to text me to let me know she was expecting a package as it would trigger me (I used that word reddit doesn't like).		They made her cry and said I was a piece of shit who made bad life decisions and she deserved better, among other things. For trying to buy a couple ounces of pot.		They asked about my time in service once they found out I was a veteran and when they learned of my time in the Air Force they made nonstop jokes about how they thought only smart people got into the Air Force. It was a very personal thing for them despite the only words escaping my lips being yes sir and no sir.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thatbardfellow","name":"t1_csq6isu","parent_id":"t3_3bvaix","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435868245,"created_utc":1435864645}
