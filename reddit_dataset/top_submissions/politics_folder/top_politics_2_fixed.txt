A lot of it is personal experience, and a large portion of the population appear to be sheltered from the worst effects of our growing income inequality and shrinking middle class.

We're going to start seeing an economic shift as it becomes less of a financial no-brainer to own a home, but long term, unless there's a black swan event, I don't see riots in the streets or other forms of extreme civil unrest as likely outcomes of our current household financial circumstances.		As for student loans, I think that either a political movement will be initiated to forgive massive amounts of debt at once, leaving financial institutions caught holding it high and dry, *or* the process of debt forgiveness will occur slowly over time, as federal loans hit the 25-year income based repayment forgiveness period. I see most of this excessive student loan debt as "bad" debt, so I would prefer that we do our best to purge that debt and correct student tuition rates as a country sooner rather than later, but I'm not going to pretend like I have any well-thought-out solutions for how that can be accomplished without creating another recession.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"s54b32dd","name":"t1_cqt1gl0","parent_id":"t1_cqt0wt3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430342392,"created_utc":1430338792}

{"body":"Large, nation-wide riots don't happen in the United States.  But plenty of protests and "riots" happen all the time.  Riots over sports games (Riot after the 2014 world series), riots over money (Occupy Wall Street), riots over injustice like the ones you mentioned above with Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown or Freddie Grey.  And these are only the major riots that major news outlets decide to show us.  There could be tons of riots across the country each day that only locals may ever hear about.		There is unrest and there is always that anger in the back of your mind but people are powerless to do anything.  Our forefathers would turn in their graves if they knew how strong our federal government became in relation to the people.  George Washington,  John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, our first three presidents knew of the shitstorm that surrounded a strong and powerful central government.  They understood how they could be put down so easily by a powerful government and understood why government must be limited.  Because the King of England was slowly taking away their rights (Remember, no taxation without representation?  Where is our representation?)		There is also the illusion that many people are behind the cause, but in reality, the people you see on Reddit speaking out about this is as far as it goes.  In reality, most of our country is ignorant to the news, to politics, and to our leaders.  They have no idea why they vote for people, no idea why they are working, no idea why they are even living, because the government has brainwashed so many people into thinking that living in America is the best gift anyone could receive.  It is great here,  but our leaders use the greatness of America to shadow their dark deeds that most Americans might hear about, but won't care about.  Even Redditors are guilty of doing nothing, just like the rest of the country, by sitting on their computers and talking to other Redditors like it will make a difference.		So you can see here, the extent of our "unrest".  People type words on a computer, people get angry for 5 minutes, and then go back to what they are doing like nothing was ever the matter.		Most people also won't do anything because of the police.  The police are infamous in America and they are hated almost universally by all Americans (my parents are Korean immigrants who own their own business and are doing very well, they still hate the police).  Who wants to get up from their comfortable couch and go to a rally/protest where they can potentially get hit by bean bag shots, tear gas, tasers, tackled, etc. by the police in the name of justice and order?  I sure as hell don't.  		So why do we vote for our leaders?  Well say hello to our bipartisan system.  Unlike the EU or other governments where there is a huge selection of different parties to choose from, the United States has only two--the Democrats and Republicans.  Well, our system basically makes these our "official" parties while other independent parties are not given huge media attention like the Dems or Repubs.  So parties like the Tea Party, the Green Party, the Libertarians, etc. are usually unable to rack up enough votes.  Why is that so, though, if our people are the ones with the power?  		Well they aren't.  The government has selected what they want our people to know, so well, that the people are basically blind to anything except the two-party system.  Even though these independent parties are supposed to be for the average citizen, most are too blind by "tradition" (families tend to have similar political affiliations), the media, and by our own long standing system of government (majority [currently Republican]  and minority [currently Democratic] parties have their own leaders in the Senate, etc.)  		Independent parties are also usually hugely underfunded in their political campaigns compared to our two majority parties.  The donkeys and elephants have ties and old money that go back probably to our founding days.  Money is recycled through these parties like aluminum and what you have is a powerhouse that can't be tamed by a small party like the Libertarians, (mainly because the biggest and most outspoken supporters of the Libertarian party are young Americans who have no money aka college students/recent graduates, just as a fun fact).  So in these cases, it usually boils down to most people voting for "the lesser of two-evils" or as they believe it to be, with any independent parties receiving fractions of the votes.  		For example, the last independent party to receive huge recognition was the Libertarian party where Ron Paul began to pick up momentum as the 2012 Presidential election rolled around.  However, the media painted him as a senile old fool (he sort of was) that was not capable of leading our country (even though most of his policies were the most sound of the three, most people would have supported him if they knew who he was, etc.) so by the time elections came around, he just dropped from the ticket.  So what did his son, Rand Paul do?  Not follow in his Dad's footsteps and he signed onto the Republican side, because only these two parties are given recognition and attention.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lord_dokodo","name":"t1_cqsscmn","parent_id":"t1_cqsl2ey","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430329179,"created_utc":1430325579}

{"body":"God Damn people. Somebody either explain why not or upvote my solution to this. I have been posting to get some support but none so far. Whats wrong with this? 		Most of solutions proposed are not practical because, even if we replace president, how do we know he will do anything. Or if he will have the power to do anything. Same with congress. We cannot build a new system, it is not practical. We cannot start a civil war. We cannot elect a third party (neither practical nor do we know it will reform the system).	Allow me to propose a very practical solution. If we look back, we were able to influence laws in the past. Remember SOPA? CISPA? And lately Net neutrality?	How did we do it? Because it needed people enough people to gather online (easier to do than physical gatherings) and act towards a common goal (again easier online).	The only factor missing is that we have been reacting not acting. When a law is too atrocious, we gather together to reform it. Why cannot we vote/discuss online, agree on one law and focus on one law at a time to reform our political system? Yes, not everyone will agree on biggest problem with USA (or whichever country you are in), but if enough people vote on biggest problem, let's fix it. Is it - money in politics? - war on drugs? - NSA spying? - bailouts? - Oil wars?	You name it, we can do it. We need a system, just like kickstarter, where people can share their ideas and have others agree/disagree. We pick one, call congress, make a noise. We will get media attention. It will get fixed, just like SOPA, CISPA and Net Neutrality. Then we can move on to next one after it.	Maybe we do just one campaign every 2 - 3 months, it will not be too overwhelming for most people. Key is to be fair to everyone so everyone can participate, support each other (even if you disagree that top item is biggest problem as long as you believe it is a problem), be positive (we have done it before many times, so it is totally doable, there will be naysayers, but we gotta win over them, one by one we can and we will).	If enough people agree, I am willing to build a website to get it started. Do tell me what will make you join such an effort (I am in USA, if I build a website, I will try my best that it can be used by other countries/regions to create their own laws.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OccupyCongressOnline","name":"t1_cqt3nde","parent_id":"t1_cqskwxj","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430345609,"created_utc":1430342009}

I am proposing referendum based approach.		3. We were also able to prevent CISPA and SOPA, which were internet freedom also but congress had vested interest (read money) in it. Still we were able to push.		4. Overall, the thought is, this is only practical way for citizens to unite. Once we unite, some doors will open up.

Sting's 1993 song about peer-to-peer articulates what I feel inside. It's a echo of Martin Luther King Jr's concerns beyond skin color and into the ego development.		Look at the transition from silent films to talking films as an example of the kind of problem that has grown.  Favored "loved" actors were suddenly viewed as trash. Photographs and "style" grow to dominate every person.  As Sting puts it in his [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7km4EHgkQiw), "Politicians all seem like Game Show hosts to me".  His faith lies in the growth of peer to peer relationships - not in all the very narrow personality systems we have constructed.

{"body":"Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"anima173","name":"t1_cqsngd4","parent_id":"t1_cqslk2y","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430321557,"created_utc":1430317957}

Yha, in fact in recent months he has been around doing sly artistic things in Texas.		> I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist,		I watched the Showtime (HBO?) documentary on his about 5 times while doing work at home. I think he's perfectly fine in both... and I think he is a honest artist in that he's fully self aware he is making art.  The mocking of him I think is really mocking of how his own audience doesn't take him seriously.  		> Especially songs like In the Air Tonight 		I'm trying to parse your ideas - are you pro or against? I'm reading against.  My response is: the songs are entirely true of emotion and spirit of the human heart.  They aren't teaching lessons of "what you should do" but more like "what I feel".		It's hard sometimes to deal with mainstream commercial art. On one hand, you need a vocabulary that other "everyperson" around you knows - so it's important.  on the other hand, the money and celebrity influences of it can be observed.  Here on Reddit, the Nolan Brother's films are slammed heavily for this.  But I have spent hundreds of hours analyzing *Interstellar* and can not dismiss it's unique themes about challenging education institutions ("Another Brick in the Wall" Pink Floyd) and the personal bookshelf... plus the time-shifting communications that is also in *Inception*.

If certain key things are under that kind of control then other things which are not still have to fall in line in order to even function.  For the few to rule they need not control it all to actually rule it all.		> Does that mean the US is an autocracy because the military isn't democratic? You see what I mean?

It's meant to be a controlled and obedient entity.		> It's not helpful to paint things black or white when there is so much nuance to the whole question.		Hence my statement being "more of an oligarchy than a democracy".  Not it IS an oligarchy.  But more of one than not.  Which I feel is a true statement.  We have the democratic elements in our government and the oligarchic ones, but honestly can you tell which are which any more?   No you can't and neither can I.    		We know the rich and powerful get what they want from the politicians and the government.  We can see it happen right in front of us.  But do we really know to what extent?  Not really.  There lies the major problem we face.  How to fix what we're unsure about and we're so outgunned over.  Public outcry vs. the very wealthy is a tough battle.

Different person:  There seem to be many people in positions of power with strong faith in weapons technology and fear control systems just waiting for another domestic terror attack. They want new budgets to be validated so very much.		Those with faith in weapons can not seem to recognize that the terrorist also have a faith in weapons. Not education, open debate, and criticism.

Catchy slogans, pride in the military, and demands for unity were common themes in expressing this nationalism. It was  usually coupled with a suspicion of things foreign that often bordered on  xenophobia.  	  	>    **2. Disdain for the importance of human rights.** The regimes themselves viewed human rights as of little value and a hindrance to realizing the objectives of the ruling elite. Through clever use of propaganda, the population was brought to accept these human rights abuses by marginalizing, even demonizing, those being targeted. When abuse was egregious, the tactic was to use secrecy, denial, and disinformation.  	  	>    **3. Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause.** The most significant common thread among these regimes was the use of scapegoating as a  means to divert the people???s attention from other problems, to shift blame forfailures, and to channel frustration in controlled directions. The methods of choice???relentless propaganda and disinformation???were usually effective. Often the regimes would incite ???spontaneous??? acts against the target scapegoats, usually communists, socialists, liberals, Jews, ethnic and racial minorities, traditional  national enemies, members of other religions, secularists, homosexuals, and???terrorists.??? Active opponents of these regimes were inevitably labeled as terrorists and dealt with accordingly.  	  	>   **4. The supremacy of the military/avid militarism.** Ruling elites always identified closely with the military and the industrial infrastructure that supported it. A disproportionate share of national resources was allocated to the military, even  when domestic needs were acute. The military was seen as an expression of nationalism, and was used whenever possible to assert national goals, intimidate other nations, and increase the power and prestige of the ruling elite.  	  	>    **5. Rampant sexism.** Beyond the simple fact that the political elite and the national culture were male-dominated, these regimes inevitably viewed women as second-class citizens. They were adamantly anti-abortion and also homophobic. These attitudes were usually codified in Draconian laws that enjoyed strong support by the orthodox religion of the country, thus lending the regime cover for its abuses.  	  	>    **6. A controlled mass media.** Under some of the regimes, the mass media were  under strict direct control and could be relied upon never to stray from the party line. Other regimes exercised more subtle power to ensure media orthodoxy. Methods included the control of licensing and access to resources, economic pressure, appeals to patriotism, and implied threats. The leaders of the mass  media were often politically compatible with the power elite. The result was usually success in keeping the general public unaware of the regimes??? excesses.  	  	>    **7. Obsession with national security.** Inevitably, a national security apparatus was under direct control of the ruling elite. It was usually an instrument of oppression, operating in secret and beyond any constraints. Its actions were justified under the rubric of protecting ???national security,??? and questioning its activities was portrayed as unpatriotic or even treasonous.  	  	>   **8. Religion and ruling elite tied together.** Unlike communist regimes, the fascist and protofascist regimes were never proclaimed as godless by their opponents. In fact, most of the regimes attached themselves to the predominant religion of the country and chose to portray themselves as militant defenders of that religion. The fact that the ruling elite???s behavior was incompatible with the precepts of the religion was generally swept under the rug. Propaganda kept up the illusion that the ruling elites were defenders of the faith and opponents of the ???godless.??? A perception was manufactured that opposing the power elite was tantamount to an attack on religion.  	  	>    **9. Power of corporations protected.** Although the personal life of ordinary citizens was under strict control, the ability of large corporations to operate in relative freedom was not compromised. The ruling elite saw the corporate structure as a way to not only ensure military production (in developed states), but also as an additional means of social control. Members of the economic elite were often pampered by the political elite to ensure a continued mutuality of interests, especially in the repression of ???have-not??? citizens.  	  	>    **10. Power of labor suppressed or eliminated.** Since organized labor was seen as the one power center that could challenge the political hegemony of the ruling elite and its corporate allies, it was inevitably crushed or made powerless. The poor formed an underclass, viewed with suspicion or outright contempt. Under some regimes, being poor was considered akin to a vice.  	  	>    **11. Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts.** Intellectuals and the inherent freedom of ideas and expression associated with them were anathema to these regimes. Intellectual and academic freedom were considered subversive to national security and the patriotic ideal. Universities were tightly controlled; politically unreliable faculty harassed or eliminated. Unorthodox ideas or expressions of dissent were strongly attacked, silenced, or crushed. To these regimes, art and literature should serve the national interest or they had no right to exist.  	  	>    **12. Obsession with crime and punishment**. Most of these regimes maintained Draconian systems of criminal justice with huge prison populations. The police were often glorified and had almost unchecked power, leading to rampant abuse. ???Normal??? and political crime were often merged into trumped-up criminal charges and sometimes used against political opponents of the regime. Fear, and hatred, of criminals or ???traitors??? was often promoted among the population as an excuse for more police power.  	  	>    **13. Rampant cronyism and corruption.** Those in business circles and close to the power elite often used their position to enrich themselves. This corruption worked both ways; the power elite would receive financial gifts and property from the economic elite, who in turn would gain the benefit of government favoritism. Members of the power elite were in a position to obtain vast wealth from other sources as well: for example, by stealing national resources. With the national security apparatus under control and the media muzzled, this corruption was largely unconstrained and not well understood by the general population.  	  	>    **14. Fraudulent elections.** Elections in the form of plebiscites or public opinion polls were usually bogus. When actual elections with candidates were held, they would usually be perverted by the power elite to get the desired result. Common methods included maintaining control of the election machinery, intimidating an disenfranchising opposition voters, destroying or disallowing legal votes, and, as a last resort, turning to a judiciary beholden to the power elite.   	  	There are plenty of symptoms of a country falling further and further toward fascism.","depth":1,"score":55,"ups":55,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"W00ster","name":"t1_cqsm3b5","parent_id":"t1_cqsg833","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430319166,"created_utc":1430315566}

But for a deception to have occurred, some other pieces of the puzzle have to fit together. I see no reason to *disbelieve* a government claim if doing so tortures reason. Then you have Occam's Razor and all that.		Here are some of the pieces I think would have to be in place for the government's claim to be false:		1) The government would have to have a motive for blaming a foreign government instead of what it knows to be the truth. There would have to be something to gain from it. To this point I've seen no action taken on the part of the government that it uses the incident to justify *and* which it would have had a more difficult time doing if the incident hadn't occurred.		2) The interests of the U.S. government and Sony Pictures would have to be somehow aligned, and I can't think of a reason why they would be in this case. Why would Sony Pictures take an ass pounding from a former employee for the sake of letting the FBI blame North Korea? If I were in charge at Sony I'd want the guy's head served to me on a platter with his nutsack tied in a bow around it. Anytime two powerful actors with diverging interests are said to be working together--especially on an endeavor from which neither party benefits greatly--I put on my skeptic's hat.		Perhaps if we were looking for an excuse to do something shitty to North Korea this would make sense. But we're not, apparently. If they'd blamed Iran, maybe. But then it would still be a pretty dumb choice of an incident to manufacture.

I'm not saying I know *better* or that the government never lies. I'm just saying that if security experts have valid questions, then until we have answers that's all they are: questions. And personally, I think that *those* questions are less bizarre than the questions we'd be left to ask if the government's line *were* false. Frankly, the government line is egg on the faces of both Sony Pictures *and* the government itself, so the payoff would have to be pretty big to go down this road, and I can't see what that payoff could possibly be.

And since you won't RTFA:		>Sometime in 2010, in a windowless CIA basement, Starzak and Jones found this particular file while combing through documents related to the torture program. The documents were made available to the Senate staffers in a shared electronic reading room provided by the CIA.		>At the time, the file -- an internal review of the agency???s torture program that confirmed the operation had been badly managed and ineffective -- didn???t stand out, according to committee accounts. It was encouraging, since the agency???s findings seemed to align with what the investigators themselves were discovering. But it was one file in a trove of literally millions. And the markings on the file, which indicated it was a deliberative draft and privileged, were not different from those on other documents.		>Starzak and Jones saved the documents in this file, which would come to be known as the Panetta Review, to the walled-off Senate side of a computer system being shared by the intelligence committee staffers and the CIA. As the investigation continued, the documents remained there, not inspiring any particular controversy until mid-2013, two years after Starzak had left the committee.		>It was in June 2013 that the CIA, now under the leadership of John Brennan, sent the committee its official response to the completed torture study. The agency largely defended its use of torture -- in stark contrast with what the Panetta Review said -- which tipped Senate staffers off to the document???s importance.		>After the CIA issued its response, Senate investigators sat through dozens of hours of meetings with agency staff in an effort to resolve the discrepancies between the official CIA line and the Senate???s findings. But those meetings yielded little. Newly aware of the relevance of the Panetta Review -- as it backed their findings and undermined the agency???s official response -- staffers slipped the document back to their secure committee spaces sometime in late 2013.		>That move sparked what would ultimately become a constitutional crisis between the CIA and the Senate. After learning the staffers had somehow gotten their hands on the Panetta Review, Brennan ordered agency personnel to sift through the walled-off Senate computers, breaching a prior agreement under which the CIA had promised not to access those drives. The agency maintained that intelligence committee staffers had already broken that agreement by removing the Panetta Review documents from the facility in the first place.		>In early 2014, the spies referred the matter to the Justice Department, alleging that the staffers had improperly accessed agency computers when they first came across the Panetta Review documents in that basement in 2010. The DOJ said in June 2014 that it hadn't found grounds to open an inquiry.

The lawmaker conceded that Starzak may not have been the one who actually took the document, but argued that she should have been more proactive in keeping her colleague???s eyes off of it.

{"body":"I understand the sentiment, however I cannot help but think that using torture to accertain whether or not something is a real threat or not could easily lead to a similar situation to (albeit not quite as extreme as) the Spanish Inquisition, whereby tortured prisoners were forced to out their 'conspirators' whether or not they had any (or whether or not they'd even committed a crime themselves) and those conspirators were then tortured. 		This leads to innocent men and women being tortured, which I am not ok with under any circumstances, even under the pretence of 'safety' and the slim possibility of finding other criminals. As a result, it is not the murderers I am sympathising with, it is the potential innocents who would suffer that I am sympathising with. 		I could just as easily contend that to NOT sympathise with innocents when they are being tortured is twisted and likely indicative of one who has lost their mind (Which is the accusation you so swiftly threw out)","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dude2dudette","name":"t1_cqsmszo","parent_id":"t1_cqsm1b7","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430320453,"created_utc":1430316853}

{"body":"> Collateral damage is unfortunate		So you are ok with potentially ruining/destroying the lives of innocent people in order to potentially save the lives of innocent people? I don't mean to come off as obtuse or as though I am intentionally being rude but I am just curious, how does this make sense? 		The only way your system works is if we can be 100% certain of the victim of torture's guilt. 		Given your very admission of 'justice systems aren't perfect', I would contend that we cannot know for sure that someone is guilty of something 100% (as opposed to 'beyond reasonable doubt' which I would say is not 100% and so wouldn't warrant torture) without full video evidence of them committing the crime, or multiple pieces of evidence all pointing to that. 		This means that this heavy-handed use of torture is entirely inhumane and supporting it seems like an inhumane position. 		Once again, sorry if this comes off as offensive or anything of that ilk. It really isn't my intention to offend. I just to understand your position better.
