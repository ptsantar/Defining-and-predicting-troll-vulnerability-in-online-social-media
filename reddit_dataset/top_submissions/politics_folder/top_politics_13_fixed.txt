{"body":"And this:		Political[edit]		Mike Huckabee has received nationwide criticism for his role in Clemmons' release from prison in 2000.[18][35] The evening of the shooting, Huckabee released a statement seeking to cast some of the responsibility for Clemmons' release onto the parole board that freed him and the criminal justice system that Huckabee said repeatedly failed to properly handle him.[36][37] In his statement, Huckabee said, "Should he be found to be responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington State."[36] Huckabee, who was considered a favorite for the Republican Party presidential nomination in 2012,[38] claimed that the situation was used as a political weapon against him.[35] Clemmons has been compared to Willie Horton,[38][39] a convicted felon who was furloughed from a Massachusetts prison in 1986 but never returned and committed more violent crimes several months later. The Horton case eventually factored into the 1988 presidential campaign of Democratic Party candidate Michael Dukakis, who was Governor of Massachusetts at the time and supported the furlough program. Timothy Egan, opinion writer for The New York Times, said of Huckabee's role in Clemmons' release, "If this case does not sink the presidential aspirations of Huckabee???it should."[18]		In his book about the shooting, The Other Side of Mercy, Jonathan Martin of The Seattle Times wrote that Huckabee apparently failed to review Clemmons' prison file, which was "thick with acts of violence and absent indications of rehabilitation." Martin also suggested that Huckabee failed to ensure Clemmons' post-release plan was "solid, or even factual." In an article for the Times, Martin wrote that if Huckabee was serious about running for president in 2016, "he'll have to answer his Maurice Clemmons problem."[40]		The incident has also led some university professors, criminologists, and attorneys to speculate that U.S. governors will become more reluctant to grant pardons and clemencies to convicted felons, in order to avoid the negative publicity faced by Dukakis and Huckabee in the Horton and Clemmons cases, respectively.[39]		SOURCE: I live near Lakewood WA","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bohica_","name":"t1_crnxkka","parent_id":"t1_crnmhud","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1432842308,"created_utc":1432838708}

Let the president focus on the economy, foreign policy, healthcare...

Consent is not the sole basis for good social behavior. All parties directly involved can consent to an act that is still a net-negative on society and deserves regulation; see environmental laws for one example. The indirect effects are socially significant and therefore legitimate topics of legislation.		And I disagree, obviously.

The point is that you can't go around and say that people can't make laws about behavior because you're born with the inclination, because that's irrelevant to the level of social damage incurred by the behavior. Society by and large is about suppressing natural and biological urges in exchange for more comfort, protection, and social pleasantries. Consider that we don't really care if you have an urge to steal your neighbor's property; it's still theft, and it's still punished because it's a behavior, and behaviors are totally valid things to legislate.

{"body":"First link presupposes a genetic cause in homosexuality and draws a bunch of tenuous connections that could as easily imply nurture as nature (such as having more older brothers than older sisters). It's based on survey data. Irrelevant.		The **first sentence** in the second link admits that the genetic link is "poorly understood", i.e., assumed to be there for political convenience but not actually shown. The paper outlines mathematical frameworks that *could* be used to validate whether there is a genetic basis, but doesn't do so itself. Again, irrelevant speculation.		The third link helps to disprove your case, grasping at straws for why we can still believe there is a genetic component in sexual orientation despite numerous studies that find even among identical twins it's a crapshoot as to whether they'll both be gay. **Identical twins have the exact same DNA**, so if homosexuality was expressly genetic and not learned, it would express in both twins much more often than 45-57% of the time. The article goes on to say families with one gay person tend to have more gay people than the random family (7% v. 10% of maternal uncles), which again, just as easily implies that homosexuality is learned from watching and emulating family members as it does that there is some occasionally-visible inherited trait.		And again, the fourth study is further proving my point, as it refers not only to gay males but also to sex offenders and other paraphilics. This is clearly stated right above the abstract. Since most of this study is paywalled, we'll just assume they're using silly methods and/or making presuppositions that homosexuality *is* inherited and then searching for potential evidence to support that conclusion like the other three, but it demonstrates that this attitude **is not exclusive to homosexuality** and logically encompasses other paraphilia.		> From a practical point of view, do you honestly think that gay people in Uganda or Russia or your neighbourhood wake up one morning and think "hey, a lot of folks here sure hate gay people...I reckon I'll be gay for a while and see how that works out for me"?		No, I don't think this exact thought process occurs, obviously. I think they're looking for a sense of belonging, community, and nobility. They're looking for a cause and, subconsciously or not, they find one in the homosexual "struggle". Other things can go wrong that may result in homosexual orientation, but a not-insignificant portion of homosexuals get into it for this reason. "Gay people" hardly exist in Russia or Uganda not because they're "underreported", but because Western sexual decadence has not fully pervaded.		>There are lots of causal links with homosexuality: genetics, the hormonal environment in the womb (you're more likely to be gay if you're a little brother to lots of sisters, even if you're not raised with them, for instance), and some psychosocial factors. Choice is not a factor.		Choice is a factor in the expression of the behavior. Straight people can be celibate and so can homosexuals. It is perfectly valid to outlaw something over the criminal's protestations that he can't help himself.		>Being gay is not harmful.		Disagree, although also irrelevant to this discussion, which centers on the irrelevance of "born that way".		>It clearly scares the shit out of you, but it does you no real harm, nor does it harm society or others ??? unlike harmful disorders like paedophilia or any of the personality disorders which can lead someone to have a compulsion to harm animals or, for that matter, other people.

{"body":"Neither here nor there to this discussion. The point of this discussion is that the commonly-used rationale "I was born this way" and/or "I can't help it" is absolutely irrelevant as to whether it's OK to legislate against that behavior. The rhetoric should center around the consequences of homosexual behaviors and whether those consequences are problematic enough to justify legal sanction, not whether someone is capable of controlling the urge or not.		Even if we accept the argument that sexual preferences are inborn and not learned (which is frankly silly), gay persons *can* help it insofar as they can refrain from homosexual activity no matter how strongly they may desire it. Some people have very powerful urges to do illegal things. Those people are still held culpable for the illegal things they've done, and saying "I had very strong urges to do them" is, if anything, *more* reason to keep someone locked up, not a reason to let them go.		Maybe homosexuality is totally OK and fine, but if it was my guess would be that the rhetoric would not be centered on "Well you can't be mean to me about it because I can't help it!!!" Acknowledging that the inborn desire has nothing to do with the validity of legislation preventing the behavior is not necessarily equivalent to advocating anti-gay legislation, it's just an acknowledgement of real life. Behavior can be legislated. Law is made to punish socially bad behaviors and reward socially good behaviors. Sexual conduct is behavior. Claiming that we can't legislate behaviors that people feel naturally compelled to perform is the same thing as claiming we can't legislate behavior at all.

{"body":"> Right. If all you care about is some narrow economic policy, both parties are the same.		Narrow? We're talking about the structure of the global economy. It's no coincidence that people like Obama, Clinton, Pelosi, and the others own millions of dollars in capital investments. They're part of the owning class, with real economic interests in maximizing corporate profits (and thus, the returns on their investments). Hence why the stock market is used as *the* measure of economic health. Capital and labor have an antagonistic relationship, as they are dividing the value produced by labor using the capital. If the owners' share of that value goes up, corporate profits rise, but wages fall. And vice versa. The banks got a bailout, but most of us had to suffer through the effects of something we had no hand in. When the auto bailout came, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel (now mayor of the Democratic stronghold of Chicago) reportedly said "Fuck the UAW" (United Auto Workers). The administration seemed to take his advice.		Just as Clinton (D) pushed the NAFTA, Obama (D) is pushing the TPP and TTIP. These agreements grant freedom of movement for capital, but not for labor. They help companies bust unions and drive down wages. The TPP, it seems, would give corporations avenues to challenge new laws based on the effects on their profits.		The Obama administration, under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pressured Haiti not to raise its minimum wage (an effort to address crippling poverty in the country) at the urging of U.S. corporate interests. Hillary Clinton has also written about how proud she was to take part in the 2009 anti-democratic coup in Honduras, perpetrated to keep that country from taking a popular economic left-turn.

I'd argue that one of the key bottlenecks for our nation's success is that our populace lacks education in several of those disciplines. We push people into STEM because we hear it's important (and profitable employment), but we refuse to accept their recommendations (pollute less, renovate and expand infrastructure) because it's somehow controversial that either of those actions fall within government's responsibilities, or that the individual should have a slice of financial responsibility for their society as a whole.		Even within our recent military engagements, there have been times where we could have prevented escalation of a situation by increased cultural awareness of the people we were working with. Special Forces, who tends to focus on cultural education during preparation for their ops, made a lot of diplomatic progress with the tribes of Afghanistan. When our main military force stepped in, the top brass did not engage with tribes in the same way, assuming Afghanistan had the same centralized structure as the Western countries with which we're familiar. It cost us a lot of the popular goodwill that Special Forces had built up, which is a key currency in a fight that hinges on denying the opponent recruits. The end result is likely that we sent more money and troops to the region than we otherwise needed to--both of which could have been used to improve our internal infrastructure, just as an example.","depth":7,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"payco","name":"t1_cro0zuk","parent_id":"t1_crnuixn","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1432847382,"created_utc":1432843782}

{"body":"No education is useless. The critical thinking and textual (a text doesn't have to be words on a page) analysis skills taught in *80's Movies Studies* would be very useful in modern life, where so much of our information is delivered to us by text and screen. In addition, the study of history - even so recent as the 1980s - is vital to making sure we don't repeat it. How will we know if we're building a better society if we don't know how things were just 30 years ago? Funny you should mention 80s films as Hadley Freeman happens to have a book out [on that very subject](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/17/life-moves-pretty-fast-hadley-freeman-funny-absorbing-80s) and it sounds utterly fascinating.		Unpacking meaning from media is a skill and while you can - like any skill - learn it from the internet, that doesn't make formal education along those lines useless. I did a film studies module during my degree and it was really interesting. The effect of images on humans is a complex thing and well worth understanding - again, especially so in this age of media management and the ceaseless psychological manipulations pushed upon us by politicians, news and advertisers. The ability to critically read media is excellent bullshit-armour in today's world, and being able to cut through the crap is a seriously useful skill to have.		I have a degree in Philosophy and English Literature. I use skills I learned during that time every single day. I've had jobs in IT, programming, sales, management and currently in design and production. My "useless" education, which taught me how to think (and argue!) logically and how to understand and how to communicate, has helped with all of those. The most interesting and capable people I know are often those with "useless" degrees - although philosophy seems to be the most adaptable, I know philosophers working (and doing well, thanks) in a surprisingly wide range of fields.","depth":5,"score":16,"ups":16,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"auntie-matter","name":"t1_crnsvru","parent_id":"t1_crnqfc5","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1432835189,"created_utc":1432831589}

I agree with your conclusion, but I don't see how it applies in this instance. Nobody is trying to prove beyond a doubt that Obama was born in America. We accept that as true, because we have good reasons to believe it's true, and no reason to believe otherwise. There is no reasonable doubt.

{"body":"It is a long, and complicated story. I suggest read the brief synopsis on wikipedia on the [Cuban Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution) but basically the formerly democratically elected President Fulgencio Batista held a military coup and cancelled elections. This pissed a lot of poor people off. His early 50s regime can be classified as selling out to American corporations and organized crime, thus making some families lucratively wealthy. However, women and blacks were treated very poorly. Older Cubans are noted as being incredibly racist. As an example, my best friend's Cuban grandma, while liberal and a citizen, could not bring herself to vote for Obama because of his skin color even though she supported his political position. This is just to be used to highlight some of the similarities between Cubans and certain Right Wing ideologies.		So when the Communists rose up, the rich Cubans were the first to flee to America, and it wasn't exactly a perfect transition in their eyes. Then in the 60s you have Kennedy allowing the Bay of Pigs Invasion. It failed, and when Kennedy wouldn't continue, many Cuban exiles considered this a bitter betrayal from Democrats. So you have a Conservative people who view themselves as a former aristocracy and have an enemy with a D. So, they quickly went R and stayed there.

{"body":"I'm half white and half brown. When I was home my light skin made me a minority and when I came to America my Asian/Hispanic look made me a minority. I feel I've seen some interesting blatant as well as subtle racism and I feel that's given me perspective on many issues. I see two reasons why minorities want to see someone of their race in the White House: pride and understanding. For pride, look at the Philippines and Manny Pacquaio. There are tons of Filipino boxers in the Philippines but when one makes it big the whole nation stops to watch his professional fights. There is just something about seeing someone of your own race make it to the top. It's difficult to understand when you haven't lived it but when you are from somewhere small, or come from a place with limited resources, or come from a family, town, or neighborhood where no one is expected to stand a chance against the privileged in America...it's like that person represents the best that is in your genetics. It could also mean that there is a chance that you could change where you are in life. Like, if they did it then I can. The other reason minorities want to see their race in a position of power could be because it makes you feel better knowing someone who knows what it's like to be a minority is now in a position of power to make a "real" change. Again, it's hard to describe it if you haven't lived it but the way I see it is like this...you can say we need to provide FEMA assistance to those in the flood but it's different when you are actually down there. You can see it on tv or have friends in Texas but unless you are actually being evacuated, watching your car wash away, or crying because your life's investment, your home, is now destroyed there is no way you can know what it really feels like.

{"body":"To assume or even postulate that I haven't 'lived it' or experienced hardship due to racial or economic disparity because I'm white is a bit presumptuous. I was born to parents who lived in a trailer park and was the subject of plenty of racism living in Oakland, CA. I *was* the minority there.		I am successful now and people I meet simply assume I grew up a privileged white dude with privileged white parents. I succeeded because of who I am, not due to the color of my skin or because of who my ancestors were. I didn't look up to white people because they were like me, I looked up to people who made something of themselves regardless of their background. I took pride in seeing people succeed who had drive, and ambition, and hope, because those are the people like me.		That said, I don't feel a connection or any amount of pride when a white male succeeds. Nor do I experience any more or less pride when someone who isn't white succeeds. I just can't imagine what benefit that gives someone. We can't, as a people, rally around ideals or feel a connection when anyone 'makes it'?		Regardless of my political affiliation, I felt pride when Obama was elected because it represented us, as a people, making a statement.

Tying your personal pride or personal worth to your ethnic heritage is something I simply do not and will not ever understand.

[Here's some solid data from 2010, during the surge and before the drawdown and cutbacks](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2011/military-recruitment-2010/).

Actually, the 2010 data also has a breakdown of enlistment by income decile near the bottom of the page.  They don't record the recruits income, but the authors of the paper have looked at median incomes for the zip codes the recruits enlisted from.  For the 4 years of data the report covers, there's a pretty close match across all ten income levels, with the majority of recruits coming from the middle income zip codes and around 7% of recruit coming from the top tenth most wealthy and another 7% coming from the tenth poorest zip codes.  		Anyway, it only seems like there's a lot of Texans in the military because Texans are *loud* about it.  But that's beside the point: if the US Military closed the 20+ bases they have in Texas, not all of the 160,000 service members might leave, but they'd definitely stop getting paid.  Even if only 20% of them stay and want to join the Texas armed forces, paying them anything would be money Texas currently isn't budgeting for.

Look at Scandinavian countries.

Arizona (where I live) just passed a budget this year that cut $100 million from the education budget and ALL funds for community colleges.  There are school districts in Phoenix that are considering a 4 day school week because they aren't getting enough money.

Emergency relief for the families who are suffering from this natural disaster should not be used as a Christmas tree for billions in unrelated spending, including projects such as Smithsonian repairs, upgrades to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration airplanes, and more funding for Head Start.		Two thirds of this spending is not remotely ???emergency???; the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 30% of the authorized funds would be spent in the next 20 months, and over a billion dollars will be spent as late as 2021.

Unfortunately, cynical politicians in Washington could not resist loading up this relief bill with billions in new spending utterly unrelated to Sandy. Emergency relief for the families who are suffering from this natural disaster should not be used as a Christmas tree for billions in unrelated spending, including projects such as Smithsonian repairs, upgrades to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration airplanes, and more funding for Head Start. Two-thirds of this spending was not remotely "emergency"; the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 30% of the authorized funds would be spent in the next 20 months, and over a billion dollars will be spent as late as 2021. This bill was symptomatic of a larger problem in Washington???an addiction to spending money we do not have. Sen.

The Sandy recovery bill also includes more than $500 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which amounts to a full tenth of what the agency spends per year, nationwide.

It will be declared as DR (disaster recovery) xxxx and Fed funds will be allocated based on specifically written projects reflecting actual and estimated costs.

The Sandy Recovery Act was additional to all of this and, agree on the necessity of specific pork inclusions or not, is what he voted against.  The appeal for Emergency, Public and Individual Assistance from FEMA is not hypocritical itself; however, should he put forward or support a similar Texas Flood Recovery Act he will then be treading on hypocracy.

Following Hurricane Sandy, there were hundreds of riders--provisions added into legislation that advance the agenda of Congressmen, and are usually completely irrelevant to the rest of the bill--added into the disaster relief bills. Many Congressmen NOT in the Northeast voted against these bills altogether because they would provide federal dollars to Northeast states that wouldn't necessarily be for disaster relief. 		Cruz voting against Sandy relief legislation was a wise decision IN SOME REGARDS because it stopped federal money from going to things that were in no way related to Hurricane Sandy. 		And what is he supposed to do when Texas gets hit with massive flooding? Say, "I think we're alright, the rest of the nation can carry on"?
