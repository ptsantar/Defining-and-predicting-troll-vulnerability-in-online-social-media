{"body":"That's not true at all. Rainbow Six is the title of a Tom Clancy novel about a multinational counter-terrorism force formed to combat international terrorism. The book was highly successful and spawned a series of video games that continues to this day. Here is what the Wikipedia article says about why the novel is titled "Rainbow Six":	> The idea for the title comes from the United States Color-coded War Plans, specifically the Rainbow Plans of the 1930s, where Rainbow Five is the last known plan. In these plans, various countries were given a color code, and the Rainbow Plans outlined strategies for dealing with potential conflicts between coalitions of countries. Rainbow Five, for instance, which is discussed extensively in the Plan Dog memo, details several U.S. strategies for America's involvement in World War II. For Rainbow Six, the aggressor is international terrorists. "Rainbow Six" also refers to John Clark, the leader of Rainbow, because "Six" is U.S. military terminology for a unit commander. Additionally, the title symbolizes the multi-national nature of the elite unit. Whereas a rainbow contains many colors, the unit contains many nationalities.","depth":3,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"StupidGuns","name":"t1_cueg3kw","parent_id":"t1_cuefc8i","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440486148,"created_utc":1440457348}

I have a 65% completion rate. The only things I'm missing are 12 trials that I can't be assed to do, and 2 tapes that you get for doing so.		So no, the game isn't stupidly long. As someone with 26 hours on it, it's a 3 hour game at best. It should have been 7 bucks, not 20.		Don't get me wrong, I love it. It's my favorite of the MGS, gameplay wise. I've replayed the missions so many times that I've gotten my money's worth over and over.		But completing each mission 7 times to get 100% completion rate is not "content". It's rehashing. The true value of the game (at best) is beating each mission once on each difficulty (if not just on the normal difficulty, because difficulties are optional affairs).		On my first playthrough, that took me:		GZ = 54 minutes		Renegade Threat = 26 minutes		Helicopter Mission = 13 minutes		Intel Acquisition = 9 minutes		Anti Air Defenses = 16 minutes.		That's not even close to 4 hours. So no, Ground Zeroes is not a massive demo.		It is a pretty demo, and it has some of the best gameplay ever, but that's because the gameplay and graphics are taken from The Phantom Pain. It's not worth the money, not even to someone that loves it and has played over 20 hours of it just replaying missions over and over.

Is Ground Zeroes worth as much as a full priced game? Maybe not for most people, but I'm fairly sure there are several games in your library you spend more than 20 dollars on yet did not spend 26 hours playing. The fact that you can even say that Ground Zeroes would be worth 7 bucks pretty much demonstrates the difference, barely any demos ever has been worth even 1 dollar because they are usually 30 minute deals with 0 replayability and nothing to do once you beat them.		As someone who has been playing demos regularly since 1996 until it stopped being popular releasing demos, safe to say I have rarely seen anything even close to ground zeroes when it comes to content.

I should add that I had to replay Anti Air a lot before I finally got it (I would rage quit midway and replay the GZ mission).

Can you play Ground Zeroes for 26 hours without replaying anything? Obviously not, there's honestly quite few games outside of RPGs and recent open-world games which will give over 25 hours of unique content. I would however say that most people should be able to expect about 45 minutes per mission in Ground Zeroes for their first run. That's 6 missions for consoles, 7 for PC. This already puts it way ahead in "real" content compared to the tanker chapter of MGS2, which is one of the only demos in history people were ready to pay for (by buying Zone of Enders).		I beat Vanishing of Ethan Carter in less than 4 hours on my first playthrough and that game has zero replayability. I payed about 15 dollars for that.

The game has an underlying system where you build a base, and fill it up with people. Every human enemy in the game has a Face and Stats, they can be captured and put to work under a multitude of things, you can even play as them instead of Snake. You found an outpost full of anti air guns? you can just steal them and put them in your base. Found a armored vehicle with heat seeking Missiles? Why not take it back to base and bring it for a mission later. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGGuvRIIx8c) is a video just explaining this sector of gameplay if your interested.

{"body":"Since the game simply puts up a notification stating the number of dead guards, I doubt that the game was keeping track of what killed them. More likely is that is was just keeping track of whether they were alive or dead. This would be the most efficient route since the programmers can assume that the guards will never encounter any deadly situation that isn't caused by the player in some way. Even if they do, if the goal is to make dead guards, then the thing that makes the guards dead isn't going to be very important.		However, if they were to make a system that specifically mentioned the player being the one to kill them with a vehicle, they could do so by setting up some tagging system along these lines:		* Player sets C4; C4 belongs to player.	* Neutral vehicle interacts with player-owned C4(explosion); Neutral vehicle now belongs to player.	* Player-owned vehicle causes lethal damage to guard; Guard killed by player.","depth":1,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AbatedDust","name":"t1_cue8wex","parent_id":"t1_cue5ngd","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440474730,"created_utc":1440445930}
