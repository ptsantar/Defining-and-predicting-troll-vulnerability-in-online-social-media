{"body":"I don't care dude. Seriously, I said I was done talking about this. You're making this huge stink over what is really your own bias. They aren't saying all black people are crackheads in those depictions. You're the one making it about race when it's true that crack addiction happens a bit more often in black communities, though the same shit exists in white communities. The more common drug in the white community is weed and they aren't depicted any different than the black crackhead character. That's not about race. It's about what actually exists in a community of like individuals and they cross over. 		Look at any pothead white guy in movies, it's practically down to the same outfits and same dumb ass behavior. Obviously it's not to be taken as a literal depiction of race or a people as a whole, which is what racism is. Racism isn't just "I don't like his hat therefore anyone with that hat is an asshole" the hat in this example is a type that is used in some degree for every race in every form of media. Be it a crackhead in more afrocentric media to potheads in white centric media the depiction is interchangeable. Both are idiots that do horrible things.		This isn't to say all potheads are bad, not all crackheads are bad. It's a cartoon of what people think of the "stoner type". This also goes for media depicting Meth users. A good portion of those roles go to white people because it's looked at as something more in the white community thanks to the cheap production and it's prevalence in the country and southern states. They do the same with moonshiners. They are shown as toothless hillbilly white guys who do stupid shit. You're ignoring like %80 of the media that's around and going off the surface of one point. Ignoring everything else is just ignorant of the main point that was made hours ago. 		You look at it as black people being made fun of AS crackheads when it's not that simple, it's black people making fun OF crackheads, much like white people goof on potheads and methheads. It's not a race thing at all, just showing a caricature of a bad behavior that's looked at negatively. What Chappelle did was take that common depiction and use it as a "lovable scamp" cartoon character with a theme song and everything. 		NOW lets just end it. I'm not responding anymore.

{"body":"The point was that it was lazy, the content isn't the biggest issue, it's just plainly and lazily racist and homophobic in it's jokes. This isn't to say making a cripple joke is a bad thing, a clever well written racist joke or a clever well written homophobic joke can be good. Instead the family guy method is make the cheapest laziest joke. I'm cool with all content, as long as there's actually talent involved. It's like the movie "This is the end" they have great examples of clever writing AND lazy bad writing. The good is the Emma Watson overhearing "rape" and attacks them. It's a rape joke that doesn't use a victim as a punchline, harder to pull off in a funny way and they did it, but then the lazy joke was the rape joke where the fat kid gets raped by a demon or whatever. The victim in that one is the punchline and absolutely horrible.		Thats my point, there's clever writing where it creatively uses racism or homophobia or sexist jokes to a good degree. South Park does this fairly well.

It used an active contour method known as wrapping snakes to extract the lip shape. The sequence of lip shapes was then fed into the speech recogniser which used Hidden Markov Models to detect the individual phonemes.		As for translating it to sign language, sure that could be done. Once you have the text transcript, you can do anything you want. The biggest issue is getting a reliable transcript. The error rates in visual speech recognition are still very high, since a lot of the speech formation happens hidden inside the mouth.		Where visual speech recognition really works well is when paired with audio.

{"body":"Similar real life story:		Once upon a time, I went to school as a lay student at a rural Catholic seminary. Most Catholics in the USA tend to be not-black, so the only black seminarians we had were the ones from Africa (Togo, Kenya, Tanzania). If you have ever met an African, you know they run a few shades darker than what we're used to in the States. 		Anywho, the seminarians liked to have bonfires at the pond by the woods on campus, and we lay students were often invited. We're all hanging out and having a grand time when 3 more approach the fire. 		Straining through the darkness, one of my fellow students says "Hey guys!" to the approaching sems,  and to the one in the white T-shirt: "OMG, do you have a face?"		Only when he was fully illumined by the fire did she realize he was one of our African pals, and she was subsequently mortified with embarrassment while he laughed his ass off.
