{"body":"I finally understand what's weird about this. The shadows on the object don't change. A small object by your face will be lit differently than a huge object far away. So they're must be only one light source that's infinitely far away. The sun. That also explains why all the stages are open to the sky. 		I think that, no matter how much the graphics are improved, there will be limits because of the illusion involved. For instance, you can't have shadows being cast onto objects. If you did, then either you would be able to see the objects moving toward and away from the player at hyper speed as it was manipulated, or the shading would "snap" into place as soon as the object was released. Both of these things would ruin the lovely illusion that's shown in this demo. 		So it's impossible to have a photorealistic environment and the effect that this game is based around simultaneously. The dreary feel some people have mentioned might be integral to the mechanic. 		If the dev happens to be reading this, I think there are two solutions. 		1. Render the selected item differently while it's being manipulated. Outlined and highlighted in a color. This also destroys the very impressive effect that's shown in this video though. 		2. Stylize the entire game so the shadows become a non-issue. Think Antichamber, but not so extreme. If the game was given cartoon graphics through something like cell shading not only could it look beautiful without giving away the position of the items, but it might give it a characteristic visual style that would contribute to the overall story/character of the finalized game.

{"body":"These concepts are a bit difficult to discuss without terminology from linear algebra and 3d game programming, but I'll try.		There are a few issues:		1.  **There is no "2d mode." (as described by the poster)**  	Putting something in the "same position" doesn't make sense anymore because your eyes are fixated on stitching together two images that are no longer overlapping.  	You would have to "cross your eyes" to see this "2d mode" object (similar to those "magic eye" books).  Otherwise you'd likely see a blurry double-vision version of the object.  It would look quite strange (erroneous) if implemented this way.		2. **The concept of "forced perspective" relies on not being able to tell how far something is.**  	In typical 3d game programming, you take a 3d scene and do some math to "flatten" (project) it onto a 2d surface (your monitor).  Going from 3-dimensions to 2-dimensions causes you to "lose" a dimension, and in this case, the depth dimension.  	Losing the depth dimension means you can no longer tell far an object is.  You can no longer notice if the depth of an object is changed (so long as the size is kept just right).  This demo takes that ambiguity and does a neat trick with it.		3. **With stereoscopic 3d vision you no longer lose the depth dimension.**  	When you project 3d to *two* 2d surfaces, you have enough information such that that 3rd dimension is no longer "lost".  Similar to how GPS systems can figure out your position through triangulation between 2 satellites (but not with just 1), your eyes can actually tell how far something is.  Changing depth at this point is noticeable.		4.  **Trying to "recreate" the ambiguity of losing a dimension makes no sense when you have that dimensional information.**  	The ruse is completely lost when you have stereoscopic 3d vision, so you'd just see an object moving closer/further from you while changing size.  It wouldn't really "make sense" anymore.  	You would still have to force the perspective to a single camera, so where do you chose?  The left eye, right eye, or maybe the center point?  No matter which one you choose, at least one eye will not be forced to that perspective, so the object is literally getting bigger/smaller for that eye.

This ambiguity of how far the object is, is the essence of forced perspective. Any type of 3D display destroys this ambiguity, because the distance information is intact.		When your workaround using 3rd camera between your eyes is actually implemented, the object will seem to be placed at infinity (somewhat like clouds in the sky), because there is no parallax between images in your eyes.
