A few things were cut, but those cuts were actually for the better (the cut scenes slowed it down, and it already has some pacing problems).		It probably would have performed better with a different release date (e.g. had it been bumped to early August, the competition wouldn't have been as stiff).  Minions and Ant-Man ate up a lot of the potential audience for it.		It'll probably land somewhere in the Mr. Deeds part of the "Sandler quality" spectrum once all is said and done.

Since Atari Games owned Tengen (due to the home console/computer and arcade divisions of Atari getting split into two separate companies in the '80s, Atari Games was not allowed to use the Atari name for home products, opting instead for another term based off of the board game Go), this is probably also why a lot of Namco's NES games wound up getting released in the West as unlicensed cartridges.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bigsphinxofquartz","name":"t1_cu32ysj","parent_id":"t1_cu0kayb","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439607264,"created_utc":1439578464}
