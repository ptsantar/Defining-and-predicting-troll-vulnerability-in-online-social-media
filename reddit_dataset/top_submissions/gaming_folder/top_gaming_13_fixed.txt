Also, the story is more about the actual characters themselves rather than a quest to save the world. Take that into consideration, because when I purchased it, I was expecting an epic tale about defeating dragons and whatnot as I did in Symphonia.

Overlimit lets you use a more powerful arte, and Overlimit level 3 lets you use the most powerful of your artes. You also have base and altered, as well as the "skills" (Techs in Symphonia) to add hits to combos or chain them, etc. Combat starts to flow pretty nicely once you get overlimit and a full party, but before then, it does feel kind of sluggish, but it's still fun.		I know on the Xbox Live Market, there's a digital copy for $30. If you feel confident about it (Watch a few gameplay videos), go for it.

{"body":"Does anyone know what game started this whole animal thing, where by you click on an animal (normally in some sort of town) and eventually it says something like "Yes, this is a cat!" or something along those lines.		The first game I remember doing this was Diablo, back in 1996				- Diablo, 1996 - In the town of Tristram there were 3 cows, clicking them they would "moo" at you and eventually your character would reply "Yep, that is a cow alright" and if you continue clicking it then your character would say something about being thirsty. There was a lot of speculator and rumors that it was something to do with a secret level, Blizzard ruled that out and no secret cow level was ever found.		- Diablo II, 2000 - There were 4 (5) new towns in Diablo II and you could revisit the old ruined town of Tristram to free Deckard Cain (who appears in all 3 Diablos) if you went over to where the cows roughly were you would find a dead cow on the floor what was rotting and would explode if clicked on, you could also find a wooden leg of Wirts using this leg you could unlock a secret cow level where you killed lots of cows including a "Cow King", in early patchs this was a great source of experience aswell as items it was where most people spent their time. Later on in the expansion pack you could again revist Tristram to kill "Ubers" using a combination of hard to get items which gave you an item which was a must have boost for all the top characters.			- Diablo III, 2012 - You could again find Tristram which was made obvious by the well known water Well where Deckard Cain used to stand, if you went to where the cows used to be you would find a pile of bones what were the remains of the cows, to unlock the Secret level in Diablo II you had to craft a "Staff of Herding" which must then be taken to a pile of bones in Old Tristram Road where you would have to click on the "Cow King's Ghost"","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IAmABritishGuy","name":"t1_c8u0fpe","parent_id":"t3_1a3ug8","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1363087093,"created_utc":1363058293}

{"body":"Now this is a story, all about how My life got flipped, turned upside-down, And I'd like to take a minute, Just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air	In West Philadelphia, born and raised, On the playground where I spent most of my days Chillin out, maxin', relaxin' all cool, And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys,said we were up in no good, Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood, I got in one little fight and my mom got scared And said 'You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!'	I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packaged my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss And then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said 'I Might as well kick it!'	First class Yo this is bad Drinkin orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people in Bel-Air livin like? Hmm... this might be alright	But wait I hear the prissy, Bushwa and all that Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared For the Prince of Bel-Air!	Well I, The plane landed and when I came out There was a dude,looked like a cop, Standin there with my name out I ain't tryin to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness And like lightening dissappeared	I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said 'Fresh' And had a dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Now, forget it - Yo, home to Bel-Air!'	I pulled up to a house about seven or eight, And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home, smell ya later!' Look at my kingdom, I was finally there! To settle my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"homoeroticsalarian","name":"t1_c8u7dre","parent_id":"t3_1a3ug8","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1363125876,"created_utc":1363097076}
