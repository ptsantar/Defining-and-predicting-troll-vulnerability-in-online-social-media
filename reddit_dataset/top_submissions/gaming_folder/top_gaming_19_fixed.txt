More or less the same with Zizek, though he does seem like a bit of a prick sometimes, and often comes across as fetishising leadership and centrality. I'm not sure its its just him wording stuff in a way that he intends to piss people off though, because he likes being antagonistic. I don't feel I'm familiar enough to pass judgement. However, a friend of mine used to be really into Zizek's stuff, has been basing a lot of his PhD on his work, even got an article published in the Journal of Zizek Studies, but recently he's become more or less completely disillusioned with the guy and is moving away from his work. Though he still claims he is a comrade in struggle. It's nice to see someone overtly anti-capitalist getting so much attention, even if it is often in a bit of a tokenistic way, such as is often with Chomsky when he is brought up in discussions or invited to speak.

Theses, of course, aren't perfect answers though. A lot of thought focuses around flash points. I.e capitalism is fucking up and will inevitably fail (infinite growth on a finite planet? I think not.....), and we need to create relations, structures and ways of being that can move into replace it when it collapses, or at least when cracks are opened up to be able to jump in there, expand them, and help bring it down, along with the rest of the oppressive power relations of humankind - patriarchy, racism, ableism, nationalism, etc.		On your former question, well, that's harder.

{"body":"In regards to 'cracking capitalism', I honestly don't think it's as simple as tearing it down.		We have a fragile economy, and a fragile means of producing, maintaining and distributing food, medicine and other essential goods. This same fragile system often leaves the marginalized and disenfranchised with the short end of the stick.		Nonetheless, simply tearing it down would be catastrophic. It's structurally engrained into our lives. For many, our very subsistence depends upon it. 		That's what you're dealing with. It's broken, but we rely on it.		IF you were to switch to an alternative economic mode of production, I can really only see two alternatives:		1) You tear it down. Through revolt, revolution, or physical force. You bring it down, and you bring it down fast. This would be inherently disorganized. Some people would disproportionately benefit, and many would suffer given the logistical impracticality of sustaining any semblance of a productive economy in the resulting aftermath. People would die, anarchy would ensue, and the end goal would be questionable to all parties involved.		>-*edit: to clarify, when I say that people would die, I'm referring to two different things. 1) If it were a revolution, there would be casualties. 2) after the take down, things would be in disarray. It's in this climate where I believe many people would die due to medical/nutritional reasons.*		2) You slow play it. You educate the people, and you use the power of democracy to slowly reform how the government interacts with the market, and how the market serves the people. Here is where you would create relations, and start to set the foundations for new structures. Here is where you can address capitalism intellectually. However, this still has so much potential for failure. Ideological movements are divisive. Competing interests will always exist. On the outside, and within. Small divisions turn into factions. Factions lead to internal conflict. Internal conflict gives ammunition to the external forces. So not only do you have to deal with educating and informing people so that you have the consensus necessary to start the process of reform, but you also have to do so while remaining wholly united.		>-*edit: This ties into my other [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1rz1i2/my_friend_is_a_games_journalist_he_gave_duke/cdsnukn) about Foucault, and it relates to the relationship between power, discourse, and knowledge, and those who have maintain it's order. 	For further insight, see [Ã©pistÃ¨me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme)*		Perhaps I'm over thinking it, and maybe I'm being pessimistic, but unless something incredibly radical happens, I can't see communism replacing capitalism. It's an incredibly risky notion, with uncertain outcomes. 		Unfortunately, I think things would have to be pretty bad before the general populace even begins to consider the alternative.

This is also where the poststructuralism of people like Foucault comes into play, but that's.....that's something that takes some explaining and that I often still struggle to get my head around.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AskMeAboutCommunism","name":"t1_cdsm0i2","parent_id":"t1_cdsko9k","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1386120009,"created_utc":1386091209}

Why not be a poet most of the time and then every so often help out with cleaning out barn on the communal farm?		Nevermind that there would be no use for productiveless jobs such as bank managers and politicians.		Though, ofc, you do hit a key point that reveals a key characteristic of the proces by which we can try to change the world to one more suitable to life. *Not only do we need a economic revolution but also a social one.*		Michael Hardt - [in this video iirc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0IopdH1e3s) - and others bring up the key point that we cannot simply create new ways of economic being, but we also need to create new ways of social being. We are created by the world we live in, and the one that the vast majority of us live in at the moment is one of capitalism; war; patriarchy; racial divisions; a lack of democracy; etc. Hundreds of years ago not many people questioned the rule of the monarch, now many of us don't question the rule of capitalism and power (what Hardt and Negri term ["Empire"](http://en.bookfi.org/s/?q=empire+hardt+negri&t=0)).		But not even those who claim to recognise the oppressive rule of capitalism are able to live outside of it, just as those who lived under monarchical rule in bygone eras may have struggled to imagine the liberal-democracies many of us have today.		We, as a species; as peoples; as differing subjectivities, have to learn new ways of organising our lives, they don't just come out of the air. Many say the solution to this is struggle; political action. At the end of [Declaration](http://antonionegriinenglish.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/93152857-hardt-negri-declaration-2012.pdf), Hardt and Negri (is it clear I like their work?....) note how this has been a virtue of the Occupy movement. It achieved very little, but what it did was show new ways of living, new ways of organising, new ways of relating to one another, new outlooks of the world. Even in this respect, Occupy has not gone too far, but it is through movements like these, struggles of a whole range, that we can hope to build the people who can build the world we want to see.		It's a hell of challenge. Fuck, some days I wonder why I don't just give up the stupid dreams of a student reading too many (not enough?) books, but we are in charge of our own individual and collective destinies, if only we have the will. And to paraphrase Rosa Luxembourg, we have a choice between communism or barbarism; it is either the barbarism of a world that pits us all against one another, or the freedom of a world where we work together for the betterment and autonomy of all.		I'm not really doing these themes justice in my scant explanation because I'm writing fast so I can go make the cup of tea that I've been dying for for the last 2 hours but have been too distracted by the internet, but I hope that I've shed some light on some alternative views.		Laclau and Mouffe also say some interesting things on democracy and struggle being key in creating a world more conducive to freedom, in their book [Hegemony and Socialist Strategy](http://en.bookfi.org/s/?q=laclau+mouffe+hegemony&t=0)......well, the bits I've read of it.","depth":6,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AskMeAboutCommunism","name":"t1_cdslpu9","parent_id":"t1_cdskkar","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1386119322,"created_utc":1386090522}

As for janitorial work lets take the example of said worker's cooperative.

{"body":"My issue was with how in Duke 3D everything going on around you was very serious.  Aliens torturing people, cities destroyed.  *Duke himself* was the parody.  He was a lovable character because through all the seriousness he was still a tacky action hero, spewing one-liners and paying for lap dances.		In DNF everything is twisted into one big trashy joke.  It didn't have its own identity, it was like one big fan service with no actual foundation. "Hey guys, remember when there were strippers in Duke 3D?  Remember when you saw boobs?  Remember 80's references?"  And all of the little events seemed so out of place, like driving the car through the casino.		Serious Sam 3 is what DNF should have been.  Same general theme, same humor (a hero who is so over the top cliche that it can't be for real), big guns, simple puzzles, destructible environments and TONS of enemies.  Plus there's 16 player co-op where you can adjust *everything* from how much ammo is available to how strong the enemies are to how many extra lives you get.  Playing Sam 3 for the first time felt like playing DOOM for the first time.

{"body":"I understand where you're coming from, and I can see how that might spoil the experience to some degree. But I see it as more of a meta-parody. Where DNF's Duke, who now has his face on every single thing and has pictures of himself doing incredible things around the world and is basically the center of the Universe, is almost a loving parody of Duke 3D's Duke. Since many people kind of loved Duke in D3D seriously instead of as a parody, it turns him into the sort of thing he was supposed to be a parody of in the first place. So it makes sense that they would then parody Duke himself using Duke himself.		I mean, that was probably not the intention at all. But it's how I like to view it.		That said though, I enjoyed driving the RC car through the casino. It was weird and interesting. I've driven so many off-road vehicles across warzones and alien landscapes in my games, that I'm glad to do something a little different.		As for SS3, I loved it. I'm a big fan of the Serious Sam series, and I'm glad to hear you are, too. But I have to admit, I didn't like 3 as much as TFE or TSE. I still had a load of fun playing it, and it was a good game.

{"body":"Not that I'm trying to put you on the spot or anything, but most of what you describe actually had legitimate explanations.

Clipping through floors/walls is an unfortunate product of latency. SOE got a lot of flak for having really shitty net code. And in regards to aimbots, there has honestly only ever been 1 or 2 times where I've encountered them; a lot of people just have really good aim, and this is compacted by the fact that the most accurate weapons in the game have a cone of fire like a needle.		Anyways, you should come check out /r/planetside if you are interested in getting back into the game.

{"body":"I think BF4 is pretty fun, but only because they finally brought back the features that were present in Bad Company 2 that let you destroy small buildings and such. That plus having commanders and some technical updates make it a decent game.		That being said, it's still full of major glitches. It crashes on me almost every time I play, and the single player was just plain bad. The graphics in the campaign are very pretty, but I found myself disliking just about all of the major characters and the plot. It cages you in to the point where if you move too fast through a level you'll beat the event triggers that require your squad be close to you. For example, there's a level on a dam where you have to fight up some scaffolding and then leap across a gap to a ladder. If you've gotten too far ahead of your squad the ladder isn't active yet and you'll just fall to your death. You have to wait for the squad to tell you that you need to climb it.		Multiplayer is fun though, and that's the only reason people buy Battlefield games anyway. Once they start cleaning up the net code a little bit (no lag, but client side hit detection is awful) and fix some of this crashing it will be solid.

I was the best driver there (because I worked the most), so on Friday nights I would work as well and get given all of the already late pizzas as the manager freaked out, and gave the easy runs to the kids who worked only that day. So they got all the tips, I got angry 'fuck you's' and barely any tips.		Plus I had to run my car and pay for my own petrol of course.		All in all it was unsustainable.

A few minutes later my phone rings, and it's my best friend.  I walked out of the concert to answer it, and I don't hear his voice on the other end.  I say "Oh this is Jon isn't it?" and he hung up.  About fifteen minutes later my phone rings again, and it's another friend who I quickly assumed was at that panel.  I ignored the call and went back to enjoying the concert.  Later when I check my phone again I see I have voicemail.  It was Jon (as Duke), and he left me a pretty hilarious message.			The next day I confronted Jon about the voicemail, and he says "Oh, that was you, wasn't it?" We both had a great laugh and we embraced.","depth":3,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"capt_carl","name":"t1_cdsj3c7","parent_id":"t1_cdshdcq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1386112606,"created_utc":1386083806}

{"body":"It's the only game in my steam library (500+ games) that I had to force myself to finish in order to never have the temptation to install it again. I will compare it to DN3D a lot to emphasize the difference between the two, but you could take each point objectively and it would be still as bad.		The level design of DN3D was really good, lots of secrets everywhere, different ways, maze-like levels where you had to actively search for the way to progress. DNF has the most corridor levels I've seen in a long time, there isn't even rooms on the side of the corridor to find a little thing.		Which is tied to another change : the regenerative health and the box of neverending ammo. It has killed any sense of exploration to find a mega health pack or to find RPG ammo. What would they fill their secret rooms with if medpacks and ammo aren't important any more ?		DN3D was about shooting things in a frantic, nonstop action from the beginning to the end. Hordes of ennemies were thrown at you constantly. I don't really know what DNF tried to do, but at least half of the game is not spent shooting things, between the horribly long "prologue", the huge amount of driving and other nonsense I could barely call shooting like turret shooting. Those sequences are generally bad made, with sloppy controls. 		DNF has embraced the 2 weapons max system of modern games which is awfull. DN3D relied on having all of the options you find in the levels available to you at all time to kill the hordes of ennemies. It was very satisfying and allowed some variety in the gameplay when the player wanted it. DNF throws at you the exact weapon type that youy will need for the next sequence, no thought needed for the player and no choice at all : here is a sniper rifle, prepare for a long range encounter, here is rocket launcher, prepare for a boss, here is a shotgun, prepare for narrow corridors. And what is the reasonning behind the fact that bosses can't be harmed by anything other than explosives and turrets ? To be sure that the player can't choose which weapon to use or which weapon he likes best ?		Let's not forget that DNF animation and overall graphic fidelity is barely acceptable at the year that it was released, that the humour was awful in the wrong kind of awful (where DN3D was quite funny), the story was horrible, the weapons were unsatisfying in term of feedback for the player (besides the devastator maybe), the game forced some kind of mouse acceleration on you... and the list goes on and on. All those points that I can easily forgive when they are alone, but together, they form one the worst game I've ever played.

It starts out bright and colorful, moves on to blue toned, and finishes off being a dirty brown. 		Basically, shooters in the late 90's, shooters up till 2005, and then shooters up until the present.		Taking a step back from the immaturity of the game(which is what Duke Nukem is at it's core, a parody on the 'serious shooter') it had relatively few game breaking glitches, a story just as complete as any major shooter's campaign, and some decently fast paced gameplay.		People wanted DNF, but were in no way expecting to receive a Duke Nukem game when they bought it. 		My one, single complaint about the game is that they used static meshes for things like soda cans and debris.

{"body":"to be honest, i think them bombing with DNF was the smartest move to make for Gearbox. they told us when they bought 3D Realms that they were doing it so they could make their own game with the Duke franchise. they also told us that they were going to polish up and release DNF mostly as is. 		like i said in a earlier post, this was a important thing for us as gamers. even if others don't acknowledge it as such. most of us grew up in that time frame, and games like D3D were our first adult games. almost like our GTA3, basically. we needed DNF to be released to give us closure. it lets us move forward. 		without that Gearbox would have been in a terrible situation. people would've always wondered what might have been, and would have compared that imaginary version of the game to whatever Gearbox releases next. by playing it the way they did, people's expectations are now low. if they release a solid game, they'll be the company that saved the Duke franchise. 			on it's own, DNF is a solid romp through the days of old. wrapped in fairly modern graphics, it's a step back to the world of games in the early 2000's. the gameplay mechanics are solid, the game is somewhat fun, and i never encountered any game breaking bugs, in either the pirate copy i played on my laptop or the 360 version my wife got me for my birthday one year. 		it's just a relic from a by-gone era. the problem with it as a Duke game is that it's hard to shock us anymore. we've all killed hookers in GTA. hell when Duke3D came out, TIPPING the hookers was shocking. it had a impossible goal that was unobtainable. but, if you've played the old ones, or if you thought Doom3 was fun, this is one to play.
