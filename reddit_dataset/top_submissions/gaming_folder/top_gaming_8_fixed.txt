I feel the rating system is a bit fucked as there's no way realistically I should be over DMG if you think of it as a slightly over mid skilled rank as I think it should be. Current DMG is low-mid which is stupid for saying it's one of the higher ranks available. I know it's a different game but when people who were awful at 1.6 (gamesense wise) get to Global in about 100 games you know the ranking system isn't great, it's not like your game sense can improve to that extent over the course of 100 games.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hara-Kiri","name":"t1_ctvc3gd","parent_id":"t1_ctv3o3p","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439015771,"created_utc":1438986971}
