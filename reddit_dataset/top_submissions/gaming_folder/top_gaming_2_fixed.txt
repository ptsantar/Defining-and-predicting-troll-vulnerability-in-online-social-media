{"body":"My plan to sort this mess out would be something along these lines: 	(Its been a while since I’ve played Civ 2 but I can remember some stuff…)		- Forget ending the war, try and get your front line such that you can consistently withstand attack, forcing a stalemate. Basically stop wasting production on tanks and planes that are going to get nuked anyway.	- Change to fundamentalism, I remember this was bad for research but you don’t need it now anyway, but the people will stop hating you and you'll have more coin.	- Get your core cities to rebuild and fix the land surrounding them (very costly in engineers, in know) and get farms and production moving! I’m guessing it take a lot of turns to build a tank in a low population city. 	- once all that’s in place, build an army of tanks, mountain troops, artillery and spys the like of which has never been seen and keep it off the frontlines, build rail roads as far as they'll go without losing engineers.	- once all is in place, get spys in every enemy city (enough to guarantee a nuke hit) all the way to their capital, hit em all at once and drop in the mountain boys, wait for the nuke response, hopefully using their whole stockpile, then move your conventional army in and mop up the mess.	- Repeat with the other guys.		Diplomacy's failed in this world, you’ve got to hit em hard and take over the world for the greater good. Then you can spend turn upon turn under the blanket of enforced religious peace fixing it with hundreds of engineers if you like!		Its for the greater good.","depth":0,"score":3012,"ups":3012,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DonutEF","name":"t1_c4zi6pr","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339528781,"created_utc":1339499981}

I remember once she spawned near the Monsoon Jungle and had a massive population and tons and tons of bases. While she was low-tech, her army was just so big that it just wasn't worth it to invade her. But then she began landing troops on my island and I knew that if I didn't take her out, she would slowly eat away at my faction while my army was busy with the Hive and the Spartans, both of whom were to the south of me. 		This was before I developed jump jets and Space Elevator, so I needed to shuttle dozens and dozens of advanced troops to across the sea. As soon as I'd land them, I'd immediately get attacked by her massive army and lose the foothold I'd established, if they could even land at all. I must have fed that jungle with hundreds of lives as I tried, time after time, to get some traction. Eventually, though, I was able to establish some sort of stable base camp and began shuttling workers there like no one's business and quickly started expanding outward. Once I was in a safe position on her continent, it was no contest. I rolled over her like an 18-wheeler. It's funny. At the end, she thought she could appeal to my mercy and surrender.

{"body":"Ah, but there are ways.		I'm pretty sure this tactic will work in Civ2, but it's been a very long time since I played that. I know it will work in FreeCiv, as that's where a friend and I perfected it. The scenario we were dealing with was late-game where everyone had almost all of the tech, and we were attempting to take a dense-packed enemy continent: over 100 cities, massively rail integration between all of them. We landed, took one city, and that immediately sparked a massive swarm of howitzers boiling out of every other city on the continent to retake it. Repeat this a few times, same deal.		Finally, we realized a few things. 1) Bombers can take off on one turn and return to base on the next. 2) Ground units can't enter squares occupied by enemy aircraft.		Realizing this, our path became clear. We proceeded to park a couple of carriers off shore, then used our bombers to screen off one or two enemy cities from the rest of the continent, switching them out every turn to maintain the line. We then pounded those cities into rubble and took them to establish a bridgehead and base for our bombers, moved in more units, and slowly extended the line across the entire north-south axis of the continent as we took more cities. I think when we were midway through the process, we had around 70 active bombers and a screening wall 30 squares long.		I think you could use this same tactic in Civ2, perhaps with a bit more buffer space between your bomber screen and the cities you take to avoid having nuclear strikes on newly-captured cities take out the line. The one thing we didn't have to deal with there was enemy nukes -- they didn't have any.

{"body":"Definitely change to fundamentalism...the only downside at this late stage is that your spies aren't automatically veteran. With the extra money you get you can cause revolts at a faster pace, hopefully your enemies aren't Democracies ;). Revolts are obviously ideal because they leave the city intact, and most AI opponents will have every city upgrade conceivable at this point.		My main approach in this situation was to have every city with an SDI, then keep a wall of ground units within 3 spaces of the city (for SDI protection) which would block the paths from allowing spies in, and at the same time be heavily fortified so that ground/air units couldn't take them out. This usually required a lot of forts and mechanized infantry (which are fairly cheap to build) on mountains and/or hills. It might be difficult to get to this point if you don't have SDI on an outlying city, but if you can it will keep you from having to fall back.

Almost immediately afterwards Olympic struck the submarine just aft of her conning tower and her port propeller sliced through U-103's pressure hull. The crew of U-103 blew her ballast tanks, scuttled and abandoned the submarine. **This is the only known incident in World War I in which a merchant vessel sank an enemy warship.** Olympic returned to Southampton with at least two hull plates dented and her prow twisted to one side, but not breached."		>Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Olympic#Naval_service)","depth":6,"score":264,"ups":264,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_c4zjjwt","parent_id":"t1_c4zihp3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339538455,"created_utc":1339509655}

High command set us back here in the deep north to keep our outdated ship out of harm's way, but war is cruel and it found us today.		The ship has fought many a great battle, but against a modern fighter squadron, she shouldn't stand a chance. She is no modern cruiser, after all. The first two striving runs nearly took us out and many good men lost their lives.		All seemed lost, when Kanonier Velmer had an idea. When they returned for the third time, he fired all cannons at once, without any balls loaded even, just as they were going into their descent on us. The heavy, oily smoke that arose from the mounds of our ancient weaponry must have blocked their sight by pure luck for us. And what luck it was, as the strife not only missed us completely, but the whole squadron was not able to pull up in time anymore.		When I heard all cannons firing, I thought we were lost. But upon seeing the aftermath, I was dumbfounded. We thanked our god and our king, when it was clear that we were victorious in the most uneven battle since the Stand of the Pikemen hundred years ago. As long as I live, I will never forget this day when brave Kanonier Velmer saved all our souls with his ingenuity."","depth":5,"score":162,"ups":162,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Daniel__K","name":"t1_c4ziy1t","parent_id":"t1_c4zidly","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339535001,"created_utc":1339506201}

{"body":"No, I don't think my view of the world is overly sanguine.  Orwell's vision may have been grimmer than mine, but it was also rather specific.  It's handy and easy to say that *1984* was a grim but accurate scenario, but it really wasn't.		It might have been accurate in its grimness, but it severely missed the mark in the political structure of the world—and at that point, it's no more accurate than any other man who looks at tomorrow and predicts it's going to suck.		We don't have telescreens, I drink real gin rather than Victory Gin, and the political elite are not deliberately constrained in a roundabout way of controlling the poor.  The rich are simply rich, the poor simply poor, and Orwell's vision isn't remotely close to the world we live in.		We live in an alamgam of more than one hundred and fifty nations, not three, and that would be one of the most core of Orwell's assumptions.  He predicted superpower domination, and in the end fully half of the two superpowers that emerged disintegrated.		He wrote a very powerful statement on man's inhumanity to man, but he misread the future of the world.

{"body":"no, I think Orwell objectively makes the point that three major superpowers do exist.		Chapter III	War is Peace		>The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.		>In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years.		...		>To understand the nature of the present war -- for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war -- one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable.					http://msxnet.org/orwell/1984			edit: these are assertions by Goldstein, arguably the voice of Orwell.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_c4zivux","parent_id":"t1_c4ziay3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339534619,"created_utc":1339505819}

{"body":"Sort of, except for the fact that it was Germany attacking the Soviet Union and the USSR had no choice but to continue fighting or to lose their country entirely to Hitler. It is believed (and highly plausible) that the extreme winter of '44-'45 was the only factor to allow the USSR to keep fighting for so long, for the conditions slowed the blitzkrieg down considerably and killed thousands on its own. Finally, Hitler's persistent effort on the Eastern Front most certainly weakened his other fronts, Western and North African, allowing the Allies to make their way to Berlin.		The tactic being suggested for Civ II is a bit different: here, the "sacrificial" army would be attacking the aggressor army rather than the reverse. Weather conditions don't have any effect in Civ II and the only thing slowing anyone down is the swampy fallout land but this affects all players equally and thus is no advantage to anyone.		Note: it isn't as clear-cut as "America turned on them (USSR) post-war. After Germany had conceded defeat, it was obvious to the leaders of most nations that the USA and the USSR would be the most powerful countries after the war. It is believed that the atomic bombs were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima not in necessity to end the war, as Japan was the only opposing force left and the US Navy had slowly but surely made their way across the Pacific and were quite capable of walling them off to the east while; the Allies could have then rallied together and cooperatively invaded Japan until surrender. Instead, it is believed that the bombs were dropped as a deterrent to the anxious USSR. Many believe it also worked as without the deterrent of such a massively destructive weapon, the USSR may have attacked the US directly and made things much more difficult for everybody.

{"body":"Some of these issues aren't quite as clear-cut as you make them. For example		>It is believed (and highly plausible) that the extreme winter of '44-'45 was the only factor to allow the USSR to keep fighting for so long		Well, no, it isn't plausible that the single, only and deciding factor was a shitty winter. The size of Russia and her population were critical as well, for example. If we compare, say, the war in China and Japan, which started in the early '30s, we can see that a smaller but better equipped and trained army can be radically more successful, and yet the bigger and more populous country can holdout for a long, long time. 		Also, about the dropping of the bomb. Again, issues aren't that clear cut. One of the major motivations for the dropping of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was that US military officials weren't sure what would happen if they invaded mainland Japan, except that a lot of people would die. The Emperor had a very clear policy of "death before dishonour", and tactics like kamikaze pilots baffled traditional US military doctrine. So one of the major motivations for bombing Japan was that the US hoped to intimidate Japan into surrender, because they weren't sure that Japan would surrender under conventional circumstances. On the other hand, the intimidation of the USSR was a major goal as well - which might have worked better if the USSR hadn't already stolen a bunch of the science before President Truman was even informed about the project. 		Like, 99% of what you said was correct, and I don't mean to harsh on your mellow. But if my history classes have taught me anything, it's that you can't make blanket statements like the kind you were making. If you care about my sources, I've taken classes in WWII and Cold War history, as well as taking AP history myself (although it was European, not American, and it was four years ago now... jesus).

{"body":"First off: Awesome game man! I'm almost hesitant to give you advice on how to finish this one because it sounds like a truly epic struggle. Also as many have already commented, the parallels between your game and 1984 are really remarkable. You should save this game in honor of Orwell's foresight :)		Now how to finish this game:		The best way to conquer your enemies in Civ (that i've always found anyways) is to build a few super production cities and then mass up an insane army (the kind that takes 20mins just to MOVE).		So to begin with: Choose a few core cities that are usually safe from attack. Make the rest of your crappy outer cities build 1 engineer each and send them to beef up the land around your cores.	2. Once your cores are primed and ready for production (20 shields production per turn...minimum!!! Change the terrain to mountains and mine those suckers if you have to) - start pumping out units. You're going to want to focus on tanks and howitzers and mechanized infantry. Howitzers to pummel any defense your opponent has in his cities, Tanks to kill weaker units in the surrounding hills and mech infantry to defend them once captured.		3. This strategy revolves entirely on a few massive pushes - think D-Day Normandy kind of scale. Ideally, you shouldn't even launch the attack until you are confident that the army you have is enough to defeat every single enemy unit.

{"body":"I ctrl + f'd for 'engineer' and saw no mention of a Civ II tactic you may wish to employ. Building an engineer in a 1-population city presents you an option to erase the city from the map, improvements and all. (I hope you've been selling every improvement that you don't need in the apocalypse each turn, incidentally.) If I'm remembering correctly, the kicker here is that the engineer will have a home city of NONE, meaning you can skip the food support requirement. An uprooted, enslaved, self-supporting city to do your bidding in eternal starvation. (Please correct me if I am remembering this wrong.)		You can use this to make an SDI-free no-man's land to burn and bleed your enemy if that will serve you, or to ensure that enemy production centers go down and stay down. The rush-built engineers will probably be more useful to you than the vulnerable and polluted cities, and they can join your own cities and pump them up to size 8. This may be enough to make viable cities on the coast with rush-built Harbors, or to contribute to production in the towns with hills or Whales if they starve slowly enough. Ideally, relocate them to sanctuary cities safe behind your lines. Not much worth a damn on the screenshots of your planet except the whales and hills anyway.		So that's the slaver option. On to genocide! Your Commie-produced Veteran spies can do some incredible damage poisoning water supplies and dropping off nukes. Each nuke halves the population, and I don't see any cities larger than Size 12. And those people won't be coming back in your world. Dead is dead. Nobody is running a food surplus. Fifteen million seven hundred thousand can go quicker than you'd think.		So at least you have a way to kill Chicago and that little American island east of Tintagel on the cheap, potentially in one turn or two. You can daisy-chain Transports by trans-shipping units using the Sleep command if memory serves, or by moving the units from ship to ship in mid-ocean regardless. And Spies are amphibious, so if there's not a ship parked on every ocean tile abutting a city you can get in and do your damage without any chance for a response. Aaaand spies ignore Zones of Control, so you can use them to get your occupier units onshore. Then just back your transport off one space and hope your nukes get through. The spies die or teleport home, your transport and occupying unit probably get shot to hell the next turn unless you get lucky with parking a Bomber on them, but you've killed a hundred thousand survivors who ain't coming back. It won't win you the war, but there's not much that can stop you from doing all this damage. If you can't control the game, control the board. The military stalemate will be much more malleable when there are ten Celts to every living American and Viking.		**tl;dr You're *already* complicit in genocide, kidnap small cities wholesale and have your Veteran Spies rise out of the ocean to murder the wretched surviving civilians like a Lovecraftian elder god.**","depth":2,"score":37,"ups":37,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yumpsuit","name":"t1_c4zmere","parent_id":"t1_c4zib93","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339550044,"created_utc":1339521244}

{"body":"It seemed like just another day in this never-ending war. The last few historians left (who needs history now, really) agree that it has been going on for at least 1500 years, but their estimates vary. Why does it matter, anyway. The leaders of the remaining superpowers are locked in this pointless struggle, with no breakthrough. I have no idea how the Vikings keep being so consistent over such a long time, but the Communists have had the same family (and principles) in power ever since the war began and over here in America we've hooked up our president to a computer so he could rule forever. What a brilliant plan that was... Each nation is powerful just enough so neither can fall. Every time a city is captured, it is taken the next day. When roads are build in order to help dry up the swamps, they are immediately destroyed. The only way to rebuild our Earth is for someone to win, but that won't happen. At least, that's what I thought until now.		Our forces took another city by dawn. Nothing was special about it, apart from the fact that it was the first time it has been under American control since the war began. It's not that it was heavily guarded, only it was never deemed important enough for capture. As a part of our new military "strategy", we had to capture it for the slight chance that an inhabitant over there could have any sort of solution to the famines. We didn't find a man, but we got the solution alright.		I was being escorted into a large house on the outskirts of the city. It was a big, empty mansion, abandoned for generations according to the locals, who think it is haunted and avoid coming near it. Nevertheless, we had to comb the entire town, so someone had to go there. I, a fragile and valuable scientists sent to the front lines to find some way to grow food in the irradiated swamps that make up most of the world now, am accompanied by a small squad to keep me guard against any sort of dangers. They aren't very smart (to be fair, most of the smart people left in this world aren't anywhere near combat) but they provide good company. As we enter the mansion I order them to split up and search the house. If they are to see anything unusual - they are to report it immidiately. All protocol, we have done it a hundred times in the past year alone, and yet I always excited by the fact that I am giving orders to these armed men.		An hour passes and we find nothing, apart from a sprawling library in the basement. While we should move forward to more important targets, the idea of so many books untouched for such a long time intrigues me, along with my guards. We decide to call in a code 4057, which means we found something of interest and will be taking out time exploring it. We didn't expect finding much from the books, but it is a good distraction from the situation outside.		The library is beautiful, modeled after the old ones that were in medieval castles. My guards all pick up some fiction books and start reading to their enjoyment, which surprises me as I never saw them take leisure in books. I go around the bookshelves, searching for something more interesting than mere stories, when an odd book strikes my eyes.		It is labeled "The Secrets of Life", without an author. The cover is colored with a strong crimson color and gold linings, and it is huge, at least 3000 large pages. I don't know what prompted me to pick it up, the fact that it could be what we're actually looking for or the amazing aesthetics of its cover, but the moment I lift it up from the bookshelf a loud, rumbling sound is heard.		All of the guards spring to their feet, clinching their rifles reflexively, and turn to me. The bookshelf in front of me starts to turn, introducing a new, secret tunnel that is unlike anything I've seen before. Even though this was probably built thousands of years ago, the hidden tunnel looks like it's from the future. It is a shiny, chrome color with light-blue wires running along the ceiling. We slowly make our way deeper into the ground, when a huge door comes in front of us. I walk to a control panel nearby and pull a big-looking lever, the only intractable object I can see, and the door begins to open slowly sideways, into the wall. Behind it lies a large chamber, empty apart from a huge machine connected to the wires we saw before. The machine is just a cube, around 5 meters a side, with a large screen on the edge towards the door. As I approach it, a keyboard comes out of the cube and the screen turns on.","depth":0,"score":1182,"ups":1182,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"EliteKill","name":"t1_c4zifc3","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339531097,"created_utc":1339502297}
{"body":"The keyboard is covered in English, although by the font I can tell it's an old variant of the language. Apart from the letters, which are ordered in a formation I cannot understand (the top-most row starts with the unusual combination QWERTY), I see the numbers 0 through 9, four arrow keys each pointing a different direction, a large button with "Enter" written on it and another, long key with no label. I instinctively press the "Enter" button and a presentation begins on the screen.		Apparently, the mansion belonged to one of the wealthiest men alive in history. I couldn't really understand how he did earn his fortune, but it was something to do with Quantum Computers, a technology long outdated. In the year 2012, which was 1979 years ago, there was some international panic from a predicted solar storm which would "end humanity as we know it". The owner of this mansion built this machine, which is a huge database, to serve as a testament to human advancements in case civilization would be wiped out. The presentation goes on to explain how to navigate the database, and then fades to white as a nice looking menu pops out.		The screen presents me with four options: "Browse Categories", "Search Entries", "Replay Introduction" and "Export Data". Without hesitating I search "swamp vegetation", only to find an entry about the long extinct Eucalyptus tree, which was used in the past to dry up swamps. Apparently back in 2012 no one even attempted to grow food in marshes. I try to search for more solutions, but find nothing I can use. Just as I am about to give up and report the whole area so other scientists can drool over the historic database, I have one idea. An idea that proves to be the key to ending this war.		I simply search for "World War", and find 3 main entries. "World War 1" and "World War 2" were two large-scale conflicts in the 20th century that are as good as ancient history to me, but what catches my eye was an entry titled "World War 3". It describes a hypothetical war, identical to the one that has been going on for the past 1500 or so years - nuclear holocaust, completely global, likely never to end. And then there is a section named "theorized solutions".		Reading this completely baffles me. I mean, it seems so simple that I just can't believe nobody though about it before. In the time this database was composed, this third world war seemed close than ever with the rise of the country Iran as a dictatorship, which aimed to build nuclear weapons. To combat this while not starting a war so big, Western Civilization would develop "computer viruses" which disabled the nuclear facilities and halt Iran's advances.		Now, cybernetic warfare is nothing new, but a specific virus, launched in the summer of 2012, caught my eye. Codenamed "Phantom", the virus didn't target Iran's nuclear facilities, but rather the personal computers of the people who worked there. The virus implemented specific pop ups and advertisements in those computer which sub-consciously turned the workers and scientists against the government. Then, using undercover agents, the western countries sparked a small revolt, which usually would not make a dent to the government. However, as the revolt broke, the nuclear facilities' employees immediately joined, brainwashed by the virus, and thus the rebels got hold on nuclear technologies. The government quickly fell, and the war was averted.		The problem with using viruses was that now, important facilities can't be breached - virtual security is just that good. However, the Average Joe doesn't have access to that kind of security, so this plan could work. This could mean the end of the war. The rebirth of humanity. I explain the situation to my squad, and they all agree we must contact a high-ranking officer ASAP. We run outside, but as we enter the library we hear explosions above. We exit the house, only to be greeted by a missile launched from a drone up above.		As I lie near a bush, I manage to get a glance around. My guards are all dead, most of them mutilated beyond recognition by the missile. We must have spent a few hours down there, because it seems like the Celtics are launching an assault to capture the town again. As everything around me blurs out, I realize that with our death, the information of the virus will be lost until someone else visits this mansion, and now, seeing as it's mostly destroyed by the offensive, seems highly unlikely. If this war is going to end, it would be thanks to something else. It's funny, I just read how this "World War 3" is likely to never end, and as I was about to finish it, the same war made sure that it would keep on going. I look back at the mansion, now collapsing, before I black out, probably for good this time.","depth":1,"score":891,"ups":891,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EliteKill","name":"t1_c4zilhy","parent_id":"t1_c4zifc3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339532539,"created_utc":1339503739}

{"body":"The story goes from past to present tense....I'll stick with past		Usually the experience of awaking with a pounding, throbbing pain in your temples and a sore body was testament to an evening to substance abuse.  I was not used such experiences, with the rationing being rather severe the last decade.  Alcohol was nearly impossible to find, and even the ratty home made versions of it were rare.  Groggily I sat up, the darkness illuminated by burning embers and neighboring houses set alight and battered by the enemies missile barrage.  Small arms fire peppered in the distance, giving a macabre closing hymn for this funeral pyre I was situated in.  My men were eviscerated, severed limbs were settled around me like leaves falling from trees with the changing of the seasons.  Not that I had ever witnessed that phenomena firsthand, but when I was younger the tales of lush green forests enthralled me.  Once I viewed a grove of pines, with green needles.  That valley is gone now, I thought morosely, destroyed in last years nuclear strike.  Just radiation and despair now.  		There was a faint moaning sound to my left under rubble from the mansion.  I knew I would not want to see what was left of the soldier under there, but I stood and staggered over to him.  Sometimes holding a dying ones hand or comforting them in their last moments made the transition easier.  Usually we just put a bullet in their heads, but with potential enemy troops nearby I opted out of that decision.  		I removed the pieces of brick, mortar, and wood to find one of the ammunition carriers from my machine gun section.  "Help me, for God's sake, help," he croaked, barely audible.  I could not find any trace of his legs below the knees.  They were ragged stumps, with bits of bone poking out the ends.  The charring from had moderately cauterized the viscous wound, staunching the blood loss that would have been quickly fatal otherwise.  The boys midsection had been ripped open, and his innards were on his lap and pooling over the side of his torso.  I could see the intestines glistening because of nearby fires.  "Help me....I want to go home....it hurts so much,"  tears ran down his sooty face, little clean rivulets on an expiring surface.  I knew he was done for, there was not one doubt about it.  		Then I heard it.  Vehicle engines.  They were coming down the street.  I ducked down beside the boy, and put my hand over his mouth to cover up any sort of noise he could produce.  The tires stopped and I heard soldiers dismount.  Beads of sweat dripped down my face, and I could feel my body become tense.  Were they friend or foe?		The injured child was squirming now, and the groans were becoming incessantly louder.  "Shut up," I whispered coldly.  "Just shut up or we're both dead."  I saw the silhouettes of the men as they fanned out and could tell by the formation pattern that they were not friendly.  They rifled through the rucksacks of my dead soldiers, taking rations and clothing.  There would be nothing else of value in them.  I watched one of the enemy take a small book from the pack of my dead medic presumably, as he had been the only openly religious man in the section.  A lot of good that did him, I said in my head.  		The boy flailed his arms, foolishly believing that the men who walked among us as we lay in rubble would provide aid.  His rapid movements knocked over a chunk of concrete or stone, in the darkness I was unsure.  Regardless it fell to the ground and bounced off a wooden beam with an audible noise.  I could see some of the soldiers tense up and some hit the ground instantly, trying to get to cover.  Some of them stood and did not move at all.  I knew they were definitely new replacements, fresh meat for the unending slaughter.  		One walked over to us, sauntering slowly, systematically pausing along the way.  He was mere meters away.  I wanted to run, to bolt away and scream.  I let out a string of expletives mentally and felt my bladder relax without my permission.  The urine soaked my trousers.  My hand was still tightly gripped over the injured boys mouth, but the soldier was so close he would hear the muffled breathing anyways.  With caution I removed my trench knife from my sheath and had it at the ready.  Any second this soldier would see that we were not debris.  His rifle had a nasty looking bayonet on the edge, shining bright from the fires.  "Steady boy, steady," I whispered.  He did not comply and cried softly.  I knew I was done for.  The man had heard and was fast approaching, so I lay my head down on the scorched earth and feigned dead.  		"Please, please...."  the injured boy said to the enemy.  I heard the bayonet stick into the boys body with a sickly noise.  He screamed, the death rattle piercing the night, and shook violently.  I used his death to my advantage and utilizing my free arm to keep my opponents rifle from rising I leaned up and quickly thrust my knife deep into his bowels.  He shrieked as well and I felt warm blood coat my hand as he went limp and collapsed to the ground in horrific pain.  		This situation had become worse with each second.  The rifle was stuck  because of the bayonet in my dying ammunition carrier, who was still screaming and flailing listlessly.  He was dead but he did not know it.  I pulled it out hastily and checked to see if the safety was off.  Voices were yelling at each other in the darkness.  I fired towards silhouettes and shadows, and made sure to put a round in my soldiers head to spare his suffering.  I left the enemy I had stabbed writhing and groaning.  As I sprinted away I could heard the hiss and snap of bullets as they narrowly missed me.  The terror was unimaginable.  I was manic, completely on auto pilot but horrified all the same.  I wanted to crawl into my mind and stay there.  I wanted this to end.  I wanted to be in another body.  It was like i was in a dream, just a long dark dream that was not meant to be.  Poor eyesight and darkness combined are a ghastly duo and soon enough I tripped and fell, rolling down a slight hill before coming to a stop.  Every bone in my body was sore, and I thought about the eyes of my young ammunition carrier.  Larga something or other.  First name unknown.  Sixteen.  Dead, for the nation and the people.  Disgusting.  His eyes were looking to me for safety, for aid.  I effectively killed him.  If his parents were living, I imagine how they would take the news.  Yes commissar, we understand our son died valiantly and gloriously on the field of battle.  It was a quick death and he was a hero, and all of that compiled bull shit.  I felt dry in the throat, and vomited bile on myself as I sat in relative silence.  How long had I been running?  Thirty seconds, or thirty minutes, I would have not known the difference.  My weapon was out of ammunition.  But the bayonet was still on it, with a sixteen year olds blood of course.  I stood and walked into the dark, the rumble of artillery in the distance a supple reminder of the utter hell I lived in.","depth":2,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"liberty4e","name":"t1_c4zmjlv","parent_id":"t1_c4zilhy","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339550530,"created_utc":1339521730}

{"body":"I apologise for the rushed job, but I hope you like my expansion of the original story.		——		We hadn't expected the Americans to take back Chicago. Legend has it us Vikings took it from them almost four centuries ago, and it's so small and insignificant they had never bothered retaking it. I'd been there a couple of times, and from what I can gather from the ruins and the myths of the citizens it was once a magnificent city made of glass and steel. Skyscrapers rose thousands of feet above the millions of citizens bustling about their daily lives in the streets below. That is, if one city's population could ever hold that much. But that's what people say, 72 million was one of the largest apparently. Hard to believe when you look around these days, even at our capital, which struggles to support less than 100,000.		Yeah, these days. "The Never Ending War." How can something be never ending? Oh well, that's not for me to think about. I get my rations for being a fighter, not a thinker. I've heard scientists have it pretty good; don't have to get dirty on the front line, decent amounts of food, I've even heard some have started families, an opportunity no soldiers get. Families? They're a thing of the past. Apparently children are smarter if they're conceived naturally and then modified, whereas us soldiers, we're just clones. It's always fun to join a new unit, look around and three of the 14 people look exactly like you.		And then we all have numbers; no names. I'm #11155353. It's nice that my numbers form some sort of pattern, though I don't get much time to think about that, what with the fighting.		I suppose "The Never Ending War" is sort of accurate, a soldier will never get more than a days rest once they're back from the front lines. *If* they get back from the front lines. Our superiors seem to forget that clones are still human. Thousands upon thousands of lives are lost almost on the hour. Not like that matters to them. A thousand clones aren't hard to make, and they can be on the front lines as soon as their transport gets there after the three days training and growth.		And I suppose that leads nicely up to where we are now. I was on my break in Vancouver, meeting up with some new spawns, when the intel that the Americans were launching an assault on Chicago came in. And just like that we were off.		We got there too late, of course. The Americans had occupied the city. Not that that was bad or different or hard, we'd just go in and take it back, just like they'd done the day before, and happens to most of the other cities on this planet daily. There was no point using missiles. "Ranging it" was the slang used by us grunts. You know, like you attack from a.... Eh forget it. We couldn't use missiles because there was no doubt there was a SDI installed, which meant to do anything we were going to have to get into its effective range.		And so we did. 4,427^th Company launched a ground assault from the North. Nothing out of the ordinary, couple of hundred tanks and a few GDR's. Oh, "GDR" is "Giant Death Robot" – some more of our slang. The incursion was completely ordinary, and we half expected them to be wiped out in a few minutes! But they in fact did not face much resistance.		My squad was teamed up with three others to infiltrate the city from the West, hoping the Northern Incursion would prove enough of a distraction for us to break in and disable some of their defences.		To be perfectly honest, once we were in the city walls we were scared shitless. Empty. Absolutely empty. We didn't know if they knew we were coming or what, but it made us nervous. It just wasn't right, you know? If it wasn't for the fact that we needed to stay silent, I reckon, heck, I know most of us would have been swearing. As I said, scared shitless. Our fears were almost confirmed when a group of American soldiers walked out of a building. We were dumb enough to be in the middle of the street. "CONTACT!" someone yelled and we all ran for cover while laying down covering fire. We had 60 men, they probably had 40, both sides had losses instantly as the street was filled with laser fire.		I dove behind a blockade just as a bolt singed my helmet. *Too close*, I thought. I looked beside me to see two more of our soldiers. One of them suggested we all stand up on the count of three and lay down some fire. We radioed across to the other side of the road to make sure they were ready with some grenades. We started counting. One. I positioned myself, ready to stand up. Two. Me and the soldier next to me's eyes met. I could see the fear in his eyes. Ha, sounds like something from a story book, but you try fighting in a war. Three. We all stood up, rifles blazing. The Americans were caught off-guard, thinking most of us had been killed and the rest fleeing. A few were downed instantly, while the others tried to fire back. Without taking my finger off the trigger, I looked to my right, across the road. As I had hoped, the soldiers were standing up, grandes held high and ready to throw. They did, very accurately. The end result was almost all the Americans in the group being killed, a fair number more when most of the roof they were next to collapsed. Ion grenades will do that, you know.		But I wasn't celebrating. Aside from a quick glance to see the result, I was still looking right. Our soldiers were taking cover next to an alley, and to my horror I saw four figures moving through the shadows, guns raised, towards our troops. I shouted, *NOO!!*, trying to bring my rifle in time to fire back. My fears were confirmed when the figures' guns flashed, lighting up their uniforms; their **American** uniforms. All our soldiers in front of them were razed instantly. Luckily another one of us had seen them, too, up the street, and as soon as they left the alley they were gunned down by him and myself.		I ran over to the limp bodies on the ground. There was no chance they were alive – they were all direct hits, but I had hope all the same. False hope. And the costs of the war hit me full on.		I had been mostly insensitive to it, but I was overcome with the sudden realisation that these men laid their lives down in the false hope that there might be a winner in this war. It sounds stupid coming from a soldier, I mean, what do I know about it? But that is honestly what I thought. Perhaps it determined my actions later that day.		After regrouping we continued pushing through the city. There was no time, nor intentions largely, to mourn losses, but I paid my own silent tribute. We eventually met up with the Northern Incursion Force, and were tasked with spreading out through the city to eliminate any remaining enemy forces. My squad and one other was assigned to go East. We were go to the very outskirts of town until we were at the wall, and then to come return. Shoot to kill.		We were approaching the wall and had only found three stray soldiers thus far. We were looking forward to the idea of turning around when we came across an old looking mansion with American soldiers outside. We instantly took cover but it was too late and they had seen us. One of them ran inside, *probably sent for reinforcements* I thought, and immediately reached for my Targetor. Hmm? Oh, yeah, it’s a device that lets us target something to be taken out from afar. I targeted this building while the other soldiers fired on the Americans. A green light came on on my Targetor – target confirmed. I released the switch, and a few moments later missiles came raining from sky, coming from our new outpost in the city centre. It was perfect timing, too, as more personnel were emerging from the building.		The mansion was razed instantly, of course. I think every soldier was killed in the blast, too. My troops and I waited for any signs of movement, and after there was none for a few minutes, we moved in for a closer look. There were a handful of survivors, and we were quick to disarm and apprehend them. But there was one who caught my attention. He was out cold, but certainly alive, pretty standard in every way, except he wore a white lab coat.		I assigned a few soldiers to stay hidden with me and guard our prisoners, while the rest of the group finished the sweep. They met us on their way back after an uneventful walk. I had managed to wake the scientist up, but couldn’t get anything out of him. We then began the walk back to the city centre where the rest of our companies would probably be waiting.		You’d say that was uneventful, would you? Well, I suppose so would I. Except for one thing. During his sleep the scientist was muttering something about an end. **The** end. What do you mean *To what?* – to this! To this war! An end to the war... Huh, unlikely if you ask me. But I had hope, all the same.","depth":1,"score":37,"ups":37,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ProfSmiles","name":"t1_c4zkg2a","parent_id":"t1_c4zifc3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339542462,"created_utc":1339513662}

Controversial expert Áedan Byrne was hired on to investigate the nature of the text, and his rough translation is as follows.		==		THE GREAT STRUGGLE CONTINUES! 		Our brothers and sisters fight on the front lines, our heroic civil corps construct roads larger than anything that existed before! Strong weapons of steel and flame churn victory for our revolution, crushing the petulant Vikings and the sour-souled Americans! Watch as they struggle to rebuild their ruins and farmlands! 		Our war is as ancestral as it is eternal! Our father's grandfathers marched in American lands, uniting the common worker and man under a Celtic flag! Our workers are the envy of all craftsman in the diseased Viking swamps! 		They challenge us with fanaticism and theocracy! We defeat them with weapons of destruction and burn their armies into the Earth! We have outgrown the simple belief systems of Gods and cherished the plight of the common man in our age of strife and dismay!		Long live the Celts! Long live our Revolution! Victory is but a short month away, my brothers, my sisters! Long live the idea of peace! When the war is over, our armies shall cast aside their weapons and work with the common man in rebuilding our world to her former glory!		The swamps shall be cleared, replaced with arcadian farmlands! The radioactive wastes cursed upon us by our vile enemies will be cleaned and replaced with vibrant cities like in the texts of old! 		No longer shall our children starve because of the decadent and foolish bourgeois enemy! No longer shall we see our once beautiful countrysides rot and waste away with our wives and daughters!		Stand with your brothers! Stand with the workers! Stand and fight the enemy! Only if we all work together can we finally end this righteous war!		We shall conquer and unite the worker of the world under our communal banner! We shall rebuild this world! We shall return to prosperity! 		==			The expert was criticized for his poor translation and voluntarily elected for reeducation. In an act sure to inspire his brothers, Dr. Byrne has enlisted and is currently fighting bravely against the American and Viking enemy.  Remember, the educated do make mistakes, and the possibility of war of our ancestors a THOUSAND years ago is absolute drivel.

{"body":"Thanks for sharing your Civ II gaming experience.  I am a long time player of Civ II, while I've tried Civs 3, 4 and 5 - I find Civ II to be the best.		I downloaded your saved game and in two nights of play, I was able to get things turned around in your favour.  Here are my tips:				Beginning the game…		I am the Celtic nation	Americans are strong and they are my Ally	Vikings are strong and an enemy	Incas are weak and also an enemy			Goal:		1) Don’t piss off the Americans (your Ally) as I see a two front war as suicidal.  		• Don’t totally wipe out the Incas, let them keep at least one city and then make peace.	• Don’t make peace with the Vikings when the Americans (your ally) are at war with them.	• Halt the use of any existing nuclear weapons			2) Attack the Vikings in a non-nuclear, non-conventional method I call “Funding the Insurgents”		• We will require gold to fund the insurgents, spies to deliver the gold and transports to deliver the spies.	• Switch your government to Fundamentalism to keep your people from rioting and causing a civil disturbance, it also helps your cash flow – required to fund the insurgents (who are the pissed off Viking people). 	• Stop all production of nuclear weapons, city improvements, have all your cities make armor.			Funding the Insurgents : Step 1 – Rattle the Cage		• Begin building transports in costal cities like Hieraconpolis that are close to the Vikings as well as Spies in any cities connected by railroads to those coastal cities.	• With a spy in a transport and a couple thousand gold, look for small cities like Trondheim.  It all must happen in one move, your spy should go directly to the city from the transport.  Select the bottom option – “incite a revolt” 	• Take advantage of the Viking Railroad system to first cause revolts in cities furthest away.  This is important as Viking units will ‘take to the surrounding city areas’ – we don’t want to block any future Spy movement.	• Once you take over a city sell one of the improvements to recoup your Coup d'état expenses.  The more money you get the better, the more useless the improvement the better.  Every turn you hold on to the city repeat the improvement selling.	• The Vikings will be successful in liberating some of their cities.  They will fill them full of new troops to defend the city.  Feel free to incite a revolt once again, and now those troop are yours.	• Eventually the Vikings will begin running low on troops to liberate their cities and they will change their government to a Democracy.  You cannot incite a revolt in a civilization with this type of government (in this game).  This completes the first step of the Viking down fall.		Attack the Viking Capitals: Step 2 – Chase His Government		• The Vikings cannot maintain a Democracy for very long, it’s just too expensive and their people are going to begin rioting.  They’ve still got a lot of fight in them, but this is the beginning of the end. 	• You could make peace with them, but don’t.  It will piss off the Americans who are your ally and still at war with the Vikings and you cannot afford a war on two fronts.  The Vikings can’t be trusted; sooner or later they will knife you in the back, they best solution is to conquer them.	• Save your gold and try your best to hold on to as many Viking cities as possible.  	• Continue to sell the unless city improvements, you should also consider doing this in your pre-existing cities too.	• Put together a conventional army of heavy tanks, use them to attack the Viking capital city.  After you capture it the Vikings instantly move their capital, chase their government and attack the new capital.  Always try to avoid attacking Viking units unless unavailable – as each Viking unit outside a city make another citizen unhappy and unproductive.	• In the year 4011 the Viking civilization was destroyed by the Celts, we have 20,180,000 people and 2,576 gold.	• Somewhere along the way I took over 3 of the 4 Inca cities and made peace with them.			Reaching for Space: Step – Rebuilding the Earth		• Many of the cities make a huge number of shields but have a small population, I decided to start the space race and I built a complete spaceship and it arrived at Alpha Century in the year 4046.	• For the cities with enough wheat I built new settlers, we are very slowly changing the land back to pastures, I automate them all as I don’t like to micromanage.	• I stayed allied to the Americans thought the game and the Inca and I have never broken our peace treaty.  While I have many Spy’s at the ready and attack plans drawn up, I will not initiate war on my peaceful neighbours as I don’t play that way.","depth":0,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ryeman66","name":"t1_c67tisy","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1347606581,"created_utc":1347577781}

{"body":"Life long Civ 2 player here. 		Here's what you do:		*Switch to fundamentalism. 		*Stop attacking so that your enemies can rebuild their infrastructure.		*Build a city close to your front line and buy an SDI first. This will protect your front line units from being nuked. 		*Sell your libraries/universities/research labs 		*Once this is done, switch all your cities over to rebuilding in this order:		-Temple		-Granary		-ENGINEER		-Colosseum		-Marketplace		-Cathedral		-harbor		-ENGINEER		-Stock exchange		-Factory/Manufacturing/Recycling/Solar  		-Military (Walls, Baracks, etc.)		*Once you've rebuilt all your cities, begin manufacturing howitzers only. Send all of these to one city. Preferably the city closest to the nearest enemy. Hopefully, this city is within 6-7 spaces of the target enemy city.		*Once you have 100+ howitzers, build an equal amount of transports, in the same city.		*Once you have enough transports, bring in all your engineers. 		*Next turn, land on your enemy's city, bring in all howitzers and engineers. Take over his entire land mass in one turn to prevent counter attack. If he has multiple land masses, land on all of them at once. The benefit of not attacking him will be that they have begun laying down roads that your engineers (50-60) will be able to build on to ease the howitzers across cities. A good rule of thumb is 10 howitzers per city. 		Good luck and Spaghetti Monster Speed		EDIT: Formatting	EDIT: Here's another tip, let each city build for one turn so it pops on some shields. Then buy whatever you're building.

Imagine when you've fought for so long and nuclear wasteland all around you that generation after generation after generation of suffering and war, people just forget what ever Peace means. Maybe they just fight because they've always fight. 		I can see the rulers of the 3 empires thinking the same way you just mentioned "Fuck them, they always break the ceasefire like clockwork" NUKE EM!!!. 		I'm just incredibly impressed by your determination and this awesome project that you're worked on for 10 years!

{"body":"Man, this is worse then 1984. It's like this:		Take 1984, get in some WH40K grimdark, and FallOut (of course), and combine those. Now, put this cocktail in a microwave oven for an hour and you get this game.		Or, as a possible war scene would be:		There were nothing stopping those Celts, dressed in varying shades of green, from attacking his hometown, Wounded Knee, it seemed. Wave after wave of enemy infantrymen, tanks and helis approached the city like a massive starved beast looking to feast on some well-needed food. It was the offensive tactic that he had seen in so many campaigns - humanity's goverments no longer saw men as men, only as tools for the War.  		He and his fellow American comrades, all what he saw as believing and true Christians, were ready to defend as the soldiers commanded shouted over the rusty megaphone "Fire the artillery, now!"		He soon heard thunderous noises emitting from the inside of the small city as artillery shell after artillery shell fired from the Pachtton cannons hit the advancing wave. Not that it stopped the Celts one bit as the wave came closer to the city. 		He had been fighting in this war since he was a child, due to official American policy. He was a veteran of similar charges, so the thoughts running in his mind were that if he survived, he would fight another day for America, the President and God. If he died, he would go to heaven. Nothing would stop him from killing in the name of defending his hometown.		The Celtic mass soon enough, not disturbed by the artillery barrages clashed with the American defense, and it was all man-to-man. It was all knife-to-knife, gun-to-gun combat as neither side were willing to use heavier weaponry. Only the Holy Order of American Engineers (and similar Orders in Viking and Celt lands) knew how to build houses anymore, and no one was willing to destroy what few available resources were left - good trees were scarce, after all.		As he slashed and shot his way against his Celtic opponents, something hit him. Undettered, he kept fighting on, despite the gaping wound in his left knee. Amongst this carnage, there was nothing stopping him. Almost all of his forefathers had fought in the War in ages past, why should he stop?		And just as he was back on his feet, he was shot in the neck. A friendly fire - as the soldier collapsed and died, still clutching his knife and rifle. No one would remember his name as the battle for Wounded Knee continued to rage. Official American accounts would not list the casualities from friendly fire. 		And in this world, as the War continues, humanity's hopes are all long gone, claimed by the swamps and the wastelands. The goverments are on the brink of disaster, food for the day for ordinary humans are something that only dreams can conjure, and the Golden Age of Technology are now just a very distant memory.		This world has now gone so far that official American Christianity has intentionally confused the legendary General Patton with Jesus Christ. If the War ever ends, no one will see it as a peace. The population of the world will only see it as a declaration of war against the War.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SKX31","name":"t1_c500imq","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339625076,"created_utc":1339596276}

I'm sorry Lycerius, but it looks like you're the most powerful nation with control of most most of the map, yet you're still unable to end the misery and suffering.  Perhaps your secretly holding back because you enjoy the power and control that this war brings you?

{"body":"You've mentioned you have SDI in place, you have the max techs on all sides.  In games I've played in the past I've focused forces entirely into Tanks and Stealth Fighters supported by spies on land, and built Carrier groups with Helo's and stealth fighters on deck with Aegis escorts and a few transports filled with spies and tanks to follow.  (every turn you have to run fighters out in all directions to sub/spy hunt.  If you can use spies to bribe any incoming spies/units)  Of note you can use spies from transports to do this to enemy ships, just get the transport by the ship and activate the spy.  I also use spies on barbarian uprisings to bolster city units quickly.  I also disband those barbarian units to speed up tank/plane production.  In your core cities you should be able to move your bribed troops fairly quickly over rail and be sure to set their home city to keep the people happy if you don't disband them into more advanced units.  Your coastal cities should be you're largest producers because they are harder to pollute and easier to clean.		In a Scenario like this one I would throw all I have at one enemy capital at a time.  If I remember large empires in Civ have a chance to splitting into Civil War creating two enemies but weakening the greater one.  In turn you may gain an ally in the fight.  If you have SDI in place the perimeter of your cities should be defensible under it's shield.  Since you are using primarily tanks (3 moves per turn) you can kill rail between your outer fringe cities and your core inner cities.  Focus on getting the core cities back up to full, happy citizens set your luxuries at about 30% take science down to 0 since it's a waste of funds and put the remainder into the remaining production bracket.  You can always bump luxuries up to 40% if needed, happy people are productive ones.  I always push for Democracy if possible, spies are less effective against you.  On your outer fringes make sure only roads lead into your areas, and forests around them if you can terraform, this forces spies to use up their moves just getting to you and you can expel them back to their capital using helo patrols.  You basically need to limit their ability to access your core heartland and rebuild your main cities.  If you can get democracy up and running and get get the money flowing in big, use spies to bribe enemy spies that approach and use those spies to subvert smaller cities.  If you have the pyramids, sell your granaries and also sell the granaries of any city you subvert or conquer.  If you don't have the pyramids, you need to capture that city if the wonder still exists.  The key basic structures in any captured city should be SDI, Walls, and airport.  Once you have an airport use it to fly tanks (1 turn at a time) into the city to bolster it.  Also part 4-5 stealth fighters in the city to run patrols for spy hunting.  After that focus on building it's people needs, use the other cities to supply troops via air and or rail if you build it.  If you build proper defenses, you are fine if the enemy attacks first, if anything it forces them to over extend.  If you run vigilant air patrols and keep your cities properly buffered and keep units in the cities.  Stealth fighters are powerful and expendable, use them on a defense until they crash or are shot down.  You can kill 3-4 more units per unit if you don't fly them home again.  		Another trick I used to use when capturing cities is to use spies to subvert the the partisan units and pull them into the city defense freeing up my tank to roll further while also approaching for peace.  Never declare war, let them attack you, they will always offer peace and buy you time after they lose enough.  Never leave a stack of units on an open square always park them on hills and preferably into fortresses.  Use engineers to lead the way when possible.  If you're lucky you capture the city with SDI intact, if so park as many units as you can in that city until you can prep the next attack.  		Still going for the Capital with a carrier group and Helo's is usually the primary strike.  Since you will probably lose the units in battle or to nukes anyways, I will usually send my stealth fighters on 1 way trips, they attack until they crash or are shot down.  believe it or not it actually bolsters morale since that city is no longer supporting a unit far from home.  Seems like I was able to stack somewhere close to 20 units on a carrier back when I played, and sometimes would use two carrier strike forces, usually on opposite coasts so I could fly over and still have a friendly deck to land on if for some reason I was not kamakazing them.		So there you have it.  Build up your core, build large attack groups, focus on core power units, rule the air and strike at your opponent's heart and pray for a Civil War.  Push for Democracy and they will not be able to outproduce your industry.  Keep people happy and use luxuries as much as you can to keep them happy.  Also micro manage your cities along those lines as well, up taxes just enough and setup entertainers (Elvi)to keep your people rocking.  And be very vigilant of your borders, do not give your enemy a rail line in and expel any spies spotted from the air before they can get close enough to plant a nuke.  I will download the game when I get in from work and see if I can pull it off as well.

{"body":"Well as it turns out I tried that initially, but didn't realize the cities were in such bad shape starting out so until I could get the Vikings in Check I had to use fundamentalism to bolster my numbers.  I played largely defensive, let them throw what they had at me and deplete their forces.  I stockpiled cash and built spies.  Every time they would break the ceasefires, I would hope I could defend and in most cases I was able to then I'd follow up by taking a city using a spy, if I had the money and spies I'd take 2.  As soon as they lose ground they would talk up a cease fire.  As that went on they kept getting weaker and weaker.  I never could get them to commit to a peace treat, it would appear you pist them off pretty good.  Once they were defeated though I changed over to democracy, I've managed not to pick a fight with the Americans and I've just completed my purchase of the Souix.  You did mention didn't just want to win, so while I slowly take the Americans one town at a time, I am cleaning up the years of radioactive pollution and attempting to the turn the cities back into the large powerhouses.  If I can get all the pollution in check I can start terraforming and gettign things back to normal.  But my first couple turns I spent all the gold on making Barracks, then Harbors and then offshore platforms.  Without Barracks you can't make decent troops and the cities can't repair them.  Harbors for food and platforms for shields, so for about 5-10 years I was playing defense and rebuilding infrastructure.  Also allying with the Americans allowed me to finish the Vikings.  By the time I'm done there should be no more global warming and the Americans will be too small to be a threat and the Celtic empire will control the map and have repaired the world.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Blackhawk99x","name":"t1_c5170sy","parent_id":"t1_c506cmi","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339832279,"created_utc":1339803479}

The Celts now run under a Democratic government and although they are not as rich or as powerful as the Americans yet, we are at peace and our cities are growing.

{"body":"I posted this before on Reddit I think but let me tell you the best game of CIV 4 I ever had or a small time frame of it. Sorry for wall of text and you will probably not understand half of it unless you play civ. Also forgive my spelling grammar I kinda got tired and was just free rolling from memory it was an epic game though.		The year is not really that important because CIV games technological rates are dependent on many things. Technically speaking we are probably in the 1960's. No one has stealth tech yet.		There are 3 super powers sharing a continent. One 3rd world nation holding a continent to its self (ZULU) and 2 other civs that lag behind on tech sharing another content (Aztecs and Egyptians) .		Celts (Myself) A Democratic state with free religion holding 1/4 on the far left side of the northern continent. It is also the homeland of the worlds most popular religion Judaism) My state was previously a theocracy but due to United nations vote I was encouraged to intact free religion. My military is arguably the most powerful I have more Nuclear weapons than the Russians and I can also hit there city using attacks from Submarines. My navy is second to none. My army is however much smaller than the Russians.		I border a similar sized nation of similar wealth and technology America. They control the United nations through election but I house it in my second city. The Americans are the 3rd most powerful nation with a military half the sized of myself, they do not have nuclear weapons but are capable of producing them. They are also democracy with all the most liberal options and it was there first vote at UN that made me drop my Theocracy.		To the Americans right are the Russians who's country is slightly bigger than both American and celts(me) land. They are communist police state. They are pretty much communist Russia massive yet backwards. They have a massive regular army which they love placing all along the American border. Massive air force which they waste countless minutes to recon over America every turn and also nuclear weapons.		All three super powers have fought in the past before nuclear weapons but since the modern era things have been peacefull with well established borders. 		The Americans are friendly to me and the Russians but have an open border with myself and a defence pack. 90% of my army is stationed along the Russian/America border and 90% of my airforce is based in American cities too defend them encase Russia attacks.		It is clear that a war between me and the Russians would be Armageddon with neither side going to achieve anything kinda like OP's situation. It is too late for religious victory so my only options are space race or diplomatic victory because even taking the other civs lands would not give me land area or population victory because Russia is too big. 		I decide to win by UN vote even though I don't control the council I have the perfect plan to do so. I know Russia will never vote for me and will always vote for itself like wise I will do the same for voting for myself but I know America and the other civs could be bought.		So I start getting sweet with America accepting there trades with out bartering for better deals. I give my extra shitty food resources to the Zulu and bring them up to the industrial age in technology which wins them over.		I do the same for both the Egyptians and the Aztecs. I get voted into the UN and my first vote is to elect me as winner but sadly I do not get enough votes with pretty much every one abstaining except me and the Russians.		I Think no biggy lets just wait till these gifts start swaying them and I'll use my UN votes to force resolutions that bring us together, freedom of speech ect. Which the Russians defy which is good because it makes peeps hate them including America. SO I decide to change the other civs views by asking them and gifting them shit when they do which works. So we all have the same types of liberalish governments.		So roll on my vote ''yeah I'm gonna win'' everyone votes for me except the freaking Aztec wtf. Worse still the Aztec declare war and invade Egypt that turn, WTF again. So I decide to send a ''peace keeping'' force to Egypt and capture some Aztec city's until they surrender. My advanced navy and marines make mince meat of the Aztec army, establishing air bases in Egypt to bomb the crap out of the Aztec my marines quickly destroy all Aztec resistance they surrender and become a vassal state.		Roll on next election ''For sure its in the bag'' everyone votes for me except Russia naturaly and the freaking Aztec! WTF WTF I FUCKING OWN YOU SHITS.		Worse still I can't wipe them out they have surrendered it's just not possible, you can't undo the vassal unless they choose to. SO I'm like ahh games bugged dev error or someshit no way to win but then I realise I can win I simply need to de-legitimise there nation and create my own from there citys.		So I form Plan Israel. (no fucking joke I decide that to win I must make Israel who will of course support my UN vote)		I decide to make my new nation from captured Aztec cities renaming them Tel Aviv, Jerusalem ect. I even convert them to Judaism because I still gt gold for every Jewish city.		I provide Israel with everything it could desire I giver her 200 gold each turn I built loads of buildings in the city before I founded the state. (My plan is that Israel will declare war on the Aztec and wipe them out giving me the UN majority that I need [Israel is voting in support of me at the UN]).		Slowly Israel is taking over the Aztec cities through cultural absorption. I keep giving the Israeli cash to build cultural achievements.		I also demand every single piece of resource crap the Aztecs have knowing fine well that if they refuse the vassal state contract will be broken and I can bomb them to shit. I also discover that I can put large amounts of coin into sabotage against them and send like 30 spies to destroy every road, farm, building they have.		Finally the Israeli declare war against them but they are fucking useless and even manage to lose a city to the Aztec, WTF I gave you advanced military and you fail hard you dam cowards! After somehow losing a 3 turn war the Israeli make peace with the Aztec but then shortly after anoter wave of me now sending spies to destroy anything of value in the captured Israeli city the Aztecs break the vassal contract I march in wipe them out giving all there city to Israel. Israel who loves me ''+10 you granted us our independence and gave us citys''		All the while Egyp looks on not giving a shit so funny. Well anyway on the next UN vote I won.		In Short to win at CIV I had to become evil and support a rouge state as it wipes out another.

It's so simple -- just surrender to one enemy (say, the vickings) while putting all your strength into a last batlle against the other (the americans). 	If I understand the game correctly, you should be out of the board quickly, and the vickings should then be able to take over America.

{"body":"I have been playing Civ 2 ever since it was released. I agree that you need to consolidate a core few cities and fix them with engineers. The outer cities are a buffer zone for the war. Go on a defensive, let the vikings expend energy attacking while you build up the revenge. 		But you have two main problems:	1. Most of the pollution is in Viking controlled teritory. It is possible to stop the global warming but you have to clear up all the pollution including that inside enemy territory.	2. Your supply lines are really really long. Your army has to move too far from your main cities to where your enemy is. Including bad ocean crossings where the army ends up sat on the shore for a while.		These two problems are wrapped in to one. Sort out the supply lines and you will be able to conquer the vikings and clean up the pollution. And then everything else is much easier. To do this you need to sort a few things out. 	1. Build coastal cities to move your army using transports between continents seamlessly. No military unit should EVER be left outside a city (or SDI defense is gone and they will get nuked or otherwise destroyed). Particularly you need a city north of edinborough near thebes. Build it 3 squares north of edinborough, that way any SDI defense in Edinborough will protect the new city and it can't be nuked on being built. Critically it is also within 7 sea squares of thebes so you can move units across in one turn. That is the big whole in your supply line and will allow you to strike quickly at the core viking cities. 	2. Get rid of all bombers, nukes, military ships etc they are too expensive and not effective enough. Build only howitzers, mech inf, transports, and engineers. They are the cheapest units and are also the most effective when used properly. Howitzers destroy cities, mech inf defend them, transports and engineers get the attack units to cities instantly. 	3. Build an enormous store of howitzers and mech inf and have them primed and ready to go. Hiding behind an inpentrable defense way away from the front line. Then when ready (100 howitzers, 100 mech inf or so and enough transports c.25 to move them to cities linked with railroads to the enemy in one turn) then you strike. And you take all of the major enemy cities in one turn.  		Also presumably you know that leaving a spy in a city is defense against spies planting nuclear devices. So you should have one in each of your cities alongside the usual SDI, city wall, coastal frotress, SAM battery defense. 		Oh yeah and you should definitely be in fundamentalism until this is sorted. Communism just won't cut it. Once you have extra cash you can start bribing enemy cities to convert using a small army of spies too. It will help mop up the outlying cities that are difficult to get a full army to.

{"body":"I played a scenario one time that started with a single settler on a earth map, which has a pollution in every square. If I remember correctly, tundra does not turn into swamp, so that is where you want to settle, preferably coastal cities, since sea tiles still yield 2 food, 2 trade and 1 shield, even if the earth warms up a million times. That should give a massive production bonus over all size 1 and 2 inland cities. 		Furthermore, to stem the flood of tanks, switch to fundamentalism, start cracking out mechs (and maybe some fanatics) create a defensive perimeter around your cities with swamp (or mountain) forts, close enough to the SDI's to prevent them from being nuked, and make sure that the defensive line is closed, so no spy can get through. AI's usually will send everything they have against your line, but breaking through with tanks vs. swamp fort mech's shouldnt happen. The tithes from Funda should bring on some nice extra cash for now.		So then you will get time to work on a plan to finish the game. It depends on what you want to do. If you want to crush the opposition, build up your industry again, and start churning out stealth bombers, howitzers etc. until youre ready to blitz the enemy.		If you want to restore the planet and return to peace: stop nuking with spies, it gives -99 attitude (and I think -7 = max reputationloss, giving despicable rep), so it keeps the AI's at enraged level, making peace impossible. if you do that, and stop sneak attacking, just keeping bottled up behind your defensive line, peace should be possible again, in say 200 turns or so (until your rep gets back to -3 I guess). In the mean time, start cleaning up pollution (farming is useless until you can stop global warming from happening every few turns.) It depends a lot of the AI cleaned up its territory a bit, but I guess not if you constantly nuked them. If you stop, they should start doing that, if you attain peace with them, you can start helping them and you can start farming again, etc. etc.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"leenverkade","name":"t1_c5011uu","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339627600,"created_utc":1339598800}

Because they are in your territory they won't heal as fast making it easier for you to destroy the stack of doom. Again being in your territory he also won't be able to reinforce his stack. 		After that you need to assess the situation can you counter attack did you destroy enough of his units to take a city? Or maybe just enough to raze on? Or use the time to build up a larger stack of doom to use later. 		But try to stay defensive keeping your stacks out of site and away from boarders so they are harder to nuke. It is a war of attrition so conserve your troops and only attack when you know you can win. Destroying a city hurts his production giving you and edge in number of troops eventually allowing you to actually keep some of the cities giving you a production edge over the third guy.  			another very risky strategy is to give away cities to one enemy so you only have a front against that one enemy allowing you to take some of his cities in another area.

{"body":"The same scenario happened to me but on an adjusted ww2 map. I removed the turn limits since 4 years was not enough and I made Spain a playable character (me). I was making ground and made a spear/shield army. Shield=mobile infantry, Spear=Howitzers. I only had a few tanks just for pillaging raids and to eliminate weakened defeated soldiers. I had conquored france and most of north africa. I was doing well with one exception: Russia.		If anyone had ever played this map before, you know, once Russia builds railroads to connect her empire, the game is almost done. With rods you get a few turns delay for resupply, enough to make ground, but with near instant transport with so many cities, they can spam you to death with guerrillas. I was at war with everyone and Germany was easy enough to destroy but they were my buffer against Russia. So, I devised a plan and it is to this day my best war stratagy I ever came up with.		I made peace with England. I needed the seas and I couldn't do so with constant air attack from the island. And I made transports. Lots and lots of transports. And, to cover the stacks, three battleships and the AEGIS crusiers. I made three navy stacks and loaded my entirer army into them and sailed to the Baltic. Once I got there, I lost one stack to a nuke. Most of the army survived and in just one turn after landing, I cut a swath of destruction strait to Moscow and took it, then my whole army was wiped out next turn. 		I had won though. When you take a capital in some scenarios, civil war can break out and from where there was one nation, there are now two locked into a permanent war, at least, I think its permanent, I never saw them peace. Russia split. Now China was on the map and Russian and it are nuking the bejeezus out of each other. Germany is making ground in the east and England dropped the treaty with me and is bombing Paris. I am losing Italy to Germany and have already lost Amsterdam. I have no army so I am stalling until I can rebuild. Then comes Global warming. What follows was 100 turns of hell.		Just like in your scenario, everything turns to swamp. I manage to keep a few roads out of Spain but for the most part, my Europe holdings are lost. England and I do well since we have a majority of ocean cities. I go communist, just like you, so does England. The mainland empires go Theocratic. I still have my Mediterranean holdings and they help my cities survive the fundy unit onslaught. I have no idea the battle raging in the east but I think China is winning since they have only one war front. With all roads protected with a dedicated mobile infantry unit on every road plot, I can bring in howitzers. Without roads, I falter. It ends in a stalemate. I didn't play it for 10 years, but honestly man, thinking back, I wish I did. Kudos to you man. I haven't thought about this great game in awhile.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"2Mobile","name":"t1_c4zoel2","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339557430,"created_utc":1339528630}

{"body":"A few main tips for what I did in late-game war:		Build rail.  It takes (I think) 8 engineers to built railroad in a square in one turn.  If the square has no roads, that's ten engineers.		Use the rail to drive artillery.  Use only one of the artillery's moves in attack each turn.  Take it home to a "safe" city after the one attack.		You'll find a sweet spot city *without* SDI that's close to another that *has* SDI.  This sweet spot, let's call it "bait" is what the enemy will try to nuke.  Place enough units in there to lure the nukes.		Utilize the artillery to soften a city.  If you can't take it in one turn; don't.  When you capture the city, don't garrison it with very many units *unless* it has SDI.  It could end up as your new bait city.		Every turn, your priority should be to kill any enemy units in the field.  Artillery is your friend.  *But keep the artillery on the rails.*  Period.		After the enemies in the field are dead, soften cities.  		There will be friendly cities that they know they can't nuke (SDI) and are heavily garrisoned.  Let them break their teeth on these cities.  Punish the survivors with your artillery.  Don't leave your own toys out in the yard to be stepped on.

{"body":"There are environmental consequences to nukes still; it's just not that anymore.  Civ5 is substantially more detailed than Civ2 is, but since it's less detailed than Civ4, fans have a pretty weird misunderstanding of it.		Two points of interest.		One, Civ2 had two expansions and decades of mods/scenarios.  Civ4, the one they're remembering, had four expansions and has now seven years of mods and scenarios, plus it was the first civ to ship high quality modding tools and assets.		Civ5 is about to get its first expansion next week, and is long delayed because its first year was plagued with software problems.  Compared to the others it's a very young game.		Two, the other thing you need to understand is why Civ5 is so much smaller of a game.  It's the first Civ that Sid Meier wasn't at the helm of.  There are some pretty big rule system changes, and it's this designer's first major title.  He moved small, he cut (knowing he could add later,) and he made some incisions.		Yes, new-ish Civ5 is rather simpler than 4 in its end state.  (It's way more complex than 2.)		There is a *major* upside to his choices to cut, though: the various strategies available to a player take roughly the same amount of time.		Old civs were very difficult on multiplayer because certain strategies would leave one player taking several minutes longer per turn than everyone else.  Also, if one player had a dominant advantage, their time per turn scaled with how winning they were, which meant people who were losing also had to sit still for several minutes frequently, which made for unhappy gamers.		This new Civ, whereas it's less satisfying *so* *far* in single player, is actually quite a bit better in multiplayer, because it's cut so much micromanagement, so everyone finishes their turn within 60 seconds or so of one another, except once in a while when someone makes great big changes.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"StoneCypher","name":"t1_c4zj8vs","parent_id":"t1_c4zihed","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339536800,"created_utc":1339508000}

{"body":"DonutEF's plan would work well. However the time to build the engineers and reform your land would indeed be a little daunting. I have another suggestion.		Stage 1:		You say that the stalemate exists because any conventional forces that make any progress get nuked right? So what you could do is make a chain of cities from your front line to wherever you want to attack first. Found another city on the edge of an existing city, just within the protection of the SDI defence. Then build only defence appropriate structures (ie baracks, city wall and SDI defence). It will be more of a forward outpost or fortress rather than a functioning city. Load it chalk full of mobile infantry and tanks etc. Also maintain and move your frontline forward, idealy air tight so no spy's can sneak through and nuke your forward city. Rinse and repeat. 		Side note: To attempt a sure chance that you will conquer a city, bulid one of these "forts" either right outside the boundry of an enemy city (so your units can be SDI protected while being next to or close to an enemy city); or even within an enemy cities borders (though im not sure what sort of stance you have standing with your foes, if it is anything but war i think they will ask you to remove units from the vicinity and thus it wont be possible).		Stage 2:		You will have to have build a rediculously large arsenal of howitzers at this point, i would say 100+. Once you have turtled your way to their front lines, start sending in the howitzers. It is imperetive that there be an unbroken railroad connection to your first target. Howitzers have 2 actions possible per turn right? So simply send in a Howitzer, use 1 action to attack, it will almost surely destroy the target its attacking, then retreat it back to the safety of the closest SDI defended position. Rinse and repeat until you run out of howitzers. Worst case scenario you destroy close to 100 enemy units without losing many howitzers. With enough repetitions you will out produce your enemy until you can consistently hold cities. 		Side note: when you conquer a city it seems a random amount of city improvements will be left behind, if the sdi defence is still standing you can make that your forward outpost, have 10+ mech infantry ready to move in and defend and build a city wall and buy the completion that turn. (Im sure you've realised but disbanding a unit from within the city view, while it's in the city will give you 50% of the shields it cost to make. Disbanding a useless unit, or at least an expendable one will vastly reduce the amount it costs to force complete a city improvement).		Continue until victory. 		I haven't played nearly as far into the future as you have but due to the cities being in ruins and the length of the conflict, the enemy army can't be SO large so within 2 or 3 turns you should be able to just conquer half of their cities in 1 turn. 		Depending on the production possibilities of your cities, reforming the land to increase production may be necessary to build the amount of units you would need. So DonutEF's strat would likely come into play.		Hope this is clear enough :S And I just want to say this is an amazing post. Im SO going to dig up my old civII saves and check them out :)","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sage_006","name":"t1_c4zmx2o","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339551892,"created_utc":1339523092}

Use this alliance to smite the remaining enemy, you can't count on your ally pitching in much until the enemy is weakened so try to save up units in cities and wait. When the time is ripe let out all your units from your cities, kind of like all those meddlesome midgets coming out from under that big ladies dress in the nutcracker. If you stagger your enemy that should be incentive for your ally to pitch in for garbage time (two front war, yeeeah buddy). You can also try inciting revolts to weaken and then take cities or simply build new cities (and buy Sdi units ASAP) simply to advance your line. Oh and try to comitt a good amount of your forces to air units, their range will help you take out relief units behind the front line.  I love this game, good luck and god speed.

{"body":"I doubt if the people in this world even have any concept of "peace" anymore.  The idea that the world could exist in anything other than a constant state of war and nightmarish suffering is probably as impossible to them as the idea of utopia is to us.  There are probably cults that talk about how the war could end if everybody would simply stop fighting, or if one nation would sacrifice itself.

{"body":"OK, you have two major issues that need to be resolved.  First your land is useless.  Second you have aggressive untrustworthy neighbors with no compunction for using nukes.  		Looking at your map I would say it's time to resettle some of your cities near whale resources which provide a lot of food and sheilds relative to anything else you have available and target enemy cities near mountains, hills and whales with nukes early and often when they declare war on you.  This should limit the enemy ability to generate new military units while simultaneously boosting your ability to rebuild your civilization.  		Secondly I would surround your most important cities with really junky units, (partisans, riflemen whatever is cheapest) this should hopefully minimize the amount of nuke planting that spies can do to your best cities.  This will also give cover to your engineers as they clean up the space around the city and try to improve the terrain.  I would simply pick one civilization that is the easiest for you to beat and simply attempt to wipe them off of the map.   (In your case that would be the Americans) Fight only defensive wars against the other civilization until the first one is finished.  At this point the only way to improve their diplomatic "feeling" towards you after so many treaty violations on both sides is to consistently fight one common enemy and to not declare war on them anymore.  Every time the Vikings declare war on the Americans, join in.  Every time the Americans declare war on the Vikings declare war on the Americans.   You have to find a way to shake up the dynamic so that hopefully you can come out with something like 60% of the eventually conquered American territory.		I see you have what is a lot of gold, I would use that to buy a lot of engineers, paratroopers and the occasional transport vessel.  Indeed land forces are overrated.  I would personally put a lot of effort into destroying every possible road that leads to you and the Vikings.  Let them march through the swamp.  This should slow up a lot of their armies and give you time to marshall your forces on the border if that is necessary to prevent an attack.  Focus your energies on bombers, paratroopers and alpine troops that can move quickly over roadless terrain and them make them attack you or take advantage of the tank's relative weakness on the defensive.  You may lose a lot, but it will slow them down and open them up to a lot of pounding with your air power.  You can often  detain an invading army using this tactic and make your stronger enemies sue for peace.  		Doing these things will hopefully simultaneously make the Vikings more apt to like you and less effective in harming you while you gain strength and prepare to take enough territory from the Americans and eventually the Vikings to prevent global warming kicking in every so often.  At this point the land can begin to heal and you can focus on building pollution decreasing improvements in your cities that are farther away from the front lines.  The healing will begin.  This will take a lot of time given the circumstances you have.  The land may never heal, but you can get out of the eternal hell of perpetual war you are playing with.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gaardian","name":"t1_c4znr2e","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339554988,"created_utc":1339526188}

{"body":"I once played a game of Civilization II where I decided to see what would happen if you pushed global warming to the extreme.  I polluted like crazy and then started multiple nuclear wars.  With the fallout in my own territory, I ignored it until climate change occurred.  Again and again, pushed way beyond what the designers intended.  I wanted to see how far it went.		In the beginning, change was gradual - a square would turn from grasslands to plains, from plains to desert.  I kept going.  It didn't happen near the pollution - it was random.  The rest of the world seethed, but could do nothing against my superior armies.  Eventually, the entire Earth became swamp, the worst possible land terrain.  Farms and mines were sunk, and people starved.  Every city in the world fell to 10,000 population.  Armies were disbanded due to lack of food.  Wars stopped due to lack of armies.  Buildings were sold due to lack of taxes.  A sea of swamp with tiny, powerless settlements dotting it here and there.  The world had ended.		But I cheated.  I kept a slave laborer and fed them nothing.		In Civ2, you could capture enemy workers - and they wouldn't have a home city that had to support them.  While I lost everything else, my one slave laborer sat waiting, until the last square became swamp.  		Then I began to drain the swamps and make good farmland.  My capital city began to rebuild itself.  Soon it was able to churn out more workers, and they cleared even more land.  I rebuilt buildings, created an army, but did not attack.  Soon my people outnumbered the rest of the world a hundred to one, and rising.  		Then I lost patience and took over the rest of the world with a single tank.

{"body":"Well, most of these have been said in some way, shape or form, but here's a few ideas.		1. Stabilise your cities with harbours and offshore platforms. Guaranteed food and production regardless of global warming, live off the sea.	2. Build engineers and clean up your mess (they're useful for something). The AI players will clean theirs up and after a century or so the melting icecaps cease. Know the rules. Only pollution squares count for global warming and it takes 9 pollution squares or more to initiate it. Even with more it takes a while.	3. Sit and rebuild. The current fortress position is easily defended. You can easily kill any viking land units with half a dozen bombers while they waste their bombers on fruitless attacks on defended cities. If you stop attacking and they can't find an easy target, they'll give up on nukes.	4. Sun Tzu: Avoid war. If it is necessary, achieve your objectives quickly so you don't wear the population out. When you're ready, launch short sharp campaigns. Clear the area with bombers, buy small cities and take the big ones with howitzers. The Viking cities have many buildings, they will be essential to fight the americans so the less casualties the better.	5. Sun Tzu again: Understand yourself, understand your enemy. The Vikings are aggressive, they will keep fighting so you will have to take them out first. The americans are expansionist, leave them alone and they will ally with you against the Vikings, just don't let them get too powerful, or aim to outgrow them.	6. Believe it or not, I actually recommend democracy as soon as the climate stabilises and you have a few engineers. Democracy allows faster population growth.		Well, I'm not going to win in 58 years but here's a story of long term strategy:	The celts hold firm in Hieracanopolis	After a century of war and engineers clearing the pollution, they stabilise the planet	A few daring raids and several viking cities fall in succession. They nuke one, but promptly lose it again.	The fledgling celtic republic arises, slims down its army and rebuilds while just holding the line.	A series of short campaigns then the Vikings begin to request peace treaties, which they promptly break. The americans ally against the vikings.	As the population grows, an army of engineers terraforms the celtic cities.	The celts usher in democracy and become the most populous race.	The Americans wipe out the Sioux and the last Viking city while the celts conqure the viking heartland, utilising captured cities and military forces to accelerate their campaigns. The viking cities are a veritable industrial powerhouse and boost the power of the celts.		And the real war begins....	The Celts strike first and within a decade, more than a dozen american cities fall, including the old viking island. (Every city the sneaky american former allies built to infiltrate the celtic heartlands fell in the first year).	The americans hit back hard with their superior military of over 500 units and the war lurches back and forth.	Damaging periods of revolution and battles are interspersed with peace to refill the coffers and patch up battle-worn bombers and artillery.	Sensing they are losing the advantage, the americans retaliate deep into the celtic heartland island cities with a volley of nukes and slam the recently lost old viking cities in the northeast, temporarily halting the celtic campaign and restoring equilibrium. Engineers swarm and the pollution clears. The celts diligently invest in SDI.	The advantage shifts back and forth around Ephesos and Satsuma and the americans again resort to nukes to take the advantage. 	In the celtic and old viking heartlands, city after city hits its straps and turns to full military production, battleships and bombers roll off the production lines while mega cities support numerous units....	The Celts make peace for a decade then boot the americans from the celtic motherland decisively with their new forces. 	The celts have not used (nor built) a single nuke, and the americans have depleted their arsenal.	The war is slow and bitterly fought, but the tide is beginning to turn. The american navy swells, but the miltary has been halved by the war. The celtic army alone has outgrown the entire american military.	The UN ushers in a new uneasy peace.	Almost 100 celtic stealth bombers stand by to rain death from above, while a second carrier battle group gathers for a new offensive as the battleground shifts to a war between islands.....

{"body":"The red robed figure stood before the rag-clad throng and held the bound, dark-haired child aloft. He rasped the words of the ancient ritual with a voice that had once thundered, but was now ashen. "We commit this enemy of the norse to the bosom of Hel. She, goddess of death, must be supplicated so that our children may survive! Great Hel, we beseech thee! Lead thy ghostly legions to Ragnarok so that your suffering followers may finally know peace! The peace of your grey embrace, almighty Hel!"	With what strength remained in his starving, stunted frame, the priest of Hel hurled the bound Celt into the radioactive swamp.	The American micro-drone, no bigger than the cockroaches that were the only surviving life form in the swamps, settled on a mangrove swamp and awaited further instructions.	President-Reverend Hyksos turned off the video screen and slumped back into his chair. How could one reckon with such an implacable foe: a nation dedicated to the worship of death itself? How often had one of their accursed accolytes carried a nuclear device into one of America's few remaining "cities" to perpetuate the madness of this never ending war?	There was only one way: an alliance with the godless Celts. Although it made his blood boil to think of allying with those pale-skinned, blue painted Commies, he had to admit that they were at least rational. Perhaps Comrade Llewellyn could be persuaded to join his ancient enemies in a final battle to eliminate the greatest existential threat to humanity itself that had come to exist in nearly two millenia of pitiless combat: the insane Viking Cult of Hel.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nevsky187","name":"t1_c5346qr","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1340234743,"created_utc":1340205943}

I, on the other hand, started on my own small Australia-like continent and then moved on to the other second mainland (I'm playing Continents) where I destroyed the Iroquois, the French, and the Chinese. I've also settled the Southeast Asia-like chain of semi-small islands/continents that surround America/Songhai/Japan. They're all at war with one another struggling to pump out armies to fight off invaders.		In the mean time, I'm building up a massive invasion force consisting of mechanized infantry, modern armor, mobile SAMs, gunships, and rocket artillery. The precursor to landing the ground forces will be a small trio unit of a missile cruiser, a destroyer, and a battleship group that lead the first assault and to repel any attempts to get at my transports. Oh, and each missile cruiser is loaded with nuclear missiles (which will be the first strike). Three nukes to each missile cruiser and there's eight, which makes 24 nuclear missiles.		Essentially I intend to wipe out all of their forces in one turn (maybe even some of their cities) and then "launch the ships!" before they can even really do anything.

{"body":"Don't underestimate the sheer power of the Giant Death Robot.  I thought trading them for a nuclear missile was a waste, but their ability to literally walk through infantry is awe-inspiring, to say the least.		Granted, when I finished my last Civ V game last week, it was through a Scientific victory as Russia and Germany happily galavanted across the continent, picking up loose civilizations (RIP, China.  I TRIED to tell you that Defensive Pact was a good idea!), and Greece decided that he just had to declare war on me, because it would end his own personal secretive ways.

{"body":"From The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism:		"To understand the nature of the present war -- for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war -- one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defenses are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces. Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of the super- states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment."","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brevoortia","name":"t1_c4zk5hs","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339541216,"created_utc":1339512416}

{"body":"This is absolutly amazing to see someone having invested so much time in a Civ II game and it is even more crazy to see the result of it !		What difficulty are you playing on?		My 3 cents:		Switching to engineers is a risky move: if you clean the fallout around a city and it gets nuked and captured by a paratrooper that's quite a waste... On the other hand some of your city must be difficult to reach even with the Movement of a Nuclear missile (Monte Cristo [could you be french :p ?]). I suggest clearing these first.		Switching to fundamentalism is definitly the best option for obvious economic/production/happinness reasons (you have rebels in your territory in one of the picture)		Tanks are overrated, they are good, but in such a situation you want weapons to SMASH enemy's troop. Make invasion groups with: 1-2 marines to tank in the frontline (they are great, cheap and can hold VERY well in +50%(jungle,forest,hills), +200%(fortress), 1-2 engineers to repair roads and connect annexed cities, 1 spy to buy off/plant nuke, 2-3 tanks to get back the lost ground during enemies' turn (and fortify in fortress) and 6-8 artilleries to push.		Making 2-3 groups like that would allow you to get some cities in a few turns (if they are not nuked). You obviously need to get some air force as well to get rid of these pesky bombers, if they kill you some units during their attack turn, you can wipe them out all in one turn with 3-4 fighters (even if it means suicide for them).		Get nukes to strike some of the cities you target and at least one to answer theirs and a transport full of fanatics (4/4 very cheap units) in case you get your annexed cities nuked, to freeze the front.

{"body":"Much simpler and non-violent means of ending the war is one individual or family at a time. Easiest is thru connectors - is the mos influential of the most influential, at least 2-3 per family or clan so as to gain the acceptance of all. Lord of the rings, but without magic. Bind them to peace accords prior to a treaty through value-based logic. Quite simply you show them a loved one, usually a young child from the clan universally loved. You tell them they have two choices - eternal warfare and death or the accord. Failure to sign binds them to the opposite - they must sacrifice their own child. They'll ask why such an absurdity need be done. Reply - because war or death will come to your door if you refuse to sign and they'll die of famine or war either way. To not sign will require a deadline. They have one year to get affairs in order and sign their WHOLE clan to the accord. As soon as all have agreed, thy etch into a permanent structure in a public location the names of their ENTIRE willing clan that they agree to: A) uphold peace and not bear arms B) work to support their own clan's needs and C) provide any excess to refugees such as the fatherless or disenfranchised. Once a tipping point is reached, a village/city/state can exist with each clan represented by their chosen representative. No public services are provided and knowledge bases are given freely/shared.  That is the accord. Specialization will inherently grow out of genuine concern for family well-being and prosperity will rise from even the worst of poverty. Lack of comms in familial settings is what causes resource shortages/selfishness/hoarding. Watch tv any day of the week. Quite simple really: familiarity doesn't breed contempt, it breeds discourse. Discourse ends wars, not the biggest gun. And discourse comes when one side is losing and the other cant bear to watch any more. Doesn't ever have to come to violence.

Remember the attacking unit will waste it's turn killing the weaker guy so as long as you have one guy left defending the city at the end of the turn you hold em off. That will free up your production capacity to make some more engineers. I would start repairing the earth from the inside out. That reduces risk of them being attacked by enemy armies.

So I've played Civ III for years and it's the only one that could really hold my attention. But I never got good at the game; maybe because I played in one or two-month bursts every few months, maybe I'm just naturally bad at strategy games (since I also fail at Age of Empires 2). So I've only ever played on the easiest setting with "less aggressive" AI. I haven't played in a while, but this post has made me interested again. I want to try a long-term game that goes into the future, far beyond the end of the main game. But if I play on a low difficulty it will likely just become me dominating everyone else like every other game of Civ I've played. I want to get better and have a real game, but I don't know how.

My God it was amazing, I played against the AI on the hardest mode (after a few days of learning all the commands) a huge map with tens of cities, 2 main continents of equal size with only 3 land bridges and surrounded by the sea.

On the first day I was confined to about 3/4 cities while the enemy took his whole island and started conquering my continent. Day 2 resulted in me taking control of my entire continent so I was more or less equal to the AI.		For the next few days I was mostly on the defensive, defending my continent against the constant barrage of rocket artillery, ac130 fire and tanks, but on the 5th/6th day, (I lost the diary by accident, well it was on my phone), I made the first attack on enemy soil.

{"body":"I was a hopeless Civ III addict for years: multiplayer Civ was like a god competition.  I gladly put up with probably the worst multiplayer interface in the world.  But I had an insane problem with people who would quit the game.  Eventually I had to stop playing games unless I could be host (which meant deactivating all of the anti-virus protection on my computer, which was just lovely), and then to stop playing games as soon as anyone quit without being eliminated.  I was completely insane.		They made an enormous mistake between the second and third Civ III expansion packs, from Play the World to Gold/Complete: Play the World allowed you to select the smallest possible world size (Tiny) even with the maximum number of players (8), while Gold/Complete limited Tiny maps to 4 players and Small maps to 6.  Even a small map was too large for a real-time multiplayer game, and on an ordinary Normal-sized map half of the players would quit before even a tenth of the map had been settled.  The only way to try and get around this was to make the planet as young as possible, as watery as possible, and as hot as possible, to minimize the total amount of arable land.  Every map became a parched, mountainous desert wasteland, sometimes without even any fresh water to allow for irrigation, and you created these situations where Mad Max Stone Age armies were forced to fight it out for control of narrow box canyons and tiny slivers of flood plain.  Actually, when you did it that way, it was rather fun.		Anyway, Civ II was (in some ways) a much less complicated game.  All of the Civ II games in which I survived to the Industrial Age ended in almost exactly the same way as has been suggested here, no matter what the difficulty setting: after building all the peacetime infrastructure I could, I would then turn my factory-equipped cities to building nothing but howitzers and mechanized infantry, at a ratio of roughly 5/1, until I had something approaching 10 howitzers to each of the enemy cities I wanted to attack.  I would then issue a formal declaration of war (no reputation-damaging sneak attacks if I could help it) and attempt to completely conquer the selected enemy in a single turn.  And it almost always worked: beating Civ II really did require nothing more than a lot of howitzers and a smattering of mechanized infantry.  Nukes were a distraction.  Civ III prevented this tactic by introducing zone control and proper artillery units, which nerfed the howitzer (although it was still an essential unit in penultimate-game play).  I never got into Civ IV: my computer at the time couldn't handle it, and I was both too frightened by my Civ III addiction and too offended by the idea that I couldn't build a settler AND grow my city in the early game.  And the way they tried to introduce religion was hamfisted.		Anyway, I'll be sad if I hear that you were just able to stomp the Vikings and Americans with howitzers and an army of avant-garde engineers.  I'd have hoped that by the year 3991 A.D your mutant, swamp-dwelling opponents would have invented some new defensive tactics.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kapek","name":"t1_c4zxjow","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339598555,"created_utc":1339569755}

For the ocean, I would make a line of naval uits that involved a couple battleships, and at least one of the anti-air ships (forget their name), something else too I forget the names. This would keep enemy ships from entering my water space, as well as keep enemy aircraft/missles from hitting my cities.		You also need an army of engineers. Literally an army of them. More on that below. 		As the wars went on, each turn I would push my ocean wall closer and closer to the enemy, filling in it's expansion will additional "stacks" of the units as necessary.		When it came time to take some additional cities, you use spies. You can either use spies to sabotage city walls and take the city by force with howitzers and tanks, or you can plant a nuclear device. 		I would usually, in a single turn, use dozens of spies to nuke an entire section of the enemy. Then move in my engineers. The engineers would build roads and railraod everywhere, and clean up all the pollution from the blast. With enough engineers this can all be done in a single turn. Engineers would take up most of the spaces around a city, but I would then use land units or sometimes bombers if there's poor terrain, to make sure that every square in the city radius is occupied. After that, I move a unit in and take the city.		Since all the city squares are occupied, this would prevent any enemy guerrila fighters from springing up around me. And since my army of engineers would put railroad around the entire area in a single turn, I could use the same land forces to go from city to city blocking off squares before capturing.		**TLDR//**The 2 key points to my strategy where, don't let any enemy units into my area at all, by building a "human wall" surrounding my empire. And engineers engineers engineers engineers.		I think if you could find a way to cut off the enemy from entering your space, and hold the line defensively, you should be able to pump out engineers and rebuild your own empire first.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kingrobert","name":"t1_c4zy5vr","parent_id":"t3_uxpil","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1339603552,"created_utc":1339574752}

{"body":"It's been ages and ages so details are a bit fuzzy.		I'm with DonutEF. He is describing the first stage, which basically is:	"Howto get more troups than the other guys", and that is through cleaning your land while holding your territory. You should have more than one worker-stack that can clear up any land in one round, I would aim at 5. 		It may be necessary to create lots of small cities to support all the troups, I can't quite remember how the rules are on troops support is. Anyway, the big point is that if you can clear your land, you will produce ultra fast, and thus become more powerful than your enemies.		I can't remember ever building land from water, but if this is possible, it is worth a great deal trying to connect the Americans and Vikings by land. That they are not connected by land is your main strategical problem.		The next stage is to hide your forces when they're multiplying, and while readying them for attack. I've had success with hiding the troops on ships by the poles (extreme south or north). However there seems to be little water on your map, and I'm not sure how crowded the sea by the poles is.		Anyway, before launching your attack, make sure to fake an attack at the opposite front so that the nuclear weapons of your enemy is near exhausted. Also make sure you have lots of money, to buy the anti nuclear stuff in your newly conquered cities. 		The best scenario would be to wait for the Americans to launch an attack, then in the same round launch your own attack not so far away from the American/Viking front. Then in the next round, after the Vikings have bombed and exhausted their resources on you and the Americans, you swoop in with all your naval force from their hiding place by the poles, and nuke the enemy and land your increadible army. Try to buy the anti nuke stuff immediately in each city you conquer.		Something like that.

{"body":"Lycerius - 		Here are some suggestions for a strategy involving bribery and defense.  I tested these on your savegame file, and I made what seemed like significant progress after a few hours.  I was able to capture over half of the Viking cities while maintaining a strong alliance with the Americans. 		Fwiw, I still play Civ2 now and then and I always play on Deity (highest) level.   		General approach: stockpile cash, buy out enemy cities, maintain adequate defense, build offshore platforms, maintain good American alliance & worry about land improvements later.		The general idea here is to incite revolts in key Viking city clusters. You'll capture associated military units while forcing the Vikings to attack these already well-defended cities, leaving your core cities to stockpile cash, spies and military forces.		1) Stop building factories in ocean-adjacent cities.  Better to build offshore platforms where available; they are more cost-effective than factories and will immediately improve your ability to build units. Harbors will help food production.		2) You have excellent air defenses in front line cities.  Maintain/increase the number of enemy-adjacent SDI & SAM defenses.		3) Sell all unnecessary city improvements, including libraries, universities, supermarkets, cathedrals and (for smaller cities) aqueducts & sewer systems.  Always sell these in cities you purchase.  This will allow you to create immediate liquid resources with which you can buy out more Viking cities.		4) Create lots of spies.  Use them to incite revolts and, if necessary, to target specific enemy infrastructure (inc SAM defense).  Your enemy will use spies against you, but while playing your savegame I noticed the AI using spies to destroy infrastructure.  When playing on Deity level, the AI will typically incite revolts.  Since you're playing as Prince or King, that is less of a concern.		5) Once you have tens of thousands in cash, sneak in multiple spies and incite revolts in Viking cities well back from the front line.  I concentrated on the Jarlshof region (and cities behind it).  Jarlshof, incidentally, gave me the United Nations, which may help in future negotiations. These back-line cities were high-production cities and are well defended.		6) As you increase your hold over the Viking empire, the cost of inciting revolts will decrease.		7) Regularly talk to your ally.  Occasionally gift the Americans with cash or military units. Keep them happy and occupied with providing Viking defense.		8) Avoid using nukes.  You'll just piss off your ally.  You need to improve reputation as much as possible.		8) Look for oil deposits.  If you decide to build a new city, begin it adjacent to multiple swamp deposits.  There are several such locations.		9) If you want to change to Fundamentalism (as many here have suggested) either do it immediately or wait until you have massively overrun the Viking empire.  Once you revolt, you'll suffer an immediate financial hit, and that will delay (or set back) your city buying plans.  I don't see a sigifnicant problem with Communism as you're currently constructed.  You have no cities near revolt. 		10) Convert outlying cities to capitalization.  This will help build cash resources more quickly.		Anyway, these are just a few thoughts.  This strategy might fail in the long run, but it might work out if you have good planning, patience and luck.   		Also, thanks for sharing your ideas and savegame.  Awesome stuff.

{"body":"Ok so this caught my attention. I'm not sure if I should post here or the new subreddit.		I am an EXPERT at Civ 2. Meaning I can win just about every single time on diety level often times pre modern times. I haven't looked at your savegame you've provided yet.		First thoughts:		- The fact that you got into this scenerio in the first place means that you're not very good (sorry).	- Why the F are you Communist??? Switch to Fundamentalism. (After you capture the UN switch back to Democracy...)	- Don't even bother sending units to the front lines to fight the enemy. Just place cheap units in their way, but within your city radii, so they can't be nuked.	- Your first priority is to stabilize the game such that you don't have to pay your attention to "fighting". Its pointless anyways. After you've "stabilized" the game, your next priority is to capture the UN.	- The AI has huge build advantages, especially late in the game. You have to capitalize AI stupidities in order to win. You WILL need to capture the UN.	- You can prevent their spies from nuking your cities by putting a spy in each of your cities (I believe)	- Repopulating your cities: when safe, switch to Democracy, turn the luxury rate up. An engineer will be safe from nuke if he is in the city radius of a city that has SDI. So once you clear out some swamps, you should have some food coming in which will allow you to capitalize on the population bonus from We Love the Prez Day.	- You can circumvent zone of control movement rules by building a spy and then moving it where you want to move your other units. Then move the unit on top of your spy.	- There is an in-game trick (which I DO NOT CONSIDER cheating) if you want to build a unit quickly... Just buy the least expensive unit. Then, switch production to the next least expensive unit. Buy again, and repeat process until you have the unit you want. You will have bought it at a bargain price!

{"body":"I've never played this game, but evidently the rules outlined in Wikipedia are incorrect:		"There are two paths to victory (and bonus points to the score) in this game: to be the last civilization remaining or to build a spaceship and reach Alpha Centauri before any of the other civilizations. The space race can be much more difficult because there are a limited number of turns in the game, which ends in the year 2020. If the spaceship does not reach Alpha Centauri by then, the game will simply end with the current score. The player can continue playing after all civilizations have been conquered, the spaceship has reached its destination, or the year 2020, but there will no longer be any scoring. The sooner a player conquers every other civilization, or the space ship arrives, the better as far as scoring is concerned. However, there are many things that can be done to gain points, so it occasionally is better to hold off victory to gain more points by, say researching extra 'future technologies'."

{"body":"As considered in the "58-year-solution" by Stumpster the civ-pro-solution to the stalemate in the original Eternal War (even when staying with Communism) is rather simple:		* building Offshore Platforms	* massing Howitzers		I generally did the same (without knowing Stumpsters solution), though it took me a little longer (slower playstyle...and cunning Vikings nuked Edinborough, where I was gathering my army...forgot to build SDI). But as soon as you reach that point where you have a decent amount of howitzers it becomes too easy...so here's my suggestion:		I turned the original savegame into a scenario where I changed the following:		* You (and the AI) can't build Offshore Plattforms. The cities that had OPs keep them. (at 3991 earth should by out of oil anyways...at the latest...)	* Howitzers loose their ability to overcome city walls. (Maybe "city walls in 3991" could be interpreted as whole cities built below the earth being giant bunkers where even Howitzers are of no greater use...could be reasonable after 1700 years of war...)	* Celts are no longer allied to America. You only have a temporary truce. They hate you now as much as they hate the Vikings.	* The overall behavior of America is shifted slightly more to "Militaristic"	* The Scenario will also give you the oportunity to play at a higher difficulty level and choose another faction.		With all these changes I tried to keep true to the original *feeling* Lycerius is describing. So maybe this scenario could bring up some other solution to The Endless War - while providing a bigger challenge for advanced civ2 players....thus enriching the TEW-universe.		so here's the file, hope that you (and Master Lycerius) like it:		[scenario](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/735014/cu_a3991.scn)		-disclaimer: this is my first civ2 scenario so I'm not sure if everything works out as intended.
