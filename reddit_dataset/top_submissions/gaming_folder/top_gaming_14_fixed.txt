DayZ really is a game where you make your own fun; perhaps don't buy into it *just* yet, but definitely keep an eye on it. As someone who was pissed at the devs for slow/no progress (how little I know about game developing, shame on me), they're really pushing out the updates now, with big patches.			You can see what they're working on on their Trello board: https://trello.com/b/5yzeFpo2/dayz				**Rust, H1Z1, Infestation: Survivor Stories, Nether, Miscreated, and so on**; I have them all, I don't ever play them. Take that for what it's worth.

It has huge potential to be the crazy zombie survival game you've always wanted.				And **Survive the nights** has *just* released their stress tests. This is a game I'm REALLY excited about; less PvP-focused and more focus on actually surviving against zombie hordes. It's has features where you have to find gas for generators to power lights in your home, lockable doors and windows, window-boarding, driveable RVs with storage in them (think the RV from The Walking Dead - mobile base, baby!) and much more.

The amount of game available to play now is more of a teaser for enthusiasts and backers who are closely following development. 		That said, it might be worth it to buy in now with a basic package, kind of like a pre order with a little early access, and end up paying a lot less than when the game goes retail. It's also very interesting to actually follow development as the devs and studios involved put out a hell of a lot of progress content.

{"body":"> So... what type of game is it then? I assumed it was an MMO.		It sort of is, but if you're expecting a lot of interesting and varied things to do, lots of missions etc. you're going to be *very* disappointed. The missions are procedurally generated, but that basically just means at every station there'll be a mission to kill X <npc-type>, or transport Y <item> to the next system.		It's pretty, but it's kinda empty. Running into players is a rare thing in open play, unless you're in a very select few systems, at which point you aren't really exploring the vast universe the game has to offer.		The customisation of your ship is lacking, when you really get into it, you'll pretty quickly figure out that for most layouts, there's pretty much only one module for each role that fits the bill, and it won't take much thought or consideration. If you want to paint your ship a different colour or something like that, you'll have to fork over more cash to do it.		There's no walking around, or landing on planets yet. There will soon be an expansion that allows you to fly around and stuff on *some* planets, but explicitly *not* earth-like planets. That will be included in *another* expansion. Again, these will all cost you, and right now a lot of players are pretty irritated because they will *not* be cheap.		So is it fun? Well, for a while, yes. Is it pretty? Very. Is it worth the money? ...yes, but *barely*. Maybe in six months that will be a more firm yes, but for now it's a bit underwhelming after the first two weeks of play when all you're doing is grinding for more money to buy a new ship.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Soul_Rage","name":"t1_ctvefuu","parent_id":"t1_ctv5uki","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439020000,"created_utc":1438991200}

{"body":"It seems the plan is to basically make a game that is sort of a mashup of FTL: Faster Than Light and something a bit like Freelancer. So it has the rogue-like elements (you WILL die, the game WILL start over, it is part of the game), the path forward for some goal, etc of FTL. But it has the flight system from Freelancer, but with better graphics.		Apparently their plan is to give you a bunch of situations that can happen much like in FTL and you have to deal with them, but instead of dialog boxes popping up to explain that you are under attack from a suddenly decloaked enemy ship, the first warning you get is when you get a torpedo up the ass.		Additionally, they (again, like FTL) will be expanding their content, though through DLC as time goes on. I quite enjoy FTL and have often wished for a game that was like it but with more depth. So I anticipate that I will play this game far into the future. So I backed it at one of the levels that give you a "life pass" to all future DLC free of charge. Now, theoretically I'll have spent more now then I will in the future on the DLC, but I do actually value getting in on alphas and such.

While it would need a lot of assumptions to set up a scenario with routine interplanetary trade, you could still craft such a situation without going outside the bounds of hard sci-fi. Mankind sends drones out into the galaxy to find new stars to settle, ships off colonists in sleeper ships on a millennia-long journey.
