So keeping the cars, bodies, etc. in the game exponentially increases how much load is put on the processor. This is because each individual object retains its "directive" so to speak on how to interact with each other object. So with 3 objects, each one communicates with the other two.		If we keep 100 objects, 100 objects must communicate with each other.		So, 10 objects = 100 directives		100 objects = 10,000 directives		Crazy, right?		It gets better!		This causes repeat-overlay syntaxes to populate the engine, essentially frying the processor unit and causing the game to unload derelict bytes into the backup venison system.

{"body":"A CHAIN OF EXPLODING VEHICLES LEAVES HUNDREDS DEAD		It's unclear what happened on this short stretch of road in south Los Santos, but witnesses report hundreds of exploded vehicles and mass hysteria. Tens the people run over, hundreds the people burnt to death or tore to pieces by the explosion of a multiplicity of motorvehicles. Among the victims two brave EMTs and various firefighters who died after the ironic explosion of their own truck.		While a single cause couldn't be identified at the time of writing, it looks like the ordeal started when a man, while speeding and going against the flow of traffic, crashed his motorcycle against an incoming car. Reportedly, the man walked away unscathed from the accident. Or should we say "sauntered away", as multiple recounts put the man on the side of the road for the duration of the tragedy onlooking the nightmare of his own creation with a smug face.

In GTA IV I was hooning down one of the wide roads that runs next to the Central Park knock-off on the middle island, driving a very damaged sedan with 3 screaming AI passengers. As I approach a red light the car finally catches on fire, naturally I bail and the car rolls into the back of another car stopped at the red light. The passengers from my car get out and start running away, only to be knocked to the ground when the car explodes moments later. They get up and resume screaming, now on fire as well. The other cars at the red light start catching fire in a chain reaction just like the OP's.
