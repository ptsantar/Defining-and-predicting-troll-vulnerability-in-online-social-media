The result of this combination is that some clever artists could pull some amazing stunts, for example the waterfalls in sonic look striped on a modern screen, but with the combination of screen and cable instead it looked like transparent water (the Sonic waterfall is drawn with alternating columns, one of them ost frequent ways the combination of pixels and cable blurred was horizontally, merging two columns, thus alternating columns instead looked like a single column with transparent water in it).		Also old TVs supported some bizarre resolutions, earthbound for example has a really weird resolution, and to play on a modern screen you need to play it distorted (so the lines don't get excessively aliased), or you scale it in a way that break lineart (the lines get very jagged).

{"body":"I am a beta/alpha addict. Got to know which ones to try. Ive been burned a few times myself, but you can usually tell if the game is gonna be great or not, by how much communication goes on between devs and fans.		A few really good Alpha's where Devs have great communication with their fans:		**Builders/survival**		[**Stone hearth:**](http://stonehearth.net/) Like a minecraft RTS - Active devs who talk directly to fans, release constant updates with videos explaining updates and showing changes *nearly* every week.		[**Subnautica**](http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/) - Oceanic survival/builder (Plays like a horror game for me because the deep ocean scares the shit out of me) Devs are very vocal about upcomming changes and often asks for input from their fans. (Although they use a website called [trello](https://trello.com/b/yxoJrFgP/subnautica) to post change logs which, to me, is a cluttered mess and gives me a headache when i try to make sense of it.) Their updates are also usually pretty frequent and large in size.		[Timber and Stone](http://www.timberandstonegame.com/) - another minecraft rts (it actually came before stone hearth). At the time I started following this game it only had one developer who did everything himself, but still did an amazing job on updates and communications with his fans. While he originally had it so you could buy into the beta for $19 USD, only the $29 package got the updates, he has since changed that and anyone who buys in gets the updates as they come. While I'm glad he changed his stance, I'm still a bit bitter about the period before it was changed. All in all its a great game, not as pretty as Stone hearth, but more difficult and diverse as well. For those looking for a good challenge this is the game for you. **ALSO** I wanted to add one thing that makes timber and stone unique is that you can actually set one of your villagers to a special class that allows you to take over his movements 100 percent, giving you the ability to explore the world and fight on your own. (I think this class is called the "adventurer" or something like that.		**[Project Zomboid](http://projectzomboid.com/) This game is currently released, but i played it back in the alpha/beta phases. The developers were good at communicating, but it was the community that stuck out to me. This was one of the first betas that I actually took a very active role in to posting bugs and ideas. The community was very understanding and would even post fixes and mods that would help unbreak the game for you until the devs could get around to it. Its an okay game, not a perfect game by any means, but I personally think its worth the money. 		**Party-based RPG** (edited from: turned based strategy)		[Wasteland 2](https://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/) - an amazing turned based CRPG. While its already been released, the devs did an amazing job on listening to input and fixing bugs and gripes, during beta. This is probably one of my favorite betas/alphas Ive ever participated in and the released product was great. 		[Pillars of Eternity](http://eternity.obsidian.net/) - I caught this one a bit late in development, but it was the forums that assured me it was a safe buy. Really active dev with constant updates. If you are a turned based strategy fan and havent played this game it is a must. Amazing story, hours of lore, great combat, good/bad choices, and even a home base you can upgrade and defend.		**Space Sims**   I should add that this is my favorite genre. The more immersion, the bigger the hard on i have for these games. Little details make a big difference. I love noticing something and saying to myself "wow, somebody actually thought to program that!"		[Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) - Another game that has already been released but had a great beta/alpha experience. While the overall game is okay (super cruise puts me to sleep) the combat is fun, pvp is intense, and the updates were huge and constant all the way through. Constant influx of new ships to try. **Apparently** the developers recently took a turn for the worst. Now they are charging $60 USD for DLC that was originally planned for the initial game in the first place or was at least implied. Apparently there is a big uproar about it over at the Elite Dangerous forums so... there's that. 		[Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/about-the-game) - I have mixed feelings about this one. Robert has always done amazing job with communicating with fans. His video updates play more like a documentary than an update video, which is amazing. My biggest complaint though is the amount of game play you get for the buy in is extremely limited. For people more oriented towards PVE elite dangerous is the way to go, PVP fans should look to Star Citizen. This is likely to change however as Star Citizen has MASSIVE aspirations for upcoming releases, just as of right now they are a bit stingy with them.		**[Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/) This game absolutely has to be mentioned even though everyone probably already knows about it. Absolutely phenomenal Dev team with constant updates. I watched this for a long time before eventually buying in however, because it looked so intimidating. I watched countless lets plays, how to's, and let's get started's, and I've never even landed on the moon. The first time i managed to get into fixed orbit around the moon I was overjoyed. That kerbal is still orbiting around the moon today because i didn't have enough fuel to get him back.  Very rewarding game if you can pry the reward from it hands. 		**Rogue Like** 		[F.T.L](http://www.ftlgame.com/) Not adding this would be an injustice. Subset did amazing job with PR and the game itself. I ... love.. rogue-likes and as i mentioned before, i love space games. So naturally a space rogue-like would peek my interest. Nothing could prepare me for what this game had in store for me. Simple enough that anyone can play, but in depth enough that, given the right strategy, you can do really well. The thing about rogue-likes is that they are random and tend to shit all over you depending on your luck. FTL did a good job on kinda balancing that aspect out. While there were a few times that i lost due to the cards being heavily stacked against me, it happened a lot less than most rogue likes. 		[Darkest Dungeon](http://www.darkestdungeon.com/) One of my favorite rogue-likes. With most roguelikes you wonder if this play through is going to shit on you due to bad luck. With Darkest Dungeon, its a matter of when and how much. This is a very dark and gritty rogue-like that challenges you at nearly every turn. And with every critical strike, triggered trap, or plunge into insanity, you have your own personal narrator adding his own dark touch to the event (I'll even add that the narrator is one of the coolest things about the game.) If you like to be punished, this is the game for you. 		Time is running short so i got to cut if off a bit early. Will comeback and add more of my beta experiences if anyone is interested. I have a few that i would recommend people steer clear from as well. 		**Bad Experiences**		I'm going to kick this one off right and name the worst beta experience I've taken part of [War Z or Now known as Infestation: Survivor Stories](https://infestationmmo.com/) This game was so bad that when you google it the Wikipedia page describing in detail how bad the game is, pops up before the actual website does. Actually, its number 4 on google search, under wikipedia, metacritic, and Kotoku's bad reviews. Plagued by hackers very early on due to the only Anti-cheat system being designated people waiting in rooms a monitoring the players, this game was pretty much a failure from the start. Not only that, but the forum mods pretty much banned anyone who spoke out against the game.		[Mechwarrior Online](http://mwomercs.com/) this is what happens when the developers get greedy. The first time i powered up my Mech and watched as my avatars hands reached up and flicked switched and pressed buttons, causing the mech to roar to life and the HUD light up, I fell in love. I have waited for an Immersive mechwarrior game since Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries. But, while the PVP was fun, the game was extremely hindered by an over priced market. On top of this, the developers broke off and started developing another free to play, cash shop game, before mechwarrior online was completely finished. 		[H1Z1](https://www.h1z1.com/home?cid=1065709) Im kinda on the fence about this one. The gameplay for h1z1 was pretty awesome when I started playing, but the hackers came way to quick and in far to great of numbers. I don't know what it is about these games that calls to hackers, but just about everyone I have played has been plagued by them. Technically, I don't think this belongs here as its a AAA developer and not an Indie and I don't know many triple A that actually communicates well with the fans. Most of them just say "Hey, this is the game we are making, hope you like it" which is fine.			**Edit:** Added Kerbal Space Program, Project zomboid, Star Citizen, and a excerpt on space sims. Adding more in a bit. I'm going through my steam list now game at a time to remember all the beta's I bought my way into. 		**Edit 2** Added "Bad experiences"		**Edit 3** Added a few roguelikes and expanded on Timber and Stone since it recieved a lot of attention (I think you guys might have given timber and stone the good old reddit hug of death.		**Edit 4** I have tons more to add, but reddit has a character limit**.

Most really big games take 5 or more years to develop, but they also stay under wraps for the first 4-ish years. Hype-time is relatively minimal. With Star Citizen, that waiting period is stretching across the majority of the development period. It leaves expectations a little thin. On top of that, Star Citizen is aiming to be much bigger than those other games, and it already has a large number of assets done to an insane level of detail. Chris Roberts has a habit of underestimating how long certain modules will take to release, but those deadlines are ultimately pretty arbitrary and based on one guy's opinion. Counting on them is just asking to be disappointed. What matters more to me is just seeing consistent progress being made.

{"body":"While I don't like Trello myself it's easy enough to learn this layout. I'll explain for those who don't know. From my understanding of Trello the columns can be whatever you want them to be.		Subnautica's Trello board looks to be set up for an Agile Development Process. The first column is their backlog which, simply put, is just a list of everything they ever plan on doing, and stuff gets added to it when news issues are found or there's a new feature they want to add, etc. Ideally it's in ranked order with what they want to do most being at the top. IDK if their's is set up that way. All other columns are for a certain time frame, known as a Sprint, usually a couple of weeks. When a Sprint starts everything they want to do that Sprint will get put into the To-Do column for that period, B58 in this case. Things that are actively being worked on go to the "Doing" column. Once they have finished working on the issue it goes into the "Done" column for that Sprint.		One advantage of using a Trello board is that it can be set up so that most anyone can add stuff. So anyone can add items to the backlog: bugs, new features, etc. I do not know how Subnautica has their's set up though.","depth":3,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Alexstarfire","name":"t1_cuaolkd","parent_id":"t1_cuao1a7","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440196560,"created_utc":1440167760}

{"body":"The Rust community is very volatile. There are some *really* awesome people, both in game and just on the subreddit. And then there are the people out to ruin your world. 		And that is good.		People blow up how "awful" the community is, but the grand majority of them join a server after buying, and die. Learning Rust is a huge ordeal, and newer buyers have a really tough time understanding Rust is based more on PvP than PvE, like Ark. 		I love Rust because there are the assholes, scumbags, and jerks. Because to me Rust is a huge pot of the best and worst in humanity. It truly is an unpredictable game, you have absolutely no assurance the guy who says friendly is friendly. None. Nor do you know if the guy running to you is going to ask if you'd like a hatchet, or some food. 		I was once captured and led into a room with 3 other Newmen  (fresh spawns, Bambi's). We were all naked, and 2 guys with guns were watching us. They said, "whoever has the largest schlong, will live and win a hatchet, pichaxe, and enough supplies to build a 2x2 base". 		***I walked out***.		As for the community dying, I'd say it's actually growing again. Like all games, hype was a massive factor when Rust came out. However, Garry Newman (Head dev, dev of Garry's Mod), did something both necessary and shattered their player base. He trashed the game. This version is known as "Legacy" Rust. There are many reasons why he did this, and openly admitted the game was shoddy made and poorly optimized, he was limited on what he could do. So he built it from the ground up, despite his community crying out. Now, after 50+ updates, the game is unfathomably better. Legacy served as the perfect, ideal "Alpha" to show how to do it better. And it worked. Garry has been completely and utterly transparent with the development of Rust.		Back on track, no, the community is not dying. It just fractured when Legacy split. If anything, I'm seeing tons of new players in servers saying "help, how do I ___, I haven't played since Legacy". Because people just quit Rust when Garry started on New Rust. Which is understandable, because New Rust when Garry quit building Legacy, was little more than a flat landscape with water puddles. There was no PvP, tree cutting, building, nothing. You just walked around. But over time, the game was built update by update, slow and sure. People began playing New Rust more, because Legacy was still playable, just not worked on.

{"body":"I think there are a few reasons why Kickstarter and the idea of Alpha's / Beta's are so enticing.		First of all people want to feel involved in stuff, especially stuff they like. For example one of the most successful Kickstarter games is FTL: Faster Than Light. I wasn't aware of it when it was being made so I didn't get a chance to back it. Now I have the desire to back another game so I feel like i'm not "missing out", even if that game might not even be good eventually. Also this let's the player feel like they contributed to the success of the game, even though they put in very little effort.		The other reason, and this varies a lot from game to game, is that it let's the player feel like they have some say in the direction of the game or the finished product. I know in FTL if you donated at a certain level you could submit a name to the list of names that are randomly assigned to characters. That's relatively meaningful and is a concrete example of how backers can influence a game. However, most games in Alpha / Beta won't have that same kind direct influence and are mostly relying on the players for reporting bugs / flaws.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_R4ke","name":"t1_cub27d8","parent_id":"t3_3hudr8","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440216892,"created_utc":1440188092}
