Handshakes are a mutual effort between two parties, but even if you get a good grip, that is only half the battle. Then you have to decide how much grip to put into it. You usually try to match the grip of the other person, but they might be doing the same, often leading to a weak handshake or a battle of death grips that cause your forearm veins to bulge.

{"body":"> As with Halo 3 and 4 before it, ODST was ported to the Xbox One by Ruffian games - an experienced British studio that has collaborated with Microsoft Studios on numerous products over the years. As expected, the game is bumped up to a full 1920x1080 resolution running at 60 frames per second, matching the rest of the collection (save for Halo 2 Anniversary). ODST was already an attractive game on Xbox 360 but the low 1152x640 resolution and lack of anti-aliasing resulted in a rather uneven presentation. The visual design really shines on Xbox One and while there is still room to make it better still, this updated version of ODST - with its native full HD resolution and decent anti-aliasing - offers a substantially improved presentation over the original release.			-Eurogamer.net","depth":5,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CloakNStagger","name":"t1_ctuha56","parent_id":"t1_ctuh2dc","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1438951445,"created_utc":1438922645}
