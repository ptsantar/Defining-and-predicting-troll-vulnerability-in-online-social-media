As an aside, my username is based precisely on this game not necessarily the political science term. One day I was looking for a new username, looked to my left toward my bookshelf where I have a shelf dedicated to strategy guides and the like. There I saw the game (the copy I have came "boxed" in a book-like case that resembles a hardcover textbook) and its strategy guide. I really liked the sound of it; it was dramatic without being overbearing and it appealed to my ideals of balance and moderation in all things. And hence my username was born.

{"body":"My personal favorite accurate nuclear depiction is from Tom Clancy. It's from a book, not a movie, but it is incredibly detailed. Here is just one paragraph. It's after several paragraphs describing the nanosecond process of the detonation itself (an intended boosted fission bomb that kind of fizzles and *only* yields 11kt), and precedes a description of how nearby actively broadcasting satellite uplink trucks zap comm sats.		IANANP (I Am Not A Nuclear Physicist) but it sounds believable.		> The fizzle had just ended when the first radiation reached the police officer. These were gamma rays, which are actually photons, the same stuff that light waves are made of, but far more energetic. They were already attacking the body of the truck as well, causing the sheet steel to fluoresce like neon. Immediately behind the gammas were X-rays, also composed of photons but less energetic. The difference was lost on Yankevich, who would be the first to die. The intense radiation was most readily absorbed by his bones, which rapidly heated to incandescence, while at the same time the neurons of his brain were simultaneously excited as though each had become a flashbulb. In fact, Sergeant Yankevich was unable to notice a thing. He literally disintegrated, exploded from within by the tiny fraction of energy his body was able to absorb as the rest raced through him. But the gammas and X-rays were heading in all possible directions at the speed of light, and their next effect was one no one had anticipated.		*The Sum of All Fears, Page 195*","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"svenborgia","name":"t1_cu2i6j8","parent_id":"t1_cu27nhh","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439559970,"created_utc":1439531170}

{"body":"Actually, Astronaut Lavos(I love that name, I'm stealing it) isn't the Lavos you've come to know through the events of the game, that's the right-most bit, which you need to kill to actually end the fight. Astronaut Lavos is the "Frankenstein's Monster" that Lavos was trying to *create* by manipulating and harvesting the DNA of all living creatures over the eons.		That's why it looks and moves like Chrono and Co, it's heavily based on human DNA. This is also why Chrono and Co. are able to beat it: By forcing mankind to evolve into stronger and stronger beings for harvest(giving them magic, forcing them to endure at least two mass extinction events before 1999 AD, and some other things vaguely implied by tectonic activity), Lavos accidentally created a race of beings strong enough to kill it. Basically, a human equivalent of Saiyans since Chrono Trigger is an Akira Toriyama work.		This is the irony of Lavos, and one of the biggest reasons why I love the game: Once Lavos comes into focus as a villain it starts making sense why a group of "piddly" humans could stand a chance against him.

{"body":"Thanks!		I have one other big theory about the plot of the game. My last one is pretty solid because it's looking at Lavos's actions and boss design from an evolutionary point of view, which the game outright tells you is OK to do. In contrast this one falls more to the fanon side of things, but it fills two interesting, but obscure, plotholes in a really cool way, so I'm willing to accept it when I play the game.		When you beat Magus in his castle, he wakes up Lavos, who then creates a huge gravity well and sends everyone back in time. It's easy to rationalize Lavos throwing Chrono and Co. back to the beginning of his reign on Earth so they could contribute to the gene pool, and therefore increase the potential of man even faster. That makes sense with what we know of Lavos, especially if he didn't know they were time-hoppers, which seems probable in the pre-Omen timeline.		What doesn't make sense is why Lavos would send Magus back to Antiquity, to right before Lavos's second recorded mass extinction event. There'd be no guarantee he'd survive it, it gives Magus another chance to fight Lavos, and Lavos has to know Magus would hold a grudge. There just doesn't seem to be any benefit on the surface.		However, we know from Chrono Cross that Schala was entirely absorbed by Lavos, yet somehow remained a vaguely separate being. We also know the fight with Lavos in Antiquity is much, much harder than it is in any other era. Normally I wouldn't count something like this, but Chrono Trigger has almost no ludo-narrative dissonance(think abstract Final Fantasy enemy encounters for an example of strong ludo-narrative dissonance). What you see is exactly what's happening in the world with very little abstraction.		So my explanation for all of this is Schala, the most powerful mage of Zeal, was able to weaken Lavos from within after he absorbed her. Lavos sent Magus back in time to save Schala so Lavos's past self wouldn't make the same mistake, thus creating a new timeline with a stronger, more capable Lavos. Of course, this doesn't work, but kudos to 600 AD Lavos for trying.		There is one other thing about Antiquity's timeline that's interesting, now that I think about it:		The Gurus and Janus never got thrown through time in the pre-Omen and post-Omen timelines, that only happened in the Original timeline. This means for at least a little while Janus and the Gurus were time-cloned, just like you can do to equipment and items available in 600 AD and 1000 AD. This also tells us something deeper about Chrono Trigger's time travel because Janus and the Gurus still appeared in the future: Jumping through time is a permanent thing, you'll always come out the other side. It doesn't matter if your past was erased, it doesn't matter if the timeline was altered numerous times. If you punched through time at 600 AD, you'll always come out at 600 AD. This is... strange, and implies an exponential amount of messiness over timelines. Perhaps it's an unintended, apocalyptic consequence of Chrono's and Co.'s actions?		In turn this also means your first excursion through time, where Marle is mistaken for Queen Leene, is utter nonsense with the rest of the plot. That's the only time the game ever seriously plays with the butterfly effect and grandfather paradox as consequences of time travel, and it's baffling why such a big flaw was left in the game when otherwise you need to nitpick pretty fucking hard to find unpatchable plotholes.		EDIT: Oh! Speaking of timelines and nitpicking pretty fucking hard for plotholes, the game has five major timelines with some chuckle-worthy silliness:		1. Original: This timeline ended sometime around 600 AD when Magus got sent back to Antiquity without Chrono and Co. This is the timeline when Janus and the Gurus were scattered into the future.		2. Pre-Omen: This is the timeline you inhabit for the first half of the game, before Chrono and Co. fuck up in Antiquity. It technically extends up to at least 2300 AD, but time travel shenanigans cause it to eventually end at 600 AD. There's potentially a plothole here caused by a second Magus running around in the Post-Omen timeline, but I'm not entirely sure about this, especially because we never learn exactly what Magus did to become Queen Zeal's adviser.		3. Post-Omen: This is the timeline you inhabit after Schala chooses to help Chrono's friends escape from the Ocean Palace instead of her mother. Queen Zeal is allowed to properly inherit the Dark Omen, which forever marks the future. This is also the timeline when you gain access to most of the game's side quests. This timeline potentially causes a *third* Magus to be running around in Antiquity.		4. Post-Lavos A: In this timeline you beat Lavos in Antiquity, thus creating a future where Chrono and Co. witness Magus completely fail to summon Lavos.		5. Post-Lavos B: In this timeline you beat Lavos in 600 AD or later, thus allowing Magus to not get pie on his face. This timeline potentially causes a *fourth* Magus to be running around in Antiquity.		The important thing to note about the duplicates of Magus is his going back to Antiquity is the only known, meaningful time travel that's generally assured to happen in every timeline except Post-Lavos A. If you count the numerous minor timelines, this number may go up drastically.		EDIT2: As you can see, time travel in Chrono Trigger has a way of obfuscating the root causes of things. That's why I like the opening prose of Chrono Cross so much:		>What was the start of all this?		>When did the cogs of fate begin to turn?		>Perhaps it is impossible to grasp that answer now,		>From deep within the flow of time.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"QueuedeSpool","name":"t1_cu2l4js","parent_id":"t1_cu2i1rb","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439570148,"created_utc":1439541348}
{"body":"Thanks for this awesome reply! I loved the theory about Schala taking down Lavos from the inside/from being one with him. And of course I loved the bit about Lavos controlling the fate of Crono and Co. I know that at that one point in the game they start questioning the appearance of gates, "maybe something or someONE wanted us to use these gates here and now" (something like that, I think Lucca says it). I always liked the idea that maybe it was someone from Zeal, or one of the gurus but I could never make sense on who or what exactly. Then I think I remember realizing at some point that it was Lavos controlling when and where the time travel opportunities appear. But this goes against your theory of Lavos not knowing that they are timehoppers. THEN AGAIN. maybe this is because of when and where you encounter Lavos in the flow of time. 		If Lavos uses time travel in 600 AD to do as you suggest, oblivious to the fact that Crono and Co can time travel, and Magus to Antiquity to stop Schala from weakening him. Then maybe after Lavos keeps witnessing Crono and Co all over the place Lavos has to find new ways to use them. Fate is also a big theme in this game, especially in Cross. Maybe Queen Zeal having new advantages from Magus showing back up made Zeal the major power here, since she learned how to control and harness Lavos. Lavos may have wanted to break free from her grasp and the only way it knew how was to use Crono and Co to it's benefit? I may be grasping at straws here, but I always have tried to theorize what really made the time gates appear.		They were always conveniently there in many times of need. And the game heavily suggests another power is at work with their appearances. You saying Lavos willingly sent them back at 600AD could have been the obvious suggestion that it was him who does create all the different gates. Who else has power like Lavos? None.   Lavos wanted to rule and consume, and Zeal would have gotten in the way of that. We are given this since of freedom in the game, the ability to choose our own fate (and our timelines to visit), but Crono and Co were being led to each and every timeline on a very dictated path.				Also, in regards to Magus becoming Queen Zeal's advisor, his NPC name when you first encounter him was just "Prophet." So we can assume him showing up and just knowing everything (since he already lived that life as Janus in his past), allowed him great power that she wanted on her side. The power to accurately see into the future. And Queen Zeal coveted power more than anything else, so it makes sense why she so easily allowed him on her side, especially since things he said were undoubtedly true, he had a strong case thanks to time travel unbeknownst to the queen. That's how I always took it as how he got on her side.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HardCorwen","name":"t1_cu2zblc","parent_id":"t1_cu2l4js","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439601901,"created_utc":1439573101}

{"body":"We've always had war and climate change.		I mean, you all realize that chimps make war and baboons do it so brutally that they don't even leave kids alive.		Also, humans almost died out at one point due to climate change. I don't think most folks realize climate change is natural and we've always adapted to it, whether or not we had a role in changing it, it's not exactly a new threat. If we are making it happen faster than before, it's also because we have the technology to handle it faster.		It's economics of scale - no technology, earth changes slowly, adapt to it slowly. High technology, earth changes quickly, adapt to it quickly. 		But our drive to survive and compete is what made us successful and having big-brains. Humans are at their best when they are in their worst. Death, suffering, conflict, pain, and misery have given birth to every single thing you enjoy in society, whether its the plentiful food you eat or the microwave to warm said food or this internet we're typing on: it's all come through conflict and struggle.		Comfort and convenience are the real enemies to humanity's progress to a better world.","depth":8,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ViktorV","name":"t1_cu1tc54","parent_id":"t1_cu1rxdi","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439517039,"created_utc":1439488239}
