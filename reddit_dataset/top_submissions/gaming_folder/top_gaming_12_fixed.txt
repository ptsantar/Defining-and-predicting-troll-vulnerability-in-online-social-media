You definitely can do a lot in the world. You can change the fates of the NPCs and their whole sub stories, which is pretty cool ,ad you know you are making a change to those people, even if sometimes they resent you for it. You can save a country, but will not be remembered. You can change the world. Either way there are no real good outcomes and it's not like it's a multiple path game where you adjust anything, just that your actions have huge consequences.
