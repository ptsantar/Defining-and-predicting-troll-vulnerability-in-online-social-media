The cool thing with the AI controlling them is it acts like a Terminator...just a soulless killing machine that never stops.  	  	I think both these clips are from Battlefront 2, but it's the same general idea.

{"body":"No worries!  You could beat them; they couldn't deflect missiles or grenades or tank shots, they could get knocked off a ledge (or simply miss their jump), and crashing a ship on their head was always a crowd pleaser.  Just zerging them down was effective as well: die, respawn, rinse and repeat before they captured an objective...once a hero spawned they became target numero uno for everyone.  They were just super mobile and extremely hard to hit with laser shots (the vast majority of projectiles in the game).  As players got more familiar with the game they learned to handle the heroes better, and some heroes were more deadly then others.  	  	Individual deaths weren't a big thing, the whole game was a meat grinder.  For example, think of each map being 15v15 players, with another 20v20 npc controlled units, for a total of 35v35 (I think it was much higher).  The score might start 500:500 for Empire:Rebels, and each death would subtract from their respective side, with the first team to 0 losing.  Players and npcs would respawn, with the npcs kinda of dictating where the main battle lines would be and the players either backing up their npcs, or going for flanks or grabbing vehicles to try and break bottlenecks.  You'd also have recon units moving ahead or behind to cause chaos and capture areas faster.  Vader might kill 50 units (unlikely), but he wasn't always on the map, and once he died it would be some time before another hero randomly spawned.  In this respect, each player could have lots of kills and very few deaths, so even games you lost could be fun the entire time.  Plus, just cause a player spawned as Vader or Luke didn't guarantee a ton of kills, but every now and then a ringer would get the chance to play as one and the rest of the server would be in awe watching a Jedi scorch the server.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ubernezer","name":"t1_ctveph2","parent_id":"t1_ctvcq0o","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439020489,"created_utc":1438991689}

{"body":"Vader had reasons for not killing Luke and Leia.		Vader was trying to get the location of the hidden rebel base from Leia in A New Hope.  He guessed that if Leia were allowed to escape that she would flee straight to the hidden base Vader was searching for (along with the Death Star plans).  He convinced Tarkin to allow them to escape.  Even Leia figured that out.  The biggest threat, Obi Wan, Vader "eliminated".  And they *still* went to the hidden base, and Vader *still* tracked them.  In Empire, Leia was of no consequence as long as she was at Cloud City, so Vader simply requires that she be held there indefinitely.  He already knew Leia was too resistant to interrogation or mind manipulation to get anything useful from her.		With Luke, Vader was attempting to turn him.  He is a very powerful force user, and even middling force users have absurdly powerful effects on diplomacy and battles.  All those bounty hunters, all that presence at Cloud City, the trap with Han Solo, the Emperor's and Vader's presence on the Death Star II at Endor, etc.  Think about it.

Successfully defending yourself against a couple dozen dimwitted infantry droids, that's something I'd consider to be on par with the strike team that went to rescue Obi Wan on Geonosis.		Speaking of which, Mace saw the message from Obi Wan where he was attacked by a Droideka, and he had just finished reporting that the Geonosians were manufacturing a droid army, so they knew what to expect. And they actually did fight a droid army, in a completely open arena with practically no cover, plus flying Geonosians, bounty hunters and the threat of Count Dooku the renegade ex-Jedi Master turned Sith Lord. I'm not surprised that given the odds, so many Jedi fell on Geonosis.

Anything fans come up with, no matter how much it might seem to make sense, is just a post hoc rationalization of a poorly constructed plot.

There was also a fantastic mod called mercs vs jedi where one team was limited to guns and no powers while the other team was limited to sabers and maxed out force points.		With equally skilled players, mercs absolutely destroyed the jedi. The jedi might have a force answer to almost every weapon in the merc arsenal whether it's deflecting blaster bolts with their saber or using force sight to detect mines and such.		The problem is that they can't do it all at once. Which made it very easy for merc players to ambush jedi. For instance throwing down a mini turret and trapping the jedi in the cross fire between the merc and the turret. The jedi player can achieve a 100% deflect rather against one or the other but not both.		Similarly deflection works great against blaster based weapons while force push works fantastic against launched projectiles like rockets or grenades. The thing is, extending one's hand to push a projectile away lowers the light saber. A merc could switch faster between explosives and blasters than a jedi could switch between saber deflection and force powers.		In the end the jedi were absolutely lethal up close in your face but a canny merc would never let a jedi get that close. Twitch players would die against jedi but a smart merc would slaughter jedi.

It's worth noting that some clones did react emotionally to Order 66 in the EU, either prejudiced against the Jedi or even choosing to disobey the order. Some Jedi also did sense what was about to happen and survived. Notice how most of those Jedi were more powerful and experienced. The average Jedi may not have been able to.		Another factor is the nature of the Order. It wasn't a conspiracy among the clones the Jedi could have discovered. It was programmed into them. All it took was a holocall to get them to turn on the Jedi. The Jedi would have had to have launched a full investigation into the cloning program to get even a hint of the order existing. Plus there was a Clone Wars episode about a chip grown into the clone's brains that forced them to comply with the order.

{"body":"if he means its official introduction being the moment it drops from the vent then the first time you can be killed by the Alien is when it is first introduced in a cut scene. After that scene you have to run to call one of the trains and there is a horrible terrifying sense of dread as you await the trains arrival. The first time i played this part nothing happened - what came before and the music thumping was bad enough. I made it on to the train and took off. The second time I played I was waiting for the train and wondered why it wasn't approaching then I realised I hadn't even called for it. So I wait again, and although I was certain the Alien wouldn't be coming I decided to turn around because the music still made me feel dread. And there she was, slowly walking down the corridor I had come from, right towards me. Some reason it didn't run for me, it just slowly walked towards me. The train arrived and I ran inside and hit the button to leave just as the bitch got to the doors. So I wasn't killed but I imagine that is the first time you can be killed by it.

This is how well the game works with VR. It says Alien:I is 'average', I disagree, it's the only game that has given me motion sickness, I would rate it 'poor'. I get sick in about 20 minutes.		Elite Dangerous is rated: "Perfect". I can play that game an unlimited amount of time without getting sick. The game feels incredibly real, and that experience alone was worth the $350. I actually stopped playing because it was almost too real, as if being a space ship captain was a second job. I was putting enough time into it to make that true at least.		However, to everyone I talk to who is interested I say *wait for the consumer versions.* If you can't wait any longer try to find someone near you who is willing to demo it. Try to get a long demo if you can with multiple games to see if you are susceptible to VR sickness.
