{"body":"Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls patch 2.3 (right now) is amazing.		 After clearing the story mode and unlocking the Torment difficulty, you'll find that there are 10 progressively more difficult iterations of torment. There are bounties, which are basically quests to kill specific legendary monsters or clear a specific area, and each of the 5 acts has 5 bounties, and the bounties change daily. There are Rifts, which are progressively harder random dungeons with an uberboss at the end, that you have to beat within a time limit. there are now 150 levels or rifts, each harder than the last. The highest that anyone has cleared without hacking or modding is like a mid 60 solo or low 70 for group i think. The loot system is completely revamped with better drop rates on all gear, and gear dropping with stats based on the character that picks it up (so my Demon hunter gets gear with dexterity instead of intelligence for example). The gear treadmill is real, and with a combination of gear gambling with bloodshards (similar to gambling with Haig in d2) and the high droprate in Rifts, you are always finding new or better gear. Legendary gems are special gemstones that can be socked into Jewelry (necklace/rings) that have two legendary effects and can be leveled up by completing rifts to make the effects more powerful. The auction house is gone. The addition of Kanais cube and act specific crafting material has added a whole new tier of power to the game as well. Plus they just added a new endgame dungeon for free with a really cool epic boss.

{"body":"I would go straight to say that one character per class to test builds is wonderful thing. You can experiment with various builds without having to make new characters and get them to that level and again. That is actually good thing. Actually not without reason even in Diablo 2 they added possibility to reset points at Adria (twice or three times per character) of what I remember.		And still comparing Diablo 3 release to Diablo 3 post Reaper of Souls is wrong. Game after RoS got totally different. Also to include patches 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of which every made some major changes, game of today is total different.	Reaper of Souls made extreme overhaul of way that Diablo 3 is played. And features of each patch also influence it strongly, 2.1.0 Seasons mode, Greater Rifts, Ramaladni's Gift, Legendary Gems, Legendary Potions, overhaul of sets that made them powerful due to change of set bonuses from boring stats to actually boosting various builds. And also lots of new legendary items, some of legendaries that already were gained unique to them affixes which can have very interesting effects. And tons of changes at many skills and runes stuff. That stuff also made noticeable change.		2.2.0 Didn't add new features (maybe expect that you gather all gems in 20 meter radius by picking it. And same goes for crafting materials) however it added new sets (read - new builds), new legendaries, and more legendary affixes for ones that didn't had them, remaking more of sets bonuses in way they're actually useful and all these balance changes.		And superfresh 2.3.0 which has been published yesterday. There is no more separation between level 1-60 and 61-70 craft materials, on all levels they drop same. It's simply far more convenient. It does add Kanai Cube - supercharged version Horadrim's Cube. It can change type of basic jewels (ruby's into topazes and other), crafting materials (rare into magic ones or and otherwise, but cannot into legendary crafting material) reforge legendary items (you got item you were looking for but it's far weaker from what you have and it wouldn't boost your power? Reforge and you may just get it better!). Or most prominent feature - Extract legendary power. Using this cube you can have 3 additional affixes of legendary items active without carrying items which provide them! One of weapons and other hand held stuff (shields, mojos and stuff), one of armor, and one of jewelry. It does mix up things and allow for even more builds! And also 4 additional difficulty levels as standard Torment 6 was not enough for all those who went with doing power builds.		Diablo 3 today is brand different thing than old one. and of course I'm pretty sure I didn't called out all changes.

Cross realm, while it fixed 15 hour AVs and long queues, really ruined the spirit of the game. 		I also totally lost the ability to sink 8 hours every couple days into raiding and pvp once high school ended. Still, that was probably my most memorable and fun experience with any multiplayer video game beside maybe Mario Cart, GoldenEye and Diablo 2, back when me and 10 friends would constantly play until we all had T2 gear. I remember I sold my Netherwind geared Mage when Naxx came out for 630$ (my friend sold his Thunder-whatever legendary Hunter for 3,700$, he had a pretty famous PvP video circulating at the time when someone PM'd him that offer).

{"body":"What gets me with the Casual/HM distinction, is that its the same boss, similar loot, same instance. After beating a HM boss i'm not greeted with a new experience. I'm greeted with the same thing i have seen multiple times before in the easier mode. This makes the instance itself go stale much quicker, even though the bosses are harder. Pre heroic mode killing a boss for the first time gave a greater reward in that it unlocked a fresh part of the instance. Ulduar is a great example of this, progressing through it each part is new and refreshing. This masks the fact that you're just hitting pinatas for loot, making the experience more enjoyable. There was a fresh experience after all the work of killing the bosses, not just some shinyer epix.			Off topic:	A solution could be to have multiple tiers of content in different difficulty instances. Having one HM instance, one normal instance and one causal instance. And making the HM instance the normal instance when a new instance is released (through some sort of balancing). So instead of ditching SWP when WOTLK came out. They should have made Naxx be the new HM, while the normal level raider would go through SWP (by nerfing SWP or balancing the level gain of WOLK to make SWP be at a normal level difficulty) and the casual ones go through BT/MH. If they where able to balance the difficulty right the only ones without fresh raid content would the most hardcore raiders (which would eat through anything way to quick to keep content fresh for them anyways) . While everyone else would be able to progress through multiple unique tiers. 		This won't make WOW the game it once was, as the bubble has burst (everyone who broke their MMO/gaming cherry with WOW has either moved on or are still playing, if WOW is their thing).

{"body":"Those consequences made it very special to me. Most choice-based games, you're picking a consequence, evil or good. Making choices in TWoM will hold unforeseen consequences. The game puts you in situations where you need to buy into knowingly risky choices.		Maybe you didn't build your shelter for winter quick enough, so one of your survivors gets sick. You don't have medicine, using most of your supplies on food and weapons. Said snow storm locks out some locations, forcing you to journey into a dangerous section of the city. However, in searching for medicine, you get shot. Now, you need bandages, but you're too roughed up to dare enter the dangerous areas. So you go to a hospital for the easy steal, but it unfortunately leads to depression. Through these choices, the player plots out their own story. And it's not voluntary. I'd much rather be making easy, "paragon" decisions, but its sizable difficulty forced me to make "renegade" decisions.		Of course, as these choices are contextualized by the war setting, they hold even more significance, helping flesh out the central theme. None of this is scripted, and the player really can't plan around it. I think it's one of the best choice-based games in recent memory, and it makes sense it'd come from the folks behind Witcher 2.

{"body":"That's underselling it. It is actually [one of the best games ever made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-d_8Ql7GZY). If you haven't bought this game yet, go right now and buy it. [Especially on PC.](http://www.gfycat.com/DamagedMajesticConey) 		It currently has a 94 on Metacritic with a 9.2 on user reviews. That's damn rare for both critics and gamers to love a game so much. And keep in mind that the little problems that reviewers found in launch 1.0 version (awkward inventory management, Geralt's out of combat turning speed...etc) have almost all been patched up. CD Projekt  has been incredibly attentive to post-launch support. Also we just got New Game+ mode for free.		Some reviews:		GameSpot - 10/10		>And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. As you come to reflect on your journey, there is no conclusion other than it being one of the best games ever made.		Gameinformer - 9.75/10		>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt encompasses what I hope is the future of RPGs. It stands out for its wonderful writing, variety of quests and things to do in the world, and how your choices have impact in interesting ways. Usually something is sacrificed when creating a world this ambitious, but everything felt right on cue. I still think about some of my choices and how intriguing they turned out – for better or worse. 			HardcoreGamer - 5/5		>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt presents a conundrum: how can you speak about that which leaves you speechless? The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is equal parts daunting, accessible, beautiful and hideous, but every aspect combines in such a remarkable way that it’s nearly impossible to not give it a sweeping recommendation. 		GameTrailers - 9.8/10		>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a thoughtful, diverse and frequently awe inspiring adventure. Its stories are deep an satisfying, unafriad to touch on themes of personal character - presenting players with choices and consequences that aren't about turning into a hero or a villain. In the end it's simply one of the best RPGs ever made.			PushSquare - 10/10		>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt sets a new standard for open world RPGs. Its shockingly cohesive world is as beautiful as it is demanding, and it's packed full of mature content that throws you from one emotional response to the next. Its storytelling is superb, its combat is grippingly refined, and its often unforgiving nature only lends itself to a brilliantly rewarding experience. In an industry that's flooded with so many by-the-book open world titles, Wild Hunt stands out as a true labour of love from a developer that's uncompromisingly passionate about its creative freedom. Geralt's incredible adventure is nothing short of a masterpiece.		IGN - 9.3/10		>The Witcher 3 is as dense and deep as the other two games in the series in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is. Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.		TwinInfinte - 5/5		>CD Projekt Red has outdone themselves once again with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It is a shining example of what RPGs should be: an experience that makes you believe that you’re truly part of a game’s world and that you have a very real stake in it. That’s exactly what Wild Hunt has achieved here.		Gameplanet - 10/10		>The Witcher 3 is a triumph. CD Projekt has delivered a world that is epic and textured, and a narrative composed of swelling crescendos and artful asides. This is a studio at the top of its game delivering a title that’s now at the top of the field. Quite simply, The Witcher 3 is unmissable.		Kotaku - Yes		>Wild Hunt is a grand adventure that feels distinctly of its time. It manages to set new standards for video game technology while accentuating the fleeting nature of technological achievement as an end unto itself. It is a worthy exploration of friendship and family, mixing scenes of great sorrow with scenes of ridiculous lustiness, tempering its melancholy with bright splashes of joy and merry monster guts.		LazyGamer - 9.5/10		>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an impeccable role-playing game, and one of the finest games ever created. Whether it's as large as tracking the Wild Hunt or as small as delivering a love letter, The Witcher 3 makes Geralt's actions count in the most incredible ways - creating a world begging to be explored for countless hours on end.		Elder Geek - Worth Buying		>Without mincing word, the Witcher 3 is a masterpiece. While there are some objective problems with the game, they are miniscule when compared to the staggering achievement that it has accomplished. It has raised the bar for the entire video game industry. This is one of the finest RPG games ever made, and the best open world game I have ever played. It is the new high mark of quality for any game that offers player choice within a story.		Eurogamer - Essential Game award		>This is why I love The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It is crass in some places and overreaching in others, but despite its grandeur and its fantastical setting, it is a game made by, for and about human beings. It's lewd and perverse and poetic and hot-blooded. It's huge yet crafted; its systems are purposeful and it doesn't have a whiff of design by committee. It will last you months, yet not waste your time. Above all, it has a vivid, enduring personality, something that is exceedingly rare among its breed of mega-budget open-world epics (and that will probably be rarer still once Hideo Kojima and Konami part ways later this year). Simply put the Witcher 3 is a masterpiece. It captivates players with artistic vision, a huge world and an epic story. The developers were not looking for cheap applause - game design is uncompromising, consistent, thoughtful and nuanced. 		Hooked Gamer - 10/10		>I've been a reviewer on this site for a decade and I’ve never given a game a perfect score. A number that have tempted me, but The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the first game that has me writing the double digit score. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is PC gaming personified. It would have been a great game with just its wonderful deep story, large open world and stunning visuals. Yet the musical score, challenging combat and excellent writing and voice aciting complete the deal and make it a masterpiece.		ActionTrip - 9.4/10		>The Witcher 3 is an engaging, overwhelmingly lengthy gaming experience with a staggering amount of characters to meet and places to explore. With solid quest structure, great voice acting and a killer soundtrack, there’s really not much we can say or add that could further sugar-coat our sentiment, which is as follows: “this is the game to buy right now, like, NOW!”		DuelShocker - 9.5/10		>Ultimately, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a crowning achievement for CD Projekt RED. Eight years ago, a small and completely unknown Polish studio released The Witcher using an engine borrowed from BioWare. Back then, the game already shown clear hints of greatness, even if many elements seemed to be held in place with duct tape and spit. Today, we can easily say that the students have surpassed the masters, placing themselves firmly at the top of the RPG food chain.		>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an emotional cavalcade across an enormous, compelling world that shows the love and sweat poured into its creation in every tree, building, character and quest. It’s almost everything I ever wanted from RPGs and open world games combined, and hopefully it will set an example for future games within the same space.

For the third entry, it shouldn't be more in line with the first unless 2 failed which it didn't at all in this regard.		Not enough for me to say it wasn't great yet, but also lopping off an INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT companion to day 1 DLC is ridiculous. The sexualization of Ashley and, weirdly enough, Kaiden (for male Shep anyway) is another point of contention. The sheer amount of previous allies yet they choose to invent two new ones despite having several very strong, and very well liked ones that were absent in the game. One of the newbies is also James.

{"body":"The point is that if you're white, you'll win in terms of racial issues, even though you might be disadvantaged in other ways that have nothing to do with race. A friend of mine living in China learned this. According to him, dating in china is dating on easy mode if you're a white guy. Companies in Africa will hire white guys to be on the board of directors just because it looks good to have a white guy on there. Hell, in the Asian world, they hire white people to just look like they're on the board of directors when in fact they contribute nothing to the company other than their whiteness.		So, sure, Poland had a shitty century, but you're talking about nationality, not race. If a Polish person went to the United States, they would face less systemic barriers towards making it than a black man who arrived from the Congo.		Privilege comes in many forms and race is just one of them. For instance, a rich black man is more privileged than a poor white man in many ways. But he is privileged because he is rich, and it has nothing to do with race. I don't know if you remember the case that happened in the news a few years ago when a white cop arrested a black man who was going into his own home, and Obama commented on the case. A white rich man has a privilege that the black man does not, namely that he does not have to worry about a cop assuming that he's breaking into someone else's home on the basis of his skin color. A black rich person and white rich person have privilege over the white poor person, but the black rich person still has to worry about some systemic issues that neither the rich or poor white individuals have to worry about.		Try not to think of privilege in terms of it being a spectrum. Unfortunately the conversation has been steered that way by people who do not understand what privilege entails. Rather, think of each form of privilege as coming with it's own isolated issues, and think of the privileges that one has as isolated true/false propositions rather than some kind of meter that gives one more overall privilege. 		Edit:Spelling/grammar		Edit: I would also like to be clear that I do not think that privilege is inherently bad. I actually believe very much in a fierce meritocracy. It's unearned privilege that is the problem, not privilege itself. Race itself is a nothing but a social construct but the fact of the matter is that society at large still does not seem to understand this, which is why we still need to use the language that we do when it comes to racial issues.

The game is about the slavic culture which isn't defined by national borders. As you say race is a cultural construct and remembering that I think it's very fair to say they have and still do face racism. 		> Anti-Slavism, also known as Slavophobia, a form of racism or xenophobia, refers to various negative attitudes towards Slavic peoples, most common manifestation being claims of inferiority of Slavic nations with respect to other ethnic groups. Its opposite is Slavophilia. Anti-Slavism reached its highest peak during World War II when Nazi Germany declared Slavs to be subhuman and planned to exterminate the majority of Slavic people.		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavic_sentiment		I'm aware that someone living in China probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference and would just think "oh, white person". The fact of the matter is that the majority of these people do not live in China. Nor do they live in the US. These people are not "winning" if they travel west to the richer part of Europe. People cry out that they're "stealing our jobs". I know a polish girl who quit her studies and went back home because she was too tired of dealing with the racism towards her. You're framing these issues very heavily from your own perspective and you're missing the point entirely. Please take a deep breath and let that sink in. 		The attacks on Witcher 3 is a textbook case of americentrism. Half of your comment is about racial issues in the US... You don't see how irrelevant that is.

Now here's the thing though, the narrative is a religious narrative that correlates directly to our world most of the time, of course they're not real in our world but like you stated before, we have to look at ancient history as a flat plain, in their world, the gods were real, mount olympus was their home and it existed as plain to their eyes as the internet we're using to talk over dozens if not hundreds of miles maybe. Harrypotter is actually two worlds that were once historically united but became diverged and one became hidden, in harrypotters universe wizards, witches, people like merlin are all historical figures, but to muggles(ordinary humans) this is utter fantasy, the oldest classical medieval fantasy we have. 	But the worlds are still relatively aligned, only diverging in perspective, The world wars happened, hitler i believe etc. The main point why i added the religious perspective is because these narratives were originally designed to explain our world, in the 1,300 bc nobody knew why the sun rose, that's why the came up with the flaming chariot and helios pulling it across every day. To explain the natural phenoma of our world, we cannot distinctly differentiate these narratives from our world because they're intrinsically part of these human cultures, man was not built in the image of god, god was built in the image of man.

{"body":"Eh, I have legitimate gripes with the game that have nothing to do with their portrayal of women. Obviously these are all personal preference, I'm glad people love the game.

It feels really good at the beginning, until you realize that what you see in the tutorial is all there is to it. There isn't very many interesting ways to use it: dodge/block and attack during openings, or else cast the spell that monster is weak against. It changes very little from the tutorial opening. The crossbow is worthless unless the enemy is airborne,  and you don't really get any new abilities outside of some minor variations on the extremely limited spell repertoire you have. 		* The inventory is kind of a mess and feels dated. Everything about it feels very "last gen" so to speak. I feel many modern RPGs have taken a better approach to updating weapons and progressing the strength of your character without overloading you with minor improvements to numbers. This is more of a personal preference thing, but I kind of thought we moved past looting bullshit off the ground and selling it. 		* Geralt's voice acting is utterly horrendous and distracts from otherwise great narrative sequences. 		* Running across buried treasure or hidden diaries only to be unable to complete the sequence because i'm 15 levels under the chimera it spawns is ... a bit of a buzzkill. 		* Tremendous side-quest overload. That feeling of "I just don't want to do any of these... but I have to to level up" hit me really hard. Much of the writing for the side quests is superb (truly I hope the writers for this game get some big recognition), but the quests themselves are quite bland. Way too much "hunt the red tracks."

My friend, that is what's known as an example. You don't even have to leave White Orchard to see several examples of stupidly sexualized women, almost every single one of them looks like a god damn supermodel.		>  Do women not take baths now or something?		Not like that they fucking don't, and they don't do it in front of some weird ass dude they just met.

The problem I have is that it seems like the guys at CDPR never actually learned anything from that. They didn't genuinely see the problem with their portrayal of women so the seeds are still very much there, they just made superfluous changes and removed the horrendous stuff like that without tackling the underlying problem, which is that they're a bunch of horndogs and they're letting that fact taint their game.

{"body":"And now it's called DLC. Who cares what it's called.		The question is still the same: is the content worth the price?		You can sell DLC that isn't worth the price (and publishers do), and you could sell expansion packs that weren't worth the price (and publishers absolutely did that too).		The only difference with DLC is that there's a minimum amount of content/price that you can offer with an expansion pack - because production and distribution had a higher overhead, it wasn't feasible to offer small bits of content for small amounts of money. If you had an idea for a "small expansion pack"...too bad. You couldn't do it. An expansion pack required a whole new box, an advertising campaign, shipping, production, distribution. DLC offers a strict superset of the things expansion packs did.		For instance, you can *absolutely* have small DLCs that are still worth paying for. The question is whether the price is reasonable for the content you get. You can have a small amount of content, far less than an expansion pack's worth, for a small price, far less than an expansion pack would cost, and it could absolutely be DLC worth paying for.		The problem is that a lot of DLC is priced too high relative to the content you get. It doesn't matter whether the DLC is small or large, it matters whether the price seems fair. And that's not by any means a new problem or a problem created by DLC - expansions had the same problem.","depth":3,"score":65,"ups":65,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"M0dusPwnens","name":"t1_cugv7om","parent_id":"t1_cugsx39","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440660700,"created_utc":1440631900}

{"body":"For me personally I found the combat somewhat boring and the progression in general to be outright awful. The crafting and loot systems are both awful. You will never find Loot worth having, there is always something better to craft, and an abundance of crafting materials. Even then you only need to craft once or twice every 8 levels or so.  It's not balanced at all. I may as well be playing a generic action game, this is barely an RPG.		The open world is also meaningless because Geralt gains omnipotent knowledge of the world around him by reading 6 notes about lost chickens on a notice board, and the map becomes littered with secrets....no sense in exploring when you know exactly where everything will or won't be.		The game also has loads of unecessary and overt sexualization that just makes me uncomfortable in general. Probably in part because I'm gay, but also in aprt because I don't like the character I'm forced to play- A man with a wife that he doesn't seem to mind ignoring and fucking other women behind her back every 10 feet, and a man who associates himself with an extended friend group apparently consisting almost entirely of women with giant breasts and loose hips. 		Mostly I lost interest due to the exploration being trivialized, the loot system being worse than Skyrim, and the controls being clunky as all fuck without any finesse. Dark Souls is clunky but in a controllable way with purpose. Skyrim is clunky but in a playable way with precise movement. Witcher 3 is clunky because the controls are **bad**. Also, the game's UI is designed around consoles, and it suffer(ed) from severe issues that any competent developer should NEVER make- **especially** when they *fixed those problems in earlier titles. Witcher 1 and 2 both had problems with inventory tabs, sorting, weird placement of inventory items, etc. They both had fixes for those problems. And then Witcher 3 launches with those very same basic UI problems anyone can point out the flaws with in 20 minutes of gameplay? Come on. That's unacceptably shoddy.		The game is hardly the amazing best RPG ever people make it out to be.

I guess it's a game you have to immerse yourself in completely.		>intricate crafting and potioning		Their complexity are exaggerated, you just need a few of those. Never was really big about bombs before witcher 3 for some reason.		My main issue with witcher 2 was the balance.		You go from getting occasionally gangraped by a bunch of nekkers to being an almighty god, and don't get me wrong, I like to feel powerful, but if you throw me a final boss I can outright ignore because I've got the appropriate resistance and slice down in a dozen attacks, it's a bit too much.		>And I don't really care for the combat tbh. Dodge, slash, dodge, dodge slash. Pot/spell/grenade, dodge-slash.		The first game had more of a hack'n slash type of gameplay, you could play it in isometric view with mouse only and a few hotkeys for fighting stances and elixirs. 		It makes for a really comfy gameplay which doesn't require you to engage as much as required by the action-rpg nature of later games. (Great for gaming in an altered state)		A lot of people didn't like it, I guess because it was a bit rough around the edges, but I still can't say which one of the three is my favorite, each of them having their strengths and weaknesses.		All three of the games are perfectly suited for multiple playthrough, I consider 3 to be the optimal number.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ezaruz","name":"t1_cuh95si","parent_id":"t1_cuh8o75","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440691941,"created_utc":1440663141}

{"body":"I can't speak for /u/jwikked, but for me a second playthrough was on Death March making different decisions than my first playthrough. Death March is definitely a challenge (especially the first 10 hours of the game) so it will keep you constantly working to better your character so you stand a chance in fights, as well as ensuring your fighting mechanics are on par with where they need to be. Rarely in my first playthrough did I struggle with monsters leveled 7-9 over me. In Death March, killing those monsters at that level disparity without AMAZING gear is nearly impossible unless your fight mechanics are truly superb.		I'm going to continue THIS playthrough (on death march) into the expansions when they release. It truly is a great game with small little details that I didn't find until my second playthrough.

I know it's to add to the challenge, and the concept is cool at first, but that wears off fast and you start to feel like you're just grinding for food/money to buy food.

{"body":"Yes, IBM hires everything.		IBM is pretty much like Google, just that most people don't realize it and think all it does is make IT shit for other companies and maybe producing stuff like Watson. IBM is involved in solar, self-driving cars, etc. They invest in pretty much everything that's new. There are even roles for historians and whatnot.		I don't know any IBM office that doesn't have a business development department that always love people with a background in analytics. There also are in-house consultants, project planners, demand planners, production planners, project managers, data analysts. All kinds of jobs where a business analyst is more than suited to fill the roll. Hell, you need analysts for any larger project. 		Not to mention that if you have a passion for something IBM is involved in or even just have your own project you can pitch to IBM, they often will support applicants.		Just contact HR at whatever IBM office is closest to you and ask whether they have a job for you, then apply.		If they aren't hiring, get to know some IBMers in your area. Use linkedin. Make connections and get a job when the next opportunity comes. However, note that while the work at IBM is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed, it is NOT a super safe job. If you aren't actually good, you *will* get kicked out quickly.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lobsterbreath","name":"t1_cugush0","parent_id":"t1_cugu3jq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1440659961,"created_utc":1440631161}

I decided to simply not be a dumbass consumer who pays whatever they want to charge - when they jacked up the price to a level that I found offensive, I stopped being a "console nut" - I didn't even buy the new consoles.

Consider CD/DVD players as an example, the first "niche market"/"early adopter" models sell for *thousands* of dollars.  Then, the market expands, production expands, competition increases, the prices go down to the *hundreds* of dollars, eventually, the prices drop even lower and you have generic versions selling for as little as 10% of the price of the first premium brand ones that were available.		You argue that "production costs have gone up" so?  The cost of producing chip fabrication plants that turn out millions of chips is also much higher, but the cost per chip could be just a few dollars, wheras the original CPUs many years ago might have cost thousands of dollars each.

The part where it only made $63 million in a quarter, or $35 million less than small ass studio, Bohemia Interactive made on the DayZ Early Access Alpha sales on PC only. 		And then compare that to a CoD titles sales numbers, which are over $1 billion. So, no. Game studios are never going to say,		"I know we're making about 5% of our potential, but you know what feels better than $25 million annual bonuses? Happy fans." 		Not enough studios to matter, anyways. Because human nature, that's why. I mean, Game of fucking War has made over a billion. $65 million is a slap in the face. Game of War debs cut checks 5 times that size to pay Apple for in-app purchases on their vile P2W piece of shit game. 		It actually makes me a little angry. Brilliant devs bring a good honest product and utilize honest business practices and make minuscule percentages of what studios that shit out rehashed garbage earn annually. 		The money is there.

The cash is just flowing to out-of-touch suits that have no business being in the same building as game devs instead of those who are delivering the products and creative content. 		But, that begs another question. If Witcher 3 was a better title, why does CoD sell orders of magnitudes higher volume? Better game is subjective. Objectively, CoD sells way more.

The point of this article is that they actively decided not to include DRM, as many paying consumers dislike having restrictions placed upon something they've paid for, or prefer to avoid potential issues arising from poor implementation, and that this decision didn't somehow result in everybody pirating their product and it becoming an unprofitable nightmare. Pirates still pirated it, sure, but a huge number of people were more than willing to shell out for it, despite the fact that they could have easily obtained it through less than legal means.		Essentially, it goes some way to show that DRM has virtually no effect on piracy. Release a good product that's worth the price of entry, and the people are more than happy to pay for it even if they could get it for free elsewhere.		And that's what a lot of it boils down to: Making a good product and providing value.

{"body":"I thought the game was awesome in it's scope and state of the art graphics but for me it was a little long winded with the dialog, the combat was mediocre at best, most of the crafting seamed worthless because by the time you go through the hassle of making a sword its already too weak and you need a new higher level one, it lends itself to giving you the bad ending by being an overprotective father figure, and it has absolutely zero replayability at least to me anyway. I wasn't into the Gwent . If I want to play a game like that, then I'll play flash game on the Internet or an Android game on my tablet. 		And I'm a big RPG fan. Some of my favorites were Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I liked Farcry4, Fallout 3, Dragon's Dogma, Final Fantasy . They were all good games because they balanced out an excellent combat system with the cut scenes. If Witcher 3  would have concentrated more on the actual combat and and the actual gaming aspects and less on the cutscenes, it would have been a much better game imo. It spent way too much on voice acting and cuts scenes and not enough on good gaming.  Actually now that I think about it, Witcher 3 really isn't an RPG in the true sense of the genre. There was no stats that you leveled up to increase your abilities you just leveled up your ability to use better gear and pick higher level signs to use.... So even the RPG elements are dumbed down. It was an okay game to play and I thought some of the story telling was really good but the seemingly sparse combat that was average at best left me a little  flat.   As for open world games, Farcry4 was better because of the gaming challenge of taking  an outpost with being detected. 		I sold mine back in about a week after it was released and ended up only paying a dollar for it. How you may ask, Best Buy gamers club, got 20% off and paid $51 with tax, and sold it back for $38 had some reward points totaling up to $50 and got it for a $1.
