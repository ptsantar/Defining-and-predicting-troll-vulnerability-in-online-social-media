{"body":"From Wikipedia..		>A dropbear or drop bear is a fictitious Australian marsupial.	Drop bears are commonly said to be unusually large, vicious, carnivorous marsupials related to koalas (although the koala is not a bear) that inhabit treetops and attack their prey by dropping onto their heads from above They are an example of local lore intended to frighten and confuse outsiders and amuse locals, similar to the jackalope, hoop snake, wild haggis or snipe. Stories of attacks by the fictional animal are commonly told to scare tourists.	Various methods suggested to deter drop bear attacks include placing forks in the hair, having Vegemite or toothpaste spread behind the ears or in the armpits, urinating on oneself, and only speaking English in an Australian accent.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SilverCrusader_","name":"t1_cty739y","parent_id":"t1_cty3zga","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1439258730,"created_utc":1439229930}

This argument is both near-sighted and painfully illogical.		First of all, opinions aren't called universal facts for a reason; what you find annoying as hell might be perfectly fine for someone else. 		Secondly, just because the tools are available, doesn't mean that people want or even care about using them. I'm not 'acting like I would have never seen it if it weren't for reposting content' (which is very poorly worded btw,) what I'm 'acting like' is that I really don't give a fuck that it's there because I only ever look at the first couple of pages of top posts, mostly just on the front page, and then I go on to something else. And that's how a very large portion of average redditors check their subs as well.		Third, and most importantly, being condescending to someone for stating a reasonable, statistical, and personal fact by pointing out another fact that doesn't actually counter the first fact in any way and then defending that statement by trying to take a logical high ground isn't just ignorant and ill-conceived, it flat out makes you look like a conceded child.
