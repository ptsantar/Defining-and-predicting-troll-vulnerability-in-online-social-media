One guy on the phone said my account was hacked but the supposed hacker didn't change my password or charge anything, they just deactivated my PS4. It made no sense and it seemed like it was just a problem that could easily be fixed. I asked him if someone were to hack my account and charge $1 million worth of games, the only thing I could do is wait six months and then try to reactivate my PS4? He said YES and pretended to transfer me and hung up. 		When I called the last time, I skipped the PS4 help line and went to the generic help line. The awesome lady on the line saw what the other reps had put into the notes about my account, practically said they were stupid for not fixing the problem, and corrected my account within minutes. Skip the PS4 line and get another help line via the phone. 		The idea that someone actually hacking my account and locking me out of my games for six months because of an arbitrary policy blows my mind.

{"body":"Similar customer service horror story.		Around Black Friday I decided to buy a Xbox One, but I was keen on getting the best deal. I browsed deal sites for days until I caught wind that Kohls had a 20% discount that could be stacked with a 10% discount and used towards the Xbone's $380 price (I can't remember the actual price only the amount disputed over). The total came out to something like $280 which is a steal. So I put in the order and it goes through but by the end of the day it's cancelled. So I call up figuring I'd at least take a whack at asking why and maybe get a suitable answer. The first call I made went to a call center in India, the guy explained to me that it was something about the codes that wouldn't work. There were definitely a language barrier issue, it was late, I got the gist of the idea and figured I'd call back the next day to get a better idea. The next day I call and get a nice guy, he tells me he doesn't understand why it was cancelled and it must be my bank account. At this point I'm hopeful, so I call my bank account, deal with them for like 45 minutes, they have zero idea what Kohls is going on about. I call back to Kohls, I talk to maybe 4 or 5 other associates over the period of 2 hours as they try to figure it out, I keep getting passed on and on. Finally I get a really nice woman who says she's going to push the order through at the original price and then manually refund me the difference. (Basically I'd be charged $380 then refunded $100) I was like, fantastic, y'all are awesome!			My Xbox comes, it's the bare bones model but I'm not complaining I feel like I got the deal of the century. I wait a week for my refund.... then another... three weeks go by and I end up calling Kohls back. I explain the situation and am told that the original order used codes that should not have been able to work, the workers should not have pushed it through and I was basically being charged the full amount. (Now mind you I had to contact them to find this out and this is like weeks after I've set up this Xbox and been charged for it.) I ask to talk to the manager, he tells me he's sorry but he can't help me. I tell him I feel I was sold this under false pretenses, I was told one price, sold it under that and then Kohls refused to honor it. He admits they're at fault but stands pat on the full price part, at this point I'm reaching levels of rage I've never gotten with a stranger. Finally he agrees to bring it down $20 compared to the original $100. I tell the guy that's not cutting it. He then tells me that in his call logs he see's that the Indian guy told me that the codes couldn't be stacked with electronics and implies that I was scamming the company, I tell him I couldn't understand that guy and I feel pretty offended, not to mention why I am eating the cost for multiple employee errors. I start asking to cancel my Kohls card which surprise, surprise makes him change his tune. Finally after much haggling he goes "$80 is really the absolute most I can give back.... hey $80 is pretty good!"  I respond "You're right, $80 is pretty good, but not when someone promised you $100!" He then goes on this long winded rant about how he can't eat more than $80 as if the $20 more is the cornerstone of the Kohls franchise and me having it will result in bankruptcy. I never got that $100 I was told I'd be refunded, only $80 and have boycotted Kohls since.		And that is the story of how Kohls sold me an Xbox at $280 but I paid $300.		It's not like $300 is a terrible price, I mean that's a steal too it's the fucking principle though. I was blamed, I was accused, no one ever contacted me, they were just going to never put the money back, they acted like their mistake didn't require them to maybe have to suck it up just a bit, etc. FUCK KOHLS","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Skurph","name":"t1_cpcy3y7","parent_id":"t1_cpc4ucz","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426222327,"created_utc":1426193527}

{"body":"They seem so easy to implement, I'm not sure why more companies don't use them.		Had to work to get my Skype account back recently. Apparently they deactivated it, but I was never notified until I tried to log in for the first time in months (installed it on my new Mac). Wanted to make sure everything would work for a trip I'm taking to China, and logging in met me with a, "Your account has been deactivated, please follow this link to reactivate it," link, which indicated they believed my account had a hack attempt on it.		The form asked for things like when I signed up for my account, and for at least five contacts on my friends list. Problem is, when they ask for when I signed up, do they mean the year I created my Skype account, or the year I merged it with my Microsoft account, because do they see the merge process as a new account setup? For friends do I enter their real names since you can establish that on your account? Their actual Skype handle? Their current display name on Skype?		Third time through the form and enough bitching to customer service, and the form changed to a more basic setup that was a lot clearer, and my account was handed back to me within 5 minutes.		What's funny is I could still log in to MSDN and Xbox Live using *the same account credentials*. I downloaded Visual Studio Express 2013 recently, and had to have a code sent to my phone to fully activate it or whatever, so I'm surprised they don't have a similar process for Skype.

{"body":"Agreed. But it's not just PSN. I mean accounts across the board get hacked all of the time. It's part of the internet. It's like leaving your house wide open in a bad neighborhood and being surprised that someone comes in and steals your stuff. Authenticators are like dead bolts. They help slow down the problem, but won't fix it. Strong passwords help a lot too. Not reusing passwords. Just like for home security, there are basic steps you can take to protect your account. It doesn't all fall on the companies. If you make your password 1234 and someone gains access to your account, first, that was a crack, not a hack, and second, that was your fault.		Some companies aren't doing enough to stop the problem. Others are trying, but every change they make, the hackers figure out in a few days. And some things that get targeted make me scratch my head. Depression Bipolar Support Alliance's facebook page was targeted not too long ago. At the same time, hockey fan pages were targeted. Based on the posts, it was probably the same people. In the attitude of they should do something about it, it took two or three days for DBSA to get their page back. It's easy to sit back and say it shouldn't have taken that long, but we really don't know what was going on in the background. Just like we don't know what the gaming companies are doing to stop the attacks and fix them when it happens. All we know is there are investigations. A very generic term. We don't know what it entails. 		But we do know that having accounts hacked is part of being on the internet.

Sony could help with that, and might have an even better idea who it is, because they will know the serial number of the playstation that the account is connected to now (which is the playstation of the fraudster). That would hugely simplify the work of triangulating who has done it. 		It might seem like a lot of effort for relatively low level crime, but it's only through things like this that you effectively disincentivise the crime.

{"body":"Nah, setting up a VPN on a router? It's really easy. You could learn how to do it with 30-45 minutes of reading (and you probably should, honestly.) Right now, as far as Reddit's servers know I'm browsing from the completely opposite side of the country than I am actually located. VPNs are simple.		It's certainly easier than breaking into somebody else's PSN account assuming they were using a secure and unique password as they claim. Serial numbers, IP addresses, MAC addresses are all easy enough to spoof with the right know-how... if they were able to crack a secure password, they'd probably not have much trouble doing any of that other stuff to hide their identity.		Besides, do you really think any police are going to put forth any effort for $600 of stolen digital property? I don't... The average police department would not have the means to track something like this down, and even if they did it would likely cost them a lot more than $600 to do so. The most I'd expect any law enforcement agency to do is say "tough luck" and go on about their business. I think you give law enforcement too much credit with regards to their technical capabilities and/or their interest in seeking out and stopping ALL crime, or disincentivizing crime. They're out there to stop BIG crimes (meth labs for instance, from which they make a tidy profit through asset forfeiture) or smaller arbitrary ones that are easy (i.e. traffic citations... which, again, those people have to pay the tickets.) If the cost is greater than the potential gain, it's not something they'd begin to mess with.		How many arrests have you ever heard about over stolen WoW accounts? How many stolen WoW accounts have you heard of? 		This kind of thing just would not be a big deal to any law enforcement agency at all.		Sony on the other hand, [has an established history of legal action against those who misuse their products/services.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_America,_Inc._v._Hotz)		They'd likely be the ones to pursue this... not law enforcement (DEFINITELY not law enforcement for only ~$600 worth of digital content.)		The credit card company could halt the payment with a single phone call, but Sony has the most to lose in terms of PR, and the most to gain by rectifying the situation quickly.		IF this goes anywhere past returning the account to the OP and maybe some policy changes on their part (and I think that's a BIG if...) it'd be a civil action by Sony, but only **IF** they can identify the individual who did this.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"odichthys","name":"t1_cperbvs","parent_id":"t1_cpdtxxx","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426380417,"created_utc":1426351617}

I actually end up refunding fees for customers that they clearly got for just spending too much money in order to try to be nice. Not sure where the 203 million in unjust overdrafts came from but I can assure you that every company has some sort of lawsuit against it. I just feel like people got wind of the Mcdonalds coffee incident and decided to look for something to get upset and sue about. Maybe it's just me, but why do people always have so many problems with everywhere they go? I think I have MAYBE over drafted 3 times since I was 14...

{"body":"You're argument is you refund lots of fees so you don't know where they got the 203 million dollar number. Well, since you are the one who pointed it out in the first place, I feel I need to mention that not all experiences across the board with a company are the same. So you, one person in one branch, not seeing an issue does not mean one does not exist. By this logic, since I eat everyday there must not be a hunger problem in my state.  		In reality Wells Fargo is a massive company. You working there probably exposes you to less than a 100th of 1% of the companies business practices. Outside of what happens in your branch you have no way of knowing what really goes on. But since there was a class action lawsuit and Wells Fargo had to bring information on the topic to the courts I'm going to have to go ahead and believe the facts in the court case vs the opinion of one teller/loan officer.		Of course things will be different from branch to branch. That's how retail operations work. But when it comes down to the order in which you have the system processes withdrawals it has absolutely nothing to do with you or anyone in a branch. There is literally no way your experience in the branch can constitute even an educated guess at the inner workings of the company and their high level decision making. 		But the company stopped doing the rearranging thing in 2011. So this is was before your time based on what you said. I guess because you came on afterwards you'll ignore previous shady action. 		Also, what a red herring "every company has a lawsuit" is. Yes, lots of people get sued but that doesn't mean we should ignore when a company gets sued just because it's frequent. You need to look at the type of suit, what the charges are and the companies reaction among other things. I suppose we should ignore the most recent thing they were sued for then. http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/05/us-wells-credit-settlement-idUSKBN0L92C720150205","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Angry_Neeson52","name":"t1_cpcr140","parent_id":"t1_cpcmmz3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426211464,"created_utc":1426182664}
{"body":"I'm not quite sure why you're in an attacking mood but I'm simply stating what I believe to be the case and giving a reflection of my experiences.. I never said I could speak for the entire company or their operations definitively, however the article that you presented does directly impact the line of work I do for the bank. I've also have had  5 job titles and moved to several different markets within that time, so my scope of operations are more broad than you might think(obviously there is so much more to the company than what I have experienced). Don't make assumptions as to people's qualifications or experience simply to try to make your argument look more valid. Also the process of which the items are posted largest to smallest is still in practice so your facts are partially incorrect.  And no, I never once said that because I haven't experienced certain things with my clients that it doesn't mean they don't happen. I will say however being that I have worked as a teller up to where I am now I feel extremely confident I have a better understanding of my company and what goes on here than you do. Again please try to have a civil conversation instead of having an aggressive and accusatory tone. I appreciate all stand points to some level but there is no debating that if people budgeted properly and didn't spend more that what they had.... The way the overdrafts were processed wouldn't matter. Also I'm not saying that companies being sued is a good thing, but it's hard to take things seriously when people sue companies at the drop of a hat. To sum all of this up because I don't want this ending up like those awkward Facebook fights... I personally have not had a negative experience as a customer and employee, but that doesn't mean others haven't. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but please don't scream from the roof top to others that they are guaranteed to have a bad time when they couldn't know that for certain. Warn people of your experience if you feel compelled to but also let them know that may not be an issue for them. EVERYTHING is subjective...

I would call the merchant and get the ip address used to order the product then run it through a website and see that it originated within a 15 mile radius of the customers home. Then I would tell them this and say we reserve the right to file a police report. 9 times out of 10 they would hang up the phone. The other time you may hear a bank say they involve the police is to comfort the customers who need their hand held through every step of the fraud process and have this weird desire for justice over money that in the end is not even affecting them. What people fail to realize with fraud claims is that it is built into the banks budget. The bank I worked at our goal was to stay under 52 Million dollars in fraud loss a year. It would cost the bank WAY WAY WAY more money to investigate fraud up until prosecution that it would be to just pay it out to the customer. A bank is a bank and the police are the police.

A previous call center guy screwed up your account?  Signal was bad out of town?  Imaginary savings at another company (get creative)?  Another company has offered to buy out your contract  (this doesn't have to be true)?  You get the idea.  Get them on the defensive right away.  Keep them there.	  		Always be polite as fuck.  You can be cleverly condescending while maintaining a cheery tone.  Appeal to their rationality.  Make them see your problem from a customer's perspective. 		Move as quickly as you can to the highest level of management you can.  Confuse as many reps as you can on your way up.  Account retention *supervisors* have nearly always been the best.  They will give a direct number that they actually answer, and they even hold to their word to call you back themselves.  They also have the power to apply credits and send devices to retain your service.		Again, niceness.  Use any leverage you can no matter how irrelevant it may be to your request.  Your plan is too expensive?  The plan you've been on for years?  Guess what, Verizon is probably now or soon doing some maintenance on towers near you.  Complain your signal is slow or you haven't been able to get service in your house sporadically.  Important to say sporadically because they can tell if you have been using your phone in your house.  They can't prove that you weren't trying from 2-7am while you were sleeping.  But you tell them you were and it wasn't available.  You can be an unethical whacko and say your mom had a fall and couldn't get hold of you.  I dont approve of that but it works. 		Knowing more about specifics of the network than the person on the phone is easy.  Google Verizon news and pick a few things like lawsuits, mergers, etc that can be referenced to make them think you know more than that and likely more than they do.  When they submit that you're in control, you win.   Always ask their name and id number, and how to call them back. News flash, you can't call them back.  And you cannot report them.  Ask them if they agree that that is a shitty business practice and even slightly unethical.   Know about your state lemon law regarding cellphones. 	Never give up.  If you don't get the results to need, hang up and try a different person.   Somebody will fold.  It can be time consuming at first, but once you get better it gets quicker.		--		This isnt perfect and jts sloppy but its a start.  Keep notes of your calls, they do!

{"body":"Well I have only had to contact Steam support once, so this may not be the case for most people, but it was a terrible experience.  I bought Star Wars: Republic Commando and when I tried to play it, it said I did not have a working CD-key.  I thought that maybe copying from the clipboard didn't work and so punched in the key manually, still didn't work.  I contacted customer support and they told me that they had that problem on some games because they didn't have enough CD-keys to go around so some people shared them.  Apparently someone else had my guy and used it first so mine was not elligible anymore through Steam.  After asking why they were selling games beyond the point of obtainable CD-keys they told me that as more came in they would add them to the accounts.  When I asked for a refund I was told that I had purchased the game and there was nothing they could do.		I think that Steam is great for all the game and deals they offer but God forbid something should ever happen, if it does then you are royally screwed.		On that note I am constantly confused as to why Origin is so hated when I have had only great customer service.  When I bought ME3 on Origin, right as it came out, I was having an issue where the save file would randomly disappear at times.  I called in and they said that it was a rare issue that some players were experiencing and they had not found  a fix for it yet.  As the game has just come out I could understand them still trying to resolve this issue that very few peopl were experiencing, (seriously, I couldn't even find anything online at the time of people having that problem) but I was understandably upset that I bought a game I would not truly be able to finish.		The guy on the line said he understood the frustration and offered to give me my money back.  I said I did want a refund and that I would wait a few months before purchasing it again.  The guy told me that all they had been able to figure out was that it was an issue with the EA server so if I played offline it would be fine.  They then said that they refunded the money and removed Mass Effect 3 logins for the EA server but not Origin.  They gave me my money back but let me keep the game so I could play it in offline mode!		The story doesn't end there though!		About six months later I re-bought ME3; I had already beaten the game but it was so good I felt it deserved my money, and I wanted to try the multiplayer.  I had an issue though with the game though and so I called back in to Origin support line they have online.  I talked to a guy who said he had to escalate it to another team, but that team was about to end for the day.  He said he would put me on hold and try to see if he could get something figured out.  I was on hold for 2 hours (not an exaggeration) before the guy came back.  The guy probably knew I was upset but before I could even make mention of it he told me that he managed to grab the supervisor of the escalation team and they had been working on finding the problem the last two hours.  They finally found that it was something that was my fault, I forgot to remove the ME3 I had to play offline after re-purchasing it.  The guy said even though it was on my end he was sorry to have had me on hold so long but if he ended the call he would not have been able to call back due to the closing hours and so had to keep the line connected.  Due to my having been on hold for so long, and even though the original issue was on my end, they ended up gifting me all the DLC that was out.

And if he wants to do fraud again, he will need to buy a new ps4.  Sony could implement a reauth that any new content on a new ps4 that is less than 3 months old on an account will need to reauth after 30 days to permanently work in offline mode.  That way a scammer that does this can't even have functioning content on an offline playstation after 30 days.  The amount of legit people with less than 3 month old consoles that have internet today, but won't still have it in 30 days is probably none.  Disclosing this limitation up front would avoid issues.		Also sony can implement two factor authentication, they have no right to blame the user if they don't offer two factor.		On top of that, they could easily tie a payment method to a console.  If you deauth your playstation and auth a new one, force the user to revalidate their payment info. It makes no sense not to do this.  when a deauthed playstation can't be readded for 6 months, no one is going to be deauthing to add a friends console for a few days.  So since deauth and reauth is litterally only done for a console replacement, people can reasonable be expected to readd payment info when replacing a console.		There is a metric fuck ton of things sony can do to prevent this fraud and they aren't doing any of them.  Not a single security measure to prevent fraud.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"freedom135","name":"t1_cpclpst","parent_id":"t1_cpcah86","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426202874,"created_utc":1426174074}

{"body":"I used to work billing/retention for what I can legally only refer to as a LARGE COMPETITOR TO SONY/PLAYSTATION (I shit you not, as blatantly obvious as that statement can be, we were hired on through a 3rd party, and were forced to sign contracts upon being hired saying we were not allowed to say who the client we were representing was, outside of actually being at work). I only bring this up in response to THIS particular comment because where we were, "you'll get the same answer from my supervisor" was a 100% legit statement. They would come look at the user's accounts on OUR computers, look at the exact same information as us, and genuinely did not have the authorization to really do anything more than we could. But it also wasn't used as a cop-out. We wouldn't deny the people the option to speak to a supervisor, we would just put it as "I'd be happy to, but I will say that they won't have any more information than I do. If you'd still like, I'll go ahead and flag one down for you". On one hand, it was kind of a good thing for the company to have it so clear that all of us, even at the lowest level, were still able to provide 100% accurate information. At the same time, I know what it's like as a customer to be so in need of help that you look for higher options, and actually having none is pretty shitty.		That all being said: surprisingly, despite the negativity directed at us (really less because of the PRODUCT'S reputation as opposed to the COMPANY'S reputation), we really weren't quite as strict. Unfortunately, there was still the necessity for investigations to take place in regards to unapproved purchases, but we could more often than not at least offer some options to help, during the time of the investigation. Subscription purchases could still be reversed if done in a certain window of time, payment information could be removed to prevent further purchases from being made, and investigations were based off of whether or not purchases were made on your trusted CONSOLES. If it was on a different machine, it would often result in a successful fraud investigation that led to a turnover of those purchases (that being said, unfortunately nothing could be done if the purchases were made on YOUR system, even if you weren't the one who did it... "you're responsible for who does and doesn't use your account on your system" kind of shit).		And for the record: I WAS NOT ON THE INVESTIGATIONS TEAM. If somebody genuinely had a different experience, please understand I ONLY worked in billing and had a very rudimentary understanding of the process and what we could or couldn't do, before you go flame happy on me. I do completely understand that there are quite likely cases out there that did not go so well. But I also want people to understand what kind of power is and isn't held by the low-tier teams you call (whose work is likely being contracted out to other customer service centers). There likely always are bigger steps you can take and high places you could take your issues to, but I can tell you from first hand experience, the guy who is answering your calls/messages HAS NOT been provided with the information needed to take it there.

{"body":"I can not stress enough the importance of not having your primary credit/debit card on any internet service. Most banks (if not all) will allow you to create a virtual card you have to charge with money. Keep in that card a minimum amount there for whatever you may want, but whenever you want to buy something more expensive, just add the credit you need and buy straight away. Save yourself some trouble in case shit happens.		EDIT: In case someone is still a bit lost on this, the idea here is to create a virtual card in your bank. You should be able to do this online without too much trouble, for free, but depending on your bank this may be a bit hidden. Just call and ask if you can not find it in your online control panel. In that card you keep a minimum of around 10€ for the ocasional steam, psn or android sale. You can link this card to steam, google play, paypal, ... to all regards it works like a normal card except that it does not have a tangible plastic associated. It will even get renovated automatically when the date expires if you so desire it. It has number, date, CCV, name.. anything you may expect to operate with it. In my case, to charge my card I have to do a two step process with two passwords, one of them is a one time only sent to my phone when I am doing the operation. The money goes instant and most of the time I do the charge when I am at the final checkout phase.	If the card has no money or the amount of money in it is not enough to cover a specific purchase, the operation will simply not work. There is no red numbers here, it will simply cancel the operation (I have seen this more than once in steam...). At any time you can delete that card and create another one, though I do not know the specifics on this and probably each bank will have its own rules. The point is that if for any reason your card gets "stolen" and someone robs you 3€, you can delete it with a click. I feel tremendously more safe using this card, and let me tell you, I have avoided some purchases I would have regret later!

I had my friend get his account stolen on Xbox Live years ago. As stupid as it is, my friend (then roommate) decided to put my pre-paid card on his account to buy a DLC. He figured I wouldn't notice the 2.99. 		WELL, after his account got stolen, the thief bought a year of XBL using my card. 		I contacted microsoft, and had to talk to them for days to explain that either:		A) My card was used fraudulently, and must be refunded or I will contact my bank about the refusal to refund my money, or 		B) The account should be given to me, as MS was claiming "i made the purchases but didn't want to pay". 		In the end I got the account, they restored the account password, and gave me my money back. 		This of course took a few debates with MS, but I was never threatened with a ban or told to fuck off - but then again the charges were <100 bucks, so who knows how it would have gone if it had been 5 years of XBL or some shit. 		TLDR - MS Support is much better, but still tedious and rule-based. Credit-Card reversals harm a businesses ability to take credit cards, so they use Bans as a punishment to stop people from defending their credit and wallets.

{"body":"It's probably not a "hack" of any kind and you're right this could happen on XBL. However, this **IS** Sony's (lack) of security at fault and I'll tell you why. Microsoft takes customer data and fraud prevention seriously. XBL supports two factor authentication. Steam supports two factor authentication. PSN does not. PSN has a long history of terrible security, including multiple breaches exposing customers's personal and/or financial information. Still no two factor authentication. No *real effort* to protect customer data or guard against fraud. You don't think they couldn't automatically detect multiple hundreds of dollars of transactions on this account in a short period of time (assumedly from a different IP) as unusual and suspicious? They could have and should have automatically taken steps to protect this customer and their account. But yeah, you're right it's definitely also about appalling customer service. I'd say it goes beyond poor customer service into the realm of actively participating in defrauding this customer. It's pretty clear their policy is to keep anything after $150 in fraudulent charges. They even keep the $150 because they only issue a wallet credit. I'm guessing a court would take a very dim view of such a policy. If this is their official policy I would assume there are others who have been defrauded by Sony.

{"body":"This will probably get lost in here now, but Sony customer service is one of the worst I have ever had to contact. I contacted Sony around two years ago to cancel my PS+ subscription as I had no plans to buy a PS4, and didn't really care for the free games (everything I really wanted, I had on disc). The Playstation website back then would not allow you to do it online, the only way was to do it via PS3, or by contacting customer support. I called customer support about a month before my renewal date, who fully assured me the automatic renewal had been turned off. A month later, and lo and behold £40 out my bank and I have a new year of PS+. I immediately contacted Sony again, and was repeatedly told that customer services were not able to cancel auto renewal over the phone, it MUST be done via the website or the console. Now a few years ago, you absolutely COULD NOT do it via the website. I even screenshotted the FAQ page that specified I had to do it via the console or customer services, but then customer services told they couldn't do it and I should use the website (I didn't actually have access to my PS3 online at that time, so I couldn't use that). Even though I'd shown them proof that the website couldn't so it and it directed me to them.		Sony managers were outright rude and arrogant, and refused to believe there was a problem. They refused to refund me, and similar to OP said, if I had my bank reverse the charge they would ban my account. I know a £40 renewal is nothing compared to OP's problem, but the way Sony respond to these things is cartoonishly bad. I had a problem with Microsoft billing, contacted them and I was refunded immediately, they couldn't stop apologising to me when it was a mere misunderstanding, nothing they particularly messed up. It is utterly impossible to escalate any issue you have with Sony, they will not give out contact details for real complaints to anyone but their own services department and the managers there are even more condescending than the regular staff.		That whole episode really damaged my view of Sony as a company, and I now avoid Sony products and services full stop, I will not support any company that thinks it's ok to treat its customers like total shit. From OP's story it seems the US customer service branch is exactly as bad as the UK one.

{"body":"Good Luck Mate, i have experienced the same shady business practices from Sony.		A few months ago, fraudulent activity on my Sony account caused the adding of $80 to my Sony wallet. I got an email alert immediately and was able to go into the account and change all the passwords and remove my card from the account. I even had the card on file deactivated by my bank.	Anyway, so there was $80 out of my bank account just sitting there in my PlayStation account. I called Sony and after waiting on hold with support for a good hour, they told me that they could not return the amount to my bank account, and that they couldn't help me further. Their advice was 'to reset my passwords' so this doesn't happen again.	I was furious. This was my hard earned money, and they had no right to refuse a refund even though it was clearly a fraudulent transaction. The money hadn't even been spent, it was just sitting there in the PlayStation account, where it can only be used to purchase downloadable software from Sony.	So I called my bank and began a fraudulent activity claim.	Anyway, cut to tonight when i want to watch Netflix on my PS3. I get an error saying that my account is suspended and that i need a valid account to use any online services. I do some research and dig up this gem :	https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1260/kw/reverse%20charges	Clearly stating "A console or account may be banned due to having a credit card charge reversed or "charge back" resulting in debt. Acharge back can include credit card theft, identity theft, or non-approved use."	So basically Sony was unwilling to refund the money from my 'sony wallet' even though it was never spent, and now they have taken away my access to the games i purchased over the years through their online store (final fantasy, disgaea, etc..) and made it so that i cannot watch netflix or amazon instant video on my console anymore, all due to a security breach.	Suffice to say i am not purchasing a PS4 any time soon.

{"body":"So this is going to get buried because it's so late, but your thread made me realize that my account is banned too.		Last December my sony account, and only my sony account, was comprimised. I woke up to some texts from my bank saying my account was frozen due to suspicious activity. Somone from some country on the other side of the world bought 200 dollars worth of Fifa coins before Chase froze the account. I called my bank back, let them know what happened and they said not to worry about it, they would handle it.		I then called Sony and explained to them what happened. The guy i talked to was very helpful, and he just had me get my serial code off my Playstation and he was able to deactivate it for me and I was able to reactivate it from my console after that.		After that I was able to use my PS4 fine, since as late as mid Febuary. Last week I got a call from Chase and they wanted to double check some info with me about the fraudulent charges, I explained what happened and then I egt a letter in the mail saying the case was settled and they charges would all be reversed. I haven't played my PS4 since Feb, as I honestly only bought it to play Destiny with friends(LOL RIP ME), but this thread made me want to go on there and remove my CC info.		Welp, looks like sometime between Feb and now, likely right around the time chase called to confirm the fruad charges with me, my PSN account was banned. Not once ever did anyone from Sony contact me, or tell me anything about my account being banned. Even when I was on the phone with the guy getting my account back, he asked me if i needed help with any of the fraud charges, I said no, My bank is handling it, and he said Ok, no problem. Never did he mention I was going to get banned for a chargeback.		So, OP, if you see this and you get this handled I would love to know what I can do. I too had digital Last of Us(Fortunately Ive already beaten it) as well as Madden 25. So that sucks, but it isn;t the end of the world. What really gets me though is my friends plan on playing No Man's Sky, and I wanted to play that with them.

Good story I have: Sent in a ticket to Steam support asking about possible loaner accounts for a charity LAN I was setting up.

(Side note: emailed Epic Games the same question because we didn't have enough copies of UT, and eventually got an email from Mark Rein saying it was okay to pirate the games as long as we uninstalled them after the conclusion (we ended up not going that route, but still a nice gesture)).		Bad story I have: This last Christmas (I have 2 steam accounts so if a buddy doesn't have a game, etc) I logged into my second account and added my payment method. Added some wallet funds. Then when I went to purchase a game I was told that because my account recently had a new payment method added I would be unable to purchase items from the community marketplace or the Steam Store, and I would be unable to trade with other users for thirty days. I immediately contacted customer support asking why I was allowed to add funds to my account if I would be unable to use them, and if there was anything I could do.

{"body":"I had a very similar issue 2 weeks ago except it was only for $150 so Sony just issued a refund and apparently removed my credit card from my account. I tried telling them they had a security issue but was ignored. They also would not remove the hacker's PS3 from my account as I already had a deactivation on my account. The prior deactivation was when he deactivated my PS4 and activated his back in December. I was able to get that fixed in January and then 2 weeks ago he activated his PS3 on my account and charged the $150. So after being ignored by the customer support reps, I decided to at least post the story on PlayStation's forums and was met with victim blaming.

{"body":"OP, I know this is a lot of comments, but I hope this finds you. Please read this. A year ago a large... LARGE company sent me a bill for over 1,000.00. I argued and argued and got no where. They started sending me threatening letters, they even hit my credit with two different companies. I was partially in the wrong, but so were they. 		I made and documented 36... THIRTY SIX calls with the same outcome. They would not reverse the bill and would say threatening things. I got tired of screwing with it and filed a claim in small claims court in my city. It was quick and only cost me 80.00 to file and the only reason it was that high is because I paid for extras like certified mail and some other unneeded nonsense. Within a day of getting it a lawyer from the company called and asked to "settle" with me. I said "I want my bill taken to zero, I want my court costs reimbursed and I want to cost of going to the court house. I am not interested in anything else" and she said on the spot "deal!" and sent me paper work and a check for my court costs.		THIRTY SIX calls all the way up to the presidents office wouldn't resolve it. One letter from my local court resolved in in 2 minutes. They played hard ball for over a year. 2... minutes... with a piece of paper from the court system 2,000 miles away and now they wanted to settle. I could have named my price. They don't want even a remote chance of being beaten in small claims court because then EVERYONE will be suing them in small claims court. It's better to give me 5,000.00 in shush money than try to win 1k+ from me in small claims court and possibly lose. I didn't ask for more than I needed because I felt like it would be greedy, but I could have and I would have gotten it. 		The only solution you have imo is take them to court. They will settle. If not they have to send a lawyer, pay for the lawyer and risk losing. Sony doesn't want to lose or even remotely risk it. Do yourself a favor and go file in small claims court.

I just went to the [HP business outlet website](https://h41183.www4.hp.com/pps-offers.php) and I found a PC tower with Win8Pro ([~$130](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-8-1-System-Builder-64-Bit/dp/B00F3ZN0CC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1426206513&sr=8-2&keywords=windows+8.1+pro)), an intel core i7-4770 (~[$370](http://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-4770K-Quad-Core-Processor-BX80646I74770K/dp/B00CO8TBQ0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426209649&sr=8-1&keywords=intel+core+i7+4770K)), and 500 GB HDD (~[$50](http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-sata_6_0_gb-2-5-Inch-WD5000LPLX/dp/B00QFXOL5G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1426206639&sr=8-3&keywords=500GB+sata+hdd)), 4 GB ram (~[$40](http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-Unbuffered-240-Pin-CT51264BA160B/dp/B006YG89Q6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426206777&sr=8-1&keywords=4GB+DDR3+1600)), a DVD drive (~$20), a business type tower case (~$20), a PSU you'll need to replace ($0), and no dedicated graphics card. I'm sure there are other components in that mix you'll re-use as well, but I'm not going to actually open the spec sheet.		These components individually add up to $670. The tower is being sold for $499. That means you'll save a minimum of $170 when starting your build with this pre-built.		The cost of your gtx980 is about $650 on a good day. Its a pretty neat card, but any rig it comes preloaded on is going to be overpriced gamer shit. So, the cost of building the above tower with that card is $670+$60 PSU+$650 GPU = $1380. The cost of buying and retrofitting is $499+$60 PSU+$650 GPU = $1209. That is a 12% discount.		Of course, that isn't a huge savings, but it is still a pretty good start for 10 minutes of looking. The reason you save money is because the PC gamer market has a premium markup: Buyers are willing to pay not only for good hardware, but for the best. The pre-built gaming rigs are marked up 30%-40%, and the gamer specific parts are also marked up 30%-40%. If you buy a business type computer, you'll be paying a lesser markup for the included components. That's why all of my computers have been workstation type models. When you buy laptops, look for models marketed to graphics designers. Business stuff and overstock is simply cheaper.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpd6er4","parent_id":"t1_cpd1az7","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426236474,"created_utc":1426207674}

They don't care, and they already have language in their contracts that protects them from this kind of thing. The case would likely be thrown out on those grounds alone. They'd happily toss some associate at that case and walk out with a win or an order to pay that they would never fulfill, because the cost of pursuing it from OP's end would be more than $450. They don't have to wait out the public, or the courts. They just have to wait until OP is going to spend too much money on a lawyer, or until OP loses enough wages and/or opportunity cost with the time they'd have to invest on self-representation that the $450 simply isn't worth it.

{"body":"You're correct.		What happens when they don't show? OP wins.		What happens when they don't pay? Appeal time. Suddenly this is becoming a time investment.		What happens next? Appeals are vastly more complicated (although perhaps not in this situation). Even if Sony no-shows again (which I doubt, because they now know you're serious), they still may not pay despite any court orders.		Then what? Collections? Now you have given them a reason to possibly take you to court. Another appeal? You can only do that so many times. Call Sony asking for a check? Get ready for customer support to laugh you off the phone.		It's like I said earlier, just because the court orders me to pay you doesn't mean I'm going to. If I'm an incorporated entity, there's nothing the court can take from me unless the plaintiff gets an order to seize assets (which is a whole other level of pain in the ass).		Part of what I mentioned is that all this time is going to start cutting into OP's time. Regardless of the price being in wages or opportunity cost, that cost is going to cut into OP for more than $450 eventually especially if he goes without legal representation to do the legwork (which also puts him overbudget). Sony doesn't have to do anything but kick back and wait until he's spent more than $450 in lost wages or personal time and eventually he will give up. This works for two reasons:		1. Individuals are not made of money, and paying more than $450 to fight over $450 makes no fiscal sense to the average person.		2. Sony's licensing agreements absolve them of any responsibility anyhow, so if shit really hit the fan they not only wouldn't be liable but could go after OP for their own legal fees.

{"body":"A charge is what happens when you use your card. A merchant gets money from your account.		A chargeback is what happens when you give yourself a refund and charge the merchant's account and get your money back. Merchants are allowed only a certain number of chargebacks or Visa/MasterCard/etc. will terminate their contract. Therefore, merchants (i.e. Sony) tend to take chargebacks very seriously and will avoid them at all costs.		When there is fraud that involves an unauthorized user using your card, typically the credit card company will cancel your card, issue you a new one, and refund your money. Then, they will go after the merchant for the money they refunded. If the merchant refunds you, the credit card company will then charge you for the refund (basically if you had a $100 transaction, they'd give you $100, then the merchant gives you $100, then they take back $100, but spread this out over a month or two). If the merchant doesn't play ball, the credit card company takes it back ("chargeback") and this looks bad on their merchant history. This is all really painless for you.		If you had a situation where you actually authorized the transaction, but it billed you several times by mistake (like when Southwest had payment system malfunctions and charged people for 100 tickets instead of 1 a few years ago), they won't cancel the card, and will instead negate the transactions and work with the merchant to settle the books before anything posts. In the event that a merchant doesn't settle the books voluntarily, the credit card company will chargeback and most merchants in this situation will settle the chargeback (unless you're in the wrong, then the merchant will provide documentation that you authorized the transaction and used the purchase, etc.). The ones that don't will get their money taken from them, and the ones that don't resolve chargebacks often enough will not be allowed to accept Visa/MasterCard/etc. anymore. This is why you should stay far away from any places that have old credit card logos on the door but are cash only: they probably used to accept cards until they screwed some customers over!		Banks (i.e. if you have a debit card instead) typically require that you file a police report and you only have a limited amount of time (48 hours) to file a claim or you lose most rights to chargeback (some banks have built in insurance that extends the time). Banks treat fraudulent charge claims like insurance claims, because we're actually talking about cash money moving between accounts (credit card purchases are not cash money), so the risk is greater. Chargebacks at banks also typically cost money, again because the risk is greater to all parties involved if you are full of shit. If your transaction is processed via a credit card network (i.e., you do not run it debit), you get more rights than otherwise, but your rights are still very limited.		Fraudulent charges on a debit card can mean that you can't pay rent. **Never use a debit card** for this reason. Some places require one, but treat it like you're writing a check each time (and a check might be safer TBH: you can't skim a check's magnetic stripe). If you use a credit card and some tool runs up a $450 PSN bill, you can breathe while you resolve the problem and still pay rent and such. And you also generally will get the money credited to your account as soon as you call.		A merchant can't chargeback you. You have nothing to worry about - only merchants do. I think something like 0.1% of their transactions in a month can be chargebacks.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ZiggyTheHamster","name":"t1_cpcr65x","parent_id":"t1_cpckano","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426211680,"created_utc":1426182880}

I think it pretty much comes down to them knowing that they are such huge companies, and that there are so little options out there as far as competition goes, that they can treat even the most loyal customers like shit and it won't impact business in the least. occasionally if you happen to be a celebrity or a person with a voice and have a large enough platform to yell from like a popular blog/twitter followers/podcast/radio show, if your someone like that MAYBE then you can get something accomplished but that still only goes so far its a damn shame.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chippersan","name":"t1_cpca0q6","parent_id":"t3_2yq8oq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426165436,"created_utc":1426136636}

{"body":"This EXACT thing happened to me too. I was at work and started getting these emails from PSN. The first one said funds have been transferred from the card linked to my account to my PSN wallet and then three more e-mails thanking me for my purchases of Call of Duty Advanced Warefare, Battlefield 4 and Minecraft. And then a final two emails asking to confirm my email address to my account being changed and my password being changed. The hackers had purchased three games for a total of $119.97 and locked me out of my account. They also changed my PS4 from the primary on the account and made theirs the primary. I was able to talk to a customer care rep through their online chat and they were pretty helpful. I had to go through some steps to verify that I was the true owner of the account but after that they changed my e-mail and password back for me so I could regain access to the account. When it came time to ask about the refund they said that it was against policy but they would refund the money to my PSN wallet. I told them I really needed the money back in my bank account bacause it was a lot of money and they said it could take 30-60 days but they would return the money to my account. I guess I got lucky because it was less then $150, because otherwise it looks like I would have been screwed. It has been 48 days since I originally contacted them and I still have not received my refund as of yet, but they still have 12 days left before the 60 day mark so we'll see what happens. Overall I had a decent experience dealing with them but I do not agree with their policy of returning the funds to your wallet instead of your credit card and I do not agree with their official policy being that all sales are final even ones caused by fraud and refunds are given as a one time only show of good will.

{"body":"Yeah. Playstation bullshit policies at their best. My psn account got hacked last summer. I just tried to login one day and the automated login i had just told me login information was wrong.  Fortunately the hacker didnt do any charges on my account but it was super hard to get help at all. As you propably know psn related stuff are regional/local. As finnish guy. I had to call playstation finland.  It took me weeks to get in contact with them as they didnt answer their phone. At all. For weeks. I would call every couple of days. Let the phone ring for 5 to 10 minutes per call. No answer. I even sent them email. Same thing there. Its still unanswered to this day. When i finally got a customer rep to answer the phone and told him what was going on. He verbally attacked me. The customer. The victim in this case. The phone conversation went pretty much like this: me:"hello this is Opalitic xxxx. My account got hacked. Could you pleade help me thru this?" Cr: "How did this happen?" Me: "i dont know" cr:"do you have anyone that could know your password?" Me:"perhaps. My younger brother could know it. But he wouldnt change my accounts password and not tell me about it and he doesnt even have a ps console. And we dont live in the same household so he doesnt have access to my console either" cr:"yes. I think i know whats going on here. Your brother must have been playing  cod and told his online buddies your login information"  and that was it. No matter how much i tried to explain that no. That was not possible. The customer rep was sure that my little bro plays cod and shares my password with others online and there was nothing i could say to change his mind. Eventually he did help me get my accout access back but he also said that they have a policy that customer reps can only unlock / get your login credentials changed once. If i were to ever get hacked again. I would lose my account forever. Because that is psn policy. Anyways thats my story. Sorry for the format etc. Im on a phone.

{"body":"This is probably too little too late, but I used to work for Playstation Support. Not directly, but at a call center "representing" sony. They probably don't want you to know that when you call you aren't speaking to someone at corporate headquarters, but whatever.		There actually ARE agents physically at sony's headquarters but when I last worked they had 2 separate call centers handled by 2 different entities representing sony. I actually worked for them in the past WAYYYYYYYYYYYY back when we specifically did PS1 support, I left that company when the PSP hit to give you an idea of how LONG AGO that was. I recently went back a few years ago and very easily got hired to the Tier2 position being a competent and able minded individual. 		Now... Not knowing what "policies" are currently (As I left before PS4 hit) I do know what I had access to. The systems and information which allowed me to view purchases on PSN accounts, Serial Numbers, transaction history, EVERY SINGLE downloaded, whether free or paid. I was the "supervisor". The person you ended up speaking to and I had the holy grail generally in front of me. I could tell what console made the purchase by the serial number, I could tell what other USERS had used that system by the serial number. I could tell basically ANYTHING. 		If you let a "friend" or family member use YOUR system to "commit" the crime, well... then YOU were liable. you leave a playstation with NO password, or give that password to your friend, well then you ARE liable. no different than a loaded gun on the table in your house.		if someone "logs into your account" from a separate playstation and makes purchases the lines become a little more fuzzy. Ultimately we tried what we could to "STICK IT" to the perpetrator. If not banning YOUR account or YOUR system, then banning the SYSTEM (based on serial number) liable for the "fradualent" charges.		I'm sure there are A LOT of different policies which may or may not have transpired SINCE I left the company several years ago, but they should at least be capable of determining WTF had happened and holding the liable parties at fault.

If they can't do that for you or won't then tell them you will be contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding your problem and perhaps *they* will be able to handle it for you. I used to work in Quality Assurance listening to customer service phone calls (not for Sony, obviously) and scoring them/flagging them for problems and I learned lots about what customers do to really get help if the company itself is unable/unwilling to help them initially. You'd be surprised how well those three little words (Better Business Bureau) seem to get their attention. 		I had an issue with a credit card company giving me the runaround a few years ago and no one was able to help me despite me escalating it higher and higher up the chain so I mentioned on the call to the last person that I would be filing a complaint with the BBB. I followed through and filed the complaint like I said I would. The next *day* I got a phone call from a higher-up in the company asking if I would be willing to withdraw my claim if she would fix the issue for me. She did that for me as well as a few other nice things to smooth things over and I withdrew my complaint.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KeriEatsSouls","name":"t1_cpcg0lq","parent_id":"t3_2yq8oq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426189858,"created_utc":1426161058}

{"body":"The problem is draconian rules and very very stupid people on the other line.		I woke up one morning with a similar e-mail indicating a purchase had been made on my account through a sub-account. After calling PSN to look into the matter I realized a college roommate somehow had a sub-account or child account attached to mine, unbeknownst to either of us.		I was happy I was not being defrauded and then kindly asked the PSN representative if they could separate the accounts for the future.		This is where the fun began. All sorts of rules were touted in-front of me, told sony owns soul, etc.		Then came the ultimatum. 		I was told that I would have to agree the roommate created the account without my consent though the use of stolen credentials and have his sub-account banned...... or have the whole account banned because, "according to the functionality of sub-accounts, theres no way the account could have been created without my permission," and if I won't roll over on my friend, well then, I was clearly trying to defraud PSN, Sony, and Dear Leader. 		This seems to be a good time to mention that the "purchase" was for a free item from the PSN store. I just wanted to sort out some details. Interestingly enough, I had never received e-mails for other "purchases" from my friend. I began to suspect there was some sort of internal error on sony's part.		I went back and forth suggesting other possibilities, noting that PSN has been changed in the recent years and what is not possible today, may have been possible almost 10 years ago. He said this was impossible and again accused me of fraud, which prompted me to ask his age.		Long story short, he was some 18yr old on a power trip that couldn't tell his ass from his elbow. After I was accused a 4th or 5th time of some sort of violation of their policy, I began recording the phone call. After the 6th accusation I mentioned that I had just began recording the phone call and the little shit hung up on me. The second representative was more helpful, but then became very confused as to how exactly my account was set up the way it was. He said it was impossible as well. I was hung up on again.		When I called back the next time I found out the account had been irreversibly banned per my instructions. Didn't matter I had a voice recording indicating the opposite.

I hadn't made any purchases in quite some time so i was very confused. I spoke with a rep or two before I gave up and made the choice too stop playing online. The balance was over $100 but under $200. One day last fall my brother insisted that I hop online to play and catch up with one another. My account still down I called one last time with funds in hand. When I spoke with the rep she simply asked me if I wanted to keep the $100-something dollars in my wallet which would require me paying the owed balance, or she could just take the funds out of the wallet bringing my balance to $0. Needless to say I chose the later and used some of the money to buy some DLC's.

{"body":"Here's some helpful advice from someone who use to work in the debit/credit card department for a rather large credit union.	File a claim with your bank. The chances are most of your charges are under your banks threshold (somewhere under $50) which they will likely credit your account without a problem and Sony will never know. As far the larger fraudulent charges going some where along the lines of $50 and up your bank has to send a claim to their credit company(Visa, Master Card,...etc.) At that point it would be up to the credit company to either pay the rest of the charges and send you on your way or to do an investigation. Honestly you have ZERO liability for fraud charges as long as you are honest you can have the best of both worlds.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jar-o-jello","name":"t1_cpck8xx","parent_id":"t3_2yq8oq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426200251,"created_utc":1426171451}

Here is one of the complaints from February.		Complaint	My account has been banned for a free purchase I've made in 2013 with sony playstaion	There were fraudulent charges made to my play station account. The bank realized this and refunded the money back because my account had a balance of $0.00. Now Sony is know for their week security. The fact that I have to pay for their screw ups is outrageous, and I'm applauded. My account was banned for a trial service they offered for free, not only did they cut me off before the service ended I was charged for a game I purchase via this same service in 2013. Because of that, my play station account has been banned for a game I purchased in 2013. I wasn't notified about any purchases from sony what so ever, when its policy they do. Every game or downloadable content I purchase is via redeem code, not credit card.		Desired Settlement	I want this $60 charge reversed and I'd pay the rest of the fees and the ban removed from my account Which I use daily for the bast 2 years. I tried to cooperate with these people and I was mistreated and rudely hung up on 4 times. When explaining the situation. I just want my account ban removed because I use my console on a daily basis.

As such, I would report this to your state's Attorney General.	- Since you have written proof of the threat to your account being banned, your credit card company will almost certainly allow you to charge back the games you previously bought that would be come worthless, since banning your account is akin to not holding up their end of that transaction. At this point you can effectively just start over with a new account (if you're not just thinking you might as well sell the thing and give a big middle finger to Sony.) I've successfully been refunded for a transaction as much as a year in the past (presale concert tickets that never showed up.)

{"body":"Sharing my horror story with Sony PSN customer service.		Few months back my password expired on my PSN account (with 2 months of PSPlus still active on it. No biggie right? I'll just change my password. Oops....can't do that through the PS4 UI it has to send an E-mail to the E-mail address associated to my account where I'll be given a temp password. Ooops this account is over 10 years old made on my release day PS3 and the e-mail address is my old school E-mail which because I'm 6 years removed from college has been archived by my school. Guess I'll have to contact PSN service and figure out how I can change my password. Again my account was not hacked, my password did not change, I was typing in the correct password and being told that i needed to change it via E-mail. Contact support, they do not listen to my story and simply state at the end that they can send an E-mail to the address listed to my account. I inform them again that this does not work. They then ask for the credit card information on file with the account. Unfortunately since I don't trust them I don't keep a valid card activated on my account. Obviously I can't update my E-mail address because then anyone could jsut call in and do that, but they offer something different. The serial number on my playstation, phew...ok I read them the serial number on my PS4 and get the response that No i need the serial number of the playstation the account was set up on. Meaning my launch day PS3, don't have that anymore. I ask why I can't just state my password and reset it on the PS4 or their website and they completely ignore my question and start asking for credit card information so they can set me up with a new account. No, please help me retain my current account. The one I have purchases associated with, and not that it matters a whole lot but all of my gaming friends/records on. "I'm sorry sir can I set you up with a new account?" No "Thank you for your time sir have a nice day"....*click* three different calls and trying their CS chat (which is a joke) pretty much the same conversation each time. 		I have my PS4, and I rather enjoy it but next time I buy a system. It won't be a Sony, and I was a big playstation fan boy.

Like say, only allow $150 in PSN purchases in 12 hours?

This also doesn't limit people trying to make purchases on sale items. Say there's a sale and somebody wants $200 worth of games or movies. The sales almost always last 24 hours, and usually around a week, so customers have plenty of time to get in on those.		Realistically though, I don't understand why they can't just clear the charges.

{"body":"Just want to say that there is already excellent advice here, but i had a similar incident happen with EA Games. In my case i lost all my accounts because i did the reverse right away due to not knowing who was even charging me at the time. I didnt find out who it was till some time later when i went to log onto a ea account for the sims 3. It took me damn near a year to get my accounts back and ive been informed that my account has a mark against it due to this.		The issue here is companies hurting their supporters for doing what they should be doing which is reversing fraudulent charges back to whoever the person trying to charge them is. That is a protection for us offered by our banks.		It can be argued that it hurts those companies in some way. But those companies should be responsible for making sure fraudulent charges arent happening to the best of their abilities and if they do happen helping the customers who they happen to. In my situation all i asked was a return of the money and ban whatever game accounts the charges came from, which was for FIFA 2013 or 2014 i believe. I never have played FIFA, the charges came from Canada, a place i have never been to and since i dont even have a passport cant goto. I offered up everything i could to clear my accounts and it still took about a year and a investigation by ea to get them back to me. The weirdest thing is whoever it was bought something like 800$ worth the fifa points at once in small amounts. What person in their right mind would spend that much money at once on a game? It is pretty obvious fraud to say the least especially since i have had over ten years dealings with them through various accounts and at no time did i come close to at once spending more than 100$ on any game which should have established a pattern of how i purchase. I only had one semi large charge for like 80 bucks when i started playing ultima online again after years of not and buying all account upgrades at once that i didnt already have, the rest were like 20 for some sims points here and there and subs for Ultima and small shit like that.		No matter what dont back down though, i didnt, i called all the time, went through all avenues of support and in the mean time i downloaded my sims 3 content on websites and didnt instead spend money in the sims 3 store and grew to like the shit i could get for free much better so by time my account was given back i had no will to spend a fucking cent on overpriced sims 3 store garbage, also canceled all my subscriptions and have since half ass boycotted ea so not only did they lose a customer who has proven to pay them a good sum of money every year in various games for both computer and consoles, they also lost someone who loyally supported their asses everytime someone online would talk shit about them. In the long run im personally financially only throwing them a tiny amount of their total yearly take in but my money is better spent elsewhere.		I have no clue how my debit card number got taken, only a few guesses. I rarely used it for anything besides online payments and bill paying over the phone so somewhere it got picked up somehow via either online or over the phone. My card never leaves my wallet and my wallet is never more than a couple feet away from me, sits in my pocket all day and only comes out to sit on a night stand a couple feet away at night or on the counter in the bathroom while im in the shower or to pay at a store, so to me its either someone got it online via their website or somehow tapped my phone and got it.		Time we brought some of these big companies down, sony, ea, comcast, and more like them all constantly shit on us and wouldnt be missed to much if they were gone. We are what makes them, time to quit putting up with their shit, fucked up policies and poor service.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Smokeya","name":"t1_cpca9w4","parent_id":"t3_2yq8oq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426166100,"created_utc":1426137300}

{"body":"I'm prolly going to get some hysterical pitchfork and torches reaction for what I am about to say but whatever. I find it disconcerting that you guys are so eager to blame sony for this, I'll explain. If I were, for exsample, to steal someones identity and/or creditcard information and used those to buy a car, then the victim would response by blaming the guy who sold the car and basicly started to blackmail him by threatening with media and its social cousin if the carsales person didnt return hes money. That would not be justice or fair, that would just shift the victim status from you to the person who made the sale, and it is not the carsalespersons duty to be responsible for dispensing or enforcing justice, nor is it hes/hers responsibility to ensure you keep your information secure, punishing the shop the scammed money was used in is not fair. This is a matter between you, the thief and the police and as long as sony is willing to assist you in getting the issue solved and as I understand even willing to compensate some of your losses(which I dont think they even have to), you should feel grateful, because expecting sony to take care of security on YOUR end and starting hysterical mob when that doesnt work is entirely unreasonable. And just to jump ahead and tackle the inevitable "cars R not vidyamagames hurr durr" argument, no they are not, its just data, but that money did not go to sony now did it? I mean it did travel through them and they skimmed some from the top but its the companies that made the games who got the majority of this money and sony is left with the deligthful task of billing it back from those companies while trying to resolve the issue, all in all even if they manage to do that in timely fashion or at all it is going to need a lot of workhours and employees that I would assume like to get salary too, this is going to be costly for sony, they are going to lose money because of this, even if they didnt reimburse anything to you.	Now I'm not saying I blame you, I blame the thief, as should you.	Quit the blackmail nonsense and work with sony and your local authorities and keep your information secure.

They are indeed a total loss if we lose the dispute, but they're also absurdly (and sadly) common. Our CSRs are on a first name basis with our reps at the bank who issues our chargebacks, as well as our Paypal dispute rep. We don't write it off as just an annoyance; it's just an expected part of the business. The majority of our chargebacks are genuine instances of fraud. Doing a careful investigation has helped us actually catch fraudsters (really rare, but it happens), or prevent them from making another purchase.

It's not their information, it's yours. It's not their job to protect it, it's yours.		That said, capping refunds and banning accounts for chargebacks are both legitimate methods to reduce their liability in events like this.

{"body":"http://www.reddit.com/r/compsec 		http://www.reddit.com/r/security 		http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport		Most people who would consider themselves an average user often end up leaving enormous gaps in their personal security, and 99% of the time do so inadvertently or without knowledge of exactly how much danger they're putting themselves in. I'm not here to tell you that everything on the internet is a potential minefield, because you know that already.		The more unfortunate truth is that Sony's customers have given them no incentive to invest a significant amount of time or resources into the problem, because their userbase hasn't declined over these issues in any significant way since the first big breach on PS3 back in 2011. Instead of focusing on the risk that they had been exposed to (albeit inadvertantly), everyone decided that it was pretty cool that they got a free copy of Infamous or Little Big Planet and decided that there was no reason to keep asking questions. Fast forward 2.5 years, same story. They only thing that a large company like Sony understands is money; if users started leaving they system and subscription service and told Sony that they did so over security concerns, you can bet your ass that they'd pony up for the enhanced security implementations. Since their consumer base didn't demand it or take significant action, nothing happened and customers like you continue to get screwed because of it and by no fault of your own.		I don't have Xbox Live, but I do use several other online services like Steam, Origin, and GOG. Not one of them has access to my credit card information, it's all done through my verified Paypal account. Once I'm out of school, I'll be setting up my own server to host a private email service and I'll change over my verified Paypal to that so I can cut out another middle-man (my current Email service). I hate that the world has come to this, but it's no longer strolling down the street avoiding the guys selling knockoff watches and apparel anymore... those guys are everywhere now, they run your email, they watch what you do online, they track your buying habits and monitor your communication. They know what you look like, where you live, what your phone number is, and who your family and friends are. It might take a lot of effort to protect yourself to a degree that you're comfortable with, and it may mean going without some things that you wouldn't previously have thought to be troublesome (lookin' at you again, Facebook). At the end of the day, you've got to find a balance between the effort put in and truly being comfortable with the data that's being collected on you. The world isn't going to stop trying to screw you over anytime soon. That means your options are the eternal struggle or acceptance. There's no middle ground for passive resistance in this arena.

{"body":"Whoa whoa whoa. Let's step back here for a second.		You say Sony is in the wrong, when OP agreed to a contract with them that absolves them of responsibility for things like this happening. OP has no legal justification that Sony has done anything "wrong" in the sense of what is and is not illegal.		Speaking to supervisors and ranting at them isn't going to get you anywhere. OP needs to call them with a bank representative and discuss the issue on a conference call; it's in everyone's interests but Sony's to have this taken care of the way you would consider "right", so having a bank rep who knows what is what is a much faster and more productive course of action than spending hours on the phone getting bounced around to different "supervisors" who are actually all on the same level.		Switching to digital media is not "wrong", it's just a new technology that people aren't accustomed to yet. The risks are inherent with any DRM service, be it Steam, Xbox Live, PSN, Origin, UPlay, or any other. My advice is always to buy any games you can from a DRM free source (unless the sales are just too good), and to do what you can to protect yourself from their loss. Don't cheat, put yourself in a position to avoid chargeback issues, and protect your personal information as best you can. Eventually I'll be putting together a home server which won't have internet access, and I'll store my entire single player game library on that as a backup in case my Steam account were to be banned.		This isn't about some guy on the internet defending Sony. This is about the fact that Sony took steps to defend itself, and about the fact that the majority of it's users continue to neglect doing so themselves. This is no different from a breach of personal information from Yahoo, Facebook, or Snapchat.

{"body":"Well let's get one thing out of the way here: as a PC user, I neither have a dog in the "console wars" nor do I feel like Microsoft does a good job of supporting their customers. Let's not forget, these are all companies and you and I are nothing but wallets as far as they are concerned. Now let's get to the meat.		Neither Sony nor Microsoft gives a flying fuck about morals; they care about legal liability and public perception. Sony did nothing in this situation outside of follow rules that they have laid out very publicly to protect their own financial interests. While I agree that OP is getting dicked over, said dicking over has absolutely nothing to do with OP getting his $450 back and/or being able to continue to use his playstation. The point is that Sony (and Microsoft) probably deal with thousands of these (if not more) on a weekly basis and they have the job of hiring someone to determine whether or not those claims are legitimate. It's not like the CEO can personally oversee this crap, and the company has to insulate itself from abusive of refund policies like this. Like it or not, if you want Microsoft and Sony to continue making consoles then they have to make money. They're not going to risk that over widespread Russian scam botnets or a legion of idiotic 13 year olds thinking they can game the system, and you shouldn't want them to if you like their products and want them to stay in business.		This isn't a Sony isolated problem like you seem to be suggesting. Yes, they have a shitty track record; however, looking over at the xbox one subreddit reveals tons of similar account hijackings with similar results. Just because they weren't to the tune for $450 doesn't make them less of a problem.		So no, I'm not saying that Sony's "blackmailing" antics are OK, though I don't consider this blackmail in any capacity since OP essentially signed a contract allowing Sony to take these actions. I think it's pretty shitty. That said, let's not forget the actual guilty party here: the guy who stole OP's account. Sony has no fault here. They're simply trying to resolve the situation within the guidelines that they developed to handle such situations. If you, OP, or anyone else considers those terms to be unfair, then you have every right to not participate in the agreement in the first place. Everyone jokes about the iTunes terms and conditions, but this stuff can really be important. For over a year the license agreement for Skype legally bound every user to the legal code of Sweden (or some other northern European country I forget, sorry my hockey-playing bretheren!). That meant that for breaching Skype's Terms of Service you could have potentially been extradited and put on trial in a different fucking country. Mull that one over for a few minutes.		For myself, since I mentioned I play on PC, I use as many DRM free versions of games as I can. This is obviously not possible on a console since the whole machine is basically a mid-range PC racked with DRM to the core, but my point is it's not impossible to avoid these kinds of situations. If you want to play on console, you should be using a more secure third party (such as PayPal) to pay for your service instead of storing your credit card. Steam and Origin don't have my credit card information stored, because fuck that noise.		TL;DR - This is no one's fault but the jerk who stole the account, blaming Sony for protecting themselves legally is not only pointless but it's actually counter-productive to the discussion we should be having: how to better insulate and protect ourselves from situations like this.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"enragedwindows","name":"t1_cpc8sfk","parent_id":"t1_cpc7twy","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426162520,"created_utc":1426133720}

I can't stand cyber tantrums like this, just cop it on the chin and move on.","depth":0,"score":-9,"ups":-9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"carmooch","name":"t1_cpcau0l","parent_id":"t3_2yq8oq","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1426167686,"created_utc":1426138886}

{"body":"500 is a lot of money.  Your insurance will take care of your car.  Being punished for doing nothing wrong is bullshit customer support.
