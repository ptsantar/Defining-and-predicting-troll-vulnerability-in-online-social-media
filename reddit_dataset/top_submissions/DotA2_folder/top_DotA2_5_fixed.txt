{"body":"Meh, from playing all the other Mobas around, **in my opinion** it's pretty bad. I mean it definitely changes the standard style and does it's own twist, but it's *heavily* PvE oriented, with secondary PvP aspects (like you fight for an objective, that will result in some sort of buff for your creeps, or spawn a super "raid boss" creep). 		For example you do the standard laning for a second, and then a horn goes off where you have to run to caves which is a separate area, yeah seems kind of cool, i like the idea. In the caves you collects skulls, which will spawn a super mob that will PvE it's way to the enemy base that the other team will have to fight that mob, and if you are smart you would assist that "raid boss" mob. Granted you could get away with not even bothering with the other team. Their jungle system is the exact same way, you fight jungle mobs, and they in turn join and push your lane.		If you would like that then maybe you'd enjoy this game, but this is a Dota subreddit, where I'd assume people like the PvP style of all current major Mobas.		Where as in Dota, League, HoN the mobs are secondary you just use them to get money and experience and you yourself fight the enemy, and push. Granted, if you are watching an IG vs DK match for 2 f-in hours yeah, that a lot of PvE too with a rare kill sprinkled in every 30 minutes.		Edit: Oh what also makes is BAD is that it follows the fucking shitty LoL Demo (not really F2P) model, there is a hero rotation. **This system needs to just die**, or be like, that secondary system that everyone knows sucks, but certain games need it cause they are very niche or something. Dota just does it right, you just installed the game, here is the list of heroes, all these game modes, pick your poison and give it a shot.
