{"body":""Uhh, C-Commander Newell, sir, Mr. Icefrog, sir..."		The pair turned around to see somone in a Dota Corps uniform. Black collared shirt, black pants, the Dota insignia on his lapel. Judging from the patch placed next to it and the youth's general demeanor, he was a technician, a fresh recruit.		"Yes? What's the problem?" asked Commander Newell. Icefrog remained silent, as always. They said nobody knew the face of the man under the black hood but Newell himself.		"W-well, sir, it's about the polishing of the Immortals, sir."		"What about it? Did something go wrong?" inquired the Commander. If something serious had happened to the Immortals, it could have dire repercussions on Valv^e 's income.		"Well... I-I don't know how to explain it, sir..."		Suddenly, Icefrog grabbed at the technician. A deathly pale hand shot out from the cloak, and a low, threatening voice emanated from the hood: "***Spit it out.***"		"Icefrog!" said the Commander. "Let him go, you're only scaring him more." As the hooded one let go, he turned to the technician. "Now. What happened to the Immortals?"		"Well, it's not about the Immortals as much as it is *not* about the Immortals..."		"What is it? Just say it already." said Newell, tense and impatient.		"W-well, the polishing ray, sir, it misfired... the Immortals weren't polished. The polishing effect went out of control and flew everywhere... and... *and...*" trembled the technician.		"And what?" asked Newell, fearing the worst.		"The effect cascaded onto the out-of-match UI... and now the UI looks like *this...*"		The youth handed the Commander some photographs. Newell and Icefrog looked through them all. A smile lit up Newell's face, and the pair looked at each other, and uttered one word, in unison:		"***Perfect.***"		EDIT: Holy shit, who gilded me while I was asleep? Honestly, thank you.

{"body":"The year is 2077. I stand at a window of my mansion and revel at my prized possessions - the vast acres of suburban real estate that my father and grandfather endlessly toiled to build up, and now, I have inherited it all. My grandson stands next to me and asks, "grandpa, can I be a big businessman like you when I grow up?" 	"Of course," I said, "this will all be yours someday."	I walk over to my computer and sit on my gold-plated, diamond crusted seat. I open Reddit, a leading and most-trusted source for world news. The top headline reads, "Immortal III treasure released."	"Marvelous!" I chuckle to myself. This is just in time to boost the TI67 prize pool. I purchase several chests as a present for my grandson's compendium. As I click "checkout" on the website, I can't help but take a peek in one of the chests. 	"Why, it's a shiny Zeus hammer!"	I cannot resist but open the chest. I receive a Crystal Maiden staff.	"This is no Zeus hammer," I thought. Let me just open another.	To my dismay, I still have not found the elusive Zeus treasure. I continue to buy more and more chests, determined that my wealth would eventually overpower Valve's determination to hide the chest from me. This quickly escalated to precisely 90,663,887,774 chests purchased, and not a single Zeus hammer lay between my wrinkly hands.	Slowly, a cloud of darkness consumed my mind. I began dreaming of Valve's logo being carved and stamped on every piece of real estate I owned. I have thrown all my wealth away in search of this treasure. My grandson's future--no longer secured.	I only have a few pennies left at this point, and I decided to spend them on internet bandwidth to search reddit for guidance. I went back to the Dota 2 subreddit to make sense of this all. I see a post on the front page titled, "I opened one treasure with my level 1 compendium and look what I got :D!!!" I clicked the post, only to see Zeus with all his might, holding a shiny, golden hammer, engulfed by lightening. Merlini himself would be blinded by such beauty. 	At this point, my grandson came to me and climbed on my lap. "whoa," he said, "I want one of those!" He asked if he can have just one Zeus hammer when he's a "rich business man" like me. I slowly carried him off my lap, with tears running down my eyes I told him,	"Of course, Kappa."			Credits: I don't remember.

Basically the only sentence that came out of your ass in this thread which is something close to true. Carry Wisp is viable but it's not something that will be picked every game. 		Wisp can tether up another core and give that carry as well as himself +70as, 20% damage reduction as well as HP. You shouldnt underestimate Satanic Wisp. Like, you lifesteal 200%, then your tethered hero gets what you lifesteal and 50% extra. In theory it can make another hero nearly unkillable.		On top of that you have VERY good damage min 12-25 with only Armlet and Overcharge.

It is a good trick actually but on online retailers you actually need to do it in a different way. Valve get the eyes through Dota2 and CSGO (to an extent). That being said Valve directly make money from both games as well as making them indirectly. Directly they are making it from the marketplace and in CSGO its both the marketplace, cases and keys and the cost of the game itself. 		You could go a more cynical route and think of Valve like a massive bank right now. Your money goes in and from there they can do with it as they wish. Like if Valve pay developers out at the end of the month they could in theory have a consistent flow of money to use as part of investments in bonds. Bonds are loans but more meta, they aren't to specific people but to companies, countries and banks. The amount of money going in and out of Valve is a way of making money in itself.

{"body":"Not everything. I VERY MUCH want camera grip control style to revert to how blizzard has done it forever: middle click causes your mouse to disappear, then the range of your hand movement can move the camera over the entire map, and when you release middle click then your mouse appears exactly where it started. This way you can pretty much always keep your mouse in the middle of the screen which is a HUGE improvement over flicking to the edge of the screen CONSTANTLY.		Whereas in dota, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, valve thought they needed to break a fundamental control scheme. Now, dota 2's shitty ass scheme has you middle click, then you can only drag the camera a tiny little bit until your mouse hits the edge of the screen (this has the inherent and super obvious limitation of restricting how much of the already limited space you can drag across based on how close to the edge of the screen your mouse was when you initiated the drag) and when you release the button then your mouse is wherever the butt fuck it ended up instead of precisely where you left it when you initiated the camera movement.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tweediddly","name":"t1_cs4v38q","parent_id":"t1_cs4spnq","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434187548,"created_utc":1434158748}

{"body":"I disagree that Sc2's system is *strictly* better than Dota 2's.  There's a subtle problem with how Sc2's camera grip works that Dota 2's system does much better:		When I use the current system and grab a particular part of the screen, my mouse position remains constant with respect to the ground.  Therefore if my mouse is on a hero, I can quickly readjust the camera without having to move my mouse back to the hero I was interested in.		With sc2's system, before & after you release the camera grip your cursor stays at a constant position in your monitor.  That means you have to constantly undo whatever motion you did to make your cursor stay on the same object while moving the camera.		Otoh there isn't a reason why camera grip could continue to move once your cursor is off of the screen.  I just think it should be sticky with respect to the ground.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"phob","name":"t1_cs4yeai","parent_id":"t1_cs4v38q","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434194998,"created_utc":1434166198}
{"body":"They could at least add a checkbox, and let you switch between.		But if you're up for some argument, here are my thoughts. Blizzard's camera grip still accomplishes what you said, except better. But Blizzard camera grip users would save all that effort and simply double tap the hotkey to center the camera on the hero. Also, since the classic camera grip literally just drags the minimap screen around, it eliminates the need to ever click on the minimap.		Overall therefore, Blizzard's camera grip leaves the mouse vastly more stable (not constantly jumping to the minimap and edges of display) and, therefore, more available. The power to, at any moment, drag the camera either a small precise amount or all the way across the map to an equal precision, with almost no effort in either case, is invaluable.		Another massive bonus with classic camera grip as opposed to edge panning is that you can disable edge panning. Obvious, right? But the benefit is huge. You don't have to worry about accidentally moving the camera by accidentally hitting the edge of the screen, so you don't have to be nearly as careful when making cursor movements where you need to hit a precise target near the edge of the screen.

{"body":"Think less of custom games as something that changes how Dota 2 works and has people play it under different rules. Custom games use the engine to make their own games, if you look at some warcraft 3 custom games you'd understand better what people can do.		Tower defense games were always fantastic, I'm sure you're familiar with those. Element TD, Green TD and Line tower defense being some big names. There's also tag games like Kodo tag, where NPC Kodos from the warcraft universe would come chase you around and you had to build yourself a fortified base to keep them out and gather your gold in peace which you then used to build bigger and better towers or units. There's a couple other tag games like Vampirism and Island Defense that were pretty popular. They had a  similar structure but had a player play as the threat, in vampirism's case that'd be the vampire, in island defense you'd be a titan. 		There were of course also custom games focused on controlling a single hero, dota 1 being one of them. But then there's stuff like Rabbits vs Sheep where you'd have two teams of 5 people in their own square of land, separated. The game would start by spawning sheep or rabbits depending on what side you were on and you had to kill them, for each one you killed the other side got two more. You basically had to make sure you didn't get flooded by sheep/rabbits or you'd lose. 		There's a whole fuck ton of great custom games that I cannot wait to see return.

Battle.net 2.0 (sc2 style) replaced this with a system without title and/or settings where you can only select a custom map, and the system will randomly match you with other players.

{"body":"Holy fucking shit I thought I was the only one that realized this--years ago, I mean.		Wrecklord0 hit it on the nose. OG Bnet games would drop you into the dashboard where you see a paged list of all the custom games being hosted, and it's constantly updated so every time you hit refresh you see the newest games (think 4chan). You can search for keywords and stuff. This meant that games were listed like "Game Name 1.3.2 No xyz pros only west coast only NO LAG" and you pretty much knew you were joining with people who looking for the same experience as you as opposed to getting matched with butt fucking whoever.		More importantly--and killing this is what killed multiplayer gaming for the past 15 years--in a pre-game lobby everyone could talk to everyone for the entire time (a minute or so), and the host chose when to start the game (no 3 minute picking bullshit) and once he clicked go you were playing the game 3 seconds later.		Matchmaking was never brought to market because it was a good system. It was brought to market to force people to play with people who'd otherwise never have anyone to play with. The idea was to guarantee everyone could play a shitty game, instead of most people having a great time and a few people struggling. The cost was abandoning engaging and fun competitive multiplayer experiences (remember, this crow invented GG and the mentality that you respect your opponent and ESPECIALLY your allies) in exchange for an experience that shut gamers off from each other but guaranteed that everyone would have someone to play with (the result, of course, has been toxic online behavior becoming the norm, as matchmaking games are famous for (halo, dota, COD).","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tweediddly","name":"t1_cs4usws","parent_id":"t1_cs4tt1u","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434186921,"created_utc":1434158121}

For a brand new player I would recommend a few Passive or Easy solo bot matches, then move into Easy Co-Op bots (and let teammates know you're new!).  		You can mute players by going to the upper left corner, and there is a row of 5 small icons to the right of the downward arrow; I think it's the 2nd from the left that is the scoreboard.  If you open that there are little microphones next to everyone's names and you can click it to mute them.		Of course you can jump straight into PvP, but it'll probably be a lot of people leaving and uneven matches for at least your first couple while it figures out your MMR.

{"body":"Just a little advice if you do choose to give it a try, remember bot matches.		The bots aren't as good as players, but by the time you start learning how to exploit their AI and such your hero/item knowledge and general mechanics should be good enough to let you jump into a player match (where, at least after the first game or two, the enemies should be roughly your skill).		If you're brand new to Dota I would probably say do Easy (you can do co-op, *most* of the time players in Bot Matches don't get mad if someone does bad) as the bots won't harass and are less likely to dive you, and don't have godly reaction times.		Medium is a good step up as the bots still don't harass but they are more aggressive and have better reaction times, and in Hard they start harassing (and they harass a lot).		I would start with co-op bots (maybe two or three solo bot matches first) instead of single player bots (though you may have to deal with 5 carry teams and such) on Easy, let your teammates know you're new, and ask for advice.  If they start getting mad or something mute them (scoreboard is one of the icons in the upper left corner).","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"carorea","name":"t1_cs4ye6p","parent_id":"t1_cs4vwy8","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434194991,"created_utc":1434166191}

EUW is constantly crashing (~4 crashes) in a month , and you RARELY get a loss prevented game. For 2 years they didint do ANYTHING about toxic people , you were able to get banned ONLY for leaving , and get chat restricted if you flame , if you troll you wont get anything , but THEY FINNALY fixed it , and now you can get banned for being toxic. Also if you want to have any kind of skin you have to buy RP. IP is only for champs , also ive seen like 2 scripters in a game , never seen scripters in Dota.

{"body":"We've been playing game called Dota 2 for a couple of years now, which has been using decade-old Source engine, which was first used to power Half-Life 2 which came out 2004. We've been having some issues, ideas about improvements have been tossed around, but Dota 2 has been relatively the same.		Then about year ago, there was this rumor that Dota 2 would be ported to Source 2, Valve's new engine which was looking for a game to roll out with. That would be cool, everyone though. Valve made some vague references to "Some major things we are working on with Dota 2 that you guys probably will like" 9 months ago.		Less than a year ago, Valve released Dota 2 workshop tools alpha, which are free developer tools to edit and create games and game-related content as Dota 2 mods. People were quick to notice that Dota 2 that came bundled there wasn't quite the same. Everything responded faster, things worked faster, some loading stutter was removed. And then people found out that internally, game used engine named Source 2. Enter hype.		After all this, nothing happened really. Valve kept on pushing updates like they always do, and they have been seemingly focusing on The International, gargantuan Dota 2 tournament with 13 million US dollars prize pool. Then suddenly couple of weeks ago someone spotted that some Valve developer had uploaded gigabytes of stuff onto SteamDB, ready to be pushed as update for us at the flick of a single bit. This update was not shown, but names of the files were essentially saying Source 2 all over.		Now, Source 2 is mainly cool because as Valve has stressed in their communications, it focuses on enabling regular users to create content, such as mods, models and whatnot that can be used. It's also next gen game engine, but Dota 2 specifically is unlikely to utilize much of its potential since it's game that was originally created for dated 2004 engine. Mods however, we have no idea what the mods that users create will utilize.		This was all the communication from Valve up until yesterday. Nothing beside this had been said by Valve. Then comes this blog post. Basically, instead of backend upgrade and engine swap, they have also remade the entire game UI with tons of fancy features and just casually told us that it's coming out next week, and we're not even told yet about all the Source 2 related perks that will happen, they inform us about those next week.		Basically, you knew that christmas was coming someday this year, and you're really excited for it. This blog post just informed you that next week Friday will be christmas, easter, your birthday and your wedding day.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KapteeniJ","name":"t1_cs560tq","parent_id":"t1_cs4wat8","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434222285,"created_utc":1434193485}

There is no set meta of who goes where if you watch competitive you will see 1 1 2 + jungle , you will see 1 1 3 you will see 3 1 1 and even 1 2 2 some times. Most pubs tend to be 2 1 2 or 1 1 2 + jungle. But it really depends on the heroes. Hard carries make sense in the safe lane with a support cos they need farm and don't want to fight over it too much. There are mid heroes who tend to be heroes that want a fast level and a quick item so they can have an impact early mid game. Oflane heroes tend to have some way of either escaping or be quite tanky. But because there is no set meta for the lanes no hero is prescribed to a give role and therefore a given lane.

Dunno, maybe Valve did their own thing to acompany Source 2.		>while you're on the topic can you recommend a system good enough for streaming or even recording for that matter?		Sorry can't really help you with that as I am still rocking a pretty old setup (i5 2500k, 8GB, AMD HD6950, 128GB SSD) and I can play pretty good with 1920x1080 and maxed out graphics. IRC I did my test-streams in 1080p30 and it worked pretty good, but you would probably need a more powerfull setup to get 1080p60 streams going (aside from a good upload speed).

Source 2 mainly improves handling of custom content, which is why fanmade custom game modes can finally be let into the main client and Valve-made game modes for events probably won't have to be skipped anymore because working with the old engine was so cumbersome. Items with custom particle effects were also clunky in Source 1 and Valve was hesitant about adding them, and with this new engine they might be more readily adding them.		In general Source 2 should also improve performance, especially on newer hardware, but adding new features could drag it down again, so we'll have to see about that.

So why not load the map first and then start the matchmaking? that would make the load after the matchmaking shorter. Also if you fail to load before matchmaking then you are probably going to fail loading in the matchmaking too. Having what I say will eliminate people failing.
