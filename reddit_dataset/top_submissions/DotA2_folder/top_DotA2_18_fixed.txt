{"body":"So the green team, the Radiant, has gotten a few pickoffs and the red team, the Dire, is in full retreat. The red hero, Lion, is being chased by the 5 Radiant players and you see him use his stun Earth Spike in the beginning and stun many of the Radiant team. The blue guy, enigma, drops one of his spells that deals a percentage of max hp as damage and then blinks forward and uses his ultimate Black Hole which pulls all enemies in a 420 AOE towards the center.  He catches all 5 Radiant heroes. Lion turns around, recognizing the opportunity and uses his spell Mana Drain (blue sucky thing) to get mana to cast his ult. Now the good part. Lion has an item called Aghanim's Scepter which upgrades spells in various ways for different heroes, in his case, making his formerly single target, massive damage ultimate affect enemies in an AOE around the target. With the enigma clumping the enemies up, Lion casts his ultimate Finger of Death on the low enemies and they all die! This is a very impressive play because the two remaining dire heroes left are generally played as supports, meaning they usually aren't expected to be able to 2v5 an entire team, but both players recognized their chance and capitalized on it. Landing a 5 man black hole is an impressive feat in and of itself as enemies understand the threat of the spell and typically do not bunch up when there's an Enigma.","depth":1,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"intotheocean","name":"t1_cziz58x","parent_id":"t1_czivdpc","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1454305619,"created_utc":1454276819}

{"body":"OK, 1st let's call the black hole guy**Enigma** and rampage guy **Lion**.		Then let's talk bit about build items.		*Aghanim's Scepter*: An build item upgrade ultimates/skills for lots of heros		*Blink Dagger*: An build item enable you to 'flash' 1200 distance every 12s, but not able to cast within 3s upon receiving damage.		OK let's start the porn!		Basically Enigma's ultimate is more like a **Amumu's R + Diana's E  (or actually Oriana's R's dragging effect), but last 4s**. It's the **most OP AOE stun** in Dota, cuz it pierce through all kinds of things (Dota has BKB which makes heros immune to lots of spells, and for an analogy, this ultimate can **go through Banshee's Veil**). 		The ultimate also has 165 damage/s, magic damage.		One more little detail, but **extremely important** is that, before the ultimate, Enigma uses its E. It is an AOE effect which is a larger circle than the ultimate (like **Anvia's R without slowing**), but deals **5.25% MAX HEALTH as PURE DAMAGE per second** (true damage in LOL, so it's a **more OP version of Vayne's W**). The math leads to **21% of max health as pure damage** during the ultimate time, plus 660 magical damage from the ultimate it self. Get the idea..? It's OP as fuck.		Then Lion, the rampage guy. Lion's Q is like a shorter Braum's R but has quicker effect. Lion's ultimate, is a high damage target skill (**Syndra's R**), but upgradable if purchasing Aghanim's Scepter, making it into an small AOE of 300 radius also higher damage. The 300 radius fits well with the ultimate of Enigma's ultimate (Blackhole)		**So now let's recap as follow**		Lion used his Q (Braum's R) and stunned 4. Enigma said, "u know what? let's try!" He blinked (flashed), quickly cast its E and then R. While everyone is being dragged into the center, they all entered the radius 300 circle. Lion said "oh my fvcking god I knew it's coming!" He went up, pressed R. BOOM! RAMPAGE!! (Pentakill!)		And you know what? Enigma can upgrade the ultimate by purchasing ***Aghanim's Scepter*** with free E damage adding to the R (Well it's not free, you know). Also a ***Refresher*** enables it to **cast the all skills twice, seamless**. So theoretically, **Enigma**, all by himself, can deal **84% of max health plus 1320 magical damage**. He is considered to be the most OP late game disabler.		Enigma is one of my all time favs, I have a 77.3% win rate picking him, but I don't pick him often. It's gonna be a even longer article to explain why.		*If light cannot escape me, what hope have you?*------Enigma while casting ulti","depth":1,"score":35,"ups":35,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"judsonzhao","name":"t1_czj45k8","parent_id":"t1_czj3k24","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1454313644,"created_utc":1454284844}

{"body":"Everything's strong in dota.		The reason this item isn't "op" by dota standards is that Lion is a very squishy hero commonly played as a support, and requires a 4200 gold item to unlock the AoE upgrade which takes a while to farm for a support. Moreover, the aoe it provides is very small (200). This is just about the outside edge of its aoe. This item isn't even the most commonly purchased first item on Lion (except by very poor players). Normally you'll see a lion pick up a blink or an aether lens after their boots.		This is a 1 in 100 games kind of play, assuming you pick lion every game. It's incredibly rare to have all (or even most) of the enemy heroes this close to each other, especially if they know the enemy has a) an Enigma and b) a Lion aghs, because things like this can happen. This happened because EVERY SINGLE person on the enemy team fucked up.		Also, black hole isn't "almost no setup". It's the longest true disable in the game (Things like Naga, Void, ET have downsides).
