This just isn't true, and brands without performance are useless in esports.

NAVI and dendi haven't won a match in a  very, very long time.  		It really doesn't matter how famous you are - if you can't even *get into* the big tournaments to get some exposure, you aren't a professional dota player.  You're an amateur with a big name.

It has left an impressive mark across all possible game genres such as Dota 2, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, World of Tanks and Hearthstone - to name a few and has lived upto its motto "born to win". Na`Vi was the first team to win the inaugural "The International Dota 2 Championships 2011" held at Cologne, Germany and walked away with a $1,000,000 prize-pool.	 	> Na 'Vi has also participated in three consecutive grand finals of The International; a feat no other organization has managed to achieve to this day. Fast forward to the year 2014, and we see Na`Vi's fortune starting to dwindle with less than satisfactory performance at The International 2014 which only got worse with time. Post TI4, we entered a rough patch as we began to see frequent changes to our Dota 2 line-up leading all the way to The International 2015.	 	>However, recently the team was unable to qualify for the Frankfurt Fall Major 2015 despite tremendous efforts from the players and this led us to a point where we had to make one of the hardest decisions ever; to let go of our Dota 2 team. Yes folks, you heard it right. Natus Vincere has officially decided to part ways with its current Dota 2 line-up.	 	>This can come as a shock to our fans, but we believe this is a step in the right direction. We would also like to extend our sincere gratitude to Dendi, XBOCT, Funn1k, SoNNeikO and PSM for being an important part of Na`Vi. It was a pleasure and an honor to have all of you onboard with us, some of you for many years.	 	>However, this is not the end of the road for Na`Vi in Dota 2 as we won't give-up so easily on the game we all love. On the next week we will make a few announcements regarding our new Dota 2 line-up. We will strike back and it is possible that you may get to see the re-emergence of some familiar faces in the scene. So be sure to follow our website and be up-to-date with all the relevant information regarding the new line-up.	 	>Comment by Natus Vincere's COO Igor "caff" Sydorenko:	 	>"After the protracted series of failures of our team, we have to take measures and with hard feelings fully disband the squad. On behalf of all the fans and Na 'Vi staff I express gratitude to the guys for their work and emotions, which they've granted to us all the time.

So to answer your question		>Why would you buy team from organisation, when you can get free players?		Because they want the best CIS team, not just a good team.		I'll bet you reddit gold that if they can't get Vega, they won't go for monkey business or any other western european team and their next team will have at least 3 or more CIS players.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"unpopularopiniondude","name":"t1_cw1t6mh","parent_id":"t1_cw1sdcd","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1445031630,"created_utc":1445002830}

Them failing to qualify for the Frankfurt Major (another sort of World Championship) this fall is just the exclamation mark on an excruciatingly long ride of failures and mishaps.		The squad disbanding is a relief for everyone involved: the players who can now move on to compete on new teams (or not at all - who knows?), the fans don't have to see their favourite team fail anymore, the CIS Dota scene (from which Na`Vi drew its new talents to fix the old roster, to very little success) can be a bit more stable.

{"body":"Vega are already under contract, so it's extremely unlikely that this would happen. The only team that made it to the Fall Majors that ISN'T under contract is Monkey Business, although the lack of connections between them and the CIS region might make the chances of Na'Vi picking them up a little more remote.		There is also the possibility of forming another stack of unknown players with perhaps only one or two familiar faces returning, although I'm sure Na'Vi is too hungry for success to invest particularly heavily in youth teams, despite such an approach being proven to work by the Chinese squads.		The thing I'm most curious about is what this will do to Na'Vi's relationship with its iconic figures: Dendi, XBOCT and Funn1k. All three had undoubtedly stagnated, but are all good draws in their own right, particularly the first two, so it seems unlikely that Na'Vi have completely parted ways with them. They may have offered Dendi a streamer's contract similar to LightofHeaven, but I personally believe Dendi is too competitive to accept such a deal and will be wanting to play professionally again soon.		I find it particularly interesting that Na'Vi's disbandment has come only a day after Dread, the popular CIS streamer, announced he was leaving HellRaisers, a timing that seems too close to be coincidental. Dread and Dendi are, perhaps, the two most popular DotA 2 personalities in the CIS region, and with them both now being 'free agents', I would be very surprised if Na'Vi aren't keeping close tabs on them both. Dread in particular is a player who is still peaking, and I firmly believe he has the potential to contribute to a top tier team if given the right setup.		A lot of people are desperate to see Sonneiko stay with Na'Vi, but I personally believe he has regressed since TI5, and if Na'Vi are interested in Dread, there might not be room for them both on the same squad, owing to the fact that both have such a defensive playstyle.		This might seem a fairly long-winded way of saying 'I have no idea', but for me personally the fact that there is no clear answer is one of the most intriguing things about this breakup, especially since Na'Vi have stated they will be announcing a new DotA 2 roster soon. Almost anything could come out of this, and although I'm sad to see the old Na'Vi go, I can't wait to see what a brand built on defying expectations surprises us with next.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LogicKennedy","name":"t1_cw1qt6g","parent_id":"t1_cw1q3nw","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1445026112,"created_utc":1444997312}

{"body":"My son and I were walking to the river early in the morning when a homeless man stepped out from an alley and began to shout at me. His chest length beard was speckled with bits of food, and his breath reeked of vodka. I quickly pulled my son behind me.		He stomped the ground, shrieking unintelligible words. He smacked a tattered emblem on his jacket, then pointed at me. He wouldn't let us pass. Then my son offered the lunatic his sandwich.		The homeless man immediately snatched the sandwich and tried to jam it in my boy's mouth. When my boy refused to eat the man tried to pick him up. I tore my son away from him and struck him in the mouth. The homeless man fell to the ground and began to cry. He looked at me and finally spoke slowly so that I would understand.		"You left me like this? We were kings! WE WERE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST CHINA AND SWEDEN! WE DID THE IMPOSSIBLE TOGETHER!"		My boy turned to me, "Papa, do you know this man?"	I dropped my head, trying to fight the memories I worked so hard to forget.		"Yes, once upon a time."		"Who is he?"		"An old hero. A fearless man who could fight alone against three. A ruthless avenger who would chase his victims to their homes. A champion who has slain many thrones. He was my sword, and I his shield. But I couldn't protect him any longer."		"What for?" my son asked.		"Indeed, that is the question. What?" I glared at the homeless man.		The homeless man rose to his feet, poured vodka into his hand and wiped the emblem on his jacket, beginning to reveal the N.		"This was everything to me. Each year the world doubted us and thrived on it. Come August we destroyed the competition. XBOCT, DENDI, PUPPEY forever engraved not only on the Aegis but the hearts of thousands. We were born to win--"		"But we didn't XBOCT," I said, "we stopped winning a long time ago."		I stepped forward, taking his bottle from him.		"We just needed more time," XBOCT licked the blood from his lips, "Other teams could provide us with new blood. We needed better men at our side."		"Instead we had each other. We were too proud of what we accomplished to believe we were each other's downfall."		"You gave up on me! For what? You never did anything without me! NO AEGIS. NO GLORY. WHERE'S YOUR POSITION ONE NOW?"		I looked to my son, "Right here."		________________________________________		Later at the river my son and I quietly watched the sunrise. Gently he tugged my arm and asked, "Papa, in the story were you Dendi or Puppey?"		"I don't think it matters who I was. I am someone better now."		"Who are you now?"		"I'm your father," I replied, helping him reel in his catch.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Nevflinn","name":"t1_cw2nz2l","parent_id":"t3_3oz7cd","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1445084424,"created_utc":1445055624}

{"body":"If it goes down / mirror :		￼		Natus Vincere has a rich history when it comes to eSports. It has left an impressive mark across all possible game genres such as Dota 2, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, World of Tanks and Hearthstone - to name a few and has lived upto its motto "born to win". Na`Vi was the first team to win the inaugural "The International Dota 2 Championships 2011" held at Cologne, Germany and walked away with a $1,000,000 prize-pool.		 		Na`Vi has also participated in three consecutive grand finals of The International; a feat no other organization has managed to achieve to this day. Fast forward to the year 2014, and we see Na`Vi's fortune starting to dwindle with less than satisfactory performance at The International 2014 which only got worse with time. Post TI4, we entered a rough patch as we began to see frequent changes to our Dota 2 line-up leading all the way to The International 2015.		 		However, recently the team was unable to qualify for theFrankfurt Fall Major 2015 despite tremendous efforts from the players and this led us to a point where we had to make one of the hardest decisions ever; to let go of our Dota 2 team. Yes folks, you heard it right. Natus Vincere has officially decided to part ways with its current Dota 2 line-up.		 		This can come as a shock to our fans, but we believe this is a step in the right direction. We would also like to extend our sincere gratitude to ￼Dendi, ￼XBOCT, ￼Funn1k, ￼SoNNeikO and ￼PSM for being an important part of Na`Vi. It was a pleasure and an honor to have all of you onboard with us, some of you for many years.		 		However, this is not the end of the road for Na`Vi in Dota 2 as we won't give-up so easily on e game we all love. On the next week we will make a few announcements regarding our new Dota 2 line-up. We will strike back and it is possible that you may get to see the re-emergence of some familiar faces in the scene. So be sure to follow our website and be up-to-date with all the relevant information regarding the new line-up.		 		Comment by Natus Vincere's COO ￼ Igor "caff" Sydorenko:		 		"After the protracted series of failures of our team, we have to take measures and with hard feelings fully disband the squad. On behalf of all the fans and Na`Vi staff I express gratitude to the guys for their work and emotions, which they've granted to us all the time. However, sooner or later, the time of old heroes passes.

But when TI is over, another trouble comes up the prodigy captain, Artstyle was booted from the team. The hallowed one, the master of strategy, the king of gank, the sultan of push, the tzar of teamfight, the slayer of ehome, the captain of the year 2010, the champion of the international, the one and only artstyle. I sighed, ready to accept the fate  that they might will never be the same. Oh, how I was so wrong, again. they qualified for TI2 and TI3 final. Gave birth to some historical moment in dota. The play, el classico rivalry, you name the rest. This team is the only one I support..... at least pre 2014.		Everything keep going down since 2014.

{"body":"I can't believe it. It's so surreal. I didn't think this feeling would be here, but here it is. It's the pain of loss. It's like when you grow up watching your favorite baseball, football, or soccer player perform in their sport to the point of a beautiful art, it's just so fun to be a part of that moment. 		But when you get older, so do they. So does your icon - your  idol. You wonder why they can't just outplay their opponent in whatever sport it is. You wonder why they aren't as stylish or flashy. You wonder why they aren't "the best" anymore. But they keep playing, far past their prime. Why? Because they never did it for you in the first place.		Players like these type - the Brett Farves, the Michael Jordans, the Na'Vis - they play their game because they would die for their game. These players live and breathe their game. Na'Vi was no exception. 		I hate to see them go. I will always remember the boys in gold doing things no player or caster thought possible. They set an unprecedented bar for this sport. You want this sport to have big prize pools and intense game plays? Get on **our** level.		It's not goodbye forever, I hope. But more of a "thank you" to these players. I hope to see what they get into next.

I doubt any team would willingly and heartlessly release a player that's been representing their brand for 6 years just because he's not playing well.

Sonneiko is very new but he felt like a very old member in na'vi. 	And for Na'Vi as a organisation, I hope that you never ever get any success in dota 2. This is too much hate but i simply cant watch na'vi playing without dendi, xboct.	They were not actually good lately still i loved them playing.	I think that they were the only team which was not 100% professional. Every other team is just pros playing together just because they got hired togerther by some organisation. Only na'vi felt together because they were actually together.	I wish best of luck to dendi, xboct, funn1k, sonneiko and PSM for their future. I hope they stay together atleast dendi and xboct.
