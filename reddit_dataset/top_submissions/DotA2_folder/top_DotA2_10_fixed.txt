I got some of my friends from my TF2 clan at the time to join with me, and we played loads and loads of bot games together and had the great joy of just slowly discovering Dota together.

{"body":"I'm just posting this anywhere it might be useful:		=====		For those among us who don't know about it yet, I want to point out the following way you can help cancer research, in general:		[Folding at Home](https://folding.stanford.edu/)		It's a piece of software made by Stanford University. It basically folds proteins. How does that help? From the site:		>When proteins do not fold correctly (misfolding), there can be serious health consequences, including many well known diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Mad Cow (BSE), CJD, ALS, AIDS, Huntington's, Parkinson's disease, and many cancers.		>If we better understand protein misfolding we can design drugs and therapies to combat these illnesses.		For those of you asking: has this achieved anything?		Here's some info on that: https://archive.is/0YnYB		It works with all modern CPU's and NVIDIA graphics cards. ~~Sadly nothing on AMD yet.~~		EDIT: Scratch that, information on supported cards is here: https://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=96&t=25288		You can pick which kind of disease you'd like to focus most on, or just get assigned proteins at random.		But there are alternatives that do, if I recall correctly: https://alternativeto.net/software/folding-home/		Now, this means putting your CPU and/or GPU to work. That generates heat and you're leaving your PC on at night, mostly. If your system is unstable, it might even shut down suddenly due to overheating. So if you have doubts, don't feel obliged to do this. In fact, nobody has to do this. It's just a recommendation and it's information that you **can** help combat cancer and other diseases with your PC, through the power of the internet(boogie reference).		Just a recommendation. A lot of us here have powerful pc's. My 4770 does a cpu folding packet in about 2-3 hours. Comparing that to 10 years ago where it would take days, that's a huge difference.		You can help. I just wanted people to know that. That is all.

{"body":"Not that anyone cares, just kinda posting this for myself. I'm currently in pharmacy school and I've debated how I want to specialize for a while (I never want to work in a retail setting.) Last quarter an oncology pharmacist came in to class to present what he does, a specialty that wasn't even on my radar. This guy describing his job put it to the top of my list pretty quick. I was hesitant to just drop all my other choices right away and thought I'd let it settle.		Honestly, I love research and I love staying up to date on what's current. Oncology pharmacy appeals to me because there's seemingly constant new research being done that an oncology pharmacist can draw from to help create better treatment options.		TotalBiscuit's announcement today just came at a time that coincided with me having to do a lot of research about some cancer treatments today. It added a very human element to all of it instead of me just treating this research as merely a school assignment. I've had family members taken from cancer, and friends that are constantly going through it too, so I'm not trying to say TotalBiscuit is the sole reason I'm doing this, but the timing of his horrific news just really made me contemplate this stuff from my own point of view all day today.		The conclusion is this: Fuck cancer. I feel so god damn motivated right now, like a zap of lightning to my soul that I haven't really felt from anything else when it comes towards career pursuits. I think this horrible news may have pushed me enough in the right direction to feel confident when I say I'm going to pursue the hell out of becoming an oncology pharmacist so I can do my part in the fight. His motivation to be an outlier was contagious to me to become a healthcare provider that makes his motivation a reality for my patients someday.

He created a series of videos, including tutorials, when the game CAME OUT. He introduced thousands of people to Dota 2 back when it was still getting it's footing, and through his many other videos as well. I'm not saying he's contributed a lot of incredibly significant things in terms of gameplay or casting or anything. I mentioned that, didn't I you idiot? I'm saying he showed a lot of people a lot about this game over a long period of time and HAS contributed instructional videos and other things to many players.
