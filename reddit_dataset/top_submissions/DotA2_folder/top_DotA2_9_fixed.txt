Summer / Winter Sales had multiple different events every year, like that minigame with pve fighting with party or the one where it split into multiple teams with achievements or the collecting cards from games to unlock card boosters and trade it to get special rewards.		Valve had a AR Prototype with multiple iterations too, they let the developers leave their company and make their own AR Glasses project without wanting anything from it besides what they learned.		You never had an festive event on Dota 2 that was like the same from the other years.		Chinese New Year Event had different iterations every year, same from Diretide / Christmas they are always trying something different or using them with other goals instead ( Like developing Custom Games through Diretide / Christmas Minigames ).

Not everyone can have everything, and the fact that you feel entitled to everything without effort is extremely shitty. I put a lot of money into my Compendium to receive rewards which I wanted -- those rewards shouldn't instantly drop to very low prices just because everyone wants them.

However, fucking over the collectors and traders who act as the whales for the F2P game is not only ungrateful, but unfair. People should be allowed to keep their exclusive items, because their purpose is literally to be exclusive. Removing that and allowing anyone to get that exclusive item is a slap in the face to anyone who either worked for, paid for, or was around at the time of release of, that item. 		This is best-demonstrated in WoW, where having rare Mounts (or some of the rarest Feats of Strength (e.g. World First on completing a new Raid on its highest difficulty)) which are exclusive (either by requiring grinding Raids ([Ashes of Al'Ar](http://www.wowhead.com/item=32458/ashes-of-alar)) or other resources for Professions ([Vial of the Sands](http://www.wowhead.com/item=65891/vial-of-the-sands)), or being around at the release of a new Raid/in a certain era of the game ([Black Qiraji Battle Tank](http://www.wowhead.com/item=21176/black-qiraji-resonating-crystal)), etc.) increases the amount of respect that you get for getting those Mounts.

The issues you read about on reddit are, **for the most part**(see: *not completely*), not experienced by or game breaking for the majority, but simply the vocal few who come here.

If you read the sentence you quoted, you would have noticed the part where I said it's going to take some time to iron out the bugs with the client.

There are these things called QA (quality assurance) testers , whose job it is to scour a game for bugs.

With dota there is PLENTY to test, and before Reborn's launch as the official client there were many bugs that should have been caught. You can dickride valve all you want, but it's really not up for debate that Reborn's launch was premature. Most of the things that reborn set out of fix (like particles being visible in fog) still plague the game.  	  	Yes, Valve had to push reborn out at some point, but clearly it needed more work before replacing the main client.

{"body":"Yeah... partially right.		Big corporations earn their money by keeping their costumers happy and keeping the bonded to the brand. How do you sell the new car to the customer if you fucked around with him when his older car was broke? 		How do you keep your costumers if there is a fierce competition and they can just change the company they buy from?		One of the best examples is Amazon. They let you send back close to everything (if you don't start abusing it) for even the most ridiculous reason. That sure as hell costs them a lot. So why do they do it? Because they want you to be happy with your shopping experience. On the long run that is what keeps them going because the people keep buying there.		And that's something Valve knows. There are presentations from Valve Employees in universities and such where they explain that their goal is it to make everyone happy, because once someone experiences something bad they are less likely to come back to the game/company (horrible phrasing of me I know). Valve makes great stuff and often enough changes things for the customers, one example is the paid mods thing they implemented and removed because they got awful feedback.		So yeah of course do they care about their profits. Of course they want to maximize it. But on the long run it might be better for them to have an open trading system that results in a higher activity of the playerbase.		Not buying more hats is one way (that can certainly work), but the other way is telling them what's wrong because sometimes corporations listen if enough people complain.","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lepre_the_Chaun","name":"t1_cvmodj2","parent_id":"t1_cvmo36e","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443904335,"created_utc":1443875535}

{"body":"Not sure what you are talking about, the DotA economy was quite strong back in the day. And obviously the models are different that is why we are comparing them. Back when the models were very similar is when we saw the DotA economy shine.		The paywall has hardly anything to do with the item market. Once you are playing DotA or CS actively, that is all that matters. The $15 entrance fee for CSGO is going to be negligible in regards to how people approach cosmetics. If anything people will buy less cosmetics for a game they already paid for (which would give the DotA economy the upper hand).		The scenarios are not as different as you think. Both games have items that are solely cosmetic, and people like cool looking things to use when they play. It is pretty simple really.		I also don't see how gambling is going to fuck CS:GO's item economy. If anything I think it is helping. Gamblers have a net loss from gambling, then put more money into the market replacing things they lost. This in turn causes prices to to stay higher than they would have if people were just holding onto their skins. It keeps everything moving constantly and encourages new money to enter, both of which is hugely important for any healthy economy.		One thing I do think DotA has going against it is the skins are only for 1 hero, or a courier, or whatever. In CSGO you will show off your main skins in every game you play no matter what. Which is cool. Still this one thing alone shouldn't absolutely demolish DotA's economy, I don't think it could have ever been as strong as CSGO's, but it could have been leaps and bounds better than it is now if Valve just kept shit simple.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"seanzy61","name":"t1_cvmmm18","parent_id":"t1_cvmlmio","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443896118,"created_utc":1443867318}

{"body":"I was gonna reply to your original post but then I saw someone already made my point, so I'll include my reply on the bottom of this comment to that post as well but anyway.		If you're looking at value only it's pretty easy to see why valve made the decisions they did. You're saying that by you making 2k they made 6k, guess how much more they made when no one can buy certain items for months or never unless they by them directly for them, compared to the measly tax you have to pay for each market trade. It's plain obvious that they make a SHIT TON MORE this way, then they would ever from people trying to make their own money and my original reply to your first post is this :		The dota economy isn't there to make money off of it. This is working as intended and I have no issues with that. If you're in it to make money or whatever, then definitely go bet on sports and the fact that you've stopped watching dota merely means you probably just had a gambling addiction (betting your items on teams) which made you watch the game,  you didn't watch because you actually liked the game that much or else you'd be still watching the same amount of time . " You pay for levels, and get items, there is no other way around it." which is also intended, you're not supposed to get your money back or anything, sure giving you the ability to exchange your purchase for something of equal value (trading) is nice and giving you the ability to do so on all items is very desired but for the rest I just can't see what you exactly want from the game, the market was never intended for those purposes.			That being said, other kinds of restrictions are just bad, like the fact that you cant trade or gift items or the fact that you can't sell them on the market and the amount of times it takes you to do that. These restrictions aren't bad because you can't make your money back or even earn more but because they go against what was happening before and there's no consistency, certain items are tradable, others aren't, 3month restrictions for no other reason than profit etc (although i kinda understand the 3month ban as well and I think it should apply on individual items you buy, since if you just bought say an individual arcana, there's really no reason for you to trade taht in the first 3months, however the issue is when you're opening chests etc where there's rng and u don't want those items) .","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Vuccappella","name":"t1_cvmn3hd","parent_id":"t1_cvml5n3","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443898639,"created_utc":1443869839}

{"body":"Your first part... How do you not know this? Obviously the pool of people doing what you do is more saturated, and normal consumers that resell or want to purchase cheaply, too, have an effect on the marketplace.		I can definitely tell you that it's by no means Valve's fault that that happened. You and people like you had good margins while it wasn't as popular. Now it's more popular, there's more factors involved for making a dime, and the market is more predictable than ever but it's way worse money per transaction. This is basic shit, really. There is no true regulation aside from what you're seeing in this update post. You act like Valve can remove stuff and it will fix the market. Nope, that's not how it works. They are keeping the market fresher, while obviously affecting new or very unique items/sets due to untradable status for them to make the same/more money. 		If they deregulate parts of it then you'd just see what everyone views the digital goods market: worthless. Data is important because it will always equal just 2 components: time, and energy. It's all calculation, that's all it is. The only value tied to items is players, and if players don't or physically cannot due to saturation, Valve can regulate parts of it in attempt to raise value of specific things. It all boils down to copy and pasting, and copy+paste is very cheap compared to the Steam Marketplace's value on a *lot* of shit. You change a few binary sets and the number can go from 1 copy to 1,000,000 and they're all distributed whenever they need to be. With the same margins as 1, or at least we can reasonably assume this is true since Valve will never stop producing items/digital goods. You think obsolete technology is worthless? Think about airwaves and blinks of light, you're paying for something less than air as the end-user. Which results in the product being valued by each legitimate customer differently; how much they enjoy it. If it has a high enjoyment value in comparison to how much it would cost them (very unpredictable), they might be more inclined to buy it. Seeing as it's a $200 item on the market and fuckers are hoarding it to try and make a dollar, it probably looks worse than it actually is to them.		Valve with TF2/DotA 2 is the only company in the world that really has this situation to deal with, the only one able to experiment and actually cope with the problems it faces. So they may not approach it perfectly the first time. Keep that in mind too.		Finally, margin cutters -- or better known as middlemanning -- are why prices are high and margins are very low. The more people involved, the less money each make unless there's market manipulation. But since all of these persons are buying and reselling for higher value when they can, they're manipulating the market anyway (just not together and *as intentionally as they could be*\*).		You look at it as an activity, when you're actually only doing it for money. You, and people like you, are the reason why the market rots. You're killing your own cash cow because you don't know what the *fuck* you are doing. You're in it to win it, the big money, but haven't a clue how to keep the herd from dying. When in reality, you're killing too many cows for how long it takes to repopulate. Darwinism?.. Maybe.		Final notes:  		- \*Using market stats to predict the market is definitely a form of manipulation. 		Example would be looking at graphs for certain item rarities, heroes, trends with events and the likes to adjust your bankroll so you can buy out as many and create a fake demand. The fake demand is a portion of the actual supply, so the end-user price can definitely be abused and altered. There's other ways but this is a quick example.		- You're a complete fucking idiot for not knowing at least parts of this, and for assuming it's Valve's fault. 		You are the only reason they do this, and the biggest impact on the free market. It's a free market and that is literally the only reason you were able to do it. There's a reason you trade and don't work for Valve. This is a hobby to you at best because you don't know what the hell you are doing and/or you have no control over how the market behaves. Reverting the marketplace is actually the opposite of what you'd want, but I suspect Valve would cut you people out before that ever happened. It might happen anyway, based on what I'm seeing.

{"body":"You, and a lot of other respondents to this post, fail to understand how economies work.		Valve is in it for the money. They always have been, and the cute notion you're implying that Valve wants to support its playerbase is not only naïve, but short-sighted and willfully ignorant; the introduction of the marketplace at all, their continued use of the marketplace on other platforms, the changes which are literally being discussed in this thread, the outrageous prices for some items in the International Compendium this year (not that I'm complaining about that, I think it's perfectly fair to charge whatever they like), and so the list goes on (Skyrim paid mods, etc.).		It's cute to imagine a world where DotA 2 is supported solely on Valve's generosity and willingness to give back to their playerbase, but that's not how it works. The costs of continued game development, ongoing server maintenance, outsourcing of assets, organization of events (such as The International and the current ESL One Major), not to mention all other overheads and expenses, are not small by any reasonable scale, and pretending that people like you who buy a few $0.50 items every few weeks are upholding the game simply makes you delusional. 		Valve *profits* from their high-trading playerbase, and those traders also profit from it. Valve is not losing money because we traded in such exceptional amounts, they gained massive amounts from it -- this is why they still keep those systems around in TF2 and CS:GO. In fact, by alienating that playerbase, not just by the theory of what they're doing, but by literally inhibiting any possible opportunity to make money from the system, they're fucking over the people who kept the economy running, and kept the game free (and the items extremely cheap) for *you*. This system of commerce is mutually beneficial, because Valve makes money for every sale that the trader makes, with no effort needed on Valve's part. 		Yeah, yeah, you hate people who made money off the system, because you refused to take risks, make investments, build a collection, and gamble your money on what is/was essentially the DotA 2 stock market. Well, I hope you enjoy it, because now, instead of having to deal with traders who are still basically on your side (consumers vs. corporation), you get to enjoy a 100% corporation-owned system thanks to your constant complaints. Valve didn't make items cheaper for you, *we* did, by saturating marketplaces with items which we knew we could flip for greater and greater prices, and dropping the prices of items we knew we could take risks on. Go ahead and look at the Steam Market for the current International 2013, 2014, and 2015 items -- do you think Valve dropped those prices for you? Hint: they didn't. The average Joe trader who willingly (albeit likely reluctantly) sold his extremely expensive item for a low price did that, even though you don't want to admit it. 		YOU are the ones getting fucked the most out of everyone because of Valve's shitty mistake, in which nobody's happy. You have to now gamble for items which you don't get to keep, I can't hope to invest in collections without gambling endlessly until I get everything, and Valve isn't going to get shit because people can't even gift sets to their friends anymore.

{"body":"I am not saying I don't agree with you on most points. But as a student within the business area and having played Dota 2 since it's inception, I can provide you with how I interpret Valve's philosophy towards cosmetics.		Dota 2 was launched back in 2011. Back then the game was really different, and not polished at all. Valve released a [chest series of 8 different chests](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Treasure_Chests), the first 8 chests released on May 31st of 2012. Now you would actually gain chests constantly through playing and random drops in games, they were quite common as Valve wanted you to have the chest. That's because you couldn't actually open the chest without a [Tresure Key](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Treasure_Key). So Valve were giving you this cool chest for free, and you could look inside but not open with the aforementioned Key. The only way to get keys back then was to buy it from the Dota 2 store for $ 2.49, because other markets to acquire keys had not been made yet.		Soon we would have more and more chests and cosmetics, and more and more trading websites would pop up like Dota-trade.com and dota2lounge. At this point there were only common, uncommon and rare quality for the most part, and cosmetics were generally very much scarcer than it is today. A rare back then would actually be what it meant , "a rare" thing to have. At this point in time and going forward to about 2014 and 2015, there are almost no trading restrictions. Everyone is free to trade with everyone so to speak. Betting sites also appear like dota2lounge, where you can now bet up to 4 common, uncommon or rare items. Now, there was no pricing like this rare is worth $ 0.5, because the Dota 2 Market was not created yet. So the cosmetics had no set pricing, but were instead determined by the secondary market on dota 2 trading sites. To find a buyer or seller for a particular item, you would have to look it up on the trading sites and post [H] X item [W] Y Item / 2 random rares. But some cosmetics were of course more wanted than others, and thus became more worth than other rares. So even though there was no official value from Valve on what the item is worth, it quickly became determined by market forces such as supply and demand. 		From 2012 and onward, more treasures were released and keys became the default "currency" because it was easy to trade, easy to determine quality (1 key is 1 key, unlike 1 rare which is more/less worth than another rare), and stability (you can't get a key drop in game, but you can get a rare drop, thus the key system is relatively stable). If you wanted to trade for something exceptionally expensive, you would literally have to purchase (or trade your items for) keys in order to trade with the other guy who has the item you want. Now, this was working out quite well for Valve because people were generally buying keys to either open their chests or to use them for trading. Either way, Valve was making some decent money here. 		However later on people started to become really tired of the chest system. First of all it was purely luck whether or not you get a "worthless" uncommon, or if you get some actual valuable items like the Dragonclaw Hook. You could either go bust and get an item that was worth far less than the actual key you used to open the chest with, or you actually win the dota lottery and get one of the most valuable items in the game today. Furthermore, people weren't getting what they wanted from the chest. Let's say they wanted a specific item in a particular chest (which had about 10 different options as to what item/set you get), but they just wanted 1 of them. In theory they would have to open 10 of these treasure chests on average to get what they need, and it would cost them $ 24.9 in terms of buying keys. Now this was rather unacceptable to a lot of people. They just wanted to buy that particular set for a set amount directly from the dota store.		So that's what Valve implemented next. And it took off. People could now reliably get their preferred item for maybe a bit more money, but it was what most customers wanted and were willing to pay for. However chests still continued in the same manner, but it was now optional to buy them if you wanted a particular set. This would increase the sales of cosmetics by a huge margin.		Now, Valve also added a system where you would get a rare for every 5 levels you earn in your dota profile. Combine that with certain battle boosters for TI and you would get a huge influx of new rares to the market. Along with that, Valve had certain events which gave away huge amounts of cosmetics if you spent time playing it (Diretide 1 for instance). In addition to that, there were so many new cosmetics being added all the time and being dropped in-game.		All of this resulted in what we call inflation. Remember, keys were always the default currency. Back in 2012 or 2013, a key would buy about 6 rares or similarly if you had rares you can trade 6 of them for a key. The key was always stable in price in value. But the huge influx of new items to every player meant that cosmetics were losing their value. Back in late 2013 and 2014, you would have to pay about 25-30 rares for a key just to illustrate how much the price had changed. Already then, you could see the path that items were going to. Most items were considered "trash" by traders, meaning they were not nearly worth anything. 		And that was confirmed by Valve when they realeased the Steam Market for Dota 2 cosmetics. On there you could list your cosmetics for sale and you would get Steam currency, not keys. Likewise you could buy other people cosmetics for your own Steam currency. That way, Valve took the role of the "greedy middleman" who spammed dota 2 trading sites like Dota-trade.com with [H] This rare [W] 2 random rares. But for every transaction on this new market, Valve takes a piece of the pie. So now Valve is literally making money on every transaction and they are earning tiny amounts of each sale, but relies on huge margins of trade every single day to make their big bucks. Similar to what a really big super market would do, they sell a ton of items and each one of them makes them a little bit of money. So now the cosmetics market actually gets an official price on each and every cosmetic. This particular cosmetic can change over time, depending on circumstances.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"qqmagnuz1","name":"t1_cvmprrt","parent_id":"t3_3nbist","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443908770,"created_utc":1443879970}
{"body":"But it was already too late. The aforementioned huge influx of free cosmetics to all the users meant that the market had more or less collapsed. Steam Market has a minimum price of $ 0.03 per cosmetic, but the real pricing for the current "trash" items are actually much lower. Regardless, even most rares today, which were considered very good items before, are now borderline worthless. Almost all items are valued at $ 0.03 on the official dota 2 market.		Here is where Valve comes in. They have already released the official market. Before all this happened, [their philosophy was explained very well in this video from 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHC-uGDbu7s). What Valve wants to achieve is to have a player based economy where trading is the building block. If people can trade items, then Valve has succeeded in creating higher value for its users. 		After that video was released and between now is where Valve changed their philosophy. All their previous giveaways combined with the huge number of purchases of new cosmetics meant that old/unwanted cosmetics became essentially worthless. That is the case for a huge amount of items on the market. In order to stabilize the value for cosmetics, Valve removed the free rare every 5 levels reward. Also, drops are now incredibly rare compared to previous levels of drops.		The thing which worries me and a lot of other people in this thread is that Valve has also made huge trade restrictions for cosmetics such as you mentioned. You can only trade items you buy after 3 months of owning them and so on. There are other restrictions even to gifting items, which is really surprising. What I am seeing here is Valve actually destroying their own system. Increasing trading restrictions on users means that every set or item which you acquire from a random drop is now not tradeable. It doesn't matter what the official price is for that particular item, you can't trade it. So in essence, if you dislike that particular item and don't use it, it's value is now 0. It has no use to you. In the past you could either trade it for another item, or sell it directly on the steam market. Either way it has value to you, because you can trade it away and get something else back which is valuable to you. In this case, the trade creates value for both users since you are getting something which you perceive as more valuable than the set you got, and the other user gets his desired set as well. It's a win-win scenario, and if the trade was conducted on the official dota 2 market then Valve get's its piece of the pie as well. 		My analysis of what Valve seems to be doing is that they are trying to stabilize the market prices for previous added items which is interesting. Just because you can't trade for new items right away doesn't mean that thousands of cosmetics will rise in demand. For instance, this is not going to make you want old cosmetics. However, what Valve seems to be doing instead is to try to limit the access to new items to only payers who are willing to pay a premium (real money) to have an item or cosmetic now. For instance, if I buy a new set which is realeased to the store today, it is no longer tradeable. That increases the value of the set to me. Why? Because no one else has it, and it's not tradeable. Remember, if it is tradeable then the market would immediately determine the actual value of that new set. Maybe it wasn't worth buying it on the dota 2 market for $ 5 when you can trade for it on other markets for half the price? This way, Valve preserves it's loyal customer base who are willing to pay real money now for cosmetics which will heavily drop in value right after it is made tradeable. Then the value of the set will be determined by supply and demand. Some sets will be go to the dumpster-tier of $ 0.03 per cosmetic, while some sets will be decent in value, let's say $ 0.5 for a set. Other, but very few items will increase in price dramatically as they are so coveted that their value far exceeds what the original price was. A prime example would be the Dragonclaw Hook which is worth far more than what the original price was of $ 2.49, and a good portion of RNG.		 It seems to me that Valve are trying to see how much they can get away with in terms of trading restrictions. It is my guesstimate that previously Valve didn't sell that many new sets directly from the market because they would almost always end up "for free" on the secondary market after a very short period of time. Now Valve gets the entire piece of the pie, minus the artist fee. I would encourage each and every one of you who is concerned about the direction we are going in to stop buying new items from the dota 2 store. Instead, get your items from trading other items you already have on trading sites. That way Valve doesn't get a piece of the pie, and we are telling them with our money that this business practice is not alright!

{"body":"The reason why they made the whole change was because they started putting sets into chests and making sure you didn't get duplicates. If you want them to revert back to they way it used to be, they'll start selling sets for like 5-10 USD in the store and have chests with nothing but single items and a chance to get duplicates. Your all going "it used to be so great back in the day", but guess what, items were a lot more expensive back in the day.		There was a short amount of time during the transition were they would have full sets chest and still make them marketable, but during this time people would just go buy the sets cheap from steammarket the day after the chests dropped. The restriction is there because Valve wants to make money, if you don't want to buy it directly from Valve, you have to wait 3 months. I honestly think the system is fine the way it works today, sure I would prefer how it was during the transition phase, but let's face it; Valve and content creators wasn't making as much as they should have. You also got to take into account that content creators themselves probably prefer it the way it works now, because they can't go onto the steam market and see the items they created for 0,90 USD the day after release.		So here's the alternatives:	1. pay 5-10 USD per set from the store, chests for 2,79 with nothing but 1-2 items drop and duplicates.	2. Pay 2,50 USD per set from chests, a few released on store and some more expensive chests like TI, but you have to wait 3 months for it to be on the market.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cvmmyzl","parent_id":"t3_3nbist","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443898008,"created_utc":1443869208}

But if we simply ban sales, then anything done criminally or with money is outside the scope of the game and valve gets deniability, then you can make any item tradeable after say 24 hours, maybe 2 days at most.		 or limit it to,  you can only gift/trade to someone who has been on your friends list for at least 7 days. that would throw any kind of artificial selling etc  to the wolves, as you'd have to agree on a price then get paid then wait 7 days for your item, if you werent friends with the person i doubt  people would wait for things like this.

{"body":"Your solution is great if you assume the restrictions are in place to protect players and their inventory. But I don't think this is the case, I think the reason most items are not giftable/marketable is that Valve wants people to buy items from them directly (either through the store or through compendiums) instead of from the community market for much cheaper or through trading.	For example, remember Faceless Rex courier? A lot of people spent a lot of money to get one through the compendium, but when it was finally tradable it cost just a fraction of what they had spent. If it was tradable immediately, Valve would have made a lot less money from it.	That's why it's pointless to appeal to them about this, they'll never change how it works, at least not in favor of players.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kote4ko","name":"t1_cvmn35q","parent_id":"t3_3nbist","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443898595,"created_utc":1443869795}

{"body":"Aren't these market restrictions counter-measures to the heavy item farming that devalues the items and messes up the economy in that sense? That is something valve can't control with how compendiums are set up. A free-to-play game with a low or next to no barrier of entry to farm items. If you are going to farm items, you are farming them for your own use.		I don't think valve intends or wants the regular player to make money off dota 2 by item farming and selling. I can only interpret this as Valve wanting you to buy items/sets yourself at a fixed price from the dota 2 store if you really want to use them as in-game cosmetics and not trading goods. I guess this is more controllable from Valve's point of view and these measures control and ensure that money made from items go to valve themselves and the workshop artists. Isn't that quite clear that their intentions are to look after themselves and the workshop artists first and foremost? The actual producers of content of the game, not some random item farmer who has contributed nothing to the production of this game?		Also, people compare the dota 2 market to the csgo market, but there is a whole other barrier to get items there. CSGO is not free-to-play and you also have to buy a key per chest for even a *chance* to get something valuable. That means Valve's revenue probably scale way better in relation to how many cosmetic items are created into the system. As far as I know csgo has no mechanic that accelerates item farming (compendium) and skews the item prices in a way that doesn't benefit valve themselves and the csgo workshop artists.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Changanigans","name":"t1_cvmmah1","parent_id":"t3_3nbist","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443894451,"created_utc":1443865651}

FIVE DOLLARS. you got more than enough sets go be worth more than the average 20c/set current market. Think about the challenges, the predictions, the in game replays and in client viewing. Do you really think anyone with half a brain would give most (or even half) of that up just to be able to make steam pocket change from dota? I enjoy the current system and it lets new players and not so well of players get sets and items and get to play dota dress up. I LOVE THAT. I love that even when I don't have any sort of financial stability, my hero does thanks to the non tradeable non giftable items and sets.

One of the reasons they actually implemented the 3-month no-trade on purchased sets was to *increase* the cost of the sets. New sets *used* to become cheaper and accessible to most people much more quickly because they could be listed on the market immediately, whereas now they must spend $5-10 per for a treasure with the *chance* of getting the one they wanted, for 3 months after release. Worse, some recent ones will be permanently unavailable now.

If everyone buys chests, then sells the items they don't want at a 50% surplus, valve is only getting around 15% of the chest's value for the person to buy the item that they should've tried opening a chest for.		There's simply a larger profit margin in a restricted market.  I think the 3 month rule is excessive, but manageable.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm entirely defending valve on this one.  They're a PLENTY profitable business that certainly isn't put in a position where nickle and diming their customers will be the difference between whether or not they can afford to pay their employee's, I just don't see any radical changes happening at this point.		I think that Valve slipped in a few of these restrictions under the guise of claiming security, but that was almost entirely debunked by the fact that the gift system was created as an afterthought proves that security was far from their primary goal, and I think that they need to consider rolling back some of their changes in the name of customer satisfaction.

{"body":"Yes, yes it did.  And several interviews given back in 2011 gave us insight to why.  In one interview, Valve's Robin Walker stated 'It's a belief of ours that in multiplayer games it's generally true that the more people playing the game, the higher value the game has for each individual customer."  This showed that simply having a booming community, which is bolstered by having no pay gate, helped their game.		However, since that isn't enough to quell your argument, another interview that took place with another Valve Employee, Joe Ludwig.  He stated, though redacted by Gamasutra, "Once the item store was introduced, revenues from item sales alone were four times larger than revenues from sales of TF2 itself, and after the free-to-play transition was finished, overall revenue was up 12 times higher than monthly TF2 sales were."		And at the end of the day, it's all about money.  No matter how much a company cares about it's customers, it cares about them in order to keep making money.		So what's your point?

Oh dear, you literally just explained why everyone here is an entitled asshat, you understand why what you are asking for is both wrong and will never happen, but you keep asking for it. You understand why they changed it, and why it was a good thing, but you still hate that they did it. I don't care if you got 20 billion reddit golds from rich entitled assholes, you still are rich entitled assholes. 		This isn't even Valve in it's' entirety. It's the content creators, whether Valve hired or Workshoppers, who wanted this. At 2014, some of them were barely even getting payed for this shit. Once again, this isn't about you. When people aren't getting payed for there jobs, I'm pretty certain they've got a bigger problem than the amount of time you have to wait for fake, digital goods to be given to your friends.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Grunlag-RAZ","name":"t1_cvnehr0","parent_id":"t3_3nbist","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443955405,"created_utc":1443926605}
