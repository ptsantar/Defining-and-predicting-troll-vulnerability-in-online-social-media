What if they left the door unlocked and had a sign pointed to it saying "valuables inside please don't steal", if there were no bad people it'd be fine so by your logic he's done nothing wrong and isn't at fault for all your shit being stolen.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JoelMahon","name":"t1_czb0but","parent_id":"t1_czazwwx","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1453734739,"created_utc":1453705939}
{"body":"well now there is another party involved. If I ask someone to watch my house of course I expect them to take reasonable measures to protect my house, because that is why they are there. (I'm assuming that is the reason people house sit). 		Similarly if I hire a security guard to watch my business and he falls asleep I will blame him because he did not do what he agreed to do. If you are watching someone else's things you are expected to protect them as owner sees fit, because they are their things not yours, and that is the arrangement you presumably agreed to. If my security guard acted as requested but still was stolen from then I would not blame him.		But I dont think this is the same as someone being victimized. They are not breaking any promises or agreements to anyone, which is what the security guard is being blamed for. I dont think its acceptable to criticize people for being trusting, or that people should be expected to adjust their lives because they fear someone will take advantage of them. I live in Baltimore which has high crime areas and people actually criticize someone for walking alone at night to get something to eat because they should have known better than to walk alone or past midnight or w/e. Is that not insane that someone is blamed for getting mugged because they wanted to walk?		So my point is it doesn't matter how common a crime is or how easy it is to protect yourself from it, the only way you can blame someone for being a victim is if you accept that the crime is ok because any reasonable person would have protected themselves, and since you didn't you're at fault.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spanky12493","name":"t1_czb1cwe","parent_id":"t1_czb0but","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1453738120,"created_utc":1453709320}

A virus scan wont necessarily guarantee the sanctity of your machine as some more advanced viruses (which is the way I assume he got your info, if not that means you got phished or bruteforced in which case your machine is fine) are both runtime and scantime undetectable, which means AVs wont detect them on runtime (when they launch, which is what they do on startup with persistence modules), or when you run a virus scan (modern malware also has unique hashes which is another way AVs try to detect them, it basically just constantly changes its hash so its not in the 'known virus,' database). If your machine is infected it really doesn't matter if you've recovered your accounts as he or she will get them again.
