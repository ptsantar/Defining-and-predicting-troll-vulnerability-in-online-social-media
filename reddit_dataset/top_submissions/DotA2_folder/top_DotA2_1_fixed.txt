{"body":"Seriously. Everyone here is mindblown by EG's play there, but fucking easy bots would've done the same. EG are incredible players, they played their asses off in the tournament, Universe is godlike, but that particular play was nothing. 		CDEC just made the worst throw I've seen yet. Going into Roshan at all was dumb, then deciding to attack him for 5 more seconds after they had Ice Vortex on them was insane. PPD was like "ok I'm gonna scout", then he's like "ok they're there. WTF why aren't they moving? Guess I can't go wrong by hitting R." and Universe just did blink Echo like anyone would have done. I was in total disbelief CDEC decided to play it like that.		The only notable thing was that the Echo was pretty well positioned, but he had some leeway, he was going in blind so it was partly luck and they would've gotten wiped had he missed like 2 of them anyway. Point is, despite the textbook execution from EG, the credit for this fully goes to CDEC. Really sad how they suddenly decided to completely forget basic positioning halfway into the game (and never remembered it for the rest of the game) when they consistently showed mastery of it.

You can't ban every hero. Of the first phase bans there is...Naga, Lesh, Techies, Bounty, Gyro, Lina, Tusk, Wyvern, etc. There is just too many heroes to consider.

It helps that if you have a hero the other team absolutely can't deal with (Techies), they essentially have to waste one of their bans on that. LGD had to blow an Enigma ban after EG destroyed them Game 1, which just allowed EG to draft a more meta hero.

Pulling out a pocket strat (or what seemed like it) changes future drafting decisions, and CDEC having to waste their first bans on techies/naga allowed strong meta heroes to slip through.		So there are really 5 heroes you always want to ban against EG it seems:		Techies		Naga		Ember		Storm		Clockwerk		No matter which order you ban in, some of those are getting through and the rest of the team can play around them.

Once you allow them to play Leshrac and they realize they don't utilize him well (losing with him), it becomes up to CDEC to ban Leshrac first phase, meaning Techies or Naga were not banned.

Surprisingly, Deadmau5 played a lot of artists on his label and edited versions of his own songs, typically adding in different drops, synths, and a lot of music meant to help transition from song to song.

His jungle farming was so much faster than shiki's, shiki always seemed like he was pausing between camps, thinking about how best to farm; whereas sumail would just delete his entire jungle in under a minute, dropping items while activating soul ring, then picking them up again so fast you didn't see them hit the floor; using clarities and salves in between jungle farming, so that he could blow his mana and farm the camps even faster, then show up back in lane with full hp and mana. 		I didn't realise sumail was such a good leshrac player. Watching him play it in the final gave me a new appreciation for his skill.

{"body":"Really happy for the entire team but special shoutout to the undisputed best captain in Dota 2. PPD gets shit for making it a thing to not banning Lesh etc but he totally outmindgamed CDEC this time by making them waste so many bans on heroes that EG refuse to ban but can use to such a devastating effect themselves.		That game 4 was just complete mindfuck from PPD. He takes away Dire from CDEC all series then for the clutch game 4, he switches up completely on them, fucks with their game plan so much by taking first pick, forcing CDEC to ban Lesh themselves since they've played Lesh 3 times and still got shat on. It all sets up for the easy Gyro-Naga opener and by that point CDEC were already backed into the corner they didn't want to be. EG just forced CDEC into all sorts of bans they didn't want to commit to. Lesh and Techies being the primary examples that allowed EG to counter CDEC hard by then banning the heroes EG really wants to take away in their prized Bounty Hunter and Tusk. Then the later CDEC bans on CM, Wind, etc just shows how versatile EG is and how strongly they've adapted to their opponents and forced them to play their game. PPD MVP for sure. Not to mention that clutch ice vortex at the Rosh Pit.		Looking at it now, it all seems so calculated from PPD. The insistence on letting Lesh through throughout the entire tournament. The surprise Techies picks to beat CDEC and EHOME to force them into wasting bans on it in the future. All of these influenced the opening to the Game 4 draft so much.","depth":0,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thecurls23","name":"t1_ctwi4ri","parent_id":"t3_3gb3bb","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439117041,"created_utc":1439088241}
