{"body":"> There was a lot of criticism on Bethesda's cut being too big, but Valve had no part of their decision.		No part? It was implemented on Valve's platform, which means Valve could dictate the conditions if it wanted. Valve could have easily put its foot down and said "you get 5% or we're not going through with this and you don't get to profit from mods at all, make your choice". Given that Bethesda didn't lift a finger during that whole thing anyway, I think they'd have accepted. Even 5% is still free money compared to no money at all, and of course that would have left 60% of the revenue for the modders as opposed to 25%. That still wouldn't be fair, of course, given that Bethesda is already profiting from the existence of mods, which drives the sale of their games, so for a truly fair arrangement it's Bethesda who should be paying modders, not the other way around, but it would have been better than what was ultimately implemented.		But of course Valve doesn't care about such trifles as being a force for good in the gaming industry or making sure people aren't stealing and selling other people's work or enforcing some semblance of fair pricing. All they care about is making money. As long as they get their cut, nothing else matters to them. It took huge community backlash to make them scrap the paid mods scheme, and when I say "scrap" I of course mean "postpone". Let us not forget that in the end they said they still think the idea is a good one and that it was merely a problem of bad implementation. When TES6 comes to Steam, which it will in a year or two given the release schedule of the last few games, paid mods will come back with it, mark my words. And when I say "paid mods" I of course mean "outsourced 3rd party horse armor-style DLC", because that's what paid mods are.

{"body":"> Because they implemented a system for permanent terrain. The way it used to work made it impossible to have permanent map terrain changes.	> It was literally impossible, technically, for past Halloween maps to stay around forever. It is now possible for them to.		That's not what was impossible at all. What was impossible was to have terrain as a cosmetic giving individual people the option to choose which map to play on. The way it worked before was that everyone (at least in the same game) must have been using the same map. It was all or nothing.		They could have easily implemented permanent terrain, because that's literally what the themed maps were. The only reason they weren't permanent is because the developers go in and update the game to remove the themed map so it's not used anymore. You make it sound as if it was a programming limitation that forced them to make Halloween map expire. How could that possibly be a limitation? What, you think the servers are just like "oh this halloween map file has gone bad and is past its expiration date, it just won't work anymore." Lol no. If Valve wanted to, they could have just left the terrain change there permanently.		And it's because that in the past those Halloween maps were all or nothing for everyone that they made them expire. Now with terrain cosmetics it's not the case that they have to force everyone to use the same terrain, so they don't have to go in and retire themes. They had to expire themes before, because they didn't want to force everyone to be playing the winter or halloween map the entire year and they didn't want "map theme preference" to be a permanent thing, because in reality that was just splitting the queue for a stupid reason. Having that extra queue option just for map preference just needlessly makes matchmaking worse. So rather than have permanent themed maps with the only option to choose which one you want to play with implemented as actually having to queue to play for that map with other people who always chose to play on that map, they made it so everyone in any game can be using different terrains together in the same game.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Learn2Buy","name":"t1_cze9gd5","parent_id":"t1_cze8xrb","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1453955279,"created_utc":1453926479}

It means you can't change the terrain in a way that isn't permanent. It means you're stuck with only having permanent terrain changes.

No, as I described before, the way it used to work is that every terrain change was implemented as a permanent map change. They had to move away from having terrain changes implemented as permanent map changes if they wanted to implement map cosmetics.		> Everything you said basically boils down to why it was functionally impossible for permanent map styles to exist in Source 1.		No. The fact that the themed maps boiled down to actual permanent map styles is why map cosmetics were impossible.
