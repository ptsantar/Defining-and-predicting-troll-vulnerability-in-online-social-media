It takes them from 'pub jungler when your team drafted badly' to 'actually viable'. Ofc we haven't had a chance to see it in action yet but to dismiss it off hand when it gives these heroes everything they need to jungle efficiently is silly.		> It's not a tremendous increase to jungling speed		It's pretty damn big. It's essentially an extra camp every minute in the first few minutes, but more importantly it gives CONSISTENCY to your junglers. Right now if you play doom in the jungle and you get some unlucky spawns (ursa large camp, centaur medium camp) that fucks your early game pretty hard. With this you can clear that ursa camp without losing half your hp and you not only farm faster, you sustain better, youre less vulnerable to ganks, and if you get a good early spawn you even have time to stack a camp before the next spawn. On paper it's fucking bonkers how much value youre getting from the 300g on top of the QB you're buying anyway. 		> and what boost it does give is at the cost of rushing a more important item, like say a vlads on lycan/ursa.		Yea because 300 extra gold sets you back sooooo far. Might delay your vlads by an entire 15 seconds.","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dakkr","name":"t1_cy0uice","parent_id":"t1_cy0tk3s","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450286510,"created_utc":1450257710}

{"body":"**Arcane Curse:**		Targets an area, causes enemies to take damage over time. Anytime they cast a spell, the duration of the debuff is increased. If an enemy affected by this debuff is silenced, the debuff will pause (no damage and no time elapses).		* Duration: 7 seconds	* Stacking Duration: 4 seconds (anytime a spell is cast, this is added to the duration)	* DPS: 14/21/28/35	* Cooldown: 18/16/14/12		**Curse of the Silent**		* Damage per Second: 20/35/50/65	* Mana Loss per Second: 8/16/24/32	* Duration: 6 	* Cooldown: 20/16/12/8		**The biggest question is how the debuff interacts with itself, as well as with purges.**		If it is purged by BKB, Eul's, Manta, Lotus, Greaves etc. It's trash, because the enemy heroes will be using those items to dispel the Silence anyway.		If it doesn't stack with itself, then you've got a nerf to Agh's refresher, because the buff is paused until you're casting Global again.		If the curse is not dispellable (except by letting it time out), it is significantly stronger, and stops spellcasters from unloading onto Silencer or his team, before purging themselves with something like a Eul's.		Even if the curse is not dispellable, it is completely ineffective during teamfights. Because the curse doesn't afflict silenced heroes, you effectively have 4-6 seconds of Silence, followed by 7+ seconds of DPS. The old CotS was more synergistic, preventing enemy heroes from casting spells to dispel it because they were silenced, and **dealing damage during the fight**.		If you look at the damage values of the new curse, it's rather lacklustre, sure, it's a pseudo-silence, but it does significantly less damage per second (which can be ensured with last word, or watching their mana, anyway), and doesn't drain their mana.		**Unfortunately, the best-case scenario you're going to get with Agh's and the new Curse is a non-dispellable, stackable debuff, which is going to get you plenty of killsteals (and intelligence) after the other team wins the teamfight.**		The more likely case, is that it will be dispelled along with the Silence, and will do exactly as much as the current CotS: Jack Diddly Squat.		Edit: Best case is someone who hasn't read the patch notes killing themselves in-lane, because they think it's a good idea to spam Sky's entire kit to try and dispel Arcane Curse.","depth":3,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SeablazeRS","name":"t1_cy0nj5n","parent_id":"t1_cy0isdd","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450267905,"created_utc":1450239105}

For all these years I've worked so hard just trying to make a living while supporting the great heroes who make this game what it is. Now I don't know if I'll be able to actually continue to perform my duties as a courier! Rent isn't going down anytime soon, and food is as expensive as ever and I have kids and I just don't know if I'll be able to support my family on 100g per game.		This is of course the result of increased courier immigration. All these new couriers, the little husky puppies and dragons and even miniature heroes are really cramping my ability to find work. These impostor couriers are taking our jobs and I think it's about time that Valve did something, like build a wall, preventing new couriers from finding their way to the ancient battlegrounds.

Besides an enemy surviving Zeus ult on 6hp, I've never thought _man, I reall wish my spells would deal 8% more damage from slightly longer range._ At least the Octo core of last patch unlocked a lot of new and clever interactions such as perma-illusion Naga and constant heal Necro. What does a small range buff do, besides increase range? Maybe I'm just cynical and resisting change. I'll have to see how it plays out.				edit: Now that I've given it a go, I can say that I was just cynical.

You never want that long a range of stun since it takes you away from them for your ulti. The only thing I really see it doing is helping your ulti if you don't get blink or salvaging an ulti where your blink is disabled.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"icydeadpeeps","name":"t1_cy13grk","parent_id":"t1_cy0mmu4","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450310673,"created_utc":1450281873}

Also, the 4 sec blinkstrike is kinda meh, but it also gives you infinite chase, pending mana. I do like the current system of chargers, but I think in the long run, the 4sec CD will be better, as you can always close the gap.  I found myself lacking charges after big team fights.

What I did was buy the improved version of QB and mango, and ferried myself tango and mango after I killed the hard camp twice. Before creep spawn cleared all the trees near medium (though you only need to clear 3 trees to farm the medium camp from highground indefinitely). Something to look into is to how to stack the medium camp at 01:00 too, while killing the hardcamp, or stacking it. How it could be really good is that if you had your support stacking another camp for you and you clear it once you get some levels to starfall.

In addition, you often can lose vision of a fleeing enemy before  they get out of your attack range, so the extra range wouldn't  help. Thirdly, damage is a product of how hard you hit * how often you hit, so sometimes building more attack speed is better damage per gold than more range. Finally, enchantress is a bit of a tempo hero (you want to win the game sooner than later, dont sit around farming too long), so if you need to get an orchid or hex for some escapable enemy, a 4200 gold item like Aghs would simply not be worth delaying that (a 1850 gold item, however....)

I dont know if you ever played Dota2 but it obviously is vastly diffrent from your game.

The Hero they added was already in the game for a long amount of time (they simply had to port him from Dota1 - the WC3 Mod)  and the map changes seem big to the community, because they change gameplay a lot, but from a concent point of view there is little to no actual change. 	Icefrog is known for being very secretive about his patches - there is little to no communication at all unlike over at PoE. you can check out the patch history here: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Patches 	If you have any further questions I think there are several great community members with greater knowledge about the game ( I can pm you some examples if you wish so) who can show you around the dota2 World some more.

Sure "Shadow Word" is an amazing heal, but I could get Fatal Bonds instead and cast it every wave on the enemy hero, making the enemy take damage from damage received by creeps. It's way more effective and powerful. Cast range is better than Shadow Word, Damage is better and I don't have mana to cast Shadow Word + Fatal Bonds.		Soul Ring is a bit too far fetched for early game support Warlock.		I just think you are wasting Warlock Potential by not using his full potential as early as you can. Having Fatal Bonds 2 + Upheaval 4 by Level 7 is insane, it makes it impossible for the enemy to teamfight ( 2+ enemy heroes ) anywhere.		The only way I wouldn't get Upheaval early on is if the enemy contested our safelane with an aggressive Trilane, getting Upheaval most likely won't change anything, so you need Fatal Bonds + Shadow Word to be able to fight, but it's your loss anyways if they do contest with a aggressive trilane because Warlock sucks so much on 3v3 lanes.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"otarU","name":"t1_cy0o418","parent_id":"t1_cy0muik","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450268988,"created_utc":1450240188}

Shadow word will always get its damage in, making you somewhat more of a core and less of a support, though the healing lets you support when needed.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Crixomix","name":"t1_cy0ogmi","parent_id":"t1_cy0o418","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450269672,"created_utc":1450240872}
{"body":"No I am not wrong.		Shadow Word has 500 Casting Range, it's terrible, less than most ranges.		Fatal Bonds has 1000 Casting Range.		It links 3 targets on Level 1, sharing 25% of the damage they take.		A Fatal Bonds at Level 1 will Deal 50% of 550 HP easily to the enemy hero. This means that it will deal 275 damage while Shadow Word will deal only 15 * 12 magic damage ( 180 magic damage ). 		By the time you have Shadow Word 2, Fatal Bonds 2 will be available, linking 4 units.		This means that it will deal 412 damage at Level 2 Fatal Bonds meanwhile, Shadow Word is dealing 300 Magic Damage.		If we take both skills at Level 4, then Shadow Word deals 540 Magic Damage while Fatal Bonds 4 links 6 Units dealing 487 damage to a single enemy hero ( Because there are only 3 melee creeps + 1 ranged creep in early waves ) and dealing potentially way more if it's against more heroes / teambattle.		Meanwhile if we have teambattles, you will only be able to use Shadow Word on a single target every 16 seconds and only at a risky 500 casting range.		Also reminder that I recommend Fatal Bonds 2 + Upheaval 4 so you will never do less damage through Fatal Bonds because there are only 4 creeps in a creep wave.		It's fine if you think that Shadow Word is a good spell, but really Fatal Bonds only gets better the more heroes are involved, it amplifies allies damage, it allows you to damage enemy heroes through enemy creeps. It's a way better spell, getting Shadow Word is like leveling up Shadow Poison on a hero that has 2 way better skills like shallow grave and shadow weave.		I would only build Shadow Word + Fatal Bonds instead of Upheaval if I was playing Core Mid, but even then, those Warlock Mids usually go Shadow Word + Stats to win the lane through sheer brute force.			Edit : Since you haven't replied yet, I will add some further thoughts.		I think that having a 300 dmg nuke on Level 3 is really cool and strong a 540 damage nuke / heal on level 7 is also insanely strong, but I think the main problem with Warlock is the casting range ( 500 ) / animation of Shadow Word, by the time he gets in range to use Shadow Word to harass he can be started and bursted before Shadow Word deals enough damage to make a difference.		Also his other skills are insanely stronger when having teamfights. But yeah, Shadow Word is a fine skill.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"otarU","name":"t1_cy0ot0w","parent_id":"t1_cy0ogmi","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450270355,"created_utc":1450241555}

{"body":"Let's say you have a TA with MKB + Daedalus and Phase Boots at Level 18 with 3 Stats Point with Refraction Enabled.		6.86 :		108 Base Damage + 80 from Refraction + 24 from Phase + 66 from MKB + 81 from Daedalus.		If you crit and bash at the same time.		You do 359 * 2.2x + 160 damage = 950 Total Damage.		If you crit and don't bash = 789 damage.		Now on 6.85 :		108 Base Damage + 80 from Refraction + 24 from Phase + 88 from MKB + 81 from Daedalus.		If you Crit and Bash :		381 * 2.4x + 100 Damage = 1014 Total Damage.		If you crit and don't bash = 914 Total Damage.		So as you can see, the damage cap becomes lower on both situations specially if you don't bash, but you do critical more frequently because of the increased chance, so the dps is overall the same with a slightly nerfed critical damage because the damage was transferred to bashs.		Also keep in mind that Magic Immunity blocks Bash Damage since it's Magical Damage.		Also to keep in mind is the fact that because the damage is Magical, it might be less reduced than physical damage and isn't affected by popular heroes like Dazzle / Slardar that cause -armor debuffs.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"otarU","name":"t1_cy0hjyl","parent_id":"t1_cy0gogi","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450258330,"created_utc":1450229530}

The biggest change on MKB is for heroes like Gyrocopter, they don't benefit at all from Bash Damage since it can't proc other targets on their Multishot Skill, so in a way it's a somewhat meaningful nerf on their ability to deal damage to multiple targets like when Farming Ancients or Teambattles.

{"body":"Batrider has so much heal now. Bristle Nasal Goo oh god I love it! Centaur Warrunner: A step in the right direction I think. Needs a double edge buff though. Chen is so STRONG! CM regens so much mana! Dragon Knight so much HP Regen too! Will Silver Edge Agh's Drow become a thing now? Oh JESUS Invoker so powerful in mid lane now! EZALOR IS BEST MANA GIVER! Kunkka apparently showed IceFrog DotaIMBA and convinced him that's what his ult should do. Oh that's a minor help for Magnus but not that great. Ogre Magi just can't stop getting buffs hmmm.		OH HEY PA isn't as dumb as a bag of bricks now, so that's good. I'm not sure how I like the Riki changes. Is it not based off of his agility score anymore? That fade time is way too long at level 4 for the ability, and Riki needed that HP regeneration ugh. I'll still love the little satyr guy but still, this changes his whole schtick. That is an interesting SF buff though. Oh god Glaives is going to be so friggin scary now. Wait so is Tidehunter's Gush just Tusk's Ice Shards now? It works kinda like that? Vengeful Spirit Aghanims Scepter is almost core I'd think. She'd have 24/7 uptime. Winter Wyvern is going to be even worse now. Ugh. WK's buff works like Basi-Ring now? That's kinda cool and helps sustain without pushing the dang lane. 		Sniper and Enchantress core Dragon Lance now? I can definitely see that being made mostly for Enchantress. And Drow too I guess, she needs more health and needs to be far from peeps for her Agi to stay up. Boots and Courier cost less that's cool. As does bottle. 		OOOH A diffusal buff for my riki games. Definitely going for Hood of Defiance on Centaur before Blink Dagger now, since Hood will help the Double-Edge farm so much. Ring of Protection back to the old Ring ugh.

(since something perceived as "better" is very subjective, so you need something, like number of people playing to decide which is "better") if dota would remove inconsistencies, it would take over lol in a second, dota's champion/item design is 5000 times better than LoL, but it is way too inconsistent and annoying on some other parts.","depth":8,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Aylomein2","name":"t1_cy0jdhz","parent_id":"t1_cy0isrr","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450261178,"created_utc":1450232378}
