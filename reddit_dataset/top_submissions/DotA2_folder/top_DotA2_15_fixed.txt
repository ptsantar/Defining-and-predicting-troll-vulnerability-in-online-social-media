Even teams that are bottom of the pack have players earning rumored salaries at $300k-$500k.

The NA and EU players make 20k salary from riot + 70-80k twitch money if they stream 8 hours a day 5 days a week with 20k viewers(the majority of them don't or don't get this many viewers) + whatever they get from sponsorships though for esports most sponsorship money goes to the organization and the players just get free gear unless it's a personal sponsor like demon + redbull. In total the average pro probably earns between 30 and 150k after taxes, the high end being the ones who get 50k+ viewers daily and the low end being the ones who don't stream at all. that's basically equivalent to getting 9-12th at TI with every other tournament just being a bonus. LoL doesn't really have any other tournaments besides LCS since riot doesn't allow LCS players/teams to compete in other tournaments.		now if you look at korean players most of them get considerably worse salary than western players which is why all the good ones leave to north america or china. the vast majority of them make like 10k salary per season and don't get paid nearly as much for streaming because they have to practice 6-8 hours a day 4-5 days a week.		so yeah if you want to look at chinese players alone the chinese LoL players might make more because it's funded by billionaires and the chinese distributor of LoL is one of the largest companies in the world, but in every other scene most of the money is being pocketed by riot games or the organizations through sponsorships and viewership.","depth":9,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Remi-Scarlet","name":"t1_cu2m1sk","parent_id":"t1_cu2lola","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439573922,"created_utc":1439545122}
{"body":"The person I was replying to was specifically speaking about the top 4 teams in the world, not the average LoL pro. The best region atm in LoL is China, they also won the last international tournament. Out of the top 4 teams in the world, 3 would be Chinese and 1 would be Korean. The Korean team happens to have Faker on it and he's rumored to make ~$1 million anyways, but I agree that Korea pays lower salaries than China. Okay, let me address your points:		* Even if you want to talk about the average pro earnings rather than the top 4 it's my understanding that LoL beats Dota 2 here as well, with a much better wealth distribution amongst all pro players, [source.](http://www.dailydot.com/esports/dota-2-prize-distribution-players/) 		* "Riot doesn't allow LCS players/teams to compete in other tournaments", this is factually incorrect, there are no rules in place forbidding pro players from attending other tournaments or even skipping LCS weeks. CLG infamously skipped LCS weeks to bootcamp in Korea for playoffs, there were no repercussions from Riot.		* Your Twitch earnings also seem really far off, back in Season 2 Hotshotgg would make up to $30k per month from streaming whilst playing competitively, [source.](http://www.mysig.de/images/userpics/hsgg.jpg) Important to note that this was three years before LoL saw exponential growth in its viewers with Season 3. 		In conclusion, it's far more likely that the players on top LCS teams are making salaries that are just under what some doctors make (~300k is my guess), with some of the well branded LCS players like Ocelote making close to one million per year. Bottom tier LCS teams are probably closer to the earnings range you're describing.

{"body":"your source for stream revenue seems quite off unless I'm misunderstanding something?		That seems to be the entire team's stream revenue as you can see from the list of commercial breaks per streamer at the bottom. HotshotGG was logged into the main CLG account which the other players were linked to, not his personal account.		Also Own3d paid more than Twitch, like twice as much. The only reason everyone switched to Twitch was because Own3d went full speedgaming mode and just stopped paying people entirely and when your job is streaming you can't really afford to hold out for 6 months waiting for the higher payment when Twitch was more reliable.		Twitch generally takes 40% of the money from subscribers which is pretty decent, but also only pays $3.50 per ad per 500 viewers, so while that sounds great on paper you'd have to be really popular to be making a huge profit off of ads, especially after accounting for adblock. most of the money is from subscribers.		Now I have no idea on the figures for subscribers but if you assume 10% of the viewers are subscribers a streamer getting 20k viewers on average makes $6000 a month off subscribers, maybe $2-4k off of ads depending on how many have adblock.		That's still a lot of money, 100-120k, which is realistic for how much that tier of streamers probably expect to make, but that's still only 80-100k after taxes depending on where they live.		That's basically equivalent to getting top 8 at TI, which is pretty good but honestly being a good player is a completely different skillset from being an entertaining streamer so it's mostly up to preference whether a player likes to stream a lot or not. I think either way if your goal is streaming or being a professional you still have to be a top tier player and promote yourself but after that point I imagine most would rather continue progressing to be the best rather than settling for effectively being a personality.		Feel free to correct my math anywhere if I'm wrong since I'm not a streamer and I'm not confident in my knowledge, just speculating.		edit: I actually miscalculated ad revenue, it's $3.5 per 1k instead of 3.5 per 500, so you'd basically have to cut it in half.

{"body":"Ah, my bad. You're right about that screenshot. I took it from a Reddit thread about stream revenue and didn't examine it closely. Top teams typically get 30k viewers per player on Twitch.

They concluded that a player on a top LCS team makes about $240k-$480k from streaming 15 hours a week.		Edit - Compared to your math the ad earnings would be closer to $15k-$30k rather than $2k-$4k.

Like it's actually really impressive how much the top players make but 95% of streamers will never hit Bjergsen numbers in either game so it's not really indicative of an 'average' pro player, the average probably has half as many subscribers/viewers as bjergsen, some with barely any at all even since they don't stream very often.		If anything I feel like DotA 2 just has a lot more room to grow when it comes to streamers. Even when the pros like Envy or RTZ stream they don't run ads most of the time as far as I know and stream at random hours when they feel like being 'social'.		I followed league of legends back in pre-season 1 all the way to season 3 and back then it felt like dota feels like right now where streamers mostly just did it to promote the game, primary difference being most of their income was from streaming even though their primary focus was winning tournaments whereas in dota 90% of the money is in tournaments.		Once the TI prize money bubble bursts due to Majors I think players will realize just how lucrative it can be to focus on expanding their dedicated viewership by streaming during regular hours instead of random times in the middle of the day/night only to ragequit after one game(Zai??). If players like EE and RTZ and Dendi with huge fanbases actually focused on streaming 4-6 hours a day they could be making at least 150-200k a year from twitch alone regardless of TI placement considering they average 10-15k viewers.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Remi-Scarlet","name":"t1_cu2n8hw","parent_id":"t1_cu2my49","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439578776,"created_utc":1439549976}

If the other team they're a wrench into their plan they're also hands down the best team at keeping composure, making space and getting back into lost games. They're a team of very few mistakes and run like a well oiled machine. With Zai and Arteezy they definitely crushed teams but it always felt like they did it by just being better than the other team individual skill wise, the same way secret win games now. New EG just stomp teams by playing better as a team. Hitting timing windows, rotations, ganks, pushes and defenses are all things EG do better than any other team IMO. There are so many games I see them play where they feel like they're losing or just getting bullied in lanes and then something like Aui hitting 6 or Sumail getting a key item happens and they just flip a switch and fucking *crush* teams.

{"body":"> Misery is the skill cap so no one has surpassed him today aswell. 		Ok, judging by results that's just straight up wrong. 		There's somewhat of a spurious correlation between those two facts (being a superb core in the past and being a superb core now -- DeMoN was a superb player back then as well). I'm focusing on the fact that people are using Misery's past success in an entirely different landscape as evidence of his present capabilities. Simply having past "competitive experience" doesn't necessarily translate to skill, and I think this year's TI has very clearly showed us that proper practice regimen dramatically outweighs any sort of past experience. EG aside, MVP Phoenix is the clearest example.		Pointing out good play on Secret in the present, etc. is confirmatory evidence. I never denied that. But it's been made pretty clear that behaviors that there are training activities that productively increase skill (massively grinding specific heroes, lots of replay analysis, etc.) and simply playing lots of games. Has Misery done that to stay good? I don't know, maybe, I don't know him. But the fact of the matter is that in a landscape that's changed so much, past success is a really bad predictor of future success.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"timmmmmay","name":"t1_cu2x8q1","parent_id":"t1_cu2ndm9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439598793,"created_utc":1439569993}

ArtStyle played all the junglers, all the Strength carry heroes like NS or DK and was generally the second core.   Dread was the support in the hard lane except when he was playing a micro hero, usually Brewmaster or Invoker, both of which he was excellent at, especially Panda.  LightOfHeaven played the main carry hero except when he played the main support because ArtStyle or Dread was playing a farmer AND Dendi was on a mid hero.  Dendi played the traditional mid heroes except when he had to play support because Dread was playing Panda and LoH was on a carry.  And then NS played the supports, always.   And then sometimes they'd do something like the semi-famous EEDL party raid game, where they went level 1 5-man roam with a party based on an MMO.  ArtStyle DK as the tank, Light Venge and Dread WD as CC, Dendi Mirana as DPS and NS Dazzle as the main healer.

I think fata will be a player that can secure a good team and would be wanted. At the moment I don't think any of the big EU teams are searching for midlaners but maybe Alliance might reshuffle and they might kick Pajkatt and get FATA since fata has played with mad before and he's more of a playmaking mid than the more farm orientated PJakatt.		EE will make his own team, I don't see him playing under anyone's supervision almost ever.		BDN might try out a few teams and find something or not, he was the worst after bone7. I kinda hope he reunites with fly as fly was probably the best player on complexity, for that though he will need to leave complexity and for a new team. BDN+ FLY + 3 strong cores. Complexity impressed this ti but their core players were really dragging them down. Zfreak and Fly played really well and showed good hero diversity (zfreak played chen,wisp,bounty and other supports, which player in the world even plays these heroes + other standard supports at the same time), fly was the absolute highlight in some games on WW or Tusk and so on but their core players were really bad, Swindle was loosing mid in 90% of their games, Moonmander was performing good against weak teams but the moment they played better teams I was asking myself if he was even in the game and their carry was stable but nothing special, definitely made some crucial mistakes in the deciding games as well, I doubt Col will disband after placing 8th so this is unlikely to happen.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Vuccappella","name":"t1_cu306n4","parent_id":"t3_3gyaan","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439603162,"created_utc":1439574362}
