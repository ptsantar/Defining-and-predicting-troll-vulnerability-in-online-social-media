When put in the hands of a good strategist, he can wreck havoc on the enemy team.		I've seen him trade CS in lane as NP whilst simultaneously blocking enemy ancients and pull camp with trees, and farming big camp with trees. That already takes skill.		Aghanims has actually opened up Lone Druid to be a more viable option, Bulldog himself saying the hero is playable now. 		He plays a solid Clock, is a very mechanically skilled player and seemingly does his best at Dota when he's having fun.		With Pitlord coming, NoTail as a *very* good wisp player, it could be time for the Rat to return, this time to Sec(rat).		Most mids still respect Dendi in lane, he's been playing Dota for one of the longest times, the dude's unparalleled at denying CS, I'm sure with a top tier team, Dendi could have a chance at being top tier again.

{"body":"It might not seem like much, but I really do think this picture is one of the better ones at capturing what DotA2 and gaming in general really is. Sure we have tons of money being thrown around, racism and insults in plentiful amounts, and high stress is a regularity, but at the end of the day we all play the same game and are all more or less equally capable of doing the things the pros do - only restricted by one's ability to procure a computer to play on and the time needed to hone one's craft instead of your height, size, race, etc.		You can easily say "its just a picture", but if you know the backstory of these two guys and the things that they have gone through, both as teammates and as opposing competitors, you'll take something beautiful from this picture. These are two guys who have been at the highest of highs that a person can experience in DotA2 and are currently at what one could consider the lowest of lows for their sport. Anyone watching who has an understanding of the spirit of competition or the prestige and money at stake at TI5 can immediately tell that behind the seemingly cheery faces of the many already eliminated competitors is a sea of disappointment, sadness, and depression. It almost appears that they are always "uncomfortable". However, for a brief moment in that snapshot of time both these players, Dendi & Puppey, look genuinely happy. In this regard I consider this picture one of the best, if not the best, from TI5 so far.		While I am sure they are enjoying the event regardless of their shortcomings, as a mere spectator from home it is nice seeing them smile and reminisce over old times in a fun game of DotA.","depth":0,"score":564,"ups":564,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Kowzz","name":"t1_ctvqan6","parent_id":"t3_3g7ca2","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439047820,"created_utc":1439019020}
{"body":"That's something I love about this TI and the place the Dota scene is getting to in general. This year, more than ever, it feels like TI is a celebration of the game as much as it is a competition. I think when less is at stake to win the big money, when you can get 8th place and  still get 200 thousand dollars (divided by 5 is 40k, which can be enough to survive on for a year depending on where you live) then it becomes less about fighting for survival and more about fighting to be the best, and being okay when you turn out not to be. Both Puppey and Dendi are knocked out of the tournament at this point, Dendi before he could make it anywhere. 		When you look at the numbers and see that Navi got 250k for SECOND place in TI2, it really just makes me feel good, knowing that it is because of us, the community, that these people we love can be happy about what is for all of us Dota Christmas.","depth":1,"score":29,"ups":29,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CarTastic","name":"t1_ctvughs","parent_id":"t1_ctvqan6","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439065708,"created_utc":1439036908}

Which comes to the final point of Rtz better at farming mid, S4 better at playing making mid but current meta calls for farming mids. S4 can just have his impact from the safelane where he's guaranteed a core item or 2 on heroes that really need it.		The only times secret ever switches S4 and RTZ (lately) is when they pick AM.
