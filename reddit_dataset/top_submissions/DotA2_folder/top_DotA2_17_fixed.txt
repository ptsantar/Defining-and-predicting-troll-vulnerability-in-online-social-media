The zero cast point buff also solves huge problems with being able to reliably purge the heal from Purifying Flames with Fortune's End, which opens the door for the hero to see use in a solo mid role even more so than he was already capable of.

{"body":"> Aside from the damage 'nerf', all of Oracle's Fortune's End changes are buffs.		the lvl 4 dmg went from 300 to 180 though.  		> So not only over the course of 12 seconds are you doing 180 + 180 dmg instead of 300 dmg (so it's actually more), but you are also purging twice as often, allowing you to purge more units more frequently.		yeah that assumes zero channel time though, and the mana cost doubled.  		honestly the biggest buff in here is the change to fortune's end's range. the single biggest thing that makes oracle unsuccessful is that they don't understand him. but for people that actually understand how he works, the biggest thing that fucks you up is that purifying flames has a farther range than fortune's end, which makes the nuke combo nearly impossible to land. now that fortune's end has a range that's 100 larger than purifying flames, that combo is significantly easier to tech.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zemo","name":"t1_cvdbv7x","parent_id":"t1_cvda8u5","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443176577,"created_utc":1443147777}

{"body":"Slightly yeah. Honestly if i were the Ice-man i would like half the healing values and half the cost, or something like that. Still does the same thing and it's an efficient item, but reduces the importance of it because its raw power is reduced. Maybe half is too much, 80%? Something like that, at least.		Anyway, i haven't tested it but what it sounds like is if you have (say) 4/1/4/1 and you get Agha, your spells are effectively 5/2/5/1. This is actually pretty big. For example, if you get super rich you could hit double Forge Spirits at level 7 (3/0/3/1). Admittedly, that's pretty unlikely to happen, but basically it's just a good strength increaser for him. I felt like Octarine sort of made Agha pointless on him because it did the same thing and more (and it enhances his spells since their cooldowns are soooooo long), but now this change pushes Agha back into consideration.

{"body":"Skadi probably stacks with Enchant, which now gives Enchantress better slowing capabilities while having Impetus on.		That is serious business for a chaser hero like Enchantress. Lifesteal can combo with the increased wisp amount for extra tankiness, and now Skadi preference makes her even tankier. Even before this patch Enchantress mid to late game with a few items is already hard to kill. 		Imagine a hero fighting an enchantress, getting Enchantress's hp low but decided it's too much hassle to keep on clicking her, so he retreats, only for enchantress to benefit from Impetus range bonus without restricting lifesteal OR with having slow from Skadi, killing the hero in less hits while still healing her OR while making it a shorter chase.		This applies to any kiters/disengaging heroes in a teamfight as well. Kiters die faster/slowed down with Skadi, kiters are free food for a tanker Enchantress, with Vlads/Morbid.

{"body":"The only issue here is just that this does nothing to fix what is broken about Enchantress. Is Enchantress going to get a Skadi? How and why? She farms like crap, and she needs mana-regen and Aghs is nice on her too, and so when she finally gets the Skadi... well... it's too late to really consider it a huge buff. By the time you get Skadi, the cons of having an Enchantress on your team are probably already outweighing that Skadi's utility (or you're stomping). 		The only thing I can see it helping is OoV - and she's a ranged hero so she doesn't get much from that. 		I think it's just a parity change like what's been happening to Ursa and Clinkz - Icefrog is just trying to gradually weed out hero-based UAMs.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrimsonPlato","name":"t1_cvdkb3h","parent_id":"t1_cvd7yfh","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443199631,"created_utc":1443170831}
{"body":"I was talking in the perspective of Enchantress being a core. Meaning she will get farm priority and she will get at least AoE gold from ganks. She won't buy wards and the other shenanigans support heroes do.		You can always go for Desolator or Morbid Mask (and its upgrades) as cheaper alternatives. Last I heard Clinkz Deso is a thing, no?		Now, as for farming. Use Enchant to get a large creep and sweep NC's with it along with Enchantress, Enchant another large creep if the current one dies, and constantly use their skills to make farming faster (Hellbear, Satyr, Centaur and Harpy are best candidates). You can tank stacked camps with maxed Untouchable and let your ranged neutral creeps attack from afar. You can get even more creeps to handle a stacked camp with HotD and guess what's the new HotD buff? 1.4k minimum HP fuck yeah! You don't need Aghs before Skadi, Aghs only increase attack range, Enchantress is better to be used as a slow debuffer who is also strong as fuck per attack.		At max Enchant an Enchantress can easily overtake the T1 tower due to being able to Enchant the two enemy creeps at a time in the lane and turn it against them. More money that way.		As for mana regen, Skadi provides some, and if you've played Enchantress, early to mid-game, you actually don't need many Impetus attacks to kill the enemy, especially when ganking as a team.		Skadi is better for Enchantress than Ursa because she's ranged. Ursa needs to be close for Aftershock and Skadi to apply, also Impetus is pure damage, meaning it goes through Ghost Scepter.		All that said, maybe you're right. Maybe it's just a parity exchange. We hardly notice the difference between a normal Clinkz and Desolator Clinkz, and Ursa doesn't go for orbs. And yes, mana regen on Enchantress is still a huge problem.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CMFanboy1223","name":"t1_cvdoiuc","parent_id":"t1_cvdkb3h","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443214527,"created_utc":1443185727}

{"body":"Why get b-mail when you've got that much armour reducing the damage you take.		It's like getting a vanguard and a hood on BB only to follow up with a blademail. You reduce the incoming damage so much that you reflect so little. (unless it reflects before reductions in which case I will happily eat my words).		More than anything I'm hoping he gets put in more of a core roll. I understand that a core based on chance can be risky and guarenteed damage is a safer option since it's reliable. But Ogre needs so much farm to use his full potential.		If you can farm a BS, Aghs and Octa on ogre GG. He's so strong with those three items.

Take a high ground push for example. Assuming you were already in a situation where Bat could lasso down one enemy safely, Aghs now lets you grab two of them instead. Better than Refresher since you can do both at the same time, and the high ground to low ground repositioning during base defense is probably one of the most ridiculous ones to overcome.

{"body":"The PRC on greater bash is gonna be great, and IMO it's a fairly solid nerf rather than being a buff like some people are theorizing. My reasoning is that even in their best case scenario (guaranteed bashes like charge/ult don't reset the counter, so you can prime a likely bash then go for a kill), you're still only going to be getting one bash in addition to your guaranteed bashes, then you're down to having to wait for the counter to go up until a bash is feasible again. This means your chances of stunlocking someone (beyond just charge/ult) are much lower than before. The true random was great for spirit breaker because when he got unlucky and had no bashes it usually just meant his target escaped, otherwise he could walk or charge away himself. This mean he could just try for kills over and over until he did one with 2-3 random bashes in a row for a guaranteed kill. Now he's stuck close to his average, meaning he can't use his more powerful bursts of luck to grab kills while having the outcome of bad luck be the same as average luck (enemy escapes).

Mine stacking is still possible just not on a single point.

You can put down twice as many, but for half the damage, letting you cover more of the map but for less huge nuke potential.		If people know where you mined now, it's super low risk to demine, so piling a couple of huge stacks is way more risky.		You can't stack mines on top of each other, so those instagib stacks are harder to create lategame, maybe impossible depending on the collision radius of the mines.

His weaknesses keep the same though, so the buffs are oriented to make LD a more mid game teamfight hero.

{"body":"THOUGHTS FROM A SHITPOSTER AND TB SPAMMER. Yeah this is good, more of an overbuff than an underbuff I'm gonna say, we're still fragile as fuck but now TB does work in early game fights beyond just rocking up with oodles of damage to do aaaaand he's dead. New reflection and patch after patch buffed Sunder should allow TB to cast his way through early game fights long enough to mop up. His untouched insane farming potential remains untouched and even buffed with the meta change meaning less focus on strict timings.		 All that brings us nicely into the lategame where TB was never bad, not even in the dark and already forgotten days of 6.84. Once you have that game changing Skadi your meta uptime and ability to cast (Reflection, enemies zoned and slowed, getting low? SUNDER free kill) your way through magic damage (Because fuck right clickers you have 50 billion armour) should see you not only obliterate a base as you used to, but actually survive the walk there.		The most objective example of how big this buff is that the Icy one removed him from Captain's mode with only 1 spell genuinely reworked. Bloodseeker changed a hell of a lot more for his time on the bench.		And as a last edit, **I love this rework**. It's been clear Icefrog always wanted TB to be the fighting illusion carry that PL was always better at. Having all illusions unmasked is an interesting uniqueish mechanic and the new potential plays from Reflection look a lot of fun. I definitely think numbers will have to be tweaked across the board, but the qualitative changes are perfect and justify leaving his STR Achilles' heel in. Now you just have to work around it with your new/upgraded kit and massive damage, and it's definitely viable to see you through to the glorious glorious Terrorblade lategame.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BigBobBobson","name":"t1_cvd7t32","parent_id":"t1_cvd6w22","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443169631,"created_utc":1443140831}

I feel like the allaround nerfs to him are devastating. It's not just *big* nerfs to Lightning Storm damage and jump range, or the reduced base damage.

{"body":"I really didn't. 		There's no net loss as cooldown and mana were also halved. If anything, there's a net gain in potential for mining multiple routes, as you can use a clarity to drop them at 63 mana instead of having to wait for the 125 mark. That's crucial in the level 1 game and mining jungle routes, shops (or if you have no soul and no imagination, rune spots) etc.		Just as important here is that if anyone tries to pop a panic salve or something, they're now twice as likely to run into another mine and have it cancelled far earlier. 		Remember, although mines now cannot be stacked wholly on top of one another, they can still be ridiculously close. This is not a nerf so much as a quality of life change for something that was never really intended. This means a cluster will still go off (for all intents and purposes) simultaneously, but now has *some* possibility for counterplay for an opponent to figure out how many is in a place if they have detection. 		That said, mine clusters are now **BETTER** against heroes such as TA (due to her shield counting damage sources, not damage itself) and are less likely to be wholly wasted by a single illusion from such fuckers as Naga, as each mine of 150 damage instead of 300 is now going to count as a damage source, meaning a cluster that would previously do the same damage (that can be dropped for the same mana and time cost) will consist of twice as many sources.

{"body":"It looks like a role-enforcement set of changes. Venomancer already gained so much value from the Aghs pick up that it hardly felt fair to play him as a broke support. With his non-Aghs ult doing less damage and the Aghs upgrade adding even more now, I get the sense that playing Veno as anything lower than position 3 will really gimp the heroes potential. I'm hoping that the changes to Lina/Lesh/Storm will open up the midlane a little for other heroes, including Venomancer or the other mids that he can dumpster on.		While I wouldn't expect these buffs to make him an automatic Tier 1 pick, I think he has a lot of potential for midlane or aggressive (not solo) offlane play. Forgoing early wards for extra levels in Gale and Sting already had potential, as most players underestimate just how much damage they are taking if they try to trade hits.

{"body":"No, IceFrog controls these numbers, so he obviously had a number he wanted mines to give, say 20 gold if this was never a change. Then when he thought this up he just rescaled the numbers. It's not more gold to give since this is the first time he added a gold value. Also it's a small number. At level 1 you usually stack 3 mines, so now 6. That's 60 gold a stack.

Glimmer still ridiculously strong for what it does. Hex is still way too expensive for how nerfed it is. Eblade still sucks.		I dunno, I feel the strong heroes barely got touched, and the weak ones get minor buffs in irrelevant areas that don't address their weaknesses at all.

{"body":"First impressions:		Return of first/pick ban Lycan in competitive? Direct hero buffs and minion buffs there.		Notable buffs to dedicated junglers too - Icefrog obviously wants Chen, Enigma and Enchantress to be picked more frequently again.		Nyx's Aghs upgrade has made him a fearsome high-ground defender and teamfight disruptor for a while now, but few teams have really made use of it. I can see these extra buffs pushing him over the edge and becoming a much more frequent pick.		Witch Doctor to become the go-to support pick again.		Bulldog will be very happy - his signature heroes got buffed and his frequent 'if my heroes all get banned out I'll pick up...' heroes mostly got buffed too. In fact Alliance as a whole will be very happy with these patch notes (though so too will EG 		Leshrac's been hit quite hard. A return to competitive Siberia, or just a mid tier pick from now on? Could honestly see either happening. Same goes for Techies, he's no longer viable in competitive I don't think.		I don't see the Lina or QoP nerfs hitting them too hard - they're just a bit less potent from mid game onwards but they still have their core strengths in-tact. Storm is probably hit harder; I'm not a storm player but that ult change to mana cost sounds significant.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NIN222","name":"t1_cvd839o","parent_id":"t3_3m9k4y","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443170116,"created_utc":1443141316}

{"body":"Ok, here are the main changes that caught my eye and reaction: (LOL, Icefrog said it would be a minor patch):		In general: Oh good, a patch. I wonder if purge's and Merlini's videos are up on it yet?		 Batrider:	Minor buff in his damage and agh's is interesting 		Elder Titan:	Constant buffs. Do we have the next 6.83 juggernaut on our hands?		Huskar:	Kinda unfair. One patch he sees play and he instantly gets nerfed. A minor nerf yes but still a nerf and no compensation buffs		Necro:	Rip leaf necro ancients		Nightstalker:	Well then, I expect him to be diving me more often and recovering for more dives. It's ok. I didn't want to leave my tower range anyway		Ogre Magi:	>Bloodlust can now be cast on towers	  	Wut?		Slardar:	>Sprint now provides phased movement	>Sprint cooldown reduced from 23 to 17	>Sprint duration reduced from 16 to 12		Been nothing but buffs (hero wise), since 6.70..Do we have the Juggernaut of the patch yet?		Spectre:	How much does this change? I do like her but how will this change her?		Terrorblade:	Is this enough to not call it terrorblade tier any more?		Ursa:	No play at all. Minor str nerfs (only 4.8 at level 25) and lower ult swipe multiplier for a lower cd on ult? I think it's a fair. 		Warlock:	>Golems can no longer be destroyed by Purge		~~Cool. But do they just take the damage nuke? Or are they unaffected?~~ Might be given the hero version with the slow.		Medalion and Solar crest on Roshan? Oh well		Just some random first reactions. 		EDIT:	Storm Spirit:	>Static Remnant mana cost increased from 70/80/90/100 to 100		So does that mean it's better to level up remnant over overload now? Or is overload still a bit better since it procs off all abilities including any mini ult jumps?

{"body":"In regards to your observations. 		Batrider is interesting yes, although aghs in not likely to be picked up that often in pro games. After blink, force, I still think they would prefer something like shivas over aghs. But only time will tell. 		ET: Has been getting constant buffs because the hero is shit tier. Honestly the buffs are good and okay, but it still leaves him without a lane to go to, (imo) Offlane would be the most appropriate. It honestly depends how prevalent agi cores are this patch depends on if they value natural order enough. 		Huskar: That hero is always going to be hard to buff. But i think its okay, since most of the nuking damage was reduced anyway. 		NS: I dont think this change is that relevant besides making offlane a bit more situational. 		Ogre: I think is pretty stupid, he can now have 11 armor i think level 1 with RoP thats more than/equal to a lot of heroes at level 25		Slardar: Again this hero isnt likely to be prevalent due to the increased damage that he takes from using sprint, especially as he needs to be played as a 1/2 to be relevant in the mid game. However this could see him played more as a mid. I dont know		Spectre: This wont change her that much, i guess it makes last hitting catapults easier.		As for Dispersion im not really sure how it will play out. It seems this way to make it better in every regard. 		TB: Its a buff in the right direction, but it makes me feel like icefrog wants him to be more involved in the fights, right cast range improvements to sunder, and aoe slow, but at the same time, he still has a very bad str gain, and will sit at less than 1000 HP for a large portion of the mid to late game with no inbuilt defense mechanism. i.e. blink or evasion		Ursa: I actually feel like this is just useless. Ursa wants to jump in and burst 1 target down as fast as possible. and then turn the fight into a 4v5 or w/e, the fury swipes multiplier reductions make this a little bit harder. But in return they make the CD shorter? That doesnt make a difference, its not like you can use it twice in 1 fight, unless you survive right til the very end. Part of what was good about the old ursa ulti, was you could spam it off CD to farm with little risk. The new ulti doesnt seem nearly as worth it to use on farming in the same way.		Medallion, i like this change a lot actually. It has annoyed me for a long time that a team with medallion can basically do roshan for free. I feel like if you want to take roshan in a timely fashion in the first 20/30 mins, you should draft heroes around that. Not just fall back on the 'oh Medallion makes it easy'.

{"body":"Okay, so before spirit breaker had 17% to hit EVERY attack. So the multiplier never changes, its always 17%, no matter if you hit them once or 20 times.		Pseudo random checks each time you make an attack. So it will start off at a low integer (based on what the % chance is) something like 1% for example. So after the first hit it goes, okay we didnt proc anything, next attack you have 2% chance to crit/bash/evade, you hit a 2nd time and you dont proc, so it goes okay, next attack you have 3% chance to proc. Until you do proc something then it resets back to the original value		Bare in mind, it doesnt start of at 1, then 2 then 3. I dont know the exact formula valve uses. but thats why when playing heroes like PA, if you want to gank someone, hit a creep 5-6 times if you dont crit, go for the attack.

{"body":">KOTL got nerfed hard, actually. He can no longer stop siege which means he isn't as hard anti-push and his farming slows quite a bit.		KOTL's main job is to anti-push -- especially when defending high ground / towers. A fully charged KOTL blast does 500 damage so it can take down a siege machine with just the wave, the range creep as well. Only the melee creeps requires 1 hit to clear. 		Now a fully charged 500 damage wave only does 100 damage to a Siege unit -- and if that siege unit is a helm dominated unit it's even more tanky. Not to mention if your rax are down and a wave build up occurs with 2-4 siege units a KOTL can no longer effectively hold down the lane by himself while his team pushes out other lanes.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KOTLswag","name":"t1_cvelkou","parent_id":"t1_cveasi5","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443278154,"created_utc":1443249354}

Stacking the mines exactly on top of each other was what I liked about Techies. Everything could be NEAT UND TIDY.

{"body":"This is (as /u/animalidad noted) a balance/tweak patch.  It's basically meant to curb some of the OP heroes a bit so that the meta can naturally shift.  This keeps things interesting, brings new (and probably some old) strats to the foreground, which makes for fresh games in the competitive and pub scene alike.		This patch hit heroes like Bloodseeker, Lina, Leshrac, Bounty Hunter, and Techies pretty hard, to the point that they won't necessarily be instant picks/bans, depending on how teams respond to the changes.		It also changed the way some of the mechanics work (ex: less abilities go through spell immunity, so the Black King Bar is more valuable) and changed the cost of certain items making them more or less likely to be picked up as their value has changed as does the timing in which you'd get those items.		It's pretty exciting when they do these patches, because most of us are tired of the same meta games and want things to change.  		A bigger patch is coming after the first Major tournament.  Bigger patches sometimes include new heroes, new game modes, new items, map adjustments, larger balance shifts, etc.  So while this is exciting, everyone will be way more excited for the next one (some hoping Pit Lord will finally join the pool of heroes).","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PingHigh","name":"t1_cvdjavk","parent_id":"t1_cvdiw5c","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443195253,"created_utc":1443166453}

{"body":"I expect something to shake the game up a notch, make it fee fresh and interesting, make it feel like you are trying something new. The reason i kept playing dota for 10 years is that it was always evolving, it never stayed in the same place for long while not doing radical changes every 3 months. While this patch is very balanced it doesn't mean it's perfect. Elder titan was utterly useless and he was buffed but were these buffs anything major to be excited about? Profoundly not. Batrider finally got buffed after centuries of nerfs but do you honestly think that's enough to get him back? Pretty much no. Everything that was good got nerfed, in the case of storm spirit a bit overnerfed and everything that was garbage pretty much stayed garbage. Not to mention that Icefrog seems to be miserably running out of ideas. The terrorblade AOE change to his Q, that's how the spell used to work! Leshrac's lightning storm damage was so nerfed it almost goes back to like 2 years ago before icefrog started buffing it every single patch in a row. Light strike array had its damage lowered? When was it increased? Oh yeah, 1 or 2 patches ago. And we get stuff like bloodlust working on towers which gets all the 2k plebs excited. The same plebs that were excited when Lich could armor up towers and now they forget about that feature to the spell until their tier 3 towers are attacked and they misclick on it and remember. Even the inventive changes have failed miserably. Nobody is ever EVER going to play aghanims morphling seriously, oracle is never ever going to become a thing, aghanim lone druid will never ever become a thing, the list goes fucking on! It's just my own opinion but for the first time in more than 10 years i have become tired of dota. For the first time in 10 years it seems to me like the game is standing still or even worse, running around in circles. I'm never going to switch to any game, no matter what happens to dota it will always be superior to its competition, I just kinda feel that if it keeps going this way i will, for the first time ever, get bored with it","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MartinDeth","name":"t1_cve4jsk","parent_id":"t1_cve2pl8","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443240484,"created_utc":1443211684}

So everything is garbage now? Well you have to pick **something**.

Honestly, the expression itself speaks of something about you. Don't be that guy.		> will never ever become a thing		You can never know and think this, untill someone comes up with a ridiculous strategy/gimick build around these new ideas that it *will* become a thing. That's how builds started in the first place, not by guessing by patchnotes.		And after all, it's a competitive game. You want a competitive game to stay as much on the same level as before as possible, to create a fait competition in different tournaments. You don't want teams winning a tournament, just because they are strong in one strat and are abusing one patch favoring them.

{"body":"I hope core Venomancer gets some love this patch. With his non-Aghs ult doing less damage and the Aghs upgrade adding even more now, I get the sense that playing Veno as anything lower than position 3 really gimps the heroes potential. I'm hoping that the changes to Lina/Lesh/Storm will open up the midlane a little for other heroes, including Venomancer or those mids that he can dumpster on. He's already picked against TA, who received no nerfs, has great potential with DOT against Windrun and already does fine against melee and other short-range mids.		While I wouldn't expect these buffs to make him an automatic Tier 1 pick, I think he has a lot of potential for midlane or aggressive (not solo) offlane play. Forgoing early wards for extra levels in Gale and Sting already had potential, as most players underestimate just how much damage they are taking if they try to trade hits. The passive buffs, as well as extra value now from Illusion runes, will hopefully give him a chance to shine now and again in competitive matches.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ElderThelAkai","name":"t1_cvd7zto","parent_id":"t3_3m9k4y","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443169955,"created_utc":1443141155}

Lich became more powerful an ally in lane to deny EXP				Carry Wise 		Legion commander got a hell of a buff for a not really under powered Hero.

{"body":"Are you high, just because you do not have the same problem as me and many others do, don't start misunderstanding us. Many dota 2 players have a problem since reborn which makes our fps jump between 100 (normal fps) to 20 in seconds. This has made many players unable to play including me and it still is not fixed. I always think game stability should be given priority over gameplay but i guess lesh cancer was too much even for volvo.	Whatever you have copy pasted has no relation to my question as neither memory allocation nor memory usage are the issues or for that matter anything mentioned in the patch notes seems to be the problem.

Not to mention, you are conflating the work of the balance team with the work of the engine team.		That's not the way it works and you're a complete fucking moron for conflating the two.		Balance changes are part of game design. They don't involve a lot of programming, they involve a deep understanding of game mechanics and access to all of the numbers that the code accesses to determine the interactions between various things.		On the other hand, troubleshooting code, especially low-level code from a game engine that must be optimised for speed and compatibility together, is a specialised skill that people invest a lot of time and effort into learning.		The likelihood is that nobody from the balance team has the skills necessary to get to work on fixing performance issues or engine bugs. 		It is also equally likely that nobody who can bugfix the issue has the kind of game design experience that would make them a useful asset to the balance team.		Valve didn't sacrifice one goal in order to get the other done in time. Neither of these jobs slows the other down. They can do BOTH. Unfortunately, both take TIME, and effort - neither of which entitles you to bitch that multiple updates per week trying to fix your exact problem, is somehow not enough.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GuitarBizarre","name":"t1_cvdtyxr","parent_id":"t1_cvdt8h0","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443224231,"created_utc":1443195431}

Sure it equals out to the same amount of time and mana, but now you have to spend more time at the wave. For example, before you can just run up to the wave, drop a mine and back off. Now, you need to hang around and commit to the wave. Not only that but any hero with a quelling blade has 0.8 seconds to demine your mine before it explodes, gain 10 gold and have you wasting mana and time and not getting CS.		>no proc on destroying mines... well i never saw someone die from that so i dont really care, its actually really good for balance since now you can at least play with melee		You may have never seen anyone die from it, because they knew they would die from it. ie, zeus using his W to reveal the mines and his range was too short to demine so had to have a 2nd guy demine it. Now he can just demine it. not only that but the quelling blade means that melee heroes can demine too. 		>10 gold from mines, whatever		Not as massive of a nerf, but refunds supports that buy sentries or a gem. problem is, now it requires double the mines to kill someone in a stack, so 30-50 gold turns into 60-100 gold per stack. 		>land mines not blocking camps and not having max count is actually a good buff. now you dont have to put remotes in the neutral camps for half an hour only to see them expire, and unlimited mines means they can still do serious damage late game.		This is a massive nerf, like huge!! being able to deny the enemy their jungle is a massive advantage to your team. a mine on the secret bush denies so much farm, not to mention all the spots where it's extremely hard to demine as they are in bushes etc. Unlimited mines isn't that good really, in theory a good player should have their mines being tripped often. I rarely reach the 20 limit until mid game which is when i sue my mana on remote mines instead of land mines more often. it will become ever greater reliance on remotes too as you can blow them up and deny the bounty.		>ot stacking mines, well, thats a big hit, if you are careful it's not a problem doing it old school though. i just hope its not too restricted.		it's really not that much of a change. a lot of posts have shown how 200 plus mines can still be stacked easily within the sign. this change is pretty irrelevant.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DippaDippa","name":"t1_cvdcjch","parent_id":"t1_cvdbwqg","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443177778,"created_utc":1443148978}

{"body":"No, they signify a pause in speech, I have the habit of writing exactly how I would talk if we were face to face.		&nbsp;		What I was trying to say is that since Storm Spirit was reworked the spells stayed pretty much the same. Let's analyze the patches since you got me started.		&nbsp;		**6.64** We can ignore since in 6.69 he got nerfed back to 23 base int.		&nbsp;		**6.67** Reduced attack range to 480 from 500. This was a nerf so we will ignore it since we're saying the hero was OP.		&nbsp;		**6.69** Again a nerf, they nerfed what they previously buffed in 6.64  so there's that. Also Electric Vortex got nerfed too, havign it cost more mana.		&nbsp;		**6.70** First buff, which increased the intelligence gain from 2.2 to 2.6, the base Int staying the same.		&nbsp;		**6.72d** Yet another buff increasing str from 17 to 19, okay, this is a buff but I don't see anyone bitching so hard about it.		&nbsp;		**6.73** Reduced the cooldown with 0.5 on Static Remnant. Okay, this is good.		&nbsp;		**6.75** Buffing Overload with 5/10/15 more damage on levels 2/3/4 seems like it was not that broken since they haven't done anything about it.		&nbsp;		**6.78** Again a bit of a buff for Electric Vortex which you only feel when the spell reaches levels 3 and 4.		&nbsp;		**6.80** Movement speed gets lowered by 5.		&nbsp;		**6.82** Now this is the only thing that changed since they reworked the ultimate. While traveling the Storm used 12 + 0.7% instead of 10 + 1%, this is indeed one of the best buffs this hero got.		&nbsp;		**6.83** Improved turn rate ... I don't see anyone ever bitching about Io why would they bitch here? And anyway, why does it really matter since if you're good with Storm you attack while using the ultimate to maximize the damage.		&nbsp;		**6.84** You didn't even show this one, which are all nerfs again.			Reduced movement speed from 290 to 285. -- Okay, not that big of a deal again...			Static Remnant damage no longer ignores ancient creeps, Roshan and creep-heroes. --Well this doesn't really affect that much, but it's a nerf nevertheless.			Reduced Ball Lightning vision range from 1000 to 400. --Do I need to say anything?		&nbsp;		And now comes the all mighty **6.85**:		&nbsp;		Static Remnant mana cost increased from 70/80/90/100 to 100. -- Ok, so they basically shit on the early game, which let's say is understandable because that's where storm had the ability to really snowball. It doesn't affect you late game which is ok.		&nbsp;		Static Remnant unobstructed vision reduced from 800 to 600 -- Let's say this is again not such a big deal but idk why I remember they already reduced the vision once on this because I was not able to see in the Roshan pit when trying to steal aegis in the same spot I was able to before, but I can't find anything about it for some reason... maybe it was just me.		&nbsp;		Ball Lightning base mana cost increased from 15 + 7% to 30 + 8% -- Now this is why I'm so pissed about the patch. So this was not a problem since they reworked the damn hero but it is now? Why? Because people started playing the hero more? This really affects the hero in all stages of the game after lv 6. Why has it not been nerfed until now if it was so broken? Why? Couldn't they just nerf back the traveling cost that they buffed in patch 6.82? 		&nbsp;		This annoys the hell out of me because heroes get nerfed because people bitch about it. I feared the day people will start playing Storm Spirit because I knew they will nerf him to dust, and it fucking happened. People don't know how to play against him so ... let's bitch about it and it will get nerfed ... because Valve has to keep their players (noobs) happy, who can't invest time in trying to learn how to counter a hero.		&nbsp;		Take Techise for example ... they really shit on this one. I've already said it in another reply but I'll say it again. When they added Techise, EXACTLY how it was in Dota 1, where, for some reason it was not nerfed to shit until then :O (I wonder why... hm /sarcasm). Everyone was raging and shit because they could not play against hero and that it has to be nerfed, instead of fucking learn how to counter him. God damn buy some wards and learn the how the bombs should be placed and move accordingly. If you pick a 5 melee team, you deserve to get rekt by this fucking terrorist. Now ... after all the raging, Valve had to kiss some noobish ass and go nerf that hero to dust. Because if not, people will go away and where will they get money from then? This is the only reason I liked dota 1 times (pls spare me the "then go play dota 1" comments, I hope you know why we had to move on) when not everyone knew about it. You either embraced the fact that the game was hard and required you to improve rather than bitching about heroes getting nerfed, or you didn't play at all.		&nbsp;		What's Techise now? A pile of garbage, when playing agains and even when playing with it. When playing, you don't have to strategically place your bombs anymore, I can just put 1000 mines in one place and kill even God if he passes by. And that 50% damage reduction just shits on the hero, if you don't have enough time to place enough bombs, you won't kill shit.		&nbsp;		Idk why I'm bitching ... most of the players are casuals anyway... they have to dumb the game down to keep players happy. I'm done.		&nbsp;		Oh btw, we're looking at 8 buffs and 10 nerfs since Storm Spirit was reworked. (I counted buffs/nerfs for specific spells or in stats, not patches).","depth":2,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lucicam","name":"t1_cvdpz8q","parent_id":"t1_cvdn9hq","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443217559,"created_utc":1443188759}
{"body":"Storm being 'OP' is just the result of a gradual over-buffing due to lack of play until he got to his 6.83 state and was under-nerfed in 6.84.  From 6.70 to 6.83 he received straight buffs including, as you mentioned, the 6.82 change which is where I think he got put over the top.  People started playing the hero more because he was strong; that's typically how popularity works on all but a few heroes.  Between his nerfs and the Bloodstone changes he might have been over-nerfed I'll agree to that but Storm needed to be toned down a little on his own and Bloodstone also needed to be toned down.  Such is Dota.  I mean, there isn't much to discuss since you made it very clear in your first post that Techies and Storm are you favourite and as such you'll be inherently biased towards any negative changes they receive.  I felt the same way when Morphling got nerfed in 6.84 even though they really did need to be nerfed (on that note this patch Morph seems overbuffed), and I feel the inverse this patch as both ET and Morph, my two favourites, have been buffed.  It sucks when your heroes get changed for the worse but this game isn't made for or subsequently balanced around any specific heroes.  When people start complaining about one hero in mass amounts taking the "EVERYONE IS WRONG EXCEPT ME" stance usually means you're in the wrong.  		Also, I know what ellipses are used for, I was pointing out that you were using them incorrectly for a written format :V.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eDating","name":"t1_cvdyn27","parent_id":"t1_cvdpz8q","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443231419,"created_utc":1443202619}
