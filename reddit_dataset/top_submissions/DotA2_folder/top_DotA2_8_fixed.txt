{"body":"I don't think it's as easy or clear cut as you make it seem to compare the two and determine whether one is better than the other after the patch. Arcane costs 100g less now, making it even cheaper, and restores 35% more mana to the user, has a 50% bigger radius on the aoe, and now builds into an incredible pushing item if the carrier is someone that can build mek too. With some of the newer cheaper midgame items and focus on earlier fighting, being 750g ahead towards your next early/mid game core item has potentially greater value, too. Overall, the buffs are really much bigger than items typically get when they need fine tuning. It's definitely far more in line with tranq+soul ring on a personal mana level, and considering how much early fighting the patch seems to encourage, the retention of the health from using soul ring during fights and the team mana (with its bigger radius on top of that) will all be more valuable than in the current patch.

{"body":"Well, it's too early for me to make a proper assessment, because I'm just theorycrafting. But it feels these new items actually don't benefit Tinker much. 		Travel 2 for example, is overrated in my opinion. 2k Gold is nothing to scoff at even for a Tinker - it's a third of a game changing item like Scythe or Dagon 5. Tinker's issue really isn't map mobility - I can't imagine him getting this until after he's 6 slotted. In fact, it's almost certainly going to be a super late game item for any hero to get. The luxury of TPing to a hero is almost never worth 2k gold IMO.

{"body":"I don't think lesh will be a good veil carrier, it's better on supports so that lesh doesn't have to fuck with the already fragile build order options he has. You could start with null talisman + regen, and build arcane boots from there. Maybe soul ring, too. This gets you on your way with the buildup for bloodstone and veil. Your survivability is garbage at this point, so you need either bloodstone or BKB depending on who you're up against. Maybe you need both. Let's say you go bloodstone, your farming is now greatly accelerated. At this point you can go towards veil and get it pretty quickly, but with Octarine Core costing almost 6000g, you're now a pretty long way away from utilizing it with veil, and the Core is going to be much stronger on Leshrac in earlier stages of the game where his damage peaks compared to other carries and the lifesteal gives him the most survivability relative to incoming damage on him, so delaying it by 2500g isn't appealing there, either. Another option at this point is Eul's (unaffected for Lesh by the change with his regen at this point), which gives him survivability and positioning from the move speed, increased farming from the additional mana regen and move speed, and the ability to interrupt fights on demand and set up into guaranteed stuns with split earth. Picking up a veil as a 3rd or 4th item could be nice, but would you really rather have it over a boots of travel (just 2000g if you just stay at brown boots after disassembling arcanes for bloodstone) once you've gotten yourself a few of your core items? Lotus orb is just 1500g more, still gives him the armor that veil does, gives more mana regen, and provides you an even huger teamfight presence with the active, especially when it allows you to leach off of any spells cast at you, meaning that you get survivability from it by disincentivizing opponents from casting on you, and even when they do cast at you they're still allowing you to heal for a portion of the damage of their spell.

"We both excel at demolishing enemy structures, what I propose is an alliance. You teleport in to the trees near an enemy tower, I teleport to you, and then you turn the forest in to your treants and we demolish it, then leave before the enemy arrives. Your treants can take the hits from the tower and my robots will kill the enemy creeps, keeping the lane pushed, allowing more time for the treants and allied creeps to do damage." Boush said, exhaling deeply. Nature's Prophet looked at him with his usual stoic expression. "On one condition." The Prophet replied. "Leave our jungle to me. I know which neutral creeps must be... evicted. You may do as you wish with the enemy jungle, however." Boush smirked and extended a hand. "Agreed." He said. "Then we have a deal." The Prophet said.

{"body":"all the heroes who got a new Aghanim's Scepter ability			1.Wraith King		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Wraith King: Allies who are near Wraith King (within 1200 aoe) when slain become Wraiths for 5 seconds, delaying their death. They can continue attacking, casting, etc. When the duration ends, the hero dies, and credit for the kill goes to whowever landed the original killing blow.			2.Tusk		Added Aghanim's Scepter to Tusk: 	Adds a new ability called Walrus Kick. Kicks the target back 900 units. The kick slows by 40% for 4 seconds. 12 second cooldown			3.Centaur Warrunner		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Centaur: 	Stampede reduces all incoming damage by 70% and allows allies to run through obstructions (trees, cliffs, etc). Destroys trees			4.Legion Commander		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Legion Commander: 	Duel lasts until either Legion Commander or her target dies. Ends if duelists are ever more than 2,000 range apart.			5.Lone Druid		Added Agahnim's Scepter upgrade to Lone Druid: 	Allows Spirit Bear to attack at any range from Lone Druid, and prevents Spirit Bear from dying if Lone Druid dies			6.Lifestealer		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Lifestealer: 	Grants a new skill, Assimilate. Assimilate allows Lifestealer to target an allied hero and swallow them, allowing them to hide inside of Lifestealer. Any healing Lifestealer receives is shared with the assimilated hero. The assimilated hero can release itself at any time by clicking on the buff icon to erupt outward and deal 300 damage to enemies in a 700 area of effect. If Lifestealer dies or assimilates another hero, the currently assimilated hero will automatically exit. Issuing any order with your hero, a few seconds after being assimilated, will take you out.			7.Morphling		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Morphling: Grants a new ability, Hybrid. Allows morphling to target an ally, turning himself into a hybrid illusion, removing the Morphling himself. This hybrid illusion can cast non-ultimate abilities and has your original attributes. Lasts 20 seconds. When the duration ends or the hybrid dies, your hero emerges (cannot end prematurely). Cooldown: 140, Manacost: 200, 600 cast range. Note: Ability is not available while you have a Replicate living.			8.Naga Siren		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade: Song of the Siren Scepter now regenerates you and nearby allies by 6% of maximum HP per second for up to 7 seconds.			9.Nyx Assassin		Added Aghamin's Scepter upgrade to Nyx: 	Adds a new ability, Burrow, with a one second cast time. While Burrowed, Nyx Assassin is invisible and unable to move/attack, but has 40% damage resistance, and regenerates 1.5% of his health and mana per second. Nyx Assassin's abilities also have improved properties while burrowed: Mana Burn and Impale have 50% increased cast range, Impale Cooldown is reduced from 13 to 9, and Spiked Carapace instantly stuns any enemy units within a 300 area of effect without requiring them to hurt him first. Casting Vendetta causes Burrow to end		10.Weaver		Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Weaver: reduces the cooldown of Timelapse to 20 seconds and allows Timelapse to target allied heroes. 1000 cast range			11.Alchemist		Alchemist can now cast Aghanim's Scepter to directly grant any allied hero all Aghanim's Scepter bonuses as a buff (the hero upgrade and the stat upgrade).

{"body":"Gold stuff- I think I like it. A lot of overall good changes, but maybe a little mathy. Not sure how I feel about being able to get any gold after buyback, even if reduced? All of this seems to be pushing the game more aggressive, which is good. Less money pulled out of the map passively. More pulled out of murdering each other and objectives.		Mud golems- so this means that doom/chen/ench can get a mini stun? And this should help batrider jungling times(along with other spell based farmers like DS).		XP for summon kills has been a long time coming.		Ranged melee attack fix. It's uh...awkward, but whatever that works. Can you counter it with MKB?		All pick time down is good.		Damage block not working on spells is probably a significant buff to some heroes. I'd need to look closer.		Hex no longer disabling passives is huge. Scythe has always been the go to late game contribution item mostly because of that alone.		Silence not working on any invis is probably a buff to several heroes.		Shop shuffling- it's all mostly good. I think really good.		Bashers being able to buy bash but not bash is good. Abyssal is too good to not be able to get, even if it's only for the damage and the active.		Heroes:		Abba- that's a big deal. Expect to see him picked more.		Alch- uh wow. That's....wow. I've been against the consumable aghs forever as I thought it was stupid to just give him infinite carry potential and would promote HYPER long games. This still does that, but the "give this to any ally to buff them" aspect is going to be disgusting if used right. Might take awhile for it to really be fleshed out but holy hell.		AA- look something people will never do. Like cast shadow amulet on allies.		Axe-k		Bane- the mana buff should get him some use (i still think he's one of the best unused heroes in .83). The nightmare thing is...odd, but could lead to better combo's/setups.		Batrider- heh.		BM- i expect to see him return to mid one of these days.		Seeker- umm..k. No real thoughts. Still think no one's used him right.		BH- i love everything. His nuke is no longer some math noob trap, and his ult showing enemy gold is actually really valuable info and fits perfectly in the "no one can do this, except them" dota philosophy. Bigger bounces will help a lot as well. You usually start a fight alpha striking someone, and then if you live you might be able to get a second off, but everyone has split by that time.		Brew- k		BB- good. Better scaling on goo matters.		Brood- wow. I've been waiting for the UAM buff, but the ult buff too really brings back dreams of battle brood.		Centaur- Yeah that's totally getting built. He's the sort of hero who just needs boots and blink and that's WAY too powerful to ignore.		CK- oh thank god no more level 1 low damage nuke but max stun. Made his lvl 1/2 ganking awful.		Clinkz- eh. He will get quite a bit of a GPM boost when he hits 16 at least.		Clock- a good buff, but an annoying one. I'll have to re figure out his camp block timings.		CM- yesssss. Battle CM is such a thing, and so many people sleep on her even now.		DS- eh? The duration on ion is the main one. You rarely get people to go through a wall more than once, although it will be better on high ground defense if you're behind (but that's rare). Longer ion though means better jungle and lane farming/pushing.		Dazzle- i'm sure it's done stuff, but i've never thought "Wow look at poison touch go" This changes nothing.		DP- good. She was nuts, but hopefully that's fixed. Now her lvl 1 ult doesn't have to blow.		Disruptor- small duration buffs are good, but they better have fixed the fucking bug.		DK- Wow. He's going to get pick. Breath is now a ranged anchor smash, and lethal corrosive is actually something he's needed for awhile, as he can often get solo ganks where they just barely get away.		ES- sad but expected.		ET- stomp buffs will matter. Lower cooldown is going to help him a lot in the late game.		Enchant- Nice. Refresh enchant means she can wildwing stack safely, amongst other things. Pure imp damage finally piercing puts her back in a great "support who hurts late" role.		Enigma- fine.		Gyro- k		Husk- Still mostly useless. He might actually be sorta secret good, but still not good enough. I do think he deserves to be picked more since he can hard counter and win games solo, but once that happens I expect people to be smarter and draft around him (also current meta hated him).","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Eji1700","name":"t1_cqr4dsa","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430223806,"created_utc":1430195006}
{"body":"Invoker- All awesome. He deserves to be played more and is a great example of a caster carry.		Io- bout fucking time.		Jakiro- I swear macro is one day going to be one of those skills where everyone wonders why the fuck we weren't abusing this shit earlier.		Jugg- omni no longer ministunning is actually a big deal. Using it to get a kill solo when you catch someone was a big play for him at 6.		Kotl- Lets play the "what spells did the chakra buff break" game. I can think of a few right now. This is going to be ugly.		Kunkka- YAAAAY		LC- Hell yes. I love the "to the death" duel. It was skill FOREVER ago on abbadon (although he just rambo'd you, you could run the fuck away) and it's nice to see it back.		Lesh- on my "ignored but shouldn't be" list forever.		Lich- Chain speed does matter. Might help him as wombo combos should now get a lot more damage done quickly.		Naix- what. the. fuck. The buffs are amazing. the new aghs is....strange as hell?		Lina- Sadness. I loved that part.		LD- true form staying means he's finally not shit with aegis. Aghs is 100% legit. I think people slept on this hero like hell last patch and don't realize how insane mana bear actually is. This is going to push him over when someone stops bitching and actually tries to play him differently rather than running 4 year old builds.		Luna- Uh wow. That's one hell of an aghs. She could easily be a jungle or solid 2/3 with that thing.		Dusa- same as LD. Much better with aegis.		Meepo- ouch. The respawn nerf hurts.		Potm- K		Morph- Pop quiz, how long did it take you to realize aghs is quite possibly bat shit insane with a terroblade on your team?		Naga- Support naga never actually left, but now it's absolutely back. Aghs rush naga in a support role will win games.		Prophet- I fucking hate this hero so much. I respect that it's a personal thing, but my god I almost feel ill reading that aghs. I can already SEE the hell i'm signing up for next game.		NS- k. He's still a 1v1 monster if they dont have BKB. We know.		Nyx- ....wow. Both of those are real buffs. He can totally afford an aghs rush, and with that he should.		Omni- mmmk.		Oracle- Holy fucking hell. I've been playing him recently and people seriously don't seem to get how much of a "win right now" this guy is. These buffs solve basically every problem. Ult not being on 20 is a huge (and justified nerf), but perma purge instead of invis is a MASSIVE buff. Get an euls and this guy literally makes your carry unkillable and unstopable for 8 seconds. Can you imagine dropping this on a fed Storm? What the fuck.		OD- uh.. Might be a nerf? I dunno. Hard to say. It's a crazy aoe disable, but it saves them as well. You'll do stupid damage, but still lose to BKB. The mana drain at least stopped certain heroes from even functioning. Edit edit- my brother just pointed out that aghs + refresher OD is now fucking disgusting. Like 2600 more damage on top of it, and they can't dodge the followup if you land the first, and the damn thing is easy to land.		Phoenix- Vision from spirits is pretty good.		Puck- k. I mean it's big because rift is awesome, but k.		Pudge- in racecar land this is nice		Pugna- uh...wat? Did he really need an overall nerf to his lower levels with no substantial buff?		Riki- Cool. More turn rate stuff is good, as long as it's carefully used.		Rubick- that's actually a perfect buff. So much inelegant shit shows up on other forums/reddit for a hero who really didn't NEED a buff. This makes field just better enough to be hellishly annoying and still a good spell.		SK- Cool. Finale vs a melee mid was fun and very legit, but this makes the skill much better. Might have some new builds with it?		SD- Poison still sucks vs anyone good. Break on aghs is maybe enough to see him in mid again, or greedy support.		SS- Huh. Ok. he's like Lion in that he's always good, so whatever.		Silencer- uh...ok. Feel like this is an un needed nerf.		Slardar- He's like the charlie brown of patch notes "I got an aghs! I got an Aghs! I got a new ult! I got 25 damage...."		Sniper- Huh. Not as kicked in the balls as i thought, but then again I think most of the new patch stuff hurts him anyways.		Spectre- Been waiting for this ever since the "jump as much as you want" buff. Expect to see her.		SB- meh		SS- The vision nerf is fair, and the ms nerf is fine. I think this is perfect because I don't expect him to be nearly as good if sniper falls out. He is still going to be picked.		Sven- I am also charlie brown (although that does matter).		Techies- .....just....like. Ok i'm impressed that's creative. But fuck this hero. I don't think anyone's made anything more designed to piss me off ever. Menekler looks like a fucking saint in comparison.		TA- "I got a rock" Low cd's do matter, especially that low, but meh.		Terroblade- Huh. Still won't be leveled, but it's a start.		Tide- k		Timber- might get him played again.		Tinker- The laser buff is the main thing. Maybe turtle tinker will finally get some real play (because you know, THAT'S the best way to take the hero...).		Tiny- Thank you.		Tree- meh.		Troll- Axes should have never given vision given how much that sort of thing is valued. Surprised that's all that got hit really. He's still a "team is now a global push force" thing.		Tusk- o....ok. I have no idea how to feel on this except that a cheaper shards is going to help him see play because the poor bastard is always mana starved in rough games.		Undying- Is that 1 melee attack, or 1 instance of damage? In short do i cry when they pick BB still? If not, he might finally be worth using.		Ursa- That's really really good. He's finally no longer hard countered by heroes like viper, and he's going to blow people up, and clear rosh like a god (more of a god?).		Veno- Thank you. 0 damage gale hurt a lot.		Viper- eh.		Visage- Wow. I think that's mostly good in the ultra late game, although dual ranged supports can now kill the birds much faster.		Warlock- smart to be careful with one of the best aghs holders in the game.		Weaver- HAHHAHAHAAHHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHHAHHA		WR- k (actually a big quality of life thing).		WW- Ultimately a nerf, but I guess it's fair.		WK- That's really cool. And again totally legit for 3/4 position WK. And again fucking terrifying when their carry is in the middle of you.

Octarine core- Holy shit it's old aghs buildup. And it gives spell vamp. This should be interesting. OD is going to wreck face. Edit- im a dumbass.

Wand- better buildup is actually wonderful and really opens up more viable starts.		MoM- surprised it even keeps the speed boost, but yeah that's fair.		Necro- those are disgusting buffs, and should help with the idea that you can get this on supports. The problem before was that necro 1 sucked, so you needed to be able to get 2/3 fast. now you can get 1 and actually have it do shit.		Obs- uhh..is it cheaper too now that it comes in 1's?

Good catch on the SS thing.

{"body":"**Pugna's** changes are fucking weird and I'm not sure I like them. 	I've tested him a bit in Test Client, and (see flair) he's one of my fav heroes. 		So here's the thing - **1 level in Decrep was the most important part of Pugna's kit**. If you have a lot of magic damage on the team then 2 levels could work nice for early game, but for the most part you wanted 1 level for most of the game. Icefrog has severely nerfed level 1 of Decrep though, and so no matter how you wish you could play it, it looks like you *have* to invest into it now, possibly over Nether Ward.		What this change has done is it's **greatly diminished his early game damage, and not given him much in return.** If the only spell you can hit someone with before level 6 is Nether Blast, a looooong Decrep isn't that useful. Especially because in the early game, you need to use auto-attacks. And if your lane partner only has one nuke too, again, you need auto-attacks. 		So basically his **amazing early game is nerfed by a large margin**, in terms of ganking and killing. On the other hand, his Decrep is now really good to make last hitting really frustrating for the opponent (though, the increase in cooldown at level 1 makes this not much of an improvement really). 		**His Ultimate is a must-take at level 6 now** as it's the only way to make the new Decrep work. One the plus side, you'll get more damage out of your ult per tick (180 -> 195). On the negative side, the enemy will escape your ult easier due to the decreased range and slow. 		So where does Pugna reach his old standards? 		Let's judge Pugna at level 8, old Pugna could be 4/1/2/1. Depending on how the game is going you may have 1 more point in Decrep and one less in Ward. Sometimes it was even possible to skip ult (due to bad game circumstances) and go for 4/2/2/0.		To get the same sort of damage out, new Pugna needs to be 4/3/0/1. It means he has to sacrifice Ward early on to get the same sort of damage out of Nether Blast, but with this new build his Ult will be piling out 210 dps. *(Why would you skip Nether Ward? Ward relies on Decrepify to do big damage, Ward may be annoying at level 1-2, but it's not doing much with only 30% damage amp)*		Even so, you need probably **at least 1 point in Nether Ward for level 6 fights**. At level 8 the build will likely be 4/2/1/1 or 3/2/2/1.		I really think, from a really early perspective, they should re-jig Decrepify's slow and Dmg to be 35/45/55/65%. Imo Pugna needed a little buff - not a really strange re-jig. 		Instead of having 2 abilities that need to be maxed, and an ult that didn't necessarily need investment depending on the game state, now Pugna has 3 abilities that must be maxed, and an unskippable ult. He's far more Exp-hungry than before, but loses a lot of early game utility at the benefit of +10% damage later in the game. I personally do not think that the 10% damage late game, and increased Ult damage is worth it at the expense of early game damage - because **everyone in late game has fucking BKBs.**		---		Itemwise though, big buffs to Arcane Boots which is Pugna's best boots (also good because you rely more on ult now). Lotus Orb could be great after Aghs. Guardian Greaves are also definitely worth a look, but I wouldn't expect Pugna to get Mek > Aghs. Especially now that Ult is so important.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cqr5w06","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430227298,"created_utc":1430198498}

{"body":"My predictions, hero by hero for this patch:		Abbadon: Damn near impossible to gank, but not seen very commonly still outside of possibly becoming the world's best Brood counter.		Alchemist: Becomes full time jungle support. Used to load Aghs onto the team's hard carry to make them dominate even in mid-game, or to supply other supports who have gold problems in order to make them capable of doing a lot more.		Ancient Apparition: Few major changes, though Oct will become core until it's nerfed.		Anti-Mage: Between the adjustments to Battlefury (which implements and upgrades Quelling Blade), the upgrade to Quelling Blade base, and the new consumable Moon Shard that, becomes one of the central carries of this patch. He previously had issues with inventory slots, and this patch solves those well.		Axe: Will continue to be annoying early game, but will be slightly less annoying mid and late game. No notable changes based off of the new items, except some Axes might now start to opt towards Shadow Blade in order to build themselves a Silver Edge eventually. Reduced Blade Mail cooldown could help him some.		Bane: Slightly less mana hungry thanks to the implementation of upgraded Arcanes and his manacost nerf. Able to use Nightmare much more effectively and pull off some cool plays. Will continue to drive everyone insane.		Batrider: Someone said he got buffed for some reason, but I view this as another nerf to him. Can't see him doing well this patch. 		Beastmaster: Could quite possibly see some more play, but I'm not sure it'll be a ton. His long reliable stun could be very useful now that some silences have been changed.		Bloodseeker: Slight buff, will be roughly as useful now as always. Little impact from items, outside of maybe being able to consider a Satanic now.		Bounty Hunter: Will become the new Riki of pubs, large buffs all around as far as both the items that are his current core *and* his abilities. Solar Crest could quite possibly become a new core.		Brewmaster: Changes in gold bounty for Primal Split aren't major, changes to Phase Boots, Heart and Vlad's will provide a slight boost.		Bristleback: Changes to him aren't major, though his escape will be *slightly* worse with reduced movement speed. Likely to enjoy his improved Crimson Guard & Blade Mail.		Broodmother: Will become *the* cancer hero this patch, without a doubt. The change in UAM is massive, and Insatiable Hunger got a boost as well. Will likely be building Mask of Madness or Satanic, and will undoubtedly use Moon Shard as a new core item.		Centaur Warrunner: Will drive everybody insane in pubs, will likely see some limited pro use before he's nerfed. Slight boosts from buffs to his items.		Chaos Knight: With less RNG on his Chaos Bolt, will see increased laning stage and most likely an even more snowbally lategame. Everyone will complain but he won't get nerfed. Will definitely be using Moon Shard, raising the chances that he's going to nail you with a crit and making the constant attacks from all his illusions absolutely demolish you. Slight boost from buffs to his current items.		Chen: Will be absolutely loving Guardian Greaves, likely won't be changed by anything else this patch. Will be eating mangos.		____		I'll do more tomorrow if my analysis doesn't turn out to be shit. Also, and I'll touch on this more tomorrow, this is going to be the patch of the rat. Nature's Prophet, Brood, Lone Druid, Lycan, etc. are all going to be loving this patch and it is going to be a massive boost to the pushing capabilities.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goodnames679","name":"t1_cqr6g96","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430228775,"created_utc":1430199975}

The fact that it removes debuffs and makes him essentially unkillable for the duration plays into the turnaround-factor Ursa has always had in pubs, and seems to be what they're pushing him towards in competitive, and it's a really cool role.		Pub Ursa has always been about baiting idiots into trying to kill you (usually by purposefully letting yourself get harassed) and then turning on them and wrecking their shit with an Overpower.

{"body":"So, let's have some impulse reactions to some of the changes:		-An overall shift away from farming creeps towards farming heroes and structures. Interesting, although I worry about the implementation--I don't want to see the deathball meta resurrected. But it's not really THAT drastic, all told.		-The Octarine Core is going to be LAUGHABLY core on a lot of different heroes. Leshrac and Zeus will be chief abusers. Nobody plays Lesh anyway, but expect to see this item on the people that do. May even replace Bloodstone in farm priority. Core Leshrac is going to see a surge in popularity.		-Mud Golem changes should make jungling a more consistent and less RNG-dependent experience.		-Ward changes were a long time coming, from stacking with sentries to being unmissable. Lost many a life to improbable miss streaks. Especially precarious if the enemy has a Storm or Spirit Breaker on their team.		-I approve of the Alchemist changes overall, but am of the mind that he should only be able to bestow his second Aghanim's onward to his teammates to ensure he doesn't Agh's rush to whip the team snowballer or carry into an unstoppable frenzy. You do NOT want to see a mid Zeus with a 15-20 minute (or less) Refresher Agh's. Otherwise, I've always liked the idea.		-Sniper nerfs were expected, but even I'm slightly taken aback by the agility loss.		-Didn't foresee an extensive volley of Juggernaut nerfs after the recent ones. Omnislash lacking a mini-stun is going to hurt him badly, although on the other hand, Eul's costs a fuckload more mana. Probably best, though. Heroes with cast times could NOT react at all when he was ulting.		-Troll nerfs are justified. Still a very versatile hero with a blind, a slow, Rosh potential, good farming capabilities, single-target lockdown, etc. His melee form made him a better melee hero than heroes who are *natively melee*, which was never acceptable. Loss of damage is in line with that--his melee damage should be lower than many melee characters because hey, he has the option not to be.		-Eul's Scepter nerf is BRUTAL. I suppose this discourages non-Intelligence heroes from picking it up for its bounteous utility, but god DAMN.		-I like the Guardian Greaves, but I kind of worry about its parity with other boots--sure, it is much, much more expensive, but supports especially are easily railroaded towards a better boot option than Phase Boots, Power Treads and Tranquil's users inherently have access to. This might be fine, though, since supports broadly get fewer goodies / scale worse and this would be a luxury pick-up, and Arcane Boots were getting sort of shitty.		-Stop buffing Windranger, please.		-Exactly the change I had in mind for Lina--being Laguna'd for a thousand pure damage from miles away was too much. Between this and Eul's, she's probably where she should stay.		-Mask of Madness move speed reduction is expected, but 17% is a BIG dip. Finally a risky item again. Is it too much, though?		-I'm glad Impetus pierces spell immunity now, but Enchantress still isn't going to see a renaissance.		-Some welcome flavor to Dragon Knight's nuke. It's base damage only, so it's not especially outrageous, and right-clicking was pretty much never the way to deal with DK anyway.		-Chaos Knight's low-level kill potential with a partner is a LOT higher now, especially at level 3. It doesn't SOUND like much, but he's essentially a snowball carry who needs to farm heroes and he never had a way to actually get said snowball rolling before without extremely advantageous lane compositions.		-Jesus Christ @ Incapacitating Bite no longer being a UAM. I guess she has her counters, but woe be unto the team that doesn't draft one, or the team she's last-picked against. What are people thinking on her? Skadi or an early Deso for spiderlings?		-I feel like the Sanity's Eclipse upgrade is sort of backwards--it steals the intelligence AFTER it damages them. It's nice and kind of a strong counter-initiation and disengaging tool, and it'd probably be too powerful the other way around, but it struck me as amusing.		-Techies soundly secure their position as the most obnoxious little shits in Dota 2 after a brief quarrel with Sniper over the title. Probably not as bad as it sounds at first blush, because if the game has gone late and you see that sign, you know why it's there.		-Shadow Shaman hit the gym for a week and then promptly decided it wasn't for him. Still walked away less feeble than before.		-Demonic Purge is further cemented as probably the most underrated Aghanim's upgrade in Dota 2. Can really fuck over a bevy of heroes with the new Break addition.		-*Surely* I'm misreading Naga's Agh's upgrade. If not, your team must - MUST - all buy BKBs to deal with her, almost without exception. She's going to be banned more than ever because of this. Position 3-4 Naga with Agh's + Guardian Greaves is very appealing. (Core Leshrac and support Naga? This patch is going to be insane.)		-Chakra Magic could be some frustrating bullshit in combination with Adaptive Strike or any other relatively low-cooldown long-duration disable. Really, it has a lot of interesting applications, but it's hardly so great as to be overpowered--it's just 4 seconds max, after all.		-Nyx's teamfight potential with Burrow gives him sort of an interesting niche among the invis gankers, who often struggle in late-game clashes. I just sort of wonder where the average Nyx is going to squeeze it in between their Dagons and miscellaneous utility items, especially since he's hardly an outstanding farmer.		-Nature's Prophet amping rat Dota up to eleven, but it'll require a fair bit of micromanagement to use properly. Still good even if you don't agonize over the minutiae of it.		-Centaur Warrunner's Agh's strikes me as wildly excessive for a hero who is otherwise very balanced, tilting on the strong side. He also broadly doesn't have much else to spend money on. I'm just not sure it was necessary, as his late-game was more than fine for a hero not designed to be all that effective at 40 minutes plus. Still, I could see keeping it if you scale it back from 70%.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Blanksyndrome","name":"t1_cqr4pct","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430224513,"created_utc":1430195713}

{"body":"Soo, in my opinion here might be some interesting points:		* Melee attacks now miss if the target is farther than 350 range more than their attack range (Can this be prevented by purchasing MKB or is it the same as always and true strike still doesn't negate the melee range buffer missing? (Nevermind the doom point. Just realized it didn't say from 125 range and instead said their)		* Turn casting: Is this a minor Lina buff since she has such obvious casting?		* **The following heroes are no longer restricted from buying Basher/Abyssal (but they are still restricted from activating Bash): Spirit Breaker, Faceless Void, Slardar and Troll**  (YES SO MUCH YES!!)		* Alchemist Agh's: Suggested by pretty much everywhere I've seen but with an interesting tweak to it. I'd never seen anyone suggest it being transferable, but only once is an interesting tweak. It still gives him an outlet to pump an additional 21k before being 6 slotted. But how does this account into his net worth? Is it considered or does the item just kinda vanish but leave the stats? HOLY SHIT IT ACTUALLY GIVES THE UPGRADE TOO HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT!!!!! Well, I mean, this is fucking crazy. It frees up any hero with a core agh's to have an additional item. Wow. So heroes like AA, Beast Master, Tiny, Necro, Witch Dr, among others get a free 4200 gold item, AND can have the upgrade. Jesus fuck		* Brood: Now what will she get? Deso for faster pushing, Skadi for more slow? (I would lean towards deso since she just eats squishies and can eat towers pretty well.)		* Enigma: I don't really play him but I am curious, will this let you guys take his ult whenever you can now or is the cost still too high?		* Slardar: Arguably buffed since 6.20. Do we have the new Juggernaut/Void on our hands?		* Weaver: Swarm damage nobody really ever cared about. So how much armor do they remove now on each level? The Aghanim's sounds really good too. 		* Winter Wyvern: Can somebody explain to me the Regen to .1 sec heals change please?		* Lotus orb: So if somebody is targeted with a channeled ability like Fiend's Grip, does the one with the orb start to channel it or does it jut go on cd or something??		* Guardian Greaves: So many more support slots just opened up now.		* Silver Edge: So sange has 3 paths now while yasha only has 2. Could we maybe expect a new yasha item in 6.85?		* BF: What ranged heroes could possibly want this? Or is it only there to carry over the ranged bonus for QB? And does it now require the 2 swords, perse, and QB? Will it be able to chop trees?		* Diff: Well, ranged illusions now burn mana, and no longer an orb. HH, Manta, Diffusal, Skadi, Satanic, Flaming Spears Huskar? Drow mana burning?		* Rod of Aui: Poor icefrog is just making this item scream "WHY WILL NOBODY BUY ME!?!?" But honestly, it still won't disable blinks. But would that push it into eul's territory or would damage on it be fine since it doesn't have the other amazing benefits eul's does in move speed, purging and regen?		* Vlads: Any ranged heroes wanting to get this over satanic? Possibly drow? Level 3 ult will only get 12.8 from the damage aura but will be able to split push better (possibly with illusions as well) in giving the armor and lifesteal to creeps. I know it says heroes but would ranged creeps be able to lifesteal as well? Or would it say units if it included creeps? 		Those were just pretty much my remarks about the patch. Anybody who could answer some of these questions with the test client? I don't have space to download the patch. I would be greatly appreciative who would help. Oh, and manditory question time:		* Who's going to be the Troll/Sniper/Storm/Jug of this patch?		EDIT: DC just released a video. The reflection item doesn't reflect 100% just shares.

But it says Note: The bonus magic resistance on Glimmer Cape is only active while invisible .		SO if i dust, obs someone and see them...do they still have the 66% magic resistance? they are not invisible anymore. just one of the confusing things i have. 		2nd. Moon Shard, FIRST OF ALL. im assuming this is best for late game when your carry as too much money and dont know what to do with it...just buy one of these, EAT IT and have permanent 60 attack speed. doesnt sound TOO bad for late game. 		BUT, do u still have the passive night vision. that is the question. 		3RD. the "Lotus Orb" "Note: This does not block the spell, it mirrors it back.

{"body":"**Tusk** was probably one of the biggest winners of this patch. Increased vision on Ice Shards helps a lot with follow-up Snowballs when you catch someone. **Ice Shards mana cost reduced is awesome, but still probably not enough to make it worth skipping either Arcanes or Soul Ring** (abuse that lower cooldown yo). 		Being able to pick up heroes while the snowball is rolling is fantastic, it's a straight up damage buff in some situations (you are a while behind an ally who is chasing an opponent) - but it also **de-emphasises Blink Dagger**. For example, you can now be on one side of Chrono, and roll at someone on the other side, and pick up your allies in the Chrono. 		It's great that Blink Dagger isn't as core in him (though I never bought it myslef - he needs more utility imo) - because **he has 2 new items that greatly improve his DPS**, and in fact, combine several of the items he used to want to buy before. 		I used to rush Halberd and Medallion - but now** Solar Crest** mixes them. Similarly I always wanted to go for Shadow Blade, but now the Sange I would usually buy for Halberd can be mixed into a **Silver Edge.** 		Itemising Tusk used to be a case of utility vs. DPS - now it feels like he can get a bit of both. **Solar Crest makes him a fucking monster. Silver Edge also has enough utility on it to make it really worth while.** 		I think his Aghs is fun, but honestly compared to the other items it's not as useful (well unless you get Blink + BKB as well - in which case hello batrider-ish shenanigans!).","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cqr802p","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430233583,"created_utc":1430204783}

{"body":"In some heroes is OP in a lot it is not, and even in those heroes there are counters.		Now the problem with Octarine is that gives shitty stats and costs a lot, for example in Lina, she will run out of mana really fast. You need to buy another item that gives you more mana (like refresher or blood stone). That makes it really more expensive, if you want it to be more efficient, you need to buy 2 really expensive items. For the spell steal you need to do some significant damage with it to work for something, so for a lot of heroes is useless like zeus (you nuke for 350 damage every 4.5 seconds? that is just 20 heal per second).	Also there are bkbs, if the other team bkb and burst you down your cooldowns and spell lifesteal means nothing.		To me, it's like saying desolator or satanic are OP. Satanic can be a free cheese every 35 seconds, that is insane, absolutely insane. Yes Octarine is an amazing item... really powerful, but not OP. You just need to play the game a little different, buy more bkbs, try to get high ground earlier before the casters get to much items.		That being said, in some heroes is insanely OP, Bristleback being the best example. Already low cooldown spells, stackable damage and really low mana cost. Then again, the counters will come. Silver Edge for disabling Bristleback's passive, lot's of armor and you kick his ass.	It's like PA, that crit is OP as fuck, as is the common 82.5% evasion (butterfly + passive). But you can counter her with a MKB.		It's a new game with a new meta. If people keep playing the old way they are gonna get their asses kicked.	All in all, Octarine is an amazing item as is a Satanic, but you don't want to build those items in all heroes just because it's powerful. It's gonna be similar to satanic, a great item and late game choice for most but core for only a few.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Deban","name":"t1_cqtgxmo","parent_id":"t1_cqssbl3","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430393052,"created_utc":1430364252}

In a comparison a carry can lifesteal 50hp per hit. (200 damage with 25% lifesteal).		That is nowhere near OP. And if you still think it's OP it's really easy, buy an orchid.

Did you read the post about Lina AOE? I put all the math there. She is one the greatest AOE nukers of the game. She will heal per second the same that an average carry will heal per hit (and they can hit a lot per second).		Magic resistance was buffed by the way.			Dota has a lot of OP items, for example Satanic: gives 200% lifesteal for 4 seconds. So for 4 seconds you heal the double of what you hit. It has a 35 seconds cooldown. For any hard hitting carry that is full health.		This item will make casters not shit anymore, they don't need to be supports.

{"body":"Some of the changes are absolutely insane.  Bigger than anything seen in recent Dota history, or arguably *any* game that's popular and played competitively.		Some examples:		This item contains a new patch that grants 25% cooldown reduction on both abilities and item actives, and spellvamp.  Unlike LoL, CDR was pretty much non-existent in Dota until this patch.  Previously the only items that gave CDR was Aghanim's Scepter on some heroes, and Refresher Orb, which has an active that resets cooldowns completely.		More Aghanim Scepter upgrades.  This is an item that grants an unique upgrade on a hero, and every patch adds scepter upgrades to heroes that previously didn't have one.  Some of the upgrades are really jaw-dropping.  For example, Lifestealer has the ability to "infest" a creep or an allied hero, which allows him to hide inside it.  With the scepter upgrade, Lifestealer gains a new ability -- he can now swallow an allied hero, allowing him or her to hide inside him.  So now it's possible for hero A to hide inside Lifestealer, who in turn hides inside hero B.  That allows hero B to bring two additional heroes into the fight onto the unsuspecting opponent.		Furthermore, one of the heroes can now buy a scepter, then consume the scepter and grant all the bonuses, including the new/upgraded abilities, to another ally.  This effectively allows heroes to be "7-slotted", since they gain the bonuses of the scepter without having it occupy an item slot.		Just imagine if League had such abilities.		So in summary, this patch isn't just about changing the balance of the game -- it adds a ton of new gameplay possibilities.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"itchycuticles","name":"t1_cqrbtc4","parent_id":"t1_cqrbfqg","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430249437,"created_utc":1430220637}

{"body":"**General**		- teamfight meta?		- so does damage block work on Omnislash?		- Hex is now not that great vs PA		- no more awkward EE pauses		**Heroes**		- Alchemist - probably being played now mid? Aghs upgrade seems huge...imagine going to lategame with Aghs upgrade not have a slot taken!!!		- AA - good probably for pubs mostly in case you need to destroy buildings		- Bat - still OP		- BH - Track's gold visibility might be viable now with the gold changes?		- Broodmama - Desolator? OoV?		- Cent - now probably very good with Alchemist.		- DS - a little bit better at earlier levels		- DK - laning is now good, very good		- Ench - the QoP & Lina treatment		- Invoker - that Deaf blast change seems important against Blink right clickers...		- Wisp - we did it reddit		- Jugg - with the MoM nerf he now seems ok		- LC - Fight of the Decades...		- Leshrekt - that slow seems really strong...still has some problems (squishy as fuck, range)		- Naix - so they Assimilate into you and you Infest into somebody...and kaboom, 600 damage and surprise mofo two heroes here...with Wisp even more		- Sylla - that Aghs doesn't seem that useful if you go Radiance...and later on if you die your bear will quickly follow anyway. Although in midgame you can't just focus the Druid anymore.		- Morphling - Hybrid has awesome synergy with Error. Imagine how many Metaform mofos there are gonna be...damn.		- Naga - support Naga hype! Oh and that Radiance buff makes her even stronger. My inner rat can't wait.		- Nyx - Blink is a must now. Although there might be situations where you don't have Vendetta, pop Burrow, do stuff, then Vendetta out?		- OD - I cannot imagine what it causes. Note that it will probably affect your allies as well!		- 2Puck - I hate it when people don't skill the Silence. Now I have more reasons to hate.		- Riki - Smokescreen is now the third ability in the game to change turnrate, right?		- Rubick - useless buff. Although Rubick isn't in a bad place.		- Rhasta - not such an ez kill anymore.		- Sniper - nice, delayed Shrapnel a little bit and Headshot doesn't ignore evasion. PA is now excellent vs the dwarf.		- Spec - in & out baby. This seems very useful btw - let's say you Reality in, kill somebody or you suddenly get overwhelmed - well time to swap places with my Haunt illusion again. Great change although I feel Spec doesn't need buffs.		- Storm - that flying vision is interesting. Needs Roshpit testing.		- Techies - mindgames level Jose Mourinho.		- Tusk - boxing seems fine but guys have you seen his short legs? How is the animation gonna look like?		- Errorblade - the Reflection actually seems very very useful against certain lineups.		- Tinker - Aghs now very useful for turtling, especially against melee heroes.		- Troll - doesn't nerf him too much to be honest. Although his last changes  didn't seem very good either. But then again I felt he was strong before he got picked.		- Tusk - nice changes. Especially like being able to grab units along the way.		- Undy - TA approves		- Ursa - so basically he doesn't need to stack HP items anymore?		- WK - the teamfight potential for the Aghs is huge. Imagine having Oracle ulties automatically being cast!		**ITEMS**		- Mango - that mana component seems very nice, Clarities useless?		- Lotus Orb - I assume the spell's effects apply to the reflected target as well, right? That is extremely important in the case of Reaper's Scythe.		- Glimmer Cape - seems very useful for supports, not even very expensive. For Slut Spirit maybe?		- Guardian Greaves - oh god, this item is going to be great. And Mek and Arcanes are gonna be useful again.		- Moon Shard - the passive isn't that very good but in ultra-lategame scenarios the permanent AS buff may be very useful. I mean we've seen games where some people have over 10k gold.		- Silver Edge - on paper it's not that bad but for whom is this? A manmode melee hero that wants to burst somebody? Lesbian Commander maybe? Centaur? Slardar, yeah.		- Octarine Core - a very interesting item. Based on stats it's gonna be very useful on INT heroes. But the passive looks extremely good for long CD heroes. So Enigma and Zeus immediately come to mind, thanks to the other passive Zeus benefits from the heal even more. Otherwise an interesting alternative to Refresher.		- Wards - neat change		- bashers - overall damage increase		- Armlet - better for CK whose illusions don't benefit from the AS that much. Not sure about other heroes.		- QB - never understood why it didn't kill the ward...		- Bfury - neat change, Bfury builder generally built QB anyway so this saves a slot and some tiny gold as well.		- Phase boots - cheaper now.		- BoT - I wasn't of the impression BoTs needed buff.		- Deso - 10 less damage for 600 less gold? I will take it! It's not a hardcore lategame item anyway.		- Diffusal - now provides some bonus' for heroes that built it just for the active. Although Manta Diffusal on ranged heroes for the manaburn still is very gimmicky.		- Drums - small buffs, not sure about viability.		- Euls - this seems big. But this will need some gameplay experience to judge.		- Gloves of Haste - so do all derivate items benefit from the + AS as well?		- Heaert - better at in and out but the duration still seems long. Otherwise no significant buffs IMO.		- Medic Wand - makes Circlet start better. Nice.		- Mad MoM - nice nerf. It was mostly used as a farming item. Now half of its farming viability is nerfed.		- Necromons - better earlier units. Does it matter? Lycan will either get fast 3 or lose.		- Wards - what do single increments mean? Anyway more wards! I approve.		- Radiance - you think Naga rat was strong before? Oh you haven't seen shit. Not winter but Nightmares are coming.		- Atos - now the second highest INT bonus in the game.		- Stout - changes starting items quite a lot with those mangoes and stuff.		- Tango - rewards dewarding, nice.		- TP - fuck TP, let's all rush BoTs -.-		- Vlads - awesome change, later on the supports are the one holding it anyway.		______		Generally a lot of Aghs seem fine but not worth the Aghs item itself. This is where Alchemist comes into play.

{"body":"As someone who plays a lot of Alchemist here's my thoughts:  	The buffs intended for him aren't really benefiting Alchemist's role as a carry.        	1.) "Unstable Concoction countdown can now be seen by enemies". This change can either be bad or good. Bad in a way that if you're aiming for a max duration stun and people sees the countdown, people will abuse it. Good in a way that you can be unpredictable with it but I'm pretty sure most people would disable you when you reach the 2.5-2secs countdown. I see this as a minor nerf tbh.(not ideal for supports)       	2.) "Greevil's Greed now grants 4x gold bounty from Runes" This change is so-so, it benefits him though. If I play Alchemist as a position 1 role, I wouldn't be going to prioritizing runes over lanes, but if a lane isn't safe and you're farming the jungle, I would get that bounty rune after I farm the jungle because that's the only chance I'm picking it up.       	3.) "Aghanim's upgrade" There's no way I'm prioritizing an aghs. I would probably get it if I already have 3 or 4 main items but I would never use it for myself unless I'm really rich/fed.       	4.)On the other note, Silver edge would fit sooooo good for Alch. Invis attack now deals 225 damage also applies **Break** to disable passive abilities, and reduces the target's damage output (all damage types) by 40% for 5 seconds. 24 second cooldown. Attacking to end invisibility cannot miss. Debuff does not pierce Spell Immunity. This gives him edge on fighting with other carries. Channeling stun from a far, pops silver edge (no evasion for you PA) , autoattack, acid spray while you have cuirass (-12 armor) would wreck people.    		In conclusion, he's still weak as a carry, very squishy early on unless **supports** (one support isn't enough) will babysit him. But once he gets 6 and can farm safely, he can be a dangerous carry.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kuring","name":"t1_cqr6cb2","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430228472,"created_utc":1430199672}

Feast is now considered as normal bonus damage (can Crit and Cleave off it)			Open Wounds lifesteal increased from 15/20/25/30% to 50%	Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Lifestealer: Grants a new skill, Assimilate. Assimilate allows Lifestealer to target an allied hero and swallow them, allowing them to hide inside of Lifestealer. Any healing Lifestealer receives is shared with the assimilated hero. The assimilated hero can release itself at any time by clicking on the buff icon to erupt outward and deal 300 damage to enemies in a 700 area of effect. If Lifestealer dies or assimilates another hero, the currently assimilated hero will automatically exit. Issuing any order with your hero, a few seconds after being assimilated, will take you out.			Invoker(Lvl 25 invoker will be awsome)			Circular qwe blast				Lone druid:			Added Agahnim's Scepter upgrade to Lone Druid: Allows Spirit Bear to attack at any range from Lone Druid, and prevents Spirit Bear from dying if Lone Druid dies				Morphling(Techies sucide combo?)

Note: Ability is not available while you have a Replicate living.				Wraith King(Possible support wraithking?)				Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Wraith King: Allies who are near Wraith King (within 1200 aoe) when slain become Wraiths for 5 seconds, delaying their death. They can continue attacking, casting, etc. When the duration ends, the hero dies, and credit for the kill goes to whowever landed the original killing blow.				Enchentress (Possible carry)	Impetus now pierces Spell Immunity				.Doom,				Alchemistt				Greevil's Greed now grants 4x gold bounty from Runes	Alchemist can now cast Aghanim's Scepter to directly grant any allied hero all Aghanim's Scepter bonuses as a buff (the hero upgrade and the stat upgrade). The scepter is consumed in the process. Multiple instances of this buff do not stack. Alchemist can target himself as well.

Second relocate has a cooldown, so you know if IO has relocate recently then you can are safe. Third he needs vision of you to know where you are. Fourth it requires a little more skill as you need to have map awareness.		Techies lack all of that, you can't fight cause you insta die, you don't get anything from killing his mines. He can mine all the map, there is no time nor place to be safe. He doesn't require vision nor skill to kill you. You are invis trying to kill a lone hero, boom, you die.	Imagine a Spirit Breaker, you see a hero alone trying to farm, you charge there... oh it was a trap. If riki was there is a chance you can actually save yourself, forcestaff out of smoke charge away or whatever. On the other hand if the techie puts mines there, you are done, you die, zero chance of defending, 0 chance of survival.		Another thing is that techies does that from minute 0, other ganking heroes need more time.		Techies eliminates roaming from the game. Yes you can get a gem, but you can't see up slopes, so you also need a blink, and that cancels you invisibility. Techies also eliminate melee mids (need a ranged and a sentry to take mines out of the runes). Techies ruins the fun for a lot of heroes.

Another thing that needs to be taken into account is how garbage the pull already was at level 1 for damage.

{"body":"> I mean who needs Batrider to to initiate into the rosh pit or the enemy base		Because not every fight calls for an initiation where you charge in and yolo your whole team 5v5. Bat and Centaur provide two completely different types of initiation. Centaur lets your entire team run at them and fight head on. Batrider lets you get clean pickoffs and instantly make the following teamfight a 5v4. Batrider also has superior positioning with Firefly. His initiation is also less all in and allows you to dictate where you want the fight to occur by dragging an enemy to you. With centaur stampede, you need to run to where the enemy is and you aren't controlling any of their movements.		Let's say the enemy has a very scary teamfight lineup, like with a Tidehunter or Enigma. You're not going to benefit from an initiation where you just all run into them, that's just playing right into their teamfight.

It usually changes how the game works giving more or less armor to towers, balacing how much gold/exp you receive for killing an enemie etc. Now the 6.84 comes as a MAJOR balance patch, it brings all the hype that the minor patchs do, balance heroes, bring adjusts to "comeback" mechanics thats mean a balance to how much gold/exp u receive for kills that have been introduced in 6.83, but this time the patch will add like 10 new items. That brings a lot of combinations possible for each hero, a item that was a must get for hero X now can be swaped for new item Y and community are on hype to try test all this new combinations.

{"body":"It's not about that, it's about taking a game and making nothing like what you came to in the first place for. Way too many inconsistencies. Way too much rock-paper-scissors. Less emphasis on snowballing, more emphasis on OP picks. Simple everyday bugs or blips that could be repaired by one man in a day, left untouched and ignored. These are not competitive qualities, these are the quality of a card game, a game of chance. I like chess, but when somebody keeps adding pieces, changing what pieces do, and removing pieces, I personally grow tired of it, and will find more stable games to play. So that when I get good at the game, the game is static and complete while I work on my skill, instead of the game changing every three months, if Reddit whines enough, and then having to throw the old knowledge out you just spent a year developing. Don't kid yourself, its a lure to keep you playing, keep you relearning, keep you hooked. No thanks. Through Dota I have learned that the majority has the say, and the individuals voice is never heard, and there's never a middle ground in this community. I'm tired of wasting my breath and my time. Dota was good for a time for me but that is sure as hell over now. After the disaster that was the Year Beast (I'm saying this from a non-participant's perspective), and now this patch, I am sure of this. Valve seems to believe that the game must constantly change, constantly be overhauled, and constantly expand in order for it to be considered a game. I don't believe this. I am one of the few that despise change but I'll be okay with it if it's a necessity. This patch was not necessary nor the countless "improvements" before it. 		Shame on both Icefrog and Valve. Instead of sharpening and honing this finely crafted katana they've made, they melt it down and turn it into claymore, or whatever you like; it's no longer what it was. 		Have you ever considered that Valve's culture they put forth could result in this hive-minded need for patches and changes and updates? Do you think that's what the game needs? From what I'm seeing it just looks like they want to keep people hooked. Just think about that with an open mind.		I think I might even just go to chess now, honestly, something that isn't treated like a goddamn monopoly business. Enjoy your new game though.

{"body":"Invoker - I'm 50/50 on this, he never had mana problems so the int gain is purely for extra base damage? Not really why you pick him. Feels like that + sunstrike cd reduction makes his laning a bit stronger but nothing special, new max deafening blast is nothing huge imo, by the time your that level they have BKBs anyway. Other thing is just a convenience thing which doesn't really make him stronger.		Lone Druid - The Aghs is crazy strong, the other buffs are nice for man fighting and pushing. Situationally strong on play style, may be top tier because the hero is generally really good in the Offlane, so he will find the lvls and gold he wants.		Alchemist - Farms better than anyone else now, does not make him top tier. Aghs doesn't stack, so he can only gain 10/10/10 stats, doesn't make him a huge deal. Giving someone else an aghs? Cool, but that is 4200 gold you invested there. Doesn't look like games are going to go as long now, so this feels weak to me.		Ench - Will see a lot more action, top tier? Probably not. Jungling is weaker, doesn't push as well as chen or enigma, doesn't have black hole (big buff) for a fighting oriented meta. Impetus buff is really big though, not sure on top tier but can see her being experimented with in the early stages.		Morph - Offlane morph is really legit now, although you can disjoint the stun, the aghs really caters to that utility style of play. STR morph could become top tier.		Furion - In what looks like a ganking mid-game fighting meta, is he really going to shine? We'll see a lot of heroes who have strong solo pick off potential this patch I feel which limits his viability. Sprout buff is good, but it's still a so-so spell in the sense that it can be rendered useless quite easily. Is push really that strong? Glyph mechanic still exists.		Ursa - I definitely think the new Enrage sounds incredible. I can see him being a go to hero, especially with his most powerful time being early-mid game, which this patch seems to be catering for.		Nyx - I don't see how, or why, nyx builds an aghs. It's not as useful as a blink or force. And a core nyx really does benefit from a dagon in the later mid-game, because he wants the solo kill potential to force the enemy to group and limit there map control. So I don't think hes seen anything much of a buff, depends on how the meta game shifts for game durations as to whether he becomes strong.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Biggsy-32","name":"t1_cqrl4k2","parent_id":"t1_cqrk4ot","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430267732,"created_utc":1430238932}

{"body":"> Alchemist can now cast Aghanim's Scepter to directly grant any allied hero all Aghanim's Scepter bonuses as a buff (the hero upgrade and the stat upgrade). The scepter is consumed in the process. Multiple instances of this buff do not stack.

Destroys trees		>Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Legion Commander: Duel lasts until either Legion Commander or her target dies. Ends if duelists are ever more than 2,000 range apart.		>Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Lifestealer: Grants a new skill, Assimilate. Assimilate allows Lifestealer to target an allied hero and swallow them, allowing them to hide inside of Lifestealer. Any healing Lifestealer receives is shared with the assimilated hero. The assimilated hero can release itself at any time by clicking on the buff icon to erupt outward and deal 300 damage to enemies in a 700 area of effect. If Lifestealer dies or assimilates another hero, the currently assimilated hero will automatically exit. Issuing any order with your hero, a few seconds after being assimilated, will take you out.		>Improved Aghanim's Scepter: Allows Eclipse to be cast on an area within 2,500 range. Grants obstructed vision of that area. Can also target any allied unit to center Eclipse on their location, even while moving (can double click or target Luna)		>Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade to Morphling: Grants a new ability, Hybrid. Allows morphling to target an ally, turning himself into a hybrid illusion, removing the Morphling himself. This hybrid illusion can cast non-ultimate abilities and has your original attributes.

Note: Ability is not available while you have a Replicate living.		>Added Aghanim's Scepter upgrade: Song of the Siren Scepter now regenerates you and nearby allies by 6% of maximum HP per second for up to 7 seconds.		>Aghanim's Scepter-upgraded Wrath of Nature now spawns a Nature's Call treant whenever it kills a unit. Killing a hero will spawn a stronger treant (3x damage and health of a normal one)		>Added Aghamin's Scepter upgrade to Nyx: Adds a new ability, Burrow, with a one second cast time. While Burrowed, Nyx Assassin is invisible and unable to move/attack, but has 40% damage resistance, and regenerates 1.5% of his health and mana per second. Nyx Assassin's abilities also have improved properties while burrowed: Mana Burn and Impale have 50% increased cast range, Impale Cooldown is reduced from 13 to 9, and Spiked Carapace instantly stuns any enemy units within a 300 area of effect without requiring them to hurt him first.

{"body":"Icefrog made too may buffs this patch. There should have only been nerfs, and adding items is retarded.		If anything, Dota should be approached from an engineer's standpoint: it is only perfect if there is nothing left to take away, and I see a lot of things that need to be taken away:		1) Troll, Axe, Sniper, Riki, Pudge should have all been kneecapped and nerfed to shit. They ruined the last patch and should have been punished for it.		2) Diffusal, Eul's, Mask of Madness, and Battlefury should have been removed from the game. These items are too strong and give heroes too much of an edge		3) Alchemist did not the Aghanim's buff, he did not need any buffs. A hero should not be able to be 7-slotted, that is fundamentally wrong. Icefrog should not go unpunished for this.		4) There were not enough nerfs to actual problem heroes this patch. All buffs from 6.82 and 6.83 should have been reverted. The meta must be carefully crafted to perfection or else russian retards will find ways to break it.","depth":0,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ZizZizZiz","name":"t1_cqqzh1q","parent_id":"t3_343o4f","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1430215215,"created_utc":1430186415}
