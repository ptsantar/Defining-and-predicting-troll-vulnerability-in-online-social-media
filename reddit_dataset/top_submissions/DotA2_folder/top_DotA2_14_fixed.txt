{"body":"they are really pointless...all they do is give a minor variation/increase in early/initial game stats. Without any runes a hero like Ashe at level 1 (Drow ranger) has the following statistics:	 	- HEALTH 528	  	- ATTACK DAMAGE 51 		- HEALTH REGEN. 5.4 		- ATTACK SPEED  0.658 		- MANA 232  		- ARMOR 21.2 		- MANA REGEN. 7.0  		- MAGIC RES. 30.0		- RANGED 600 		- MOV. SPEED 325		so adding some runes will give you a few additional points in some of these categories except range. A few would be between something like 12 extra armor points or 15 extra attack damage. 		you could put 1 type of rune (lets say ability power which is magic damage) in 3 of the 4  slot groups giving you an additional 30 Ability power but you would have no additional armor or magic resist while the other guy does since he might have use standard armor and magic resist runes while you went all magic damage ability power.  		At that point you hit a little harder (but the difference he absorbs via his extra magic resist) and also take more damage from him since you have no additional armor/magic resist to compensate.		So you can add mana regen glyphs, or health seals to increase how many hitpoints you have or armor seals which might add a few points of armor or move speed quints which add 1.5% increase in move speed, or a few Magic Resist glyps to increase your initial magic resistance. 		All of this is kind of pointless as the moment you buy 2-3 items the stat difference is really negligible.  		Runes only help you during the initial start of the laning phase but since in LOL so many people follow the meta very rigidly like its some holy grail everyone ends up running pretty much the same exact rune combinations cancelling out any advantage. 		For example if you play a standard mage you put 9 Magic Penetration marks, 9 scaling health or armor seals (depending on whether you are going against a melee ninja or mage), and 9 Magic Resist glyphs and 3 ability Power Quints. So every midlaner has this set up 99% of the time. Few stray from the standard guides/best way to play meta bs. 		if you are bot lane and play adc you typically go 9 armor pen or Attack damage marks, 9 Armor Seals, and 9 Magic Resits Glyphs and either 3 Attack Damage Quints or 3 Attack Speed Quints which give you 15% attack speed if you are an auto attack adc. So pretty much ever single enemy adc you face will have this setup.		It really is pointless and a big grind for stat difference that are almost meaningless. 		Many people have bitched over the years that each rune/different runes are too expensive and in general a dumb idea and should be removed or reworked.		 Riot finally reduced the pricing on some of these runes a while back and has said that they were working on a new system to revamp the runes - Coming Soon (tm).		People theory craft different rune and mastery combinations (additional stat differences like WOW skill trees) but in the end it really comes down to skill and just playing safe. If you don't do something stupid those runes won't make much of a difference. People say they do but they really don't.  		You can afk farm safely under turret until you hit 6 and buy a few items and the fact that the other dude has runes and you don't won't mean diddly squat. Sure end game some of those mastery points might give you an extra 5-8% damage or resistance but when you get hit for 1200+ points of damage by 2 different people or an ult that does 1600+ you still won't survive. 		The problem with all this pointless grinding to open champs and runes is that once you do that there is nothing else to use those points on....you end up with people having 100,000+ Influence points that are worthless and can't be spent on anything because you unlocked everything. Its just one pointless gate after another. 		I understand why its good to ease people into the game and why its good to gradually introduce them to the game but I don't understand why you have to grind for 1.5+ years to open all the characters and another year to open up a few meaningless rune pages.

{"body":"When HoN was released, Icefrog made an announcement that S2 Games had approached him for approval to create basically a port of dota, but with their own heroes too, which they did. And for some time they kept up with patches, despite having their own heroes, copying all changes dota was making even down to the numbers. 		It felt like it was to be a successor to Dota, like Icefrog's way of making sure his legacy would live on long after people stop playing custom games on an old and graphically outdated WC3 engine. 		After some time as HoN released more of their own heroes, they started deviating from Dota's balance patches, and it became less and less Dota 1.5 and more S2's own game, almost defiantly so. I think at some point they stopped keeping HoN's ported heroes exact copies of their Dota variants and even started changing them too ---- which is kinda like heresy of course. 		All semblance of HoN ever supposing to be a successor to Dota, officially or unofficially, ended. 		Perhaps a year or 2 after, while HoN was very much still considered part of the moba ecosystem, Valve announced their partnership with Icefrog. Soon after that news, there came a 'the truth about Icefrog' anonymous blog (probably Pendragon that fuckface) that tried to discredit Icefrog saying many bad things about him. 		One thing the blogger happened to mention to try to sully his name, was that he was paid by S2 for consultation on making HoN (which is just business really). So one assumes that at some point S2 and Icefrog decided not to work together on HoN anymore, perhaps due to a contract being up, perhaps due to S2 wanting to change too many things. Nobody but the involved parties know the nature of that partnership. 		We can all be glad that he's with Valve now though. Like fuck. Fuckin dream come true.

{"body":"Well, it was their ~own~ game, and to be fair, it's hard to stick with Dota balance patches when you have additional heroes that Dota doesn't have. Though it did feel like at some point they decided 'we can do this ourselves', we don't know if a few months into beta they were still getting consultation from Icefrog, or just following his release patches and copying them with his consent. If its the latter, again its really hard to make work with your own heroes.		That being said, all this is in the past, and HoN/S2 went in a clearly downward direction (was a weird, rinky dink and sometimes shady company to begin with).		Meanwhile, Icefrog's bank account gives him all the validation he needs.

Disabling invisibility, for example Dust of Appearance, continues to reveal invisible targets to all teams.		* Custom game player IDs aren't guaranteed to follow the 'TeamPlayer' convention that normal Dota does (where Radiant and Dire players have IDs 0..9)		* Exposed to script as SetTeamCustomHealthbarColor( teamNumber, r, g, b ) / ClearTeamCustomHealthbarColor( teamNumber )		Lots of support for multiple teams, as we can see in Overthrow		* Reduced CPU usage of client		* Reduced GPU usage of client		Source 2 improvements!		* Pathfinding for many units is now faster		* Added a PathfindingSearchDepthScale key to units.txt that may be set to a value between 0 and 1 to make pathfinding less accurate but much faster for that unit, to allow for larger unit counts.		Better support for huge-scale games like tower defense or footmen frenzy!		* Dota buildings now have a 'particle_tint_color' key - if set they will set their ambient and destruction FX CP 15 & 16 (dota standard) to that color		* Allow tinting of heroes in custom games		Easier colour customisation!		* Charge-based abilities and items can now be refreshed with the -refresh command and cast freely with the -wtf command.

Battle.net 2.0 had this exact same mistake: you cannot set up an interface where popular maps completely out-advertise unpopular maps, otherwise it is impossible for new maps to penetrate the scene! The Warcraft 3 system (a list of games, ordered by creation time) worked because it gave all maps an equal opportunity to be on display, and the more popular maps were simply on display more. 		Let's use Reddit as an analogy. In the interface Valve has shown, we're able to look at the 'top' of maps, or of a given maps subreddit, and that's it. You might be able to browse otherwise, but most people won't. Starcraft 2 did this same thing. Warcraft 3 instead showed you the 'new' of maps, and this allowed anything to become popular or discoverable.  		Of course, you need another system in addition to this.

{"body":"Honestly? This just proves that THIS F2P system is the most superior one.		Everyone starts at the same point, nobody is forced to grind up levels or heroes to "actually" play the game. This is why I can't stand HotS. I even had to unlock spells by leveling up and couldn't use them before. That is like the most dumbest concept I've ever experienced myself. But, its new Activision Blizzard.		For Dota2:		You just play it. You just enjoy the game.		This makes spending money on it much more enjoyable. I don't have to spend 10$ to "buy" a hero and play it then. I just have everything I need, from the start. If I want some fancy hats, thats what I can get then. 		I don't feel bad for paying for something "unnessecary" like a hat. I love the game, I love the people working on it, I love the community. Everything. Even if there are dicks here and there, that doesn't matter, its just also a part of it. I enjoy it, a lot.		There are restaurants that have the policy that "you pay what you feel like". You can pay nothing, or you can pay "more than needed". The system works, the restaurant still exists since years. But why?		You get some good warm food, something nice to drink, a good service. Basicly for free. But you honor that by paying. People put a lot of effort for you that you could enjoy your meal, the cook, the person that took your order and all. There, it's played on morale. I'd feel like shit to eat for free and pay nothing. 		Same goes for Dota2. Valve basicly gives me everything I want, free of charge. JUST. They don't except me anything to return.		But I do that anyway, by buying hats.		Valve earns money, they can spend it to make more amazing things.		I have cool hats in a game that I will play for many many many many years. And in return I get amazing Valve quality products back.

{"body":"though I agree on most of your points, still, I think valve maede a huugue leap of faith with dota. I'll explain:		1.It's hard. You don't "jump in and own noobs" cod style. It takes time to master and understand the game. It takes forever to get the quirks of each hero down, because the tool-tips don't say everything		2.It's a very specific game. Mobas (aside from HON, LoL) where small, and LoL was owning the scene big time. They were not jsut "stepping in", they were trying to cut-out the a peace of the market. That's aggro economics right there and we are talking about video games, were the market is always at max risk of a flop.		3. Going in aggro in a hostile enemy territory is one thing, going full aggro with a game, made from a mod from another game, heck even using some of the names form the game, while knowing that its Leviathan of a company is lurking in the shadows just waiting to sue your arse if it just "assumes" "copy-right" is involved, well it  needed more then just balls made of frkin adamantium-vibranium-mithril-dragon bone alloy.		4. This one is my favorite - the e-sports. Where e-sports big? Nor really. fungind a tournament in favor of a possible "market increase" , well, it's kidna the same as "let's make an eating competition worldwide tournament and let's hope that this will increase our cheese-finger sales". Replace "cheese-finger" with anything, even a bigmac and still, you might end up getting fired if you proposed such a thing during a meeting. Thats how it is absurd.	But they did it. They threw cash in the first TI and look what it did. We are now at 15mil and going. People generally started to know what an "esport" is outside of Korea (and I'm talking about hte good Korea).  		so simply put, dota2 and valve makes a good case of showing, that f2p can work, but it is also true, it can't work everywhere. 	It's a system you can't implement in Sc2 (or any rts for that, because a decal or camo for your tanks just doesn't cut it).

{"body":"> MOBA		The term Multiplayer Online Battle Arena was coined by Riot games to create a distinct genre for League of Legends without mentioning it's connections to Dota.		However, it's exceptionally vague terminology is poor at describing the core attributes of a Dota-like game. It may certainly describe Dota and League of Legends in some way, but so too does it describe nearly every competitive multiplayer game in existence. Call of Duty is multiplayer, online, battle focused and restricted to an arena. So too is the latest Super Smash Brothers. Even a browser-based Chess game is multiplayer, online, a simulation of a battle and restricted to an arena...		The term Action Real-Time Strategy, in contrast, does a much better job of describing the genre Dota belongs to. Having arisen from an RTS, it shares a lot of gameplay and mechanics typical to that genre. The differentiator is the action focus in the choice to limit the player to a single complex unit, similar to a character in a fighting game. Hence the acronym ARTS.		Of course, if you find ARTS to be too ambiguous, you can go back to the Starcraft mod that inspired DotA: Allstars and created the genre; call it ASSFAGGOTS, or "Aeon of Strife Styled Fortress Assault Game Going On Two Sides.".","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"banthisonenazimods","name":"t1_cs9g524","parent_id":"t1_cs8uu3x","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434570295,"created_utc":1434541495}

{"body":"Well the main issue stems from the design of the map and subsequently the lane setup that evolved from it. League has one viable lane setup (with a handful of edge cases in high level play). So every game has a top/mid/jungler/adc/support. And while not all the champs are the same or will play exactly the same way, they have a base level to operate on. ADC last hits, support zones and tries some harass. ADC becomes physical damage dealer, support has some utility for later fights. Jungler junglers with their handful of rotations and gank attempts. They generally become fight disruptors, building a mix of either tanky or some damage. Mid tries their best to win their lane to gain traction to kill. Usually becomes a high magic damage dealer with good nuking/killing potential. Top just hangs out top and wants to be alive and sustain.		This generic strategy always works. It is the way to play League. Of course there is some game to game variety and in game is somewhat different. Maybe you do dragon a little earlier cause their jungler tried to gank bot but messed it up and you killed him. Maybe mid snowballs so hard that you play around that champion and the ADC is more or less forgotten. But that's more or less the extent of the variation.			Dota is a lot more open ended. There isn't a single lane setup. You can run 212 (current average pub meta), 122 (really old school pub meta), 221 (which is different because Dota is asymmetrical), 311, 113, 112jungle, 111 double jungle, 112 roamer, 111 double roamer, 121 jungle, etc. These setups all lead into different strategies that are viable. There's all in push, 4 protect 1, dual core, tri-core, split push, roshan killers, negative armor strats, magic nuke, physical nuke, sustain push, heavy dot damage, etc. 		So already within just lane setup and then gameplan you have way more variations than League's system does. On top of that, you have to account for various extremely strong synergies between Dota's hero abilities. For example, Huskar is a hero who has more magic resistance and attacks faster as he loses health. His ult jumps him to an enemy, it hurts both him and the enemy (50% hp as magic dmg I'm pretty sure), and then he throws fire arrows that hurt himself but dots the enemy. His last ability is a HoT that increases the lower his health. He is a powerful hero on his own, easily reducing high hp heroes with his %dmg ult, shredding damage block abilities with the fire arrows, and insanely hard to kill with his magic resist and healing, just spamming out his high damage fire arrows at anyone near him (or jumping to them with his ult). If in addition to this, you put a hero on his team that can keep him alive through potential physical or pure (ignore magic resistance) nukes, then his power multiplies. So we have heroes like Dazzle who's second ability puts a 5s buff that keeps you from dying (think Trynd's ult but you cast on allies), or Omniknight who's ultimate makes you immune to physical damage for up to 7 seconds plus has a burst heal. On the flipside, you can completely counter a hero like Huskar if you pick correctly against him. Timbersaw has 3 pure damage nukes, one of them removing 25% of your main stat and Huskar is Strength, meaning he'll lose health. Magic resist be damned. Phantom Assassin is a carry with 4.5x crit built into her auto attack and her pure damage nuke. On top of that she has evasion as well. There's a good chance if you fight PA, you'll hit her 3 times (miss twice) and she'll hit 2 times and 1 crit and you're gone.		So yeah, that makes Dota strategy go way more in depth than League's. You can be mechanically worse than your enemy, but still win if you have a clever strategy that they aren't prepared to deal with. Maybe they win the lanes, but you know come lvl 11 your heroes will have abilities their heroes can't stop. So you tell your team to play defensive and just wait until minute 15 then gather for a 5 man deathball push. Or maybe you know that the enemy carry is way stronger than any hero on your team, so instead of having your ADC equivalent farming, you have them build some cheaper items and get to fighting immediately. These developments don't really happen in League. You are  more less doing the same thing every game on a macro level. To qualify, I don't think this makes League a worse game. But it is hard to go to League when you've already experienced the diversity of Dota. And though I played League for ~1.5 years between HoN leaving beta and before I got into Dota 2 beta, it was never as satisfying for me.			In summary, 3 things help Dota have a deeper strategy.		 * Large variety of viable lane setups.		 * Large variety of viable gameplans/strategies.		 * Very strong synergies between hero abilities.		Feel free to keep asking questions.		Edit: Oh I forgot about itemization as well. So compared to League, Dota items are powerful and unique. Depending on your item choices, you can become a support/healer, cc master, initiator, counter initiator, damage dealer, super mobile, etc. Because of our stat system, every item can be used by every hero to some extent. That isn't to say there aren't suboptimal routes or choices. But you can be a support in Dota and halfway through the game say to yourself, "Oh shit, our carry isn't going to have enough damage for the late game. Maybe I'll pick up some items to help semi-carry." Similarly, your carry can say, "Oh shit I'm really getting shut down, maybe I'll just pick up some utility items so I can be useful and get off a spell or two and rely on my teammates to do the damage." This kind of flexibility is amazingly fun (but admittedly daunting to newer players).","depth":6,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bvanplays","name":"t1_cs8zccf","parent_id":"t1_cs8y7rg","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434527878,"created_utc":1434499078}
{"body":"Thanks for the answer. That's about what I imagined the difference would be. Mainly with the variety of lane setups and a heavy emphasis on your draft that doesn't involve just picking OP champs, and playing to one of the 4 or 5 viable win conditions in league. 		I've been pretty annoyed with League's design for a while, mainly the shift towards an inability to snowball early leads into a win if your team composition doesn't scale well, as well as the general inconsistency in how certain abilities work. League's balance as of late (last couple seasons really) has basically screwed over ADCs which is really frustrating as I heavily prefer playing high damage roles, but League's meta since season 3 has just rotated between tanky champions that can solo ADCs, heavy poke teams where the ADC has to sit around until a fight starts and dodge every skillshot or lose 3/4 of your health, and finally assassin metas where you basically just run around with your team trying to not get caught out or flanked by their assassin. Granted it's a fatal flaw of league where it's so easy to kite as a ranged champ that Riot needs to give every melee champion a dash or otherwise just accept that the game will revolve around letting the ADC get 3-4 items and hard carry the game.		Honestly I don't know if I'd enjoy Dota2 should I try to learn it. I should probably just stick to playing Melee which is so much more fun and better designed than League. However, should League's design get much worse I'll probably swing by here and learn DotA.

So obviously it's not that exaggerated, but that's kind of how League feels to me. Yeah it's all actually faster, but it's just usually simple reactions to simple initiations. Nothing exceptionally crazy ever happens to me in League. You just fight well and win, or fight bad and lose. I'm never super caught off guard by anything. I feel like I know pretty much everything that's going to happen, I just need to do it correctly.		I will say though, that fighting in League is pretty fun.

{"body":"Haha I'm not quite sure any two games can truly compare to how different and boring Brawl made competitive smash, but I do like the analogy, and I've used it before to compare Brood War and SC2. The biggest problem with Brawl is that it's a game where you never want to make the first move, and it's near impossible to force them into committing to something. Melee is a game where you still don't necessarily want to make the first move, but you can, and there's a ton of ways to force your opponent into doing something. 		From your fist paragraph you make me want to instead use the analogy of League is Smash 64 and DotA is melee. Smash 64 is not a bad game, it's a pretty fun game, but at high levels the game is incredibly repetitive and there's very little variation in combos, and in your general gameplan. The movement system isn't particularly complex, 90% just dashing around, and then once you find a hit, you do your combo that your opponent pretty much can't get out of, and hopefully they're dead. Simple, but fun. Then of course DotA being melee would be that Melee has so much more depth. Just using 3 of Melee's many additions, those being trajectory DI, shields being usable, and wavedashing, makes the game incredibly complex, and even 14 years later we're being amazed by players doing things we didn't think were humanly possible. 		But that's just going off your first paragraph and my limited knowledge of DotA. It's also hard to compare the two genres.

If you flash away your opponent will just flash after you.

{"body":"> its like saying soccer is harder then Baskettball because in Baskettball you are allowed to take the ball into your hand		Ahh but this is true to some extent. Even though your opponents also get the easier mechanics, does not mean that the game won't overall *feels* easier and therefore is easier for people to get into. Basketball might be a bad example because it has so many other mechanics (dribbling), but have you ever played Handball? It's essentially soccer but you can pickup the ball (I played back in primary school). And while everyone can pickup the ball so it's no big deal, it is essentially easier to get into than soccer. People are less likely to break rules, more likely to have control of the ball right off the bat, etc.		Now this doesn't mean you can't be challenged, or that the skill ceiling is lower. Just like in Dota, no matter how good or bad you are, as long as you use matchmaking you should be having a similar experience as far as "difficulty" goes. The same is true of League.		Perhaps I'm not using the best terminology. Maybe I should say that League is less mechanically frustrating? But I do like how you mention how far you can extend and I think that's a good example of the differences. If we talk about initiation range in League, how far is it? Including Flash, and assuming abilities are hit, Malphite/Amumu off the top of my head have maybe the longest range powerful initiation? (I'm not counting TF/Nocturne since they can't really start fights by going in themselves against 5. Even though they're pseudo global.) So their initiation range is about... half a screen? Compare this to Dota, where including Blink Dagger and hitting spells, people are initiating from a screen away if not further (Clockwerk). You can be under you tower with 5 heroes missing and you're still out of position if you don't know better.		Things like that are really difficult for newer players to deal with. Yes it's essentially just changing the boundary for where "out of position" is, but people are going to learn the League one easily, and still be confused about exactly where is safe for Dota.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bvanplays","name":"t1_cs8yk3n","parent_id":"t1_cs8xs75","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434526464,"created_utc":1434497664}

It's easier to improve (and know you're improving) in League, particularly if you're not extensively reading about the game or critically watching pros or streams. If I'm going to smurf in a League game, my goal is probably going to be killing my opponent in lane as many times as possible. In DotA, I **might** try to kill my lane opponent, but depending on what hero I'm playing as/against, it might be more advantageous for me to just completely ignore my lane opponent in the name of farming, or stacking, or taking the tower without bothering to kill them. There's more variance to the flow of the game, and the most optimal path to winning can be less clear.

{"body":"I played LoL for a couple of years before I switched over to DOTA and I had substantially less to think about in LoL. I always liked the idea of helping my team so I would always play Jungle or Support. Jungling in LoL was so easy so long as you could remember the respawn timers for the "get buff, go gank" neutrals. All I had to do was pick a jungler which could clear the neutrals faster than my opponent and I could guarantee a lead that I could hold for a few minutes without even trying. Then it was just a matter of getting behind a target, shitting stuns onto them and right clicking. 		"But what about wards?" I hear you ask "Wouldn't they shit on all of that?" 		No, not really. Wards were generally place in the exact same spot every game with very few people deviating from it because "It's the meta, noob" which meant finding the one ward they have near their lane instantly and getting rid of it was trivial. Kill ward, walk away from lane for a couple of seconds, walk back, hide, gank. 		Playing hard support was also easier. I never had to think about pulling/stacking a camp to help my carry because that simply didn't (doesn't?) happen in LoL. All I had to think about was throwing down wards, not running into bushes, making sure my carry didn't die by spamming my heal and stay at the back of fights. 		What made me leave was that every match started to look and feel the same. What didn't help with this was the outright refusal of the community to deviate from the pre-defined meta and Riot started making new heroes and changing old ones to fit neatly into that meta. Something like Carry Jungle Crystal Maiden wouldn't happen in LoL because "She's a support. She sits in lane, helps her carry get farm and dies in two hits. As such, we've removed her DoT damage completely but left the stun intact". Boring.Let people branch out and do crazy shit.

Riot is still making champions, for instance, while Dota 2 is focusing on fine tweaking the balance of characters.

It had like a dozen ridges going across the map horizontally, you picked your "hero" (typical Marine, Sniper, Wraith, etc. choices) who could use some special abilities, the armor/weapons upgrades, and general rpg-ish gametype things you would expect.  All the ridges were heavily fortified and your "base" was separated from the "beachhead" by water.		As you killed units you got money and could buy backup units and dropships (like squads of snipers, marines, battlecruisers, etc), and whenever you pushed past like 1-2 ridges the enemy would counterattack with massive waves of units.		If I remember, you had like 3 or 5 lives on the Hero unit before perma death, and 3 hours to complete it before you lost because the enemy received "overwhelming reinforcements" or whatever (but really it just went to the game over screen).		Man that shit got so hectic, towards the last few ridges everyone needed to load up dropships with dozens of fodder-units and assault them from both ends at once to split the hordes, but that was one of my favorite maps.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"carorea","name":"t1_cs8v7d1","parent_id":"t1_cs8v05k","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434520741,"created_utc":1434491941}

The way it was set up made it difficult for new mods to gain traction, so everyone playing custom games was just playing the oldest/most popular ones.

{"body":"The year is 3067. The human race has expanded its horizons to interstellar travel. We currently occupy various stars in our Milky Way. The cutting edge of science is now focusing on intergalactic travel, and there have been some very promising breakthroughs.			It's been exactly 300 years since VALVE's acquisition of NASA. EG.Universe's space creation started it all, and now, the Source 2 engine, in addition to the advances in the Kerbal Space Program were just too much for NASA to compete with. I stood at the window staring outside my pod on the space shuttle, into the vast nothingness of space and time, until a green sliver slowly emerged from the darkness. In a matter of minutes it turned into a crescent, and not too long after, a large sphere, seemingly just a couple hundred yards away, stood before me. 			"What a beautiful view of planet N77-XC011," I thought to myself. "So desolate, yet so full of potential."			As I walked away from the window to grab some breakfast, a breaking news report flashed on the Big Picture screen: "Valve announces insufficient funds to continue its intergalactic travel program." 			I wasn't sure what to make of this at first. "Was this ever going to be achieved in my lifetime anyways?" I turned off the screen and left to the rotunda of the space shuttle. To my surprise, I saw a large mob of angry people gathering in what seemed to be a protest.			"Come get your pitchforks!" one angry teen shouted. "What happened with all the compendium money VALVE?!" another yelled. Apparently, VALVE had not been diverting the 25% of compendium revenue into intergalactic travel as promised, or so people say.			Not caring much, I went back into my pod and went to sleep. 			It didn't take too long until I was awakened by a high pitched screech. Sirens were howling, the halls were dark, only  briefly iluminated by synchronized flashes of red lights. Apparently, a Riot had broken out and there the main hull of the space shuttle was damaged. Men everywhere were scrambling chaotically. Women and children sat in corners, Thumping their Bibles. A few young protesters could be seen trying to tear down a statue of Gabe Newell. Sacrilage.			Panicking, I ran towards my room, and hopped into my travel pod. It was already set to evac mode. I pushed the launch button. Soon enough, I was seemingly free floating in space with no clear destination. The eerie silence of space, nothing but darkness, the endless void. "This is the end," I thought to myself. A montage of all the good memories--all the great things in life--flashed before me. The +25 mmr's, the hats, the Merlini trance streams, the ODPixel casts, intelectual Twitch chat, Lumi's unparelleled insight, soon to be but a memory now. It was becoming stuffy; hard to beathe. The oxygen meter read "CRITICAL." I felt myself fall asleep, but this was no ordinary sleep; I knew I would not awaken from this slumber. 			I let my self slowly fade away...			........				"Hey! Can you hear me?" 	He's awake! He's awake!"			A blurry image before my eyes... "Wh... Where am I?"			"Don't worry about that. I can't believe you're alive."			Time passed, I found myself weak, hardly able to move. Things cleared up now, I can make some semblence of a person's sillehoutte across the room. "What happened? where am I?"			"You're at Riot." Said the voice.			"Riot? What? What the hell is that?"			It didn't take long until I felt goose bumps all over my body. Intractable nausea, a piercing headache; I felt my insides burn, I felt like I was being turned inside out. I wanted to cease to exist.			"YOU BASTARDS! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!"			"Relax!" The voice demanded. "IceFrog has been using all the compendium funding to fuel his Immortality Machine." Said the mysterious voice.			"What the hell are you talking about?" I demanded answers. Nothing made sense. "Immortality machine?" I thought to myself. For generations, we were convinced that IceFrog is in a cryopreservation state, some even believed that he was nothing but a man who enjoyed wearing extravagant suits centuries ago, and has been deceased for long.			"Do you really think DotA 2 would be alive for this long if IceFrog was still not leading its development? Look at what happened to all of VALVE's other games."  			I thought about it for some time. CS: Interstellar Offensive turned into a Star Wars single player game and its player base slowly dwindled. Half-Life 2 died out, as its elements seemed too ancient for the modern gamer, and there was no mention of Half-Life 3 on the horizon. Team Fortress 3 was banned after an interactive virtual reality bug caused three players to be killed. Yet, out of all of VALVE's games, Dota 2 not only endured the test of time, but continues to grow. 			"How could this be?" I asked myself.			"Think of the only difference between Dota 2 and VALVE's other games. It's IceFrog," the mysterious voice exclaimed, as if he heard my thoughts. Things started making sense. IceFrog must still exist and is actively shaping Dota 2. But how? How could a mere human live for so long?			"Where do you think your immortal IV treasures have been for the past 420 years? He's been recycling YOUR immortals for charms all this time, and all of you chumps did nothing but bought into his 'polishing' excuse! Generation after fucking generation, you all just did nothing but wait for your fucking immortals to be polished!"			In a moment that seemed like an eternity, an epiphany dawned on me. "Could this really be? We've been scammed all this time?"			I turned towards the mysterious voice. The room was still dark. He had a tall slender sillehoutte, and almost seemed to float in his place. "Who are you exactly? Why are you helping me?"			"I am the Oracle," but now they call me "Bard."			"Yes, I remember you."			"Peeeeew." A loud noise zoomed across room and suddenly, the oracle was struck down. Half his body lay in the light, he appeared more frail and ill than I remember him. He was profusely bleeding. As I quickly ran to him, a voice shouted, "Thanks for standing still, wanker!" I glanced over my shoulder only to see a small figure in the shape of a man run off in the distance while shouting "HoHo, HaHa."			"Y-- You must infiltrate VALVE's headquarters, divert the compendium sales into intergalactic travel like they were meant to be." He muttered. 			"How am I to do this? I'm in another sector of the Galaxy. How do I even get to VALVE's realm?"			The Oracle waved his hand as if with a magical gesture, only to have the rest of the room illuminate. At the opposite end of the room a narrow hallway revealed itself. At the end of this hallway was a small, yet fierce-appearing space shuttle. It sat there dormant, but appeared to wait to serve a specific purpose.			"That... That is one of VALVE's own spaceships that never made it out of beta. Take it to their own sector, you will find your purpose there."			"How do I get there Oracle?" I anxiously asked.			"Here, take this paper, safeguard it with your life. It contains the launch codes for the ship," he feebly uttered.			I fumbled as I tried unwrapping the paper. After what seemed like an eternity, the paper opened staring up at me, and there was the code in my fingertips. 			"Kappa" it read.			"Kappa?" There was an errie familiarity with this. It's as if I lived with this term every day in a previous lifetime. 			"Oracle! What is Kappa? Is this the code?"			As he lay there dying, he said, "Yes, but you must make sure to enter it in the language of the machine."			"How? Oracle! What must I do? Please, your death will not be in vain."			I could tell he struggled to utter the last words. "Kappa equals... Grey... Face... no space."			He never spoke again~","depth":0,"score":303,"ups":303,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"WindsoftheNorth","name":"t1_cs8xgji","parent_id":"t3_3a34fb","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434524524,"created_utc":1434495724}

{"body":"They made it so custom lobbies could no longer exist, you clicked play and Blizzard made the lobby and put whoever else hit play into it, and auto started the game.  		This made it very hard to actually play/beat hard custom maps that require vets because you often get new people, no time to explain anything, and a lot of times people who tried it for the first time would just leave after a few minutes.  You can't remake the lobby either because you will often get different players and run into the same issues.  		In Wc3 you could put your own title and indicate whether new players etc, where ok to join, or if you only wanted pros.  You also had time to make sure everyone knew what the map was about since you controlled the start time as host and could ask them in advance.  Also if someone dropped out/rage quit you could remake the lobby and kick people until the original group was back in. 		The biggest issue however, was that they rank maps by popularity and list them in order, on pages.  This is really bad design, one example is in Wc3 I used to play some battle/space command game that a very few people hosted and would always fill, but only maybe 5-10 games a day would this map actually be played.  However when I saw it hosted I knew I could join and expect to play it, so I kept an eye out between Dota or LOTR maps.  In Sc2 you have no idea if anyone that is on wants to play them, and the only way to check is to afk in the lobby and hope it fills up.  However if the game is only played a few times total a day, it will be very deep in the pages list, and most people stop looking after 3-5 pages because they know it won't fill up anyway, so why bother.  		This really kills off any game that is decently hard/niche because it will never get popular enough to establish a real fanbase.  For example, if only 5 out of 100 people enjoy game X, but it gets voted down because the other 95 don't enjoy it during the testing phase, although it might be the best Niche custom map ever created, it won't become popular and simply die out because it never gets any exposure.  In Wc3 you can just keep refreshing your lobby to fill it up, because a lot of people enjoyed testing new stuff and the user base for good maps would gradually increase over time.","depth":2,"score":63,"ups":63,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Esg876","name":"t1_cs8ut7r","parent_id":"t1_cs8u6nu","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434520100,"created_utc":1434491300}

{"body":"Okay so ranked and normal matchmaking have separate matchmaking pools and game modes available. Unranked has 'fun' stuff like Ability Draft and All Random Deathmatch, where as Ranked is for more serious play and only has All Pick and Captain's Mode available.		You gain access to Ranked when your account reaches level 13. This isn't very hard (Typically 50-100 points from each match, you level up at 1000 points) and is meant to dissuade smurfs. You'll unlock it after about 30 games. Keep in mind that Dota account level beyond that point is entirely meaningless and does not confer any bonuses or abilities. Every single hero is free from the start and there are no rune pages or what not.		Once you gain access to Ranked, you are assigned an MMR number based on 10 calibration matches you play. The equivalent of Diamond would be around 4000-5000 in Dota. Every ranked match you win or lose will change your MMR by around 25 points. 		If you're looking to dip your toes in the water or even make the jump, good luck and have fun! It's incredibly different from LoL and will probably be the most challenging and rewarding video game experience you will ever play. But there's a reason why people have stuck with the game for over 10 years, and it's because this damn game is fun as fuck.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AGVann","name":"t1_cs90irt","parent_id":"t1_cs8yfz8","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1434530023,"created_utc":1434501223}

{"body":"The salt is so strong in your post. Let the tears flow my friend. Dota 2 smaller fanbase, less known, boring gameplay, League leading the way for MOBAs in eSports. Oh you have a big prize pool, that'll be great when no one is watching pro Dota games. League championship has considerably more viewers and always will because Dota is just irrelevant to everyone but Valve fanboys.

{"body":"Haha. You are swimming in ignorance. League championships has more viewers...because it has a way larger fan base. Percentage wise, far more of the dota fanbase follows its competitive scene. Also just continue to ignore the fact that your own people are trash talking league. And you keep saying dota people are trash talking league...I mean, let's just take a look at your comments. Isn't league a far more relevant game?  I mean why are you coming down to our level?  In one of your comments you even say us dota players make fun of league because we are "insecrue" about ourselves. Ironic.  Keep talking about player base as if it matters though!  At this point, that is all league has.  Unfortunately player base =/= quality of game.
