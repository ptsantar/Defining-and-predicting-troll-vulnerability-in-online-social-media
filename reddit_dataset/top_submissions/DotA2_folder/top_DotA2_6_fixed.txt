Also I think I should really work on improving my mapwide presence as my team has for the fourth time in a row failed to capitalize on the entire enemy team focusing a single lane and just kind of end up idling for several minutes in a row before the enemy team finally comes in to pick up the free food.

{"body":"Lol, yes, even when you are winning your lane, but it has gone horribly wrong in the other two lanes, they will blame you for not building spiderlings.		If you are not luring 2-3 of their players to your lane, you need to punish them by pushing down the first tower, which is easily done by using your ultimate on it. Even though you don't get life steal, it does a lot of extra damage and its not a large cooldown.		Sometimes you need to switch lanes to help your teammates. I am not entirely sure when because in pub games their is generally very little team communication. You do have to remember that there will be a lot of enemy heroes hiding around the other lane and they are very confident because they have been winning. Broodmother does a lot better when they are afraid of you and they try to run. So, you have to play more defensively, when you help your team in another lane, letting your teammates set the pace of the engagement and jump in with your Incapacitating Bite to disable the enemy heroes right-click with miss chance debuff.

Arena dims and deadmouse  drops a single flat note electronica for 1 minute and the crowd goes silent. Hardest buzz kill I've ever seen. Most awkward silence I've ever heard.

{"body":"It IS simpler, but theyre still very different games. If you try to start out on league, transitioning to Dota will be hard. They way the two games are played are close but still very different. Many dota skills have cast times, stuns are longer, there are more disables, and the differences between hero speed, attack range, cast speed are way more spread then in League. League tends to favor instant cast ultimates and abilites which make many spells near impossible to dodge and makes team fights seem really dogpilish and quick even though the pace of the actual game is very slow. Dota has a faster pace but because of the intricacies of cast time-spell travel time you can have more time to react to disjoint the spell (preventing the spell from hitting you), or nullify it completely with items or spells. I have to say, having played both extensively that the concensus in both dota and league is that league has a horrible understanding of how to balance champions. 		For instance during this international, Shadow Fiend had a 40% win rate even though he was banned/picked in most games and picked 47 times in competitive play. The biggest issue was that Shadow Fiends ultimate (a large aoe damage spell based on his collected souls from creep kills) has a cast time (1.67seconds) that can be interrupted. This led one of the single strongest Shadow Fiend players to have issues getting off his ultimate during the teamfights and when he finally did get it off the majority of the time it would only hit 1 enemy hero. Shadowfiend still autoattacks like a truck, but a large portion of his ability comes from cleaning up after a well placed ulti. If Riot had balanced him, you can bet that his ult would be instant and that he would be deemed toxic and then they would just nerf his damage until people stopped complaining.		 TLDR: Dota has higher preventable damage, Riot has lower unpreventable damage.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ibattlemonsters","name":"t1_ctxownf","parent_id":"t1_ctxnfn1","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439214489,"created_utc":1439185689}
