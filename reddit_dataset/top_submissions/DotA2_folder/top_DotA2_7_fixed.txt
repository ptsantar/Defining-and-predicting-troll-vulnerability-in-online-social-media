I assumed one will go jungle, so I bought wards and blocked camps. LC went into jungle, found nothing, rotated to offlane, pudge moved from offlane to mid and alch went jungle at about 3-4 minutes, which I re-warded... We won, not without some trouble, but alch had almost nothing, I was happy and proud until I watched a replay.		Alch was the retarded one, and not in a ha-ha way, but pretty sad, and LC was pretty good. By pushing them around I made other two lanes harder.
