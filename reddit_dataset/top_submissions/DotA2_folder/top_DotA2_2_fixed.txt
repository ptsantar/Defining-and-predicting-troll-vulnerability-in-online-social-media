Just interview random people on the top100 of each region for your team, which is a better way to recruit people than just swapping the same people between the same teams.		But here's the problem. PPD is the team captain and EG's sponsors don't care about it unless he actually becomes a liability big enough so that EG won't make it into the public. That gives him freedom enough to manage the team however he wants, eventhough he's completely worthless for EG.		Seriously, watch EG replays. I don't understand how PPD manages to do nothing all game long without taking shit from anyone.

{"body":"Honestly it's a douche move especially without seeing any performance dip and I feel like it would make more sense around New Years but I'm assuming they're taking the perspective of getting worse with no change.

I'm not trying to justify it but give at least a reason why. Personally I think it's too early to make that decision as to the fact they don't know if aui will thrive or die in a new meta and they don't know who the weakest link will be.

{"body":"PPD said Aui was simply the best option they could get before DAC.  Maybe he was never a permanent solution.		I am an Aui fan but maybe PPD thought the advantages of having Aui's heropool would be lessened as teams figure out how to deal with Techies.  I think CDEC just didn't feel comfortable to Naga as well and it's a bit dangerous to field a "weaker" team out of goodwill.		PPD also said Aui talks too much to his liking during matches.  This was early when Aui joined EG but there are chemistry issues to consider as well.		In the long run, EG knows they are getting a great carry in Artour.

{"body":"[**FROM THE POD STREAM: THE MOMENT THEY JUST WON TI ... MUCH TEAM SPIRIT**](http://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_pod_1/v/10167051?t=8h24m30s)		This would be some of the most cold-blooded shit ever done to someone if true. Results are results, they won the biggest thing to win with him. 		On the other hand, maybe he wasn't getting along with everyone else? Does Universe have no say in this as his close friend? It didn't seem to affect their performance even though their final "celebration" suggested they weren't really all that close in terms of love and friendship.		BUT WHAT THE FUCK, YOU WON THE WHOLE THING WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK		EDIT: okay so apparently Fear agreed/wanted to move to support taking Aui's spot, allowing Arteezy to return to carry. You can't kick Fear who IS EG at this point, so that leaves Aui as the odd man out. Maybe Fear can't physically play carry any more with his arm ailing him, so playing support is more viable?		[Charlie's tweet](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn8s65):		>Rather than have people speculate or message players for answers, I'm going to go ahead and announce the new EG Dota 2 roster: Sumail, Universe, Fear, PPD, and Arteezy. 		>Yes, Kurtis was removed from the roster. **The rest of the players decided that the above roster was what they wanted to go forward with.** 		>Personally, I'm deeply affected by this and I'm very sad to see Kurtis go. I've known him the longest out of anyone on the team. He was the one that originally asked me to be the manager for Potm Bottom years ago, and I cannot state enough how depressed I am to see him go. I cannot imagine how much worse he feels.		>Professionally, I trust the judgment of the captain and the other players. I will not make roster decisions on their behalf and I will not force players to play on rosters they don't want to play on. EG is deeply grateful to Kurtis for what he has helped contribute, and will continue to support him in whatever he decides to do and wherever he decides to go.

TI5? Goodbye Lesh, Gyro, Lina, Tusk, and Bounty Hunter. Will any of them be picked at TI6? Naga probably gets the Batrider treatment. Techies? Major nerfs.  		Icefrog will force teams and strategies to change. I would guess after TI5 he would look for ways to diminish the mid role, somehow make it less impactful in games.

EG keeping as much of this team together going into next year's Majors is the best thing for Dota growing as an E-Sport. Breaking it up this quickly is kind of nuts. 		I guess that's not a fair statement. PPD/EG have every right to make EG the best team possible.

Fnatic get Rekkles back as he's a definite upgrade over their old ADC, but the community is outraged. "Why change roster?  #keepsteelback".  Everyone assumed it was Rekkles begging to come back etc.  Turns out it was pretty much the team captain (Yellowstars) choice. Everyone predicted Fnatic to fuck up and end in the lower part of the standings, and every other prediction on this thread sounds very similar to what everyone said about Fnatic/Rekkles. Fnatic went and had a perfect 18-0 split.		I guess it's a little different, because aui_2000 is an excellent player, unlike what steeelback was (he's good, but not Rekkles good).

{"body":"This is pretty shocking. It seems pretty cold blooded from EG's end and I do feel for Aui as he has been such a big part of EG's success this year and he clearly did not see this coming. At the same time though, I am trying to understand this from EG's point of view and though it is technically a "kick", it seems more like a business or professional decision. They wanted RTZ and that was that. Given the chance to reunite SADBOYS as much as possible and given the chance to have a more matured RTZ to play with players he clearly have respect for, especially Fear, it seems like Aui was just the odd man out. We all know Fear has a massive hero pool and tons of experience in different roles so it just seems like EG did the math and decided that if they needed to swap anyone to get RTZ, Aui was the best candidate. 		It is hard not to mix emotions in to all of this but at the end of the day, this is what E-sports has become what with 18 million dollar prize pools at stake. It has become thoroughly a profession. I think its important to understand this. No other professional team in the world in any type of sport would not do the same thing given the opportunity to get one of the best, if not the best player in his position (carry-mid), to join their team. Hope Aui recovers from this quickly, doesn't take it too personal, and gets a new top tier team ASAP.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thecurls23","name":"t1_cu3m721","parent_id":"t3_3h1uco","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439641715,"created_utc":1439612915}

{"body":"Well, we wanted be a professional sport. This is what you get.		It's not too much of a stretch to say Arteezy was the best and most versatile carry at the tournament. Seemed like even with Secret getting beaten he always almost won games by himself. Fear is a really solid player but certainly not the best carry out there. With a chance to get arguably the best carry in the world on your team it seems like a pretty business savvy move. Not only is RTZ marketable as a player but you can't kick the best offlaner in NAdota or the wonder kid or the captain or the guy who has basically been the face of dota and EG forever. 		With esports growing exponentially you are going to see more consolidation of talent to try and win titles. It happens in baseball  (Yankees dodgers) basketball (all the top teams) and just about every other pro sport. Even the Champions trade or drop pieces of their teams to free up space for new prospects or even bigger talent.		That said, fuck big market sports teams and the lack of loyalty in favor of money. Let's see an EE, aui, Dendi, Kuro and Puppey team crush everyone.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Zylence","name":"t1_cu3kg6h","parent_id":"t3_3h1uco","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439637880,"created_utc":1439609080}
{"body":"Yeah, ok, so drama. Great. Enough about that. 		This makes EG a worse team.  No way around it.  Fear is going to just casually transfer to support role after years of being a carry and at this point in his career?  Not only that but he's going to perform anywhere close to Aui's level?  I don't think so.  		They basically traded a tier 1 carry and support for a tier 1 carry and unproven support.  Who does that?  		Getting back into the drama and speculation now, but I think this is the EG core saying, we won TI.  That's enough.  Now we just want to have fun and not care about winning so much.  		We'll see how it works out but I think this is pretty bad for the pro Dota scene when your best team actively stops trying to get better competitively.  It just screams of a lack of professionalism in the sport.  Personally, I would like to see players contracted to teams going forward to put an end to this random game of musical chairs and the constant drama that goes with it.  		I know this won't be received well here.  The drama is part of the scene and part of what the fans love, but I honestly don't think it's sustainable. I think this kind of unpredictability at the very top turns a lot of people away.  I also think that the people who enjoy this kind of drama will eventually grow out of that interest and move on to other things.  Of course, then again maybe the players will grow out of that stage as well.   At some point the sport will need to mature if it ever wants to be more than just a passing fad.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rookwood","name":"t1_cu3kg81","parent_id":"t3_3h1uco","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439637882,"created_utc":1439609082}

They forget to pull, they don't call out item progressions on the other team, they don't know how to zone out the offlaner without dying or throwing off lane equilibrium, they don't warn the cores of someone missing, they don't have wards/tangoes/smokes/etc. when they should, they don't know who to send where when the other team is pressing two different towers, etc.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PingHigh","name":"t1_cu56otj","parent_id":"t1_cu562hl","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439786830,"created_utc":1439758030}

{"body":"definitely a justifiable move if true. I've been thinking before TI finals that Aui was actually getting carried by EG. post would get downvoted and no decent argument tho so I deleted the post before sending it.		I was predicting 2 things, one is that CDEC actually just hit their sweet spot at this TI and they will not be a big contender for future majors. other point is that aui wasn't doing that much in EG wins. if you pay attention, all he does is take the farm and do his own things with naga and techies, even wasting lvl 1 sleep with big cd to escape from a solo "gank" where he wasn't in any kind of danger and not having it for the next team fight. then he takes away alot of the available/safe farm to build teamfight items then failed to participate in the fights quite alot of the times. also people in this thread say "he's forcing 2 respect bans on HIS naga and techies" which is also not true, ANYONE would be able to play the same lvl of techies as aui, maybe even better.		that's the first part of what make me think aui was average in EG: his outstanding performances are actually not that special. now's the second part: in games where EG was struggling, what does he provide? he feeds. he's just a farming support. a greedy one. that's it. he operates on "single player" hero like naga, techies, BH, etc where he just goes and does his own things while the team provides space for him. when those options are not available, he doesn't gank or countergank or anything to bring the game back in his favor. show me a moment of aui creating a gank or a save that turn around a game. i can't recall one.		I feel like aui's strongest point is his tricks. he dwells alot into the mechanical side of things, he knows all the tricks in the book like jungling kotl, naga walking thru ice shard's hole, elder titan movement trick with spirit stomp, etc. but he doesn't have the EARLY GAME IMPACT like other prominent supports do, proven by the fact that most of EG's early kills come from their cores outplaying the enemies or ppd's tp counterganks, not planned ganks by the support","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"raizen0106","name":"t1_cu3j2i1","parent_id":"t3_3h1uco","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439635168,"created_utc":1439606368}

So now that Secret disbanded (we'll assume) Arteezy is a free agent and given his location and all that he is very convenient for EG. EG therefore has a choice, stick with their current lineup, or change Aui for Arteezy and then move Fear to support. The single thing it ultimately comes down to is which one of Aui or Arteezy they POSSIBLY can have most success with (given that Fear's support is as good as his carry, which it is I think). Going for the "safe" choice of Aui just because it is safe and sentimental is just stupid and illogical, if your goal is to stay as the #1 in a competitive environment like this.		So all of you who say that it is "cruel" or "unfair", don't know what it's like to compete at the highest level of something.

If you set out to climb mount everest, and you break your leg halfway up there because you didn't get the right boots, but you still manage to climb the mountain, everyone would think "wow he climbed mount everest". They don't know you broke your foot, they don't know what compromises you had to make, what quick-fixes you had to improvise over your previous ones and how different it all was.		We can always do better. Even if EG is/was the top team at that moment in time, if you see potential to be greater, you wanna take it. This is competetive sport after all.		Aui could be the best player in the world and you can still find arguments to replace him, such as synergy with the team - the players need to bounce off of each others strength and make up for others weaknesses. The pieces need to click right into each other, rather than have some hollow weakness between them that keeps you awake at night in fear someone may find out.		I ask you, what would the alternative be?	If they believe they can be a better team with fear and ppd as support duo (who have been on the same team forever, but regardless - IF THEY BELIEVE) would you rather they don't try it because aui helped them so much? That's not just a wasted opportunity for them, but also disrespectful to aui. "We only keep you because you helped us so much, even though we think we could do better without you".

In turn, that must mean that Aui was, indeed, the problem. 		Otherwise, the other 4 wouldn't want him gone and, finally, otherwise, the Team Manager wouldn't make this choice if it wasn't absolutely necessary.

The only thing I find weird is that arteezy said he wanted to play mid, and if  he's replacing Fear as carry, with Fear going to position 4.

I doubt we'd be up in arms as much. But, either way, it's a business decision to ensure that EG keeps winning as many tournaments as possible in the limited time they have to be a superior team.

{"body":"A few things essentially drive this (one or any combo of these):		1. Salary caps.   Players in their final year of contract after winning a championship are more desirable to teams looking for 'winners'.   This drives the value of the championship winning player upwards to the point of their current team being unable to compete salary-wise without sacrificing personnel elsewhere (aka making room).		2. Performance.   Did the player perform to the level expected?  If not, why not let them explore other options (or trade them).   Were they instrumental in the organization winning the championship?  Are they at a point in their career where committing to them for another year (or long-term) makes sense to win further championships?   Has this player plateaued and would it be best to cash-out on them because they will never be more valuable than they are now?		3.  Considering all of the aforementioned, does keeping the player jeopardize the gameplan moving forward in any way/shape/form?   If so, consider unloading them if you're at an impasse.			Professional Dota hasn't reached this level of organization and structure (and it may never "evolve" to that point).    In that regard, it isn't "apples to apples" when comparing these shuffles to professional sports.   Some Dota players/teams seem to have much more autonomy in the business-impacting decision making process, which is flatly not the case in professional sports.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"paenultimus","name":"t1_cu3re4y","parent_id":"t1_cu3pvu5","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1439659396,"created_utc":1439630596}

Aui has encountered similar situations before and has done nothing but improve himself and the situation he finds himself in each successive season.    I have no doubt that he will do the same this year.		I thought EG was one of the luckiest teams to pick him up from Cloud9 (what the fuck were they thinking... chemistry issues were probably elsewhere in the team), and I thought highly of them for realizing his immense talent.		However, EG booting Aui (a HUGE reason they were able to gain advantages in the draft, not even touching upon his stellar play) after winning Ti5 for Arteezy is painfully dumbfounding.   I guess it all boils down to securing spots for the EG players that have seniority, but I don't think it makes a stronger team by any stretch of the imagination (would venture a guess that EG's quality of play and overall ranking will greatly decline).

Judging by those Grand Finals, Aui seemed rather aloof, playing "aui style" doto, often irrelevant beyond some split pushing shenanigans and he felt limited to a handful of comfort picks which seemed to impact EG's ability to draft more flexibly. Apparently EG feels like that's not the kind of 4 position support they need to have to continue to remain successful and a change was made. They believe they'll be in better position to continue raking in millions with him replaced with someone else. We'll certainly see soon enough.

If you didn't see huge squad changes coming then wtf were you expecting post TI? EG would be the least likely to switch up their lineup, but still the potential was too big - every team is making changes, if they want to continue to win, they are going to face new drafts and team makeups and EG obviously feels that AUI won't be effective once all the teams swapping players is over.		It's their call as a company that makes TONS of money off their brand and image. There is much bigger things at work here than just kicking a player. A BUSINESS team sat down to decide this and you need to take that into consideration. IT's not them wiping their feet at the door with Aui, rather them playing corporate magnate and doing what they know will work best to earn more money - and that's for THEM, not the players, although obviously it earns them more if the players do well and keep their name up with the top dogs. The only person who can 4 role better than Aui is probably Fear anyway due to his experience. So it makes sense that way too.

If I had to kick someone, I would probably picked Aui too.  (emphasis on "had to").  Don't get me wrong, Aui is a great player.  But from an orgnization point of view you are trying to trade for a better team.  They clearly wanted rtz that bad, going to the point of switching fear off to a support position.  		On the other hand, doing this really damages morale.  The team is going to feel shit as it is more so obvious that they are just expendable pawns to the orgnization, and that profit > friendship.  Even if they are mature enough to understand and accept this, it's still a blow to their conscience.		Alas, it is not my place to judge whether the decision is wise.

And them I saw that RTZ might be rejoining EG, and it kind of clicked.	If we are honest about it, RTZ really needs his space to farm when he is playing carry, and whenever Puppet played a jungler we saw RTZ falter a bit. Now imagine how much of an issue that would be with Aui_2000, one of (if not the) greedily position 4s in the game. Their styles just wouldn't mesh at all, and would likely be an unmitigated disaster.		Aui worked well with Fear because he was more of a traditional lane ancient and kill/gank carry, and only really relied on the jungle for certain heroes. Artour seems to always include the jungle in his farm rotations, regardless of the hero he plays, and this is likely a carry over from when he played a farming mid that would hit jungle stacks between waves.
