{"body":"Here's the thing. You said an "aubergine is an eggplant."	Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.	As someone who is a scientist who studies eggplants, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls aubergines eggplants. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.	If you're saying "eggplant family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Solanaceae, which includes things from potatoes to wolfberriess to tobacco.	So your reasoning for calling an aubergine an eggplant is because random people "call the purple ones eggplants?" Let's get blackberries and cabbage in there, then, too.	Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. An aubergine is an aubergine and a member of the eggplant family. But that's not what you said. You said an aubergine is an eggplant, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the eggplant family eggplants, which means you'd call potatoes, tomatoes, and other plants eggplants, too. Which you said you don't.	It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?","depth":8,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Golblin","name":"t1_ctj4u6m","parent_id":"t1_ctj3j50","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1438129877,"created_utc":1438101077}

{"body":"She's just arrogant and willfully blind to an extent that it annoys me. I'm not saying she's a badly written character, just that I want to strangle her.		The prime example of what I mean is the incident on the Kingsroad when the Starks are first traveling to King's Landing. Sansa and Joffrey are riding (and moderately drunk if I remember correctly) when they stumble upon Arya and the butcher's kid "sword fighting" with sticks. Joffrey pulls his actual sword on the butcher's kid, so Arya defends her friend by sending in Nymeria to stop Joffrey. Sansa is immediately angry with Arya for defending him and blames Arya for the whole incident without much justification other than "she shouldn't have been there" even though her betrothed tried to kill Arya's friend.		Later, when questioned, Sansa refuses to actually say what happened because she doesn't want to lose Joffrey's favor over something that is in her mind Arya's fault. Then, when Lady is executed, she once again blames Arya even though Lady was executed as a direct result of her refusal to tell the truth. Arya's friend is chased down and murdered on Joffrey's behalf and Sansa doesn't care because it was his fault for being there.		The detached "nothing is my fault because I'm perfect, it's my sister's because she's a trouble making bitch" attitude is infuriating to me. But to be fair, she is a child and has a childish and selfish mindset. On top of that, she has an over-inflated sense of self-importance due to being proclaimed future queen at the age of 13 and always being touted as the most successful by Septa Mordane.		Once again I'm not saying she's a badly written character, just that she's infuriating. And once again I'm only on the first Novel so she still may develop into a character I can stand.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"t765234","name":"t1_ctli8o2","parent_id":"t1_ctkw6ry","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1438292807,"created_utc":1438264007}
