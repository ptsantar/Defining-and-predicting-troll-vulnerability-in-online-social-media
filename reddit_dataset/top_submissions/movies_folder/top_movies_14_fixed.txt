{"body":"I'll be honest, I only made through 10 minutes of this before shutting it off. I'm all about camp and being over the top, but this is over the top for the sake of being over the top. It feels old and overplayed already. There really isn't much to like about this. It's the loose idea of a parody of 80s action and I keep getting the feeling it tries far too hard to be something funny by just beating a number of overplayed tropes to death in really quite boring and predictable ways. Plus I'm not a fan of how this movie looks at all. I understand the tight budget presented by kickstarter and whatnot but it just looks like crap. I understand the aesthetic feel that it's going for, but it's not translating well at all. Finally, after skipping around a bit and reading the comments here I see the whole David Hasslehoff thing and, in all honesty, it's a major turn off. Hasslehoff is acknowledging the parody of himself and the writers are super acknowledging it  by putting him in there in the first place. It's so stale. Maybe I just don't "get it" anymore, but all of this has been done before and in a far better fashion. Hell, that first fight scene with the arcade machine was possibly one of the lamest things I've seen in a while, and the cuts to make it look like it was a tracking vcr made it less appealing. I'm a fan of being camp and over the top, hell Black Dynamite is one of my favorite movies to watch regularly; that being said this was just absolutely a mediocre and unfocused genre parody.

{"body":"I mean the two films - Black Dynamite and Kung Fury - are both genre parody done in a camp and purposefully "bad" fashion. I feel like, for what it's worth, the two films have a lot more in common than one might think. Do they cover the same material? Not at all, as you've said Fury is 80s action and Dynamite is blaxploitation. However, the way both films are constructed are more similar than one might think. The big difference in that though is that Black Dynamite really commits to not only nailing the feel, but doing so in a seemingly blissfully ignorant way. None of the actors ever feel like, to me, that they're "in on the joke". With Kung Fury, what I'm seeing here, is shallow sketches of what 80s action was sort of like (having seen plenty of 80s action I would know) but every. single. joke. is really nudging you and winking at you. Basically asking "did you get this? Isn't this ridiculous and funny?" It's always telling and not showing, and it assumes that the viewer needs these things to be explained to them even if it's not outright. The foundation of a great genre parody is subtlety. That's why Black Dynamite, Airplane and High Anxiety are great films. This movie could have had a lot of potential, but instead of giving it a real heart and making a much more intelligent effort at constructing a really solid genre parody they went for a hollow outline of trope to make it really "purposefully bad," and when you try hard to make something that way there's a fine line. In this case, again to me, it actually turned out bad.","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rutteh","name":"t1_crotx32","parent_id":"t1_crorkm7","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1432913801,"created_utc":1432910201}
