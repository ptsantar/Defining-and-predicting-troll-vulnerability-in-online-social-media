{"body":"Ah I see it's time for the monthly "What Star Wars behind the scenes photos shall we discuss next" segment. Yes, there might be billions of other movies, yes, yes, the might be trillions better than star wars, but you see, here at reddit, our movie vocabulary is limited to "I know", jar-jar binks impersonations and the delusion that Carrie Fisher was in any point in time "hot". They say that there an infinite number of parallel universes where every single possibility is real within, in NONE of those parallel universes is Carrie Fisher "hot" in any shape of form. Nothing, not even that bikini can cover up that bloated face. 		Because you know, an angel gets gonorrhea every time a star wars fan watches Kurosawa, black flamingos might die upon you discovering Kie??lowski, Sauron himself screams in fear the moment you mention that all Star Wars, prequels and whatnot, all of it is horseshit, complete and utter steaming, solid horseshit compared to what's out there.		But alas, people will bicker about the prequels, will scream and shout and curse at George Lucas "HOW DARE YOU LUCAS, HOW DARE YOU?!?!", even though without the man there would be no star wars to bicker and complain about ...and of course every single new Star Wars thread WILL receive over 10,000 comment until all of these fans.. idk get laid or god forbid outgrow star wars or move on with their lives, which should take until the heat death of the universe!","depth":0,"score":-12,"ups":-12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CalvinbyHobbes","name":"t1_cqrks3f","parent_id":"t3_345jh0","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1430241990,"created_utc":1430238390}

{"body":"Yes, in fact it was raped by Jabba himself. I hate star wars, I hate star wars so much that it gives me energy, I wake up EARLY in the morning to hate start wars because there isn't enough time in the day. I despise that cliche ridden trilogy like a neckbeard hates SJW's, like a russian gay guy hates putin, like a mormon girl hates using the first hole. I HATE IT, I HATE IT, I HATE IT.		And you know why? It has nothing to do with the movies themselves, the movies are fine, it's the people who're fucked. The dissect it and redissect it and reexamine it and come with million possible explanations why the Storm Troopers can't properly aim. To the point where you want to scream on top of your lungs "ITS JUST A FUCKIN MOVIE!!"		But it is THEY who also complain about how every single movie at the theater is either a sequel or reboot or remake. Even though, they're the ones going "Ah Age of Ultron might suck but I'm still gonna see it".		And then they wonder why they is no Kubrick or Hitchcock or Chaplin anymore. NOBODY alright nobody would give Damien the 3 million, just 3 million, he wanted to make Whiplash, it ended up in the blacklist because it wasn't a comic book, star wars, geek oriented flick, and worse of all it was about a *jazz* drummer. You know maybe you could make a movie about a rock drummer, but jazz, cmon!		And while Damien got lucky there are thousands of Kubricks and Kurosawas and Herzogs out there, thousands of filmmakers with complete visions, they only need the money to realize their vision but THEY CANT GET ANY FUNDING because it's all this horseshit that people watch and discuss and then rewatch and then hate but still kinda like.		And yes, I will be downvoted because I'm going against the circlejerk but well as long as people care more about star wars or who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Hulk you can't be surprised if there is nothing on the screen that is new and unique and transformative.","depth":2,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CalvinbyHobbes","name":"t1_cqrmjui","parent_id":"t1_cqrlaho","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1430244710,"created_utc":1430241110}

{"body":"From a purely technical and stylistic perspective, the original trilogy were objectively good movies. Pacing was good, scripting was fine, character development and motivations were clear and understandable. Shot framing was fantastic. These movies are good, despite your hipster-esque claims to the contrary with references to more obscure content.		The prequels were trite drivel.		By the way, you got to see what a movie made purely from Lucas' mind looks like three times in the prequels. The original trilogy had a lot of people working on it, giving a lot of input. Those movies did not spring forth whole from Lucas' head.
