Yes. Do I get offended when someone makes a joke? No. I like laughing, and one of the best way to get through hardship is laughing. 		My condition is luckily solved due to surgery, but my friend will possibly have seizures occur often -without discernible reason -for his entire life. ...and no, him and I don't get offended when seizure jokes occur. If his seizures aren't curable and they continue to persist, he is basically unable to do a lot of basic actions like driving (luckily self driving cars are becoming a thing!), swimming.. anything where him losing momentary control could kill him or someone else. To be fair seizure jokes aren't the most common thing, but neither are rape jokes really. 		The crux of the matter to me, being on topic, is I despise the idea of censorship, so I support the idea that people should be able to joke about whatever they want.

As to limited free speech, that is exactly what people advocate for when they get enraged by something they are offended by and cause a controversy.

I am curious why you chose racism to accuse the video you didn't even watch?

{"body":"Here's some of the really good shit:		Anything **Studio Ghibli** is great.  **Princess Monoke**, **Spirited Away**, **My Neighbour Totoro**, etc.   Disney level quality but with generally more mature themes.  		**Tekkonkinktreet**		**Paprika**		**Cowboy Bebop**		**Samurai Champloo**		**Gurren Lagann**		**Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood**		**FLCL**		**Space Dandy**		**Baccano!**  (No one talks about Baccano! enough.  It's fucking awesome)		The English Dub of **Ghost Stories** (The show was terrible so the people in charge of the English dub were given free reign to do what they liked.  Turned a generic Scooby Doo wannabe into fucked up comedy.) 		**Ghost in the Shell:  Stand Alone Complex**		**Neon Genesis Evangelion**		**Battle Angel Alita**.  It's a miniseries rather than a full show but it's really dope.		I think it's a bit too melodramatic and I think the characters can be a bit wooden but **Attack on Titan** is a pretty cool show.  Just a cool concept with some pretty cool visuals to back it up.  		**Dragon Ball**.  It's not the best anime ever or anything but the characters are all really fun and I actually really like the fightscenes more than **DBZ**.  Sure DBZ is flashier and total eye candy but I always liked the fights when they were less about "power levels" and more about honed skill.  Also Roshi was a bad ass back then.		*These two suggestions are shows that, superficially, put people off initially but are amazing if you give them the chance and accept them for what they are.  Because they're easy to dismiss I'm going to try and sell them harder.  Watch Gurren Lagann first and if you like it give these guys a look-see:*		**Kill La Kill**  A high school girl named Ryuko Matoi, armed with a giant scissor blade and searching for revenge for her father's death, ends up enrolling in a school run by Satsuki Kiryuin and her 4 elite henchmen.  They control the school by handing out super-powered school uniforms to the students (each with different levels of power to dictate different ranks).  Ryoku gets her own suit and goes ham on everyone.  The show's fucking hilarious, has some genuinely touching moments and the action's awesome as hell.  Literally everyone spends the whole show as close to naked as possible though.  EVERYONE.  *General note*:  Unless you have a pathological disdain for subtitles don't watch the dub.  The OTT Original voice over cast is vital for the show to work.  		**Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt**  A comedy series about two angels, Panty and Stocking, who are banished to the mortal realm for generally being total dicks and made to fight ghosts using angelic weapons they produce from their namesakes.  They take their missions from a preist named Garterbelt, who's basically Ice Cube's character from 21 Jump Street but even more batshit and with a killer 'fro.  The show's general animation style's reminiscent of Power Puff Girls but the humour is a bit more adult.  The show actually switches constantly between animation styles giving it a really unique feel (when an enemy is destroyed they become a live action clay model that then proceeds to be blown up.)  	  		**EDIT:  This isn't intended to be a complete list.

{"body":"I dunno, I still think Madoka was more of a deconstruction. Most modern Magical Girl series do feature some heavier themes, death, conflict, emotional distress, etc., so it's true that the tone is maybe not as unique as some people whose only other knowledge of the genre is Sailor Moon might think. But, Madoka is a bit different in that [Madoka spoilers](#s "the conflict is based almost entirely on the gradual downfall of the Magical Girl system itself, instead of malevolent outside forces. There are three main twists instead the show, which occur almost exactly 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of the way through: First, Mami's sudden and unexpected death. This is not entirely a deconstructive development, but I'm pretty sure it's rather unprecedented within the genre to have such an important and standard trope character to die so early (it's not like I've watched every Magical Girl series ever, though, so please don't quote me on that). The second two developments are purely deconstructive, however. Through Sayaka's side story with Kyousuke, we learn that the mechanics of being a Magical Girl are more of a mortal curse than a blessing. And then finally, we learn that Kyubey is the main evil, and that Magical Girls are being harvested for energy through a grotesque cycle of emotional abuse. These two developments stab right at the heart of the Magical Girl genre in a fundamental way. The stereotypical Magical Girl uses her powers as a source of strength, a method for overcoming evil, a force for good in the world. Sometimes there are those who abuse the power of being a Magical Girl, but the moral in the end is always that the power can be a blessing if used with discretion and good intentions. Thus, having the very nature of being a Magical Girl be a curse is deconstructive. Also, the Magical Familiar, one of the most unique hallmarks of the genre, is never supposed to be evil. The Magical Familiar is quite literally what makes the Magical Girl magical, so corrupting that foundational trope is nothing if not a deconstruction. In addition to these major plot developments, I'd say that Madoka's Witches are a sort of deconstruction of the typical Magical Girl fight scene. Most Magical Girl fights are very straightforward spellcasting matches between two opponents. You may not know the exact mechanics of the magic being used, but everything else about them is very simple and easy to understand; both opponents attack and defend in well-defined, telegraphed moves (usually even with attack namr announcements), the scenery is familiar, the stakes are known, and each girls' chance of success is pretty much directly dictated by her magic power. That's not always how it goes, but it's the archetype (and to be honest, I find traditional Magical Girl battle scenes to usually be quite boring, and they're one of my least favorite things about the genre). Contrast this with the domains of the Madoka series' Witches, scenes which are very very obviously animated in such a way that is intended to make the viewer extremely confused and uneasy. The scenery is alien and disoncerting, not just from the perspective of the in-universe characters, but even to the viewer, through the use of highly unconventional animation techniques and surreal art direction. The witches themselves are difficult  to locate, difficult to predict, and have very unclear motives (in the beginning of the series, anyway). Furthermore, Mami's death in Episode 3 shows that battling these Witches can very easily leaf to outcomes that one would not expect based on Magical Girl experience, magic power, or 'plot armor' - the fights are as chaotic and incomprehensible as the scenery. And, to top it all off, traditional Magical Girl battles occur within barriers that keep civilians out, for their own safety, whereas Madoka's Witches live in barriers that are designed to lure cilivians in and trap them. So yeah, I'd consider all that to be a deconstruction of traditional Magical Girl battles. There are probably other, smaller things that you could consider deconstructions of Magical Girl tropes, too, like how Madoka, despite being the main character, spends almost the entire series not being a Magical Girl, whereas the trope is for the main characters to become a Magical Girl right at the beginning of the story, which kicks things off.")","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mirrormn","name":"t1_cr5bn28","parent_id":"t1_cr573mq","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1431336813,"created_utc":1431333213}

And, even with the PTSD, loneliness, and the chat she had with Madoka in the field of flowers earlier in the movie about Madoka's desires and regrets, it didn't feel like it was within Homura's character to *intentionally* take Madoka all for herself. It would have made much more sense, been a more subtle and realistic character development, and led to a more profound overall message to the movie, if the same events had occurred, but with Homura being as surprised by them as Kyubey was. She would reach out for Madoka, ready to experience the Law of Cycles, intending to resolve the conflict of the movie in the most logical and proper way. But then, the weight of the greed in her unconscious self, the anger towards the Kyubey race for not leaving well enough alone, and her countless lifetimes of bitter past experiences would be too heavy for Madoka's saving grace. And then the denouement could proceed exactly like it already did, after Homura realizes how this development brands her as having committed a truly irredeemable sin, but with the power to destroy the Kyubeys and protect Madoka in the manner of Homura's own choosing, she doesn't care anymore, and embraces her new self. It would be such a better ending, and it would require so little change to the existing script; you could probably accomplish it in just a couple revised lines, possibly without even any animation changes (aside from lip syncing). It really annoys me that no one thought to make this change (or, even worse, thought to make it, and decided not to). Maybe it was kind of a George Lucas scenario, where no one had enough balls to suggest changes to Urobuchi's script?

The best my friends and I have managed to come up with, after much speculation, is a combination of factors: 1. Homura and Madoka were bound with a special karmic destiny. 2. Homura's original wish from the very first timeline went unfulfilled when Madoka erased herself from existence and rewrote the timeline, and was essentially left 'hanging' out in the ether waiting to come true like the metaphorical other shoe dropping. 3. Becoming Homulily inside her own soul gem essentially 'broke' Madoka's wish (for all practical purposes, Madoka failed... Homura DID become a witch, and so her wish--to stop all witches before they were born--was nullified) and allowed Homura's original wish to usurp hers."). I suppose it doesn't strictly matter how it happened in the grand scheme of things, but it bothers me just the same. Not to mention that it actually is a fairly significant plot hole, considering that [Episode 12 spoilers](#s "Madoka is explicitly stated to be omniscient after her apotheosis.

{"body":"Well, for one, [TV series spoilers](#s "it may be stated that Madokami is omniscient, but whoever stated that (honestly can't remember now, I'm guessing it was Kyubey) could have simply been mistaken in terms of the scope or comprehensiveness of her omniscience. Also, a word like 'omniscient' can suffer from some very subtle changes in connotation in the process of translation; it may be that whatever word that was used to mean 'omniscient' (??????, probably? Again, can't remember specifics) is generally understood to have exceptions regarding the actions of other 'divine beings' - Shintoism is highly polytheistic, after all. That would be a very subtle cultural consideration, and even being fairly knowledgeable in Japanese myself, I couldn't really comment on whether it's true or baseless speculation, since I wasn't raised in the culture. Anyway, the point is, I wouldn't read to much into that.")		Also, [Rebellion spoilers](#s "although your speculation about the mechanics of Homura's betrayal probably work well within the established logic of the series, I'm pretty that event is not really supposed to 'make sense' (hence Kyubey and Madoka both being so surprised by it). Homura herself explains how it is possible simply by saying ?????? ('purely by love'), so I think the very strong implication is that Homura's emotions were even stronger than the incredible karmic destiny built up within Madoka's wish, and that alone was simply enough to bring into effect all of the events of the ending. Which is fine by me, except, to be a bit redundant, *there's no reason Homura should have known this would be the case.* By all means, when she learned that Kyubey had tricked her, that the entire course of events until then had been a false reality, and that Madokami was coming to take her to Madoka Heaven, it should have been really damn clear that the best choice of action would be just to go along with it. I mean, it would foil Kyubey's plan, save her soul from evil, and let her be with Madoka for eternity. She had even seen, at that point, that Madoka was still a fully-realized, conscious, functioning, sentient entity with a human form, and that 'ascended' Magical Girls could have the same status (evidenced by Madoka's assistants). So there was no downside to just going along with it! The only small loose end would be that Kyubey and his race would still be at large in the universe, and might attempt to harness the power of the Law of Cycles in some nasty way in the future, but there's no real reason that Madokami and Homura couldn't just attempt to deal with that, in God and angel form, after the fact. Anyway, the point is, it seems like Homura was presented with the choice of 'respect Madoka's wish, ascend, become Madoka's angel, we'll be together for eternity, and everything works out just fine (aside from Madoka having to shoulder the emotional burdens of ascended Magical Girls but seems to be doing just fine with that)' vs. 'embrace the powers of greed and evil, try to pull Madoka from divinity, which for all I know will literally kill her/erase her from existence, and hopefully everything will work out even though all evidence I have suggests that this attempt will either fail (Madokami is too strong) and I'll possibly risk eternal damnation, or I'll turn into a mindless construct of evil with no sense of my former desires or anything good (like every Witch in the past)' No matter how much she *wanted* a solution where she could save Madoka from the burden of her own wish and let her live a normal life, there was no reason for her to think she had any chance of actually accomplishing that by what she chose to do. So yeah, I have less issue with the 'how' and more with the 'why'. It just seems like a really terrible and out-of-character decision (Homura is shown to be quite pragmatic, after all.)")","depth":12,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mirrormn","name":"t1_cr5b7rq","parent_id":"t1_cr5ac0v","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1431334816,"created_utc":1431331216}
{"body":"Well said, well said indeed. I basically agree with you here; and the best defense I've ever heard regarding her decision at the ending--having argued at length about this point with one of my friends several times--and which I do not fully accept, is that [Rebellion spoilers](#s "she was acting out of desire to protect Madoka from the Incubators. The theory is that the Isolation Field experiment basically proved to her that, after her bone-headed decision to tell Kyubey everything about the previous timeline(s), the Incubators would never stop trying to capture and harness Madokami because they *very clearly* preferred the Witch system as a means of harnessing energy and were willing to go to extreme lengths to bring it back. Therefore, it is logical (from an in-character standpoint), after having finally and irrevocably crossed the event horizon of her own uttermost despair within her soul gem, that the only thing she could think of doing to prevent this was, of course, to revive her original wish - "I want to go back and be strong enough to protect Madoka-san." The flower field conversation feeds into this--she mistakenly comes to the conclusion a mind-wiped Madoka wouldn't have wanted to be forgotten, and determines she can no longer live in the world created by Madoka's sacrifice; except of course, both characters misunderstood one another and Madoka wasn't in any frame of mind to actually answer her question in a realistic manner. Ergo, this unfulfilled wish and the corruption stewing inside her soul gem allow her to grab onto and overpower Madokami. To a certain extent it is logical, yes, but I agree with you that fundamentally there's no practical reason for her to think this would actually work. It would've made more sense to play out as a completely unintended consequence as opposed to a sudden bit of Faustian "I've decided to be evil now, and I have every confidence it'll work!" rewriting.")

{"body":"Its from Bakemonogatari, part one of the Monogatari series		I will be honest with you now, that gif is misleading as the show itself is not very action heavy (there are only a handful through the entire series). The show is very dialogue heavy and uses a lot of stylish/avant garde directing and animating. It still has a lot of detail (sometimes a stylistic lack of detail) and style though, always interesting. It can be off-putting for some.		There is a quite a bit of fan-service (eye candy, male gaze) that tones down as the series progresses (fairly heavy in the beginning, reaching a heavy dose, and then toning down). 		The series is about a high schooler who was turned into a vampire but he got better. He still has some of the residual effects though (heals faster, for example). The story is more or less about him helping the people in his life also afflicted by the supernatural (curses etc). He is the protagonist and usual narrator, and like most teenagers is horny (hence the male gaze shots), sometimes annoying, and an unreliable narrator (the show uses this quite well).		The series, in release order, goes Bakemonogatari (Monster Story), Nisemonogatari (Fake/False/Impostor Story), Nekomonogatari: Kuro (Cat Story: Black), Monogatari Series Second Season, Hanamonogatari, Tsukimonogatari. There are more on the way, but this is everything as of right now. Chronologically sometimes the show jumps around but its meant to be watched in broadcast/release order.

{"body":"Anime is a medium. What you are looking for is genres within the medium. Anime is as vast and varying as any other medium. Books, comics, TV, movies, art, music...You just need to find the things in the medium you like.		Ghost in the Shell is commonly tagged with the following genres: Mecha, Sci-Fi, Police, Psychological, Seinen, Military, Action, Mystery.		The key "genre" here, at least for, you would be "Seinen". Basically, what this means is that Ghost in the Shell is targeted at "older males" (usually even men into their 50s). It is similar, but also different to "Shounen" (basically, targeted to adolescent males and teenagers). Shounen is typically found associated with stuff like Naruto and Dragonball. Shoujo is to Shounen as Josei is to Seinen, except for girls and women.		Also, you have to realise that with anime comes a very wide variety of art styles. The Ghost in the Shell movie's art is very highly detailed because of the high budget that they had. Not many anime have this quality of art, if any. You will probably only find this art quality in other movies. This art **style**, though, you will probably find if you look in the right places.		So basically, the type of anime you would be looking for is Seinen and occasionally Josei and Shounen.

In SAC/2ndGiG Kusanagi has always struck me as a consummate professional. She is the best at what she does, practically a force of nature. She is a highly capable leader, and not at all prone to flying off the handle chasing after existential answers or being comically defiant. 		The other characters get this treatment as well. Aramaki in particular... SAC/2nd Gig Aramaki is the man- he has the connections and the smarts. He knows the big picture more than anyone. Movie Aramaki is... deflated.

However, I actually found it refreshing to have a heroine that isn't overly sexualized, and it's awesome to realize how powerful she is despite having a diminutive frame. In the video, I really like how he sums up his analysis at the end:		>Does this make Arise a bad show? No, because it's up against some of the best anime every created. It has a hard time standing up, but if you take a step back it's an okay time killer for sci-fi fans. I recommend people to avoid it unless they really want to watch it. As long as this [production] team works on GITS, which they are planning to do for the upcoming movies, I don't think we will ever get something as good as the original.

I think that as an overall base to start from it's great, but I would have liked to see it tweaked a little bit and it could have been so much better in my eyes.		In particular I didn't like some of the acting and dialogue. I agree some of it was pretty cringeworthy. "Bro lets just smash beers all day and be big hairy boxers. Bro don't treat this like work let's just hang out. Also I'm a genius AI programmer and a cutting edge robotics builder." Don't his values seem clashing to anybody else? I mean seriously, that guy was ridiculous, unless of course it was meant to all be an act on his part. Even if it was, he was just a little annoying being like that.		Similarly the teenager programming prodigy certainly didn't act like the average one. I made the argument that you would have to spend a significant amount of time in front of a computer to be that good at programming at such a young age. So on average you won't have perfect posture and perfectly evenly tanned skin like he did. Sure, there are exceptions. But I'm just saying on average. His social interactions involving awkwardness were not convincing to me and seemed obviously acted too.		That's my nitpicking. I enjoyed 90% of the movie and would have liked to see some things a little bit different but overall was pleasantly surprised to see such a high quality science fiction movie in mainstream theaters, it really is a rare treat. And I got downvoted for pointing that stuff out before, but I guess I should expect that from reddit in a thread where people love the movie.		Then I got a bunch of flak "You must not know any programmers if that's what you think. Some of us are normal folk." I was in the CS club in college. I know a few languages. Most of the people that hung out there were pale and lanky. Sure, not all of them, but many of them.

{"body":"I'll try to explain, which I am not very good at.  		What I mean is most people are "jacked into" the American media machine.  They watch tv, movies, and so on.  And they do this for years, perhaps their whole lives.  As a result their mental taste buds for media gets shifted primarily to this diet.  I think it's a shitty diet, and it has been for a long time.  There are many criticisms of the American media out there so I won't go into it here.  The point is their standards have been calibrated for Big American Media, and Ex Machina is a perfect movie for someone in that world.  I was bored nearly the entire time.  I'm sure for others it was an exciting intro into concepts maybe they hadnt considered before.		Take the new Cosmos or Into the Wormhole.  Or nearly any docu on TV.  Or most docus on netflix.  Or a lot of ted.  People on the American media diet watch this stuff and it's mind blowing, or perhaps boring because it's "too smart".  When really it's all entry level elementary stuff geared to the lowest common denominator.  Turn on a show about space and they start from square 1 like you have no idea what space is.  A show like that is going to skim the surface for 45 minutes.

One good PBS docu a week / month / year and they have their fill.  Why learn about beavers?  To the American media diet *learning* is well..boring and not fun.  As a result many people go long stretches without absorbing meaningful educational material besides the occasional over dramatic thing about Mars.		So for someone like me ex machina was...not as earth shattering as it might be for someone else.  Same goes for Interstellar, and so on.

Another factor missing from the video analysis is that most Anime/Manga today, while part of an ancient graphic storytelling tradition, is descended from the works of Osamu Tezuka, namely *Tetsuwan Atomu*, aka *Astro Boy*.   Tezuka was fascinated with the works of Walt Disney, and so Japanese Anime/Manga has ever since basically, more or less, been putting their own spin on the so-called Disney Eyes look.			My wife and I are admirers of Scarlett Johansson's work but we both think she should have turned down the opportunity.  Japan, like many other cultures that idealize the fairest of their diverse range of people, has a lot of self-image problems to the point where there are surgeries to create double folds in the eyelids to make them look more western.... Remember that this is all because we literally nuked hundreds of thousands of civilians into submission, and then during periods of occupation we denigrated/ridiculed their customs and culture...		Western culture never really respected Japan's history as a whole, and our complicity in a self-hatred we germinated, by co-opting one of their most successful Anime and whitewashing it is just adding insult to injury... Honestly, how hard would it have been to bank Rinko Kikuchi in a movie that broader audiences won't give a shit about, and core audiences might skip for not staying true to form?","depth":6,"score":27,"ups":27,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"snowdog74","name":"t1_cr4plyl","parent_id":"t1_cr4p105","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1431287630,"created_utc":1431284030}

VV, a Spec Ops agent from an unspecified government or military just shows up at a convenient time to help out, because they have a common goal, and everyone is okay with it.

The Chief immediately assumes that Home Affairs is covering something up, and immediately take VV's word as gospel. Why, old man? I can't imagine you would just accept that. All she has done to prove any part of her authority is say she's Spec Ops. She doesn't even actually say where she's from!

When The Chief even asks this bitch is doing to investigate and recover/destroy the payload, she says "use your imagination."

{"body":"I didn't know they were making a live action flick! I really like the Ghost in the Shell films, they're bloody brilliant. I'm not going to discount a live action flick, especially a live action Hollywood flick. If they throw enough budget at it, it should at least look cool. It might not look like Ghost in the Shell, but it'll probably still look rad. Hollywood's great at throwing enough money at something that it'll at least look cool, might not be something you watch again, but it's got at least *somethin'* goin' for it.		I can never be upset about people making "bad" movies. No matter how bad a movie is there's still a ton of good people who make mad cash off that. I think it's easy to overlook the behind the scenes people, but they're the meat and potatoes of film production. If Hollywood wants to employ all the good people working in set, prop and costume design, a full suite of audio engineers, dozens, if not hundreds of people for set set up and strike, dozens if not hundreds more for VFX work, a handful of colour graders, some cinematographers, lighting techs, editors, riggers, caterers, and all the cronies and lackeys who follow them around making $12 an hour who do the grint work just to get their foot in the door and fetch coffee today so they can be a production sound mixer tomorrow, then Hollywood can make whatever they want.		I've worked in production audio, though briefly, and almost *every* behind the scenes person I met was worth knowing in their own ways. Some are bubbly, super sweet and very excited about it. Some people show up, work, do an amazing job like it's nothin', then go home (wherever "home" may be when you're in the middle of production), and you don't see them till they're on set again. Some people are grumpy, but carry a ton of knowledge that they'll reluctantly give to you if you ask enough. Some people do suck, but they're the anomaly.		I could be down about the current state of films, but the movie industry employs so many great people, I invite Hollywood to drive budgets up and up and up and up. Go right ahead!

But then I kind of take issue with the idea an unliked second season could "ruin" the first season as well. 		Also, season 2 may have been many things, good or bad, but I don't possibly see how the direction they took it could be considered a cash-in.

It basically involves dead people's spirits going to a bar (which is like a purgatory where they get judge) and they are forced to play a game (ranges from Darts to Twister with twists, such as playing darts that hurt the other person's organs or playing twister with a bottomless pit below) and whoever loses "dies" (the spirits don't know that they are dead themselves) and the winner gets to leave and go home. That is what the participants believe, when in reality they are getting judged based on their actions that they do in the game. The "winner" gets reincarnated and the "loser" goes to the void (which is like empty black nothingness for eternity) It gets really fucking crazy when they pair up people who are directly related to each other. 		Every episode talks about many philosophical ideas, ranging from suicide, religion, love, etc. They also have different tones, some episodes are depressing while others are cheerful. Every episode really makes you think about your own perspective of life. Also a bigger plot starts to surface later in the show, won't say anymore. Plot twists are all over the place and the Opening scene (where the music plays) is literally the opposite of what the show is about. So don't get fooled. No episode is similar to each other.
