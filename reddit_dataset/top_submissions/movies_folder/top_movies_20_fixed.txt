{"body":"Sure.		In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), sociopathy and psychopathy are both listed under the heading of Antisocial Personality Disorders (ASPD). According to Bouchard (1990) these disorders share common behavioral traits however there are significant distinctions between the two conditions. Common traits include a disregard for laws and social morals, a disregard for the rights of others, a failure to feel remorse or guilt, and a tendency to display violent behavior. Sociopaths tend to be nervous and easily agitated and prone to emotional outbursts, including fits of rage. It is difficult but not impossible for sociopaths to form attachments with others. Sociopaths will appear to be very disturbed and their crimes are often haphazard and spontaneous rather than planned. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are unable to form emotional attachments or feel real empathy with others. They learn to mimic emotions, are very manipulative and easily gain people???s trust. Psychopaths appear to be calm and commit crimes that are often planned out in advance.			The etiology or cause of psychopathy is different than the cause of sociopathy. It is believed that psychopathy is the result of ???nature??? (genetics) while sociopathy is the result of ???nurture??? (environment) (Bouchard, 1990). Recent research shows that psychopathy is related to a physiological defect that results in the underdevelopment of the part of the brain responsible for impulse control and emotions (Allison, 2001). Sociopathy, on the other hand, is more likely the product of childhood trauma and physical/emotional abuse. Because sociopathy appears to be learned rather than innate, sociopaths are capable of empathy in certain circumstances but not in others.	It is important to understand the distinctions between the two, because it relates back to the nature of the type of crimes committed by psychopaths as well as psychopathy being a result of a chemical imbalance or brain trauma. 			**tl:dr, Sociopaths are unable to form attachments with others whereas psychopaths are unable to form emotional attachments with others.**","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dmitriyy","name":"t1_co50zff","parent_id":"t1_co4m0yp","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1422567029,"created_utc":1422567029}

As far as Hannibal's quote being connected to him taking MAOIs, no one with knowledge of psychiatry would find that connection reasonable.  I don't have to avoid tyramine (the compound in those foods that interacts with MAOIs) so I don't have any mental illnesses?  That's a big stretch at best.  The interaction only occurs with a very specific class of drugs that are only used to treat depression, in terms of mental illnesses.  They can also be used for Parkinson's.  I don't think anyone would have ever labeled Hannibal as being depressed or Parkinsonian.  There are a large number of more serious mental illnesses he could have that aren't treated with MAOIs.  There are personality disorders that aren't treated with any meds at all.  And plenty of people with mental illnesses are walking around unmedicated by their own choice.

I'm not going to get into specific details but when I read about this she laughed a lot and said "whaaaaat" when I read the consequences bit and then said "what year do they they it is". These aren't cells either, they're open hospital with people who share similar disorders (her example was CAMHs and an eating disorder clinic). She said mixing mental illnesses together could cause things like BPD so it's generally avoided.		She also talked a bit about the 28 day assessment period (this prevents people lying and getting people sectioned). She also talked a bit about exactly what "sectioning" involves and when it's required. Essentially when people are sectioned the choice to take medication is taken away from them, but not everyone who is sectioned will require any medication. After 28 days a team of massively experienced people makes a decision regarding whether or not an individual is a danger to themselves or anyone else (again eating disorders being a good example here), if they've eaten lots in that time they're not sectioned, if they haven't perhaps they would be (individual basis obviously).		Please don't spout nonsense like this around though, it undermines people who suffer from mental health problems and massively undermines the treatment they receive by hugely qualified people (not just pill pushers).

So Hannibal was not able to zero in on Starling because they shared similar backgrounds.

{"body":"I agree. I love Hopkins performance but the Mads Mikkelsen "Hannibal" is because of the superiority of TV format these days, much deeper. 		Hannibal is this sophisticated socially acclimated genius that chooses to be chaotic-evil for his own amusement. "Because I wanted to see what would happen." He is basically his own interpretation of a cruel god of mischief and sensuality/decadence. 		Those who offend him, he holds in contempt and they find his way to his table. Those who impress/interest him he tries to test by persuading them into corruption/murder. He has chosen to embrace the worst of himself, and enjoys bringing others to the same way of thinking.","depth":8,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thatgeekinit","name":"t1_co4sm5f","parent_id":"t1_co4mk30","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1422552977,"created_utc":1422552977}
{"body":"We'll have to disagree about Lecter having some humanity in him. I think he does, and I think Barney explaining this to Starling was the way to express that. Lecter does favors for Starling, and occasionally expresses his admiration for her. I'd say he could be an anti-hero, sure. I always thought of him as an idealist or some kind of ethical supremacist, but ultimately a damaged and gruesome villain, with a barely mustered value of benevolence. 		I do think Lecter could have exploited a weakness in Barney. It wasn't ever expressly addressed, but I think the final scene in the book alludes to Lecter's all-knowing persona and Barney's full understanding of that: Lecter might have already surmised about Barney's greed and corruption, and Barney knew that, and bolted. But I don think the series is over. If I remember right (and maybe I don't), Hannibal Rising was made a farce. The studio approached Harris about a prequel that he didn't want to make. I think they forced his hand at writing the novel with the expressed intent of making a movie of it (which was god-awful IMO). I think the series ended fine, more so in the book.

That said, no official mental health organization has ever formally defined either psychopath or sociopath, and there is no official diagnosis for either in the DSM IV (or from what I've heard the DSM V). The terms are both defined loosely by pop culture, are often used interchangeably, and have no real set of defined differences or symptoms. Psychologists and Psychology professors who I've personally spoken with (and this seems to be the general consensus) is that the people / characters described as psycho/sociopaths generally exhibit mixed traits associated with the axis ~~1~~2 personality disorders of anti-social personality disorder, clinical narcissism, and histrionic disorder. 		*Edit - Axis II disorders are personality disorders (symptoms generally present from adolescents / early childhood)","depth":3,"score":60,"ups":60,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PerInception","name":"t1_co4n2w7","parent_id":"t1_co4liia","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1422542853,"created_utc":1422542853}

{"body":"Most of the behaviors resemble ASPD, however there are symptoms and overlap with narcissism and histrionic too. Nothing matches up exactly, which is why I said 'a mix of traits', and why ASPD !== psycho/socio. 		Let me clarify my previous post a bit. I realize that two or three "maybe applies maybe doesn't" diagnostic criteria aren't enough to diagnose someone with a personality disorder, but again, that's why I said 'exhibit mixed traits associated with' instead of saying a psychopath/sociopath is diagnosable with all three of these disorders. It's pieces of each disorder, not all three disorders going into one person.		On the histrionic front: 	1. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.	2. Interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior.		However, like you said psychopaths are characterized (in pop-culture) as being calm, and calculated, so with the exception of very dramatic displays of anger, the characterization of dramatic displays of emotion doesn't really make sense.  		But, on the narcissistic front:	1. Grandiose sense of self-importance	2. Preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love	3. Sense of entitlement	4. interpersonally exploitive (takes advantage of others to achieve a goal)	5. lacks empathy; unwilling to recognize or identify with the needs of others.	6. Envious of others or believes they are envious of him/her.	7. Arrogant.		Those basically describe Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Numbers 3, 4 and 5 are also widely associated with most of what pop culture deems a psychopath. 			For those interested here are the criteria for ASPD: http://behavenet.com/node/21650		TL;DR on that link, most of the criteria for ASPD line up with what is popularly considered a psychopath OR a sociopath, with some exceptions (most portrayals of either in pop culture don't include failure to plan ahead (although they do include impulsivity, two parts of the same criteria), and most portrayals don't mention failure to sustain work behavior). 		(*Note guys - The criteria I listed are not all of the criteria for each disorder in the DSM, I just picked the relevant ones.)  			Sorry for the rambling, I've re-adjusted the post several times and cut / moved stuff around because I don't want to come off like I'm disagreeing with you, just trying to relate my knowledge / experience / opinion on the subject. Since there is no concrete definition for either term, and both terms have been used to describe a wide range of characters (every horror villain with a knife and a mask is called a psycho, and every real life violent offender is called a socio), trying to research and formulate facts on the subject is kind of like trying to nail jello to a tree.				*Ninja Edit - I'm sure some of you guys reading this are psych majors, and for those of you who have to do research experiments or a thesis it would be kinda cool to see a study on what traits people associate with the term psychopath (with no modifier as a baseline), what people think of the term psychopath in relation to movies, and what people think of the term psychopath in relation to real life. Hell for that matter, step it up and add sociopath as a variable for each of those in there as well if you can find enough participants. It would be interesting to see and get a factual comparison of what pop-psychology thinks of each term and how it compares to actual axis II personality disorders. You guys can do it, I believe in you :)			TL;DR on the entire post: There is a disconnect between what people call psychopaths/sociopaths in pop culture and movies, and what people call psycho/sociopaths in real life (most 'psychopaths' in prison are no where near as charismatic as Hannibal Lecter, although some probably are.). Since the term is not positively defined in real mental health literature, the film makers / news outlets get to choose who to call psychos and socios (in fiction and real life), and they do so all willy nilly like. Generally speaking, most psychopaths/sociopaths will most closely align with ASPD, sometimes with a large amount of traits aligned with NPD, and occasionally traits associated with histrionic PD.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PerInception","name":"t1_co4tsrn","parent_id":"t1_co4r3b4","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1422554939,"created_utc":1422554939}
{"body":"I think the disconnect comes from the fact that most psycopaths shown in TV are ALSO very intelligent. People don't understand that we're watching them because those people have both characteristics, and think they're tied together. It's hard to come to the conclusion that stupid thugs that don't think anything of taking a life could have the same pathology as Hannibal Lecter if you're only looking at behavior.		Also in my experience those who have the disorder AND are smart are capable of getting over the failure to plan ahead part. Some even learn to imitate "normal" people so they can get what they want. Hell, some do it just so they don't get into trouble, which functionally looks the same as people who have morals. This type more closely resembles the protagonist of House of Cards.","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"arkain123","name":"t1_co4ubm5","parent_id":"t1_co4tsrn","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1422555789,"created_utc":1422555789}
{"body":"I totally agree. As most things tend to do, I imagine in a sufficient sample of real life 'psychopaths', their IQ would tend to approach a bell curve. You only hear about the smart ones because the dumb ones get caught earlier. But that doesn't make for a good movie or news story if someone gets arrested for being dumb early in the movie and thats the end of it. People want high body counts (in real life and in movies), because they like to see extremes. Theres no Guinness Book of World Averages. People figure if they learn about the outliers and the extremes of either end, they can extrapolate that to understand the whole subject. 		If a psychopath with a 180 IQ lost it and murdered 40 people over a couple of years, when the police found out they'd be talking about it for years. Hell the news media still references Ted Bundy quite often, and he was only above average intelligence (not a genius or a super genius). But if some psychopath with an 85 IQ gets arrested for murdering his coworker so he can try to sleep with his wife or steal his car, you'll hear about it on the news for about a 5 minute clip MAYBE (probably only if you live in the area it happened in). Then it'll randomly be reposted to reddit for a couple cycles as TIL's. That'll fade into obscurity. 		So, if every time you hear the term psychopath or sociopath being used on the news or in a movie it's always being used to refer to someone thats super intelligent and had the highest body count or most brutalized their victims, your brain is going to begin to correlate the two. And once the correlation starts, the confirmation bias kicks in and you start finding more and more little pieces of evidence that re-enforce your idea. And before you know it, every psychopath is Hannibal Lecter or Hitler. Maybe that's why the media actually focuses on those two terms 'psychopath' and 'sociopath' when describing people, since it's not a well defined term they can make it mean whatever they want, whereas if they were overusing the terms ASPD/NPD/etc, some industry professional, psychiatrist, or psychologist would come out and be like "Ya'll mother fuckers need Jesus", and kill the media's credibility. 			Also, something I've noticed lately (it seems to have started about the time Dexter became popular), people are referring to the suave sophisticated Lecter types as sociopaths, and the brutal ISIS beheading types as psychopaths. Kind of a "if he is in a tux and murdering people for weird sexual reasons he is a sociopath, but if he is wearing a carhart jacket and stabbing people in back alleys he is a psychopath".

Psychopathy versus sociopathy: Why the distinction has become crucial. Aggression and Violent Behaviour, in press	>**Hare and Babiek (2006) acknowledge a clear difference between psychopathy and sociopathy**. Psychopathy, which is the condition Hare successfully captured with the PCL-R, means the individual will have no empathy or sense of morality among a number of other traits (Hare, 1991). Sociopathy, on the other hand, is indicative of having a sense of morality and a well-developed conscience, but the sense of right and wrong is not that of the parent culture		and		>I have presented three reasons why psychopathy cannot be treated the same way as sociopathy. First, psychopathy research has been so rich and deep that the term has taken on a tremendous amount of meaning, partly because psychopathy is a developmental disorder that is associated with specific kinds of behavior. Second, if we use the definition that sociopaths have a sense of morality, we have to allow for brain differences that are not present in the psychopath. **And last, acquired sociopathy, which is very different from psychopathy**, seems to be satisfied by the mere presence of antisocial behavior brought about by lesions, from both trauma and surgery, or dementia.

That is why I said that is a possibility that he is not psychotic. In fact, it is kind of necessary for the plot for us to interpret him that way. But the characters within the story might not realize/believe that. So they might try to treat him with an anti-psychotic and find that it doesn't work because there is "nothing wrong" with him. So since that didn't work they might try some other medication like an antidepressant.		But I don't really think it is a "joke".

{"body":"Holy shit. I love Silence of the Lambs especially for its reverent treatment of Lecter's devotion to detail, and this takes it to another level. I always thought his sneering mention of the nice Chianti (Amarone in the book) was about making Starling feel more like a "rube" in that scene. In the book it's very much about accuracy: Amarone pairs well with the suggested meal, so it's him displaying clues as to his discerning tastes as well as dispassionate regard for his crimes - he remembers the meal more vividly than the man he killed. 		In the movie, the way Hopkins delivers the line, it's more mocking/sarcastic/condescending. He knows Starling isn't the type who gets out to fancy dinners. He's putting himself on another level, making things she would consider tasteful or refined seem cheap and pathetic, things an aspirant to taste or "rube" might want to like.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"phantompowered","name":"t1_co4pvb9","parent_id":"t3_2u2fhz","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1422548268,"created_utc":1422548268}
