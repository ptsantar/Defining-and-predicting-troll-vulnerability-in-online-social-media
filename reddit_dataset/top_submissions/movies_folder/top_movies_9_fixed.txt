Because the only people who matter - the creators (studio, producer, director, etc) - consider Abram's ST to be a reboot.  It's re-starting the series from the beginning, so to speak.

{"body":"I don't think what its called for marketing purposes is relevant. Even if it wasn't a reboot, they'd have to use young actors to portray the characters at a younger age than the original actors. That's like saying Men In Black III is a reboot because one of the characters from the original movie is portrayed by a different actor because he had to be younger. 		Regardless, I cant call it a reboot in traditional terms if the actions of the original series have demonstrative effects on the plot of the current series--which they do, Spock's warning in Into Darkness is more than a casual fun tie in to the original series, it's a major part of the plot. The plot of Star Trek II is DIRECTLY EFFECTING the plot of Star Trek "Reboot" II. That's not a new universe. That's not an independent universe where the rules of the original don't matter. Call it what you will, but the terminology we use to describe doesn't give it a narrative pass for a visually different looking universe when it has already established the timeline of the original universe valid. If it wanted to be a clean slate reboot, it did a really shitty narrative job of making that happen. 		And that's my entire point. I don't actually care about star trek here -- my only point here is to demonstrate that Abrams has a short history of discarding the visual style of a series even when his own movie validates that series' history. Which means that it wouldn't be strange  for him to reimagine things in Star Wars to look different than the did in a movie 30 years ago--which is why I found it notable that he was sticking to that continuity by allowing the 30-year old designs to appear in his film. 		Had that crashed x-wing, obviously dead from an old battle, been in the "new" style I wouldn't have blinked an eye. I'd already accepted that he was probably going to change small things like that. Now I know he's not going to, and that makes me happy. That's what I'm really talking about. Star Trek is just an example for why I think Abrams may have acted in that way. You may not agree with that, and that's fine, but that's the reason I'm highlighting it here--because you may not have thought of Abrams and Star Trek that way, but you can bet your ass there's people like me who will read that comment and see that X-Wing and think the way I did.

The new Star Trek is cannon with he original Star Trek, meaning the rules and history in the original movie's timeline that dates before Spock arrived in the "New" timeline are all still valid. Considering that, Abrams took enormous liberties with design and interpretation with only the barest excuse for why it was inconsistant with the rest of the Star Trek Universe. 		That's all fine. I can accept that, but since it's not a full reboot, the "reboot" excuse you have for things like Robocop or the new Ghostbusters doesn't apply. What It DOES show is that Abrams doesn't necessarily care if his movie fits in with how previous things in the franchise looked--even if it's considered part of the same story and even has the same characters portrayed in their original style (pre-reboot) by their original actors. Star Wars has a lot of that in it, just without the bullshit time travel. 		I don't think it was an unreasonable assumption to think that he might make similar inconsistant design directional choices with his work on Star Wars.

{"body":"Actually, I didn't get to see the first film until it had already been open for about 3 months (IIRC I got to see it -- after much begging, and probably *only* because it was such a MAJOR box office smash that the news was always talking about it -- as a birthday gift, which would have been like mid-September... so maybe more than 3 months, more like 4).		Because, you know how the character Luke lives on a remote farm, and like has to come up with some lame-ass excuse about needing to pick up some power converters so he can even get to go into the tiny little Toshi Station place?  		Yeah... my life at the time was sorta like that, except with trees instead of sand dunes, a mini bike instead of a landspeeder, and while I could get to the gas station/general store (sort of like a quickie-mart, but they weren't called that yet) on the outside of town, I couldn't actually get INTO town proper to get to the local movie theater... not that it would have mattered (because the town movie theater *never* got first-release films, only second-release stuff, or the "crap" B-movies as filler).		Plus to me, books were *better* than movies... because while movies were great, with a book I could "rewatch" the thing in my head any time I wanted, plus I could pause it, fast-forward, rewind, whatever. (And keep in mind that home VCR's were still REALLY expensive and REALLY rare -- and movie-rental places weren't around yet -- hell I think we'd only gotten a color TV about a year or two before... and our first VCR was several years in the future.) 		---		Heck, I was even just lucky that before Christmas, I'd gotten to go along into ~~Mos Eisley~~ the "big city" to the shopping mall where they had a Waldenbooks store, and had the novelization on display (mine [kind of looks like this](http://i2.wp.com/www.coffeewithkenobi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/prologue-pg-00-copy.jpeg), except most of the "gold" got worn off), and I was able to buy it (with my own money, my parents would have said "why would you want THAT?")  		I even remember starting to read the thing (more like *devour* it actually) in the back seat of the car on the ride home... I still remember that [opening prologue, the so called "excerpt" from the *Journal of the Whills*](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PhdtUAVDCmI/TmvWpKF9K_I/AAAAAAAACPM/Nzw-wNuuIak/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg) (whatever the F! that was), and the opening paragraph: "The Old Republic was the Republic of Legend, greater than distance or time. No need to note where it was or whence it came from, only to know that . . . it was *the* Republic."   Shit, man chills went through my body!)		Did the same kind of thing with Empire and Jedi.		Yeah, it was kind of a "weird" experience I suppose -- probably different than most peoples --  I mean I really wanted/missed the whole Biggs Darklighter thing at Toshi Station, and hearing the chick call Luke "Wormie" and making fun of him, etc; and I was kind of disappointed it wasn't in there.		And then with Empire especially seeing Yoda -- well, from the book somehow I had gotten the idea in my head that he was like some skinny little BLUE elfin-fairly like creature (sort of like a Smurf I guess), and I pictured him hopping around quickly and talking REALLY fast and in a sort of childish high pitched voice... so the on-screen Yoda was; well quite a bit different than I'd expected, it took a while before I got used to that.		I suppose I should also mention that I also bought/read "Splinter of The Mind's Eye" as soon as I could when it came out (like a year after the first film), and so... for probably close to two years -- right up until I got the book version of Empire (probably a week before that movie opened) -- well, I was expecting to see a MUCH different second movie, with a Jungle planet and some pretty funky Luke-Leia scenes (Rowrrr!) as they tried to get their hands on the Kaiburr crystal thingee before Vader did.		So for me... Empire was sort of "weird."  I mean the film was great and all, in many ways even BETTER than the first one (and I saw it maybe like two weeks after it opened, cause I had my own ~~landspeeder~~ CAR by then). But the thing was that not only was there the whole "Splinter" thing, but because I'd pictured the blue-bouncy-fast-talking-Yoda, it took a while to wrap my head around the no crystals and the green-squat-fat weird elf-puppet thing that talked like an old semi-senile dyslexic grandpa -- that was actually harder for me to grasp than the "Vader is Luke's father bit" (which until ROTJedi I was certain was simply a Sith LIE ... I mean it just didn't make ANY sense; and really *it still doesn't*, IMO it's obviously a "retcon" by Lucas, which is one reason the prequels became so distorted, because he had to make Obi-Wan NOT be a blatant & total liar, AND yet have Luke's dad "Anakin" become Darth Vader 	and Lucas did a shit job of the plot/motivation there IMO; there were *a dozen different ways it COULD have been done that would have been a lot more plausible* in terms of Anakin "turning"	).","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thrownaway_MGTOW","name":"t1_cqf2yuo","parent_id":"t1_cqf12xa","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429242615,"created_utc":1429239015}

{"body":"They were pretty widely dispersed in the EU and not exactly a 'super weapon.' They were much, much larger, but 'only' equivalent in power to ~5 - 10 Imperial Star Destroyers. In the canonical Battle of Endor, the rebel forces were equivalent to about 40 Imperial Star Destroyers and associated support ships, and were trapped by a fleet of about 30 Imperial Star Destroyers and the *Executor*, a Super Star Destoyer, and the Death Star itself which was an operational super-weapon capable of one-shotting heavy rebel ships. 		There are lore reasons (both canonical and otherwise) why the rebels were supposedly able to hold off and defeat the superior Imperial forces (The Ackbar Slash, Crix Madine's and Lando's superior tactics, direct orders from the Emperor to not open fire with Turbolaser batteries, the failure of the Sith Battle Meditation after Palpatine's death causing severe psychological shock to the imperial forces). But the end result is that it is widely assumed a Super Star Destroyer, despite its size, is actually only equivalent in strength to between five and ten Imperial Star Destroyers. 		The whole point of all that nerdery is that Super Star Destroyers weren't exactly about to bankrupt the empire, considering the empire built *not one but two Death Stars*. It wouldn't surprise me if, in the new films, the Super Star Destroyer became a fairly standard (if uncommon) ship-of-the-line in any subsequent battles that would have happened over the next forty years (the actual next forty years in the 'legends' line of EU stuff were ridiculously complex and hectic, and way more crazy shit than Super Star Destroyers kept showing up regularly) It really wouldn't be outside the industrial capacity of a galaxy-spanning empire which could craft a small moon-sized space-station capable of destroying worlds to create such ships.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gifted_SiRe","name":"t1_cqeqbz4","parent_id":"t1_cqeoggy","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429220276,"created_utc":1429216676}

{"body":"There is a whole propulsion system built into the connecting tower. This allows the bridge to detach from the rest of the ship and travel as its own self contained unit. There are a number of scenarios where this can prove useful.		The obvious, of course, is as a way of escaping the larger portion of the ship if it is damaged. This also works the other way around though, as back up bridge controls exist in the larger body thus allowing it to jettison a damaged bridge.		Gifted tacticians often use this feature in hostile scenarios where such flexibility gives them an advantage. While firepower is limited on the bridge section of the ship, the ability to convert one platform into two independent ships delivering fire from different positions can be invaluable. This is especially true when both planning and foresight allow a commander to draw the bulk of enemy forces towards one section (traditionally the bridge) as a decoy in order to perform a flanking maneuver with the other section (traditionally the more heavily armed body of the ship.)		Lastly, there are certain situations and/or environments where the option of using the smaller bridge section for surveillance or scouting can be quite useful. The mirrored bridge controls within the larger body of the ship allow important officers to take advantage of its safety while more 'disposable' officers take the risks inherent in commanding such an operation from the bridge. 		Of course, such ships are rarely without a full contingent of support vessels. As such, these tactics aren't commonly necessary. That said, when you are dealing with an armed force consisting of a truly staggering amount of vessels and personnel, the reality is mistakes happen. As has always been the case when it comes to these types of things, bureaucratic fuck ups can get people killed. The piece of mind this design gives a crew and the flexibility it allows commanders is more than worth the extra costs.","depth":8,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dioskilos","name":"t1_cqeypep","parent_id":"t1_cqerxua","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429234783,"created_utc":1429231183}

Kylo adopts the dark side and Leia and Han need to stop him, but obviously that isn't easy since he's their son.  I also believe Rey is Kylo's sister, but only Han and Leia know about her.  When Kylo finds out about Rey and goes after her, Leia sends Poe Dameron on a rescue mission to retrieve her.  Rey is fully neutral, not siding with either the Rebels or the Empire, and has just befriended a deserted stormtrooper named Finn, and so when a Rebel pilot shows up, there is tension between Poe Dameron and Finn that will eventually lead to a strong friendship.","depth":6,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"winterborne1","name":"t1_cqeqzhe","parent_id":"t1_cqepd6w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429221271,"created_utc":1429217671}

{"body":"Truly.  I don't know how old you are, but I was in first grade when the original Star Wars came out, and it was the greatest thing in my life.  I even tried to make a Star Wars movie with a borrowed camera from the school library, a die-cast Millenium Falcon on fishing line passing in front of a piece of black, backlit posterboard with pinholes all over it for stars, etc.  I've never been a Star Wars convention-type, but I grew up on Star Wars.  Besides that, I grew up collecting comic books - almost exclusively the ones with the great art, since I was into drawing.  That meant Frank Miller Daredevil, John Byrne and Chris Claremont X-Men, John Byrne Fantastic 4, George Perez and John Romita Jr. Iron Man, etc. ** I wish I could express to people just how luckly I feel to be alive right now.**  		I mean, I can only make the "12 year old me is having nerdgasm through the space-time continuum" on Facebook so many times.  And it seems like the couple of friends I still keep in touch with who were my childhood cohorts in comic book collecting, watching Robotech and Transformers, playing Star Wars in the backyard...they all seem so serious and grown-up and I can't really enjoy it with them.  But between Avengers trailers (and the recent Marvel movies), this new Star Wars, more Terminators...I just can't even, as they say.  How do I get to be alive to see Hugh Jackman as Wolverine?  The Wolverine and Days of Future Past were like dreams come true.  Most of the first Thor was amazing, as was most of the first Avengers.  The first two Iron Mans were more than I could have dreamed of.  And don't even get me started on Winter Soldier, I could watch that for days on end.  And now I get this unbelievable looking Avengers 2.		This is also why I don't have all the hate for reboots like some do - just keep rebooting it and making them better each time, it's fine with me!  Fantastic Four, Hulk, Spider Man, Superman - keep 'em coming 'till you come up with a version that's as good as Iron Man or Captain America was.  I have hope that someone will reboot Godzilla again and make him the main character this time.  I'll keep paying money to see Transformers movies until they get it right, and I won't leave this earthly plane until they make Robotech.  I could do without a live-action Akira, but otherwise, the more studios want to spend $200 million a pop at my childhood fantasies, the more I love being alive at this special time.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"whosthedoginthisscen","name":"t1_cqer0j7","parent_id":"t1_cqekhr3","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429221313,"created_utc":1429217713}

{"body":"The trailer was really pointing to everything a Superman movie *should* be about: Hope. Superman is far more important as a symbol of hope than as a strong flying guy punching things.		The movie, on the other hand, paid lip service to "hope", but then has Clark letting his dad die just because he was obsessively worried about revealing his secret identity. Seriously, what idiot *ever* thought Clark Kent would ever let *anyone* die over something as petty as a secret identity?		Then it's followed up by the Jor-El AI being so damn interactive and even taking the initiative on stuff that the guy may as well not be dead at all.		Also, there was so much goddamn destruction porn that the film might as well have been a Michael Bay alien invasion flick that happened to have Superman in it.		Oh, plus, Zod feels the need to terraform Earth and kill all its people because some *brief* disorientation that he and the other Kryptonians quickly overcome is apparently too high a price to pay for super-strength, flying, etc.		Man of Steel had some fantastic trailers, but it was a shit movie.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CaspianX2","name":"t1_cqeq1gs","parent_id":"t1_cqelflu","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429219837,"created_utc":1429216237}

Seriously, what idiot ever thought Clark Kent would ever let anyone die over something as petty as a secret identity?		Worse than that. Dad Ken was concerned that some jokels witnessing something that might or might not have been out of the ordinary like someone rescuing a dog, would throw Earth into chaos.   Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies! Rivers and seas boiling! Forty years of darkness! Earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria! 		Then Zod broadcasts globally a really creepy "You're not alone" message revealing that not only aliens exists, but at least one of them has been living among humans for decades and he's ready to punish humans if he doesn't get him. And nobody is seriously concerned, they keep going to their jobs and generally have a very "meh" attitude. Pa Kent surely felt like an idiot in the afterlife.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rowenstin","name":"t1_cqesve3","parent_id":"t1_cqeq1gs","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429224332,"created_utc":1429220732}
{"body":"Another frustrating facet of this whole thing is, in every depiction of Ma and Pa Kent I've ever seen, it is made absolutely clear that *they* are his parents. Kent may have gotten his magnificent abilities from his Kryptonian DNA, but it was the Kents who instilled in him his *most* important qualities - his compassion, his morality, and his *humanity*.		This film seeks to undo *all* of that. Pa Kent's driving concern is one of *fear*, not morality. And as soon as Clark meets Space-Dad, the Kents almost completely disappear from the film (save for Zod targeting Ma Kent later on) and Jor-El takes center stage... and why not? He might be a hologram, but aside from the fact that he's intangible, he may as well be a real flesh and blood person.		And so the entire character of Superman is undone from the ground up. His humanity is distant and forced, because Pa Kent placed the fear of getting caught above the imperative to do what's right. His loneliness and isolation lack any credibility with Hologram Space Dad there to console him and keep him company. Hell, even his relationship with Lois never even has a chance to establish itself between two *people* because she only ever sees him as Superman and knows from the get-go that Clark Kent is a construct.		And that should never be Superman. For Batman, it makes perfect sense that Bruce Wayne is his mask, his false face that he wears to enable Batman, but Superman doesn't work that way. For Superman, Clark is just another facet of the person he is, an outgrowth of his desire to continue to live a normal life amongst the people he loves, with both halves of his whole equally invested with the same basic values of truth, justice, and the American way.		But the film version? When Clark walks into the Daily Planet at the end, he feels like an alien impostor hiding in amongst insects he's studying and perhaps even fascinated by. Why? Because "Clark Kent" no longer exists as a person. That was torn away when he became Superman. It was never well-established anyway.		The funny thing is, for all the complaining people have had about Ben Affleck being Batman in the new film, I'm not too concerned about it. I think Affleck will play a great Bruce Wayne, and he at least *looks* good as Batman, so in my mind he already has two-thirds of the character down. My worry is about them choosing to keep on Man of Steel's version of Superman, who *never* established the moral high ground that is Superman's greatest strength. If Batman is really going to be Batman, he has to question why any being with the power of Superman should be trusted, and this version of Superman has no real answer to that question.","depth":5,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CaspianX2","name":"t1_cqetpse","parent_id":"t1_cqesve3","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429225754,"created_utc":1429222154}

(but read everything below before you jump to any conclusions about where I'm going with this)		Abrams has no problem pissing on cherished franchises (Star Trek) to appease a broader audience but at the same time he has the criticisms against Lucas to think about... Lucas shit on his own franchise!		So, Abrams says all right we're going to do this right.  Lucas was too proud to get writers he couldn't strongarm with his ideas, but Abrams knew enough to go back to the source of all that is holy in the Star Wars universe: Larry Kasdan.		He also knows which buttons to push with the Luke voice over, Vader helmet and last second appearance by Han in the trailer... the three beats that every fan wanted to see/hear.		But now can he follow through?  Will he trust Kasdan's instincts and go with the story, or will he go with the roller coaster ride and edit it into a nonstop action movie?		My gut tells me he loves Star Wars far too much to do that kind of damage ... and Bob Orci is not involved at all.

[This is one of my predictions for Force Awakens](#s "To me it looks like that stormtrooper guy is going to start out with what appears to be remnants of the empire, and become a turncoat that ultimately joins the new republic")		It also seems like that scene with all the stormtroopers getting f'd up in that hangar is framed from their perspective, which might imply that there are going to moments where the audience is meant to empathize with them. For the films, that is not same-old, as the clones in Attack of the Clones are an interchangeable faceless mass of generic warriors, and come Revenge of the Sith, they're "bad guys".		In the OT, we were never led to empathize with anyone that has allegiances to the Empire, until Vader has what is clearly a moment of epiphany and his character develops.		We also don't know what the balance of power is going to be like in this film. With the new republic established, who are going to be the villains? In appearance their are remnants of the Empire, but that might not be the case in the greater scheme of things.		What is the scope of the villains' might in comparison to the New Republic?		From the visuals in the trailer, it looks to me as we're witnessing the gradual decline of the once mighty Empire - and that's definitely a new take in the Star Wars franchise. In the past we saw its nigh instantaneous rise to power, and the scope of the Empire at its peak. I genuinely think we'll be getting to see something new out this trilogy.

{"body":"Revan's mask was rendered for a 3D game in 2003. The fidelity wasn't quite up to current cinema standards. It would be entirely natural to add details if it were to appear in a movie.		This is an iconic visual, and I would be shocked if the choice was not deliberate. Disney knows that that the games and novels kept the franchise alive and valuable over the decades, and that today many fans have a stronger association with these non-canon works than they do they actual films. Adding a small reference like this can add appeal for fringe fans who may not have otherwise been excited to see the movie.		I do doubt, however, that the mask will get more than a single line of mention (if that). The theory that is going around is that the villain is collecting artifacts of the Sith, and I imagine that if they comment on the origin of the mask at all, it would be something like, "This mask once belonged to one of the most powerful Sith of all time, a Jedi who fell to the dark side and brought the Republic to its knees."

{"body":"Okay, time to pull every speck of information we can from this and speculate a bit.		Luke had a kid who he presumably teaches / taught to use the force in the movie. The kid is probably the leading role of the movie, which would make them the girl they show running with the black guy from the first trailer. "The Force Awakens" is probably in reference to the girl awakening her force power over the course of the movie.		The empire's forces still exist and seem to be rallying behind some leader in that bit with the giant red banner.		That line Han Solo gives was probably given right as they entered / came upon the Millennium Falcon. Which means the ship was in someone else's possession.		The black guy is shown wearing storm trooper armor again which means it probably wasn't just a one off scene where he pretended to be a stormtrooper like A New Hope unless the scene just transitions from inside to out in the desert somehow. It seems likely he's actually a soldier.		There's some kind of soldier in fancy armor. Maybe some kind of general / commander? Probably not the army's leader though. That's gonna be some politician type.		Red light saber guy seems to be allied with the Empire from the scene where they show his helmet. Maybe he's taking up the mantle of Darth Vader after finding the helmet or something? There's a scene where his lightsaber is in normal lightsaber mode. So that's something.		A star destroyer crashed on the planet which is presumably Tatooine. Probably years before the events of the movie given how it's buried.

{"body":"A big improvement on the first teaser in pretty much every way. 		Ok, gigantic.		The star destroyer in the desert is a dream-like image. Very powerful for someone who grew up invested in the original trilogy.		It reminds me how effectively the original achieved suspension of disbelief, and captured imagination, with nothing more than a few words and images creating a sense of a vast, ongoing history.		I think Vader's mask is equally likely to haunt a few minds tonight.		These images demonstrate how the original's use of a 'used/damaged' mise-en-scene (sorry), was part of creating that 'off-screen' universe that ached to be fleshed out by our imaginations.		This stands in stark contrast to the way our imagations were positively stifled by the diabolical 'details' of the second trilogy - 	1. largely poor attempts at visual humour that fell flat (the two headed pod-racing commentator)	2 cultural references served only to break the spell (think the 50's diner in AOTC)	3. dreary explanations and clunky jargon seemingly designed only to rid us of wonder (midichlorians).		The last is a powerful argument against any regard for canon whatsoever. Maintaining coherence does not require explanation. Films will improve when we remember it's better to smuggle a plot hole past an audience if the drama requires it, than it is to stifle drama and involvement by invoking dreary and pointless, but 'coherent' explanations, or details not accessible to a watcher of the movie.		I also thoroughly enjoyed that we are introduced to blend of story of family and emotion, as much as wonder and excitement.		The only disappointment for me was looking at Han and saw Harrison Ford, rather than looking at HF and saw Han.","depth":0,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Robag4Life","name":"t1_cqenqbn","parent_id":"t3_32tx0z","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429216342,"created_utc":1429212742}

His Star Trek films were decent, but in this trailer there is something different. The shots, the style, the little details - they all just ooze passion. And that's what Star Wars films are all about. I don't know anyone who would say Episode's 4-6 are 'action movies' - because they really aren't. Hence why people always refer to them as 'a western in space' - and this trailer echoes that rugged cowboy-esque tone perfectly. Not even a serious Star Wars fan, but this has got me very excited.		**Edit**: spelling","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"berry_drunk","name":"t1_cqerrx8","parent_id":"t3_32tx0z","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429222527,"created_utc":1429218927}

This isn't set to happen hundreds of years later - some change in the tie fighters and a downed star destroyer are both some pretty big changes, IMO. Plus a more in depth look at Kylo Ren than we got last time, a better look at new stormtrooper helmet designs. Plus there's the fact that this is a teaser trailer meant to show off cinematography and with more fan service than we got in the last trailer (what with luke talking, han and chewie reappearing and delivering the obviously fan service line - though I have little issue with that, as it *is* a big deal for Ford to be back on that set). I'd say it's more creative to not have to dump the original universe in order to create something people are excited about, while not being fully fan service, which this wasn't (I'm looking back to those new things we got to see which I mentioned). 		Again, familiar characters and universe amongst some new characters, situations, and designs doesn't automatically equal rehashed and uncreative IMO.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hairam","name":"t1_cqew0vp","parent_id":"t1_cqenkpp","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429229853,"created_utc":1429226253}

{"body":"The term "milking" a franchise is something that has been invented by purists. In todays movie industry the only reason that production companies spend money creating a movie, whether within a specific genre or a continuation of a franchise, it's because they believe that they will earn their money back and more. Now for them to be able to do that there has to be a demand for it. "Milking" has a negative connotation which spawns to mind the image of a company reaching into the wallet of a poor family to take every last penny they have, which of course couldn't be farther from the truth. Disney is making more Star Wars because there are millions, most likely hundreds of millions of people that want to see more. If you saw the live stream from Celebration yesterday you would see many people literally on the verge of tears and others almost incoherent with joy.		The non-existant "milking" is not the problem. Purists are, and they will just have to get used to the fact that they are in the minority and (thankfully) will be ignored in this particular case where Star Wars is concerned.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jamaryn","name":"t1_cqfdgfi","parent_id":"t1_cqfbdy2","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429275911,"created_utc":1429272311}
