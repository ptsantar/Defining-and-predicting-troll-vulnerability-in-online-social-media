Movie theaters are one of the few venues where this is common, as live theatre performances, comedy shows, concerts, etc tend to be reserved seating, or in the cases of comedy, it is often assigned seating (to ensure the crowd fills in towards the front of the room, as dead space between a comic/improv troupe is not good).		I was a projectionist/jack of all trades for over 3 years at a newly built 2 screen cinema, with beer/wine/cocktails and bistro-type food available. We initially had reserved seating, but we found that it taxed the box office too much (the rest of the building was also a concert venue and multi-purpose conference room) when other events were occurring.

{"body":">You have to show up like an hour before showtime for regular showings		1) In Austin they now have reserved seating. This change is recent (they started doing reserved seating in the last year or two). I'm sure they will all go this way sooner or later. 2) This is true for all movie theaters that don't have reserved seating, it's not Alamo specific. I've been to many movies at the Alamo where the theater was half empty, it all depends on how new / popular the movie is. If you're going to a popular movie at a theater without reserved seating, you arrive early or you get crap seats, Alamo or not. 3) Alamo shows content relevant to the movie you're about to watch before the movie, instead of car commercials and other crap. It's much nicer waiting for a movie to start at an Alamo theater than anywhere else. 4) You have to look at the menu and order your food, so you're doing something while you wait for the movie to start unlike at a traditional theater.		> I wonder how annoying it would be to hear hundreds of people chewing with their mouths open.		Again, this isn't an Alamo thing, it's true at every theater. People eat at movies, be it popcorn or pizza, it's all the same. This is a non-issue at the Alamo just like it's a non-issue at every other theater.		The other reason that I love the Alamo is that they replace every other row of seats with tables, so you have TONS of leg room (your legs go under the table instead of hitting the back of the chair in front of you). This reason alone is enough to make me hate going to any non-Alamo theater.		TL:DR Alamo Drafthouse is better than a regular theater in every possible way.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"edgroovergames","name":"t1_cmymlut","parent_id":"t1_cmyj5jl","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1418917142,"created_utc":1418917142}
