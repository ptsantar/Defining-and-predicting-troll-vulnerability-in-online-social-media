I guess he really does have a team of cookie cutter composers to do his work for him.	The score for Interstellar redeemed Zimmer a bit for me. No particularly great moments, but I thought he at least came up with a different sound with its own personality, and the end result works quite tightly with the movie.

{"body":"If we're going to abandon the principle of causality, we enter the realm of "anything goes" and everything essentially becomes inconsequential from the perspective of the viewer of the movie. Imagine watching a movie with an omnipotent superhero. "Anything can happen at any point in time, and it's not a paradox because we've decided that it's logical for anything to be able to happen at any point in time." It becomes uninteresting and nothing in the movie is really at stake, so there's no excitement, suspense or reason to care on a deeper level, beyond just entertainment. It seems akin to a lazy deus ex machina. The viewer's excitement, interest, suspense and emotional and intellectual investment in movies stem from the notion that every action that takes place has a logical consequence, and that there are logical limitations on what can actually happen. Cause and effect. Remove this and there's no reason to care, in my view. It's fine for the viewer of the movie to know what is going to happen at the end, but if there are no restrictions on what can happen and if the explanation for the events is simply "because anything is possible in our universe", there is no meaningful internal logic in the movie that restricts the events that can take place, and therefore no reason to get emotionally or intellectually involved with the movie and its characters.		We knew from the beginning of Titanic that the ship was going to sink and that Rose would survive because this is the prerequisite for the telling of this story, but every action in the movie had a logical consequence. There was a firmly established internal logic. You could emotionally and intellectually connect to the characters and feel as though there was a meaningful purpose in the movie and a logical goal that the people were trying to achieve by adhering to the firmly established rules of their universe. The movie was still meaningful because the point of the movie was to tell a heartfelt story of a young couple who were, from the perspective of the viewer, ultimately destined to lose each other under terrible circumstances.		In Interstellar, the prerequisite for the existence of the wormhole is the salvation of humanity, because future humans created the wormhole, which in turn was supposedly used in order to save humanity. Nothing is at stake in this movie because humanity had already been saved from the very beginning, which was the entire mission of the movie.

The other thing I believe is that time travel is NOT possible -- but we can effect time and move information.

To them (the fifth dimensional beings), time isn't any more strict and linear as space is manipulable to us. Moving a marble from the corner of a room to the middle of a table in the room one minute later to us is simple and inconsequential. To a fifth dimensional being, everything they manipulate in our conception of the universe is at that same level. To us it seems like a time loop with the bootstrap paradox, but when time is as malleable as 3-D space is to us, there is no loop. It's just a flatter version of what they experience.		They may feel compelled to manipulate our 4-D space at one time or another in order to make our linear time end up a certain way that to us may seem like a paradox, but to them, it is simple manipulation of one dimension that satisfies their desire. They could do anything at any time if they wanted to, but in this narrative, they have chosen to put Coop in the tesseract and have constructed the tesseract to be a coherent version of the 5th dimension for a 4th dimensional person. That "interference" ultimately ended up leading to the creation of these fifth dimensional beings in the first place, but once you're in that dimension, 4th dimensional causality is no longer a requirement for the existence of these fifth dimensional beings in the first place.		It's hard to articulate because I'm really just trying to describe the reality of a fifth dimensional existence by extrapolating on the shadows of those things that we can see in our dimension, but *Interstellar* really handles the subject well, and I'm trying to articulate what Nolan and his collaborators were getting at in the narrative structure of this film.","depth":11,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Butthole__Pleasures","name":"t1_cpsfkrq","parent_id":"t1_cpsf6yv","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1427462631,"created_utc":1427459031}

{"body":"Amazing movie, my only problem was the very end on the space station where they were on the space station with all the grown crops. To me that defeats the whole purpose of the film.		They were sent into space to find new planets for earth because the blight made it impossible to feed the earth. But when he wakes up on the station, they have crops. They haven't colonized anywhere yet because Anne Hathaway is just setting up on her planet due to relativity. That means they are growing those crops with air, water, and soil that came from earth. If they could isolate elements to prevent blight there was no real need to leave the earth (outside of escaping the EM problems). 		Now I could be wrong about their lack of colonization, they had near-light or ftl travel at the end, perhaps they developed it off of the black hole information. But it was REALLY badly explained in that case and that hurt it for me. This wasn't like Inception where unreliability of perspective is a workable theme and the ambiguous ending allowed for multiple valid theories.

I have since adopted this strategy for all movies now, avoiding over the top trailers that give away the entire movie or are just plain better than the actual movie (Battle of the Five Armies). If it's showing in a theater I'll watch it, but I won't go seek it out online when I get home and I won't click links saying "check out this new trailer for blah blah." It's tough not indulging in them and withholding that but it's really rewarding going into a movie I know I want to see and having no idea what to expect. It removes a lot of expectations, so even if it's a bad movie, I'm not disappointed because it wasn't built up into this great thing in my mind.		edit: I guess my key point is that they let out information so slowly for the promotional material about what this movie was about and even when it was close to the premier they didn't give away the entire movie (at least from what I remember).

That alone would be a cool experience, even if the film wasn't an A+.

{"body":"When I first read what you wrote, I was hesitant to give Spielberg even that much credit...mainly because of how *Interstellar* affected me. What Christopher Nolan did with *Interstellar* made me want to tap into my childhood nature of how to make sense of things. Simplicity. Unobserved emotion. Tars and Case made so much sense this way. I remember watching them for the first time on the screen. I remember knowing that I could put any and all fear into their care. There was never an instant that I thought Tars and/or Case would turn against, or create a negative situation for the crew. 			I think Spielberg had a mastery of this connection just like Nolan. It's not a connection from human to human. It's a connection from individual emotion to understood emotion (viewer to scene). Just like the audience's understanding of Elliot and E.T.  Just like Oskar Schindler and the families he saves.  		Minds learning to trust and love machines/machine behavior. 		It was always a stretch for Spielberg. Especially because of how abstract he had to be with his visual metaphors. But back then Science Fiction movies never paralleled with current affairs, or "in development" news. -- Not that depictions in *Interstellar* are on the assembly line... Just that assumptions and ideologies of today would seem very futuristic even in the early 90's. 		All in all, I'm giving back some of my reservations about how Spielberg treated his stories and his views of, what was then, contemporary society and what *'they'* took for granted. Being born in 1987 definitely made me miss a lot of what made Spielberg's direction *"art"*. I thought for a long time that Spielberg was cheesy and predictable. Growing up has pulled me away from that. I'm biased towards Nolan now because he is reaching cinematic adulthood at the same I'm reaching physiological adulthood, but I'm realizing that Nolan is just continuing an ongoing critique of humanity that Spielberg was a huge part of.		**TL;DR** Both directors make me see things through my almost forgotten lenses of childhood insight.

{"body":"> It's not straight action and it's not straight thriller," Nolan says about the tone of his movie. "I do liken it to the blockbusters I grew up with as a kid. A lot of them by Spielberg. I don't like talking about Spielberg too much because he was the director on the project before me and I don't want to keep coming back to that, but the truth is, there's a great spirit to films like 'Close Encounters [Of The Third Kind]' and 'Jaws' that I really wanted to try and capture, because I haven't seen it in a very long time."		> "I mean, J.J. [Abrams] paid great homage to it in 'Super 8,' but it was a very literal homage. We're trying to do: 'What would that kind of film be now? Not in that period, as J.J. did, but now. It's been a really interesting challenge," Nolan added. "When you say you're making a family film, it has all these pejorative connotations that it'll be somehow soft. But when I was a kid, these were family films in the best sense, and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum. I wanted to bring that back in some way."

This movie is very difficult. To hear your children let you go. To hear your daughter not to let you go. Understand that you are not coming back. Broken promises. And then THAT. I mean if he would come back and she was dead, he would've understood, that would be finale. But he came back and she was there.		To non-fathers it's like "oh well, happy ending he still got to talk to her, blabla bla. yada yada." to me it's more like "he came onto her deathbed, he is still the same, but she is an old woman he knows as a child. And she is definitely dying. He sees his daughter die of age. He sees her legacy all around him which he has NOTHING to do with. And the most difficult thing for him to understand is, THAT HE WAS THE ONE IN THE WRONG TIME FOREVER."		Remember the phrase his father told him in the beginning? Born to 50 years too young, 50 years too old. Cooper was a marginal in his society. He was a marginal on the ship (not a scientist, has family back there). The only place where he was home, was in the fucking black hole tesseract. That's why I cried during that moment in the movie, while others did not understand shit about this moment I was crying because Coop is a guy who's only place is in space fucking suit in the middle of unknown galaxy, in a black hole watching his past in a tesseract. It's like the environment for him is there, that's his destiny. But he is still attached to his family, daughter and he is the one who once again has to make sacrifice more terrible than the others, because others did not make personal sacrifices, greater good, dying civilization as professor said "is too big to understand" for anyone. But Coop understood it more than any other bighead on the ship. Because unlike Brand he had link to his family back there.		In the end Cooper wants to know where we're going for me was literally more like a suicide text, because that day Cooper the old died and he was reborn. But we won't be able to know the continuation.			I think Nolan made one of the best Cameron style movies.

{"body":"> It's an experience		Yes, but as a film it has a lot of flaws.  Someone once said that Nolan reaches beyond his grasp, and that's what divides people about his movies.  On one hand, Interstellar was a powerful experience that has some excellently crafted scenes and bold ideas, on the other hand, it wants to say too much and gives us a glimpse of ideas and characters without giving a satisfying exploration of them.  Plus, Nolan uses too much exposition and ties the plot in knots by giving half explanations that just end up being confusing.  Take the ending for instance.  That controversial scene would have been so much better if what was happening was left to the imagination.  Instead we get the protagonist talking over the whole experience, trying to explain it, and it weakened the resonance of what was happening.  		Also, the film seemed like it had these great ideas about science fiction, but in this case they kept being sacrificed for sentimentality.  Nolan loves emotional catharsis mixed with a kind of existential angst of a single character, but this theory hurts his movies when it takes precedence over the film's themes and ideas.  The coolest scene in interstellar was when they get the surprise about plan A.  It was dark and sparked all these ideas about how they must learn to let go in a way that in most films would be less powerful, but in science fiction becomes uniquely intriguing.  I would have loved for the movie to explore this new idea, along with other new ideas, more, but instead, too much energy is used to focus things on cooper.

What ideas weren't you satisfied with? The ending was amazing! That has *literally* never been done before. That was a totally new and fascinating scene. Many of the complaints from people that had them were that it wasn't scientifically accurate. Okay... it's still a film. This is Nolan's theoretical exploration of an idea. With films like this, it is so well done that people forget it is fictional and not a documentary- even if some of the ideas it utilizes *are* factual and real. You complain above about half-explanations and then you complain about the explanation over the ending. That's a double standard. It is hands down one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, and if people would stop trying to nitpick for little plot holes to try to outsmart Christopher Nolan and just allow themselves to be immersed in the film they would experience something so profound and beautiful.

{"body":"the thing is, you can't criticize the movie toooo heavily. it is a blockbuster, and you have to look at it through that lense.		What I did like:		1. Outstanding cinematography. Some of the shots in the film were extremely breathtaking. Visually, the film was stunning no matter what the scene.	2. Hans Zimmer's score paired so well with the movie and added a lot to some of the scenes. [think of](/s the scene where coop makes a last attempt at docking on the crashing and spinning station). 	3. The choice to err towards practical effects shows a lot of effort and care to separate the movie from almost all major blockbusters.	4. There were, albeit somewhat obvious, plenty of great nods to kubrick.			what i didn't like, though:		1. Nolan tried too often to make the audience feel sympathy for the characters, but they were all developed poorly. [i laughed during the scene](/s when coop cried while watching his kids grow up) because the characters were all so poorly developed. i've seen the movie three times and literally every piece of dialogue is created to move the plot along. 	2. They spoon-fed the science to the audience in some of the most irritating ways. I get that this is a blockbuster and that a giant portion of the crowd in the theaters will not understand a lot of the science, but it was extremely lazy to have nasa engineers/astronauts explaining to each other how wormholes and relativity work.	3.

{"body":"yes, In the same way that I think that star wars is a better film than blade runner (or atleast the earlier cuts). I really liked Interstellar, there are many aspects about that I think are better done here than I've seen in any other movie (how they use the relativity of time, how they mount the camera on the ship, how fucking awesome the robots are, How Nolan creates his world, etc.) despite that I found myself quite emotionally distant throughout the vast majority of the runtime. It was about halfway through that I realized that the film was basically a remake of inception, and as the film progressed the parallels became even more clear. Michael from belated media took the words out of my mouth and said them in his review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca71wbzuWaM&t=1m35s. I also didn't care for a lot of the exposition, which is like a quarter of the movie. I understand that not everyone is informed about wormholes and blackholes and event horizons and such, but how these theories are explained felt incredibly lazy. Like wouldn't it have been better if Cooper explained wormholes to murph/Casey Affleck via video transfer before he enters? Also that speech by Anne Hathaway, man that was rough. 		Interstellar is really good, it's got more great ideas than most of the oscar contenders combined, but it's framed under a really frustrating movie. It's weird cause I think where Interstellar failed, Inception succeeded. Whenever Interstellar cut to Murph during the Dr. Mann scenes I found the film was loosing momentum, but whenever we'd cut between dreams in Inception it would amplify the tension. Both films use the same structure and editing style, but Inceptions is far better fitted to it and is so much more engaging because of it. 		As for Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel that film achieves everything it set out to do, and has kind of became a modern blockbuster classic. I mean it's easily the most popular blockbuster since, well the Avengers. It created a movie star, it launched an unknown director into one of the most known seemingly overnight, it's instantly quotable, it introduced some great 70s songs to a younger generation, and also it has Howard the Duck.

{"body":"> backwards time travel is either paradoxical or nonsensical		Not really, but it really boils down to two things. When traveling backwards you're either you're rewriting a single timeline or creating a new one. It really only depends on whether the movie/book/show decides to go the whole multiverse route or not.		It's pretty clear that interstellar uses the single timeline approach,  the problem is that by doing it that way it's just a huge grandfather paradox (and additionally a bootstrap paradox because of the data TARS had).

In acting, there's a sort of melodrama that doesn't exist in real life, but works on the stage or screen. The problem I had with Serkis is that Gollum was *too good* because it was over-expressive.

{"body":"Yeah sure. For starters there is a massive time travel flaw that anoys the hell out of me. The whole movie is based upon the opening of a worm hole in space. It is explained later that future humans were the ones who created it to save us in the past. However, the movie is very clear about how if they did not find a new planet all life on earth would die. Now we cannot get to a new planet without the worm hole so how did humans manage to survive, find another planet, evolve to the point where they can manipulate time and space to open a worm hole and then open one in order to save the human race in the first place? It's one of those things where the time loop cannot be started without the assumption that we found a way to survive regardless.  And if we found a way to survive regardless why would we need to go back try to change the past, that would negate our existence in the first place?		Also the science of gravity and relativity take way to many liberties. For starters they want to use the theory that if you travel at the speed of light then you will age slower than those on earth. That being said they never come close to the speed of light. The only reason they can travel as far as they did is because of the wormhole not speed of travel. So there is no reason that his children age and the astronauts dont.  Also the concept of a higher rate of gravity causing there to be a difference in time between the ship orbiting the water planet and the surface of the planet is horrifying. Yes it is a real concept but not anywhere near as drastic as they propose. For instance if someone stayed in the international space station for 30 years they would probably  have about an hours worth of time different from someone on earth. The movie suggests that by only increasing the gravity by 30% you see a difference of 20 some odd years. Based only on the time the astronauts were on the surface there would have been virtually no difference in time. That also ruins the point of going to that planet in the first place because they said they had been receiving a signal from it for a long time but by their reasoning the ship had just landed and had not been on the planet long enough to send that signal.		After that they move to Matt going into the black hole . I liked the idea of a construct that allowed people to to view multiple points of time at once but then they ruin it by having Matt suddenly know how to manipulate things in these time frames by making vague reaching gestures off screen. As if that wasn't weird enough they jump the shark immediately by suddenly giving him he ability to reprogram a simple wind up watch to describe the entire physics of the black hole using only Morse code. How did he reprogram the watch? How could it possibly hold that much information? That's got to be a couple terabytes of info at least. How do you translate physics equations with Morse code? None of that makes any sense.		Finally he gets back home where there should not be any time difference to find that his young daughter is now dying of old age. However she was able to use the information from here watch to finally launch the massive space station into orbit to save the human race.  They ignore the fact thought that they then had decades to study and travel through the wormhole to find a planet but never did. Then Matt steals a ship to go back through the wormhole. Why did he need to steal it? Shouldn't they have wanted him to go? Shouldn't they have been sending more people through now that they knew what was on the other side?		I guess for the most part I didn't like how the story seemed to have to change to fit what the director wanted to show. What he wants to show and what the story is should be a more coherent line. He wanted there to be more drams so he forced the children to grow up without a father. They wanted the journey to be hard so they made one of the astronauts have to spend decades alone.

{"body":"TARS was great. Too bad most of the movie sucked something awful. The story on earth just didn't sell me and neither did the actors performances. I just didn't give two shits about any of them. You could see the whole time travel thing about 100 miles away. The only good parts were the space parts after they went through the wormhole and before the time travel bullshit and ridiculously stretched out ending. This movie could have been about two hours shorter and would have been far better for it. Or maybe it should have been a series of three films. Whatever the case this movie just tried to do WAY too much and missed the mark almost the whole time because of it.","depth":0,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"crypticgeek","name":"t1_cpsky2l","parent_id":"t3_30gbrs","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1427473636,"created_utc":1427470036}
