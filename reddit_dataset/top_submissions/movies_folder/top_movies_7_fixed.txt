[(inside the Gigahorse)](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/roadwarrior/images/2/22/Control_box.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150305122344)		From the Mad Max Wiki: The Gigahorse is powered by two Chevrolet 502Cid (502Hp) Big Block V8 crate motors with fabricated manifolds and functioning 8/71 superchargers. Both engines are connected through a custom gearbox. Anthony Natoli of Natoli Engineering designed the straight cut gear system joining the two engines. The gearbox adapter was then modeled by the movie's art director Jacinta Leong in AutoCAD, all the components were waterjet cut, assembled and originally connected to a Turbo 400 automatic transmission which was later replaced with Allison automatic truck transmission. The custom gearbox system had to be re-shimmed after each day of filming by film's main mechanic - Mark McKinley. The engine setup is fully functional generating approximately 1200 horse power. The vehicle also has a non functioning (dummy) set of turbochargers feeding into superchargers. Originally the two engines were supposed to be dummy motors made of fiberglass with a single real engine hidden inside, but the production designer - Colin Gibson provided additional budget which allowed to equip the Gigahorse with an actual working engine setup.		The vehicle is equipped with tractor tyres, the rear ones being 70" in diameter. The differential and reducer systems were taken from a pair of Terex four-wheel drive front-end loaders. The massive hubs gave a 16:1 drive ratio for a 95km/h top speed.","depth":2,"score":178,"ups":178,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zimzilla","name":"t1_crpoiaf","parent_id":"t1_crpnrjf","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1432969038,"created_utc":1432965438}

The canyon is in an ecologically sensitive/protected area (if it really is the one I'm thinking of). That's probably why they limited the amount of shots there. The really destructive stuff they did elsewhere, and then did a composite to get the finished version.		I was there on a desert tour. Our driver had worked as a driver on the film (not for stunts-- just to help move everything in and out). So we were in the canyon and he pointed out where the cameras were and said "they jumped one car over another".		Now it was over a year ago, and memories do get confused... so maybe it was for another sequence. But I'm pretty sure it's a real location, which they did limited (non destructive) filming in.

I believe it's supposed to be a collection of mostly unrelated stories, centered around the idea of a man who helps certain groups of people at certain times, and then sort of fades away until "he" is needed again. I don't think there is necessarily even ONE actual Max. It's more like all these stories are being told many years after their occurrence, and over time they have evolved and been distilled down into containing one conceptual protagonist, ie Max.

{"body":"I started writing this out and realized that I had gone way overboard with it. I have 79 separate podcasts in my que and these are the best of the best as far as movies and tv go. There's a lot of other shows that I can mention that are more comedy based if you're interested.		Gotta give a shoutout to /r/podcasts, a small community for podcast hosts and listeners alike. They rock. Here's my recommendations.		**Movie Podcasts**		[We Hate Movies:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/we-hate-movies/id405271228?mt=2) Four guys from New York talk about bad movies every week. A pretty standard format but I think they do it better than anyone. They've done over 200 episodes so there's a huge back-catalogue. It's not all on Itunes but all the older ones are on [their website.] (http://www.whmpodcast.com/p/episodes.html) I really recommend to start with any movie you've seen. I loved the Crystal Skull episode, Phantom Menace, Batman Forever and the Ewok Adventures episodes. They even have their own subreddit that they go to frequently /r/WeHateMovies		[How Did This Get Made:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/how-did-this-get-made/id409287913?mt=2) This one is pretty popular so you've probably already heard of it. Another bad movie podcast. This was one of the first shows I ever started listening to and it's great if you like repeated catchphrases and the personalities of the hosts. I haven't listened in a few months, but I'm sure it's still a solid show.		[Plumbing The Death Star:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/plumbing-the-death-star/id907039089?mt=2) A bunch of Australian 20-somethings (or maybe New Zealand, I still can't tell half the time) talk about the theory behind movie universes. Stuff like when a toy actually becomes sentient in Toy Story, what medichlorians actually are, or how Thor cuts his hair. All around, very silly and fun but they make a lot of interesting points that are fun to think about.		[Modern Myth Media:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/modern-myth-media-for-audiences/id426191666?mt=2) Superhero movie news! They usually have episodes out a day or so after news breaks and they always have something interesting to say about it, with speculation from their vast comic knowledge. Not usually very funny but hugely informative.		[The Canon:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-canon/id935764143?mt=2) Devin Farraci and Amy Nicholson choose a movie every week and debate about whether it should be part of the canon of classic films. Really heavy on debate so you spend a lot of time listening to them argue but I think they're both film critics/writers so they know their stuff. If you're willing to accept that maybe Gone With The Wind or Shawshank Redemption isn't a classic, then give them a listen.		[Worst Idea Of All Time:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/worst-idea-of-all-time-podcast/id824108207?mt=2) This show is the diamond in the rough and it's absolute insanity. Two guys from Australia watched Grown Ups 2 and talked about it **every week for a year.** And they hated this fucking movie. It's crazy how much pain they put themselves through for something with no monetary value or anything. Then they decided to do it again with Sex and the City 2. They're about 16 episodes into "season 2". It's madness.		**TV Podcasts**		[Scarlett Velocity:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/scarlet-velocity-flash-podcast/id918969498?mt=2) I love the CW Flash show and I've been looking for a good podcast aftershow about it since the season started around 8 months ago. I kind of gave up until I found this one. If you love Flash and want to hear in-depth conversation about each episode, they're solid.		[The X-Files Files:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/kumail-nanjianis-x-files-files/id885275285?mt=2) Kumail Nanjiani (Indoor Kids Podcast and HBO's Sillicon Valley) talks about every episode of X-Files with a weekly guest. Kumail is really funny and obviously loves the show so it's an interesting podcast to listen to.		[Worst Episode Ever:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/worst-episode-ever-simpsons/id932491422?mt=2) Two Simpsons fans watch a random episode of the show that they may or may not have seen, then rank them on their list in an effort to find the worst episode ever.		**Shows I host**		I've been hosting podcasts since February and I would be an idiot not to mention them but I would feel kind of scummy not giving a disclaimer saying they were mine. **I didn't write this excessively long write-up just to plug my own shows but they do fit what you were looking for so check them out if you're interested.**		[The Adam Sandcast:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-adam-sandcast/id965607332?mt=2) We talk about a different Adam Sandler movie every week, chronologically making our way through his catalogue. I had a cohost for awhile but now have weekly guests I meet on Reddit. Sound quality was shotty at first but gets better around The Wedding Singer.		[Cynical Cartoons Podcast:] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cynical-cartoons/id982797233?mt=2) My brother and I talk about Adult Swim's Rick and Morty every week. The format has changed a bit since the beginning but usually, we talk about the theory of how things work in the world of the show. We also do the show in video format on our YouTube channel.		**TL;DR** I love podcasts and may have gone too far with this recommendation. This isn't a copypasta or anything so I hope you listen to a few of these. They're all terrific and I might even post this list as a self post on this sub.","depth":5,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Aquaman_Forever","name":"t1_crpoi36","parent_id":"t1_crpnif0","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1432969020,"created_utc":1432965420}

My opinion lately, although I haven't expressed it on the show, is that Sandler needs to be out of the public eye before he can start making consistently good movies. I just watched The Longest Yard last week, where Burt Reynolds plays a character in the remake of his own movie 30 years later and I said it would be cool to see Sandler play the coach in a remake made in 2035 and it occured to me that Adam Sandler could potentially keep making movies for a very long time. I don't see him as someone who will cling to slapstick, lowbrow Grown Ups 2 humor for the next 20-30 years so he'll either		**A)** Retire and colonize his own planet because he totally could.		**B)** Make only the movies that really matter like Reign Over Me, Punch Drunk Love, etc.		**C)** Keep choosing the roles he's doing now and producing Mall Cop movies for the rest of his life.

{"body":"I forgot where I read it but there's a pretty convincing theory about how Sandler tried a few years ago to pivot into maturity with funny people, and he worked very hard on it and it didn't make much money and he took the criticism personally... so he just realized that grown-ups are EASY and they PAY SO MUCH MONEY and best of all he can hire his friends and they film in hawaii or wherever he'd like, it's a very obvious scam but since people still pay to see grown-up 3, it's not going to stop.

{"body":"I think it's interesting to see the movies he did on either side of Funny People. I haven't seen any of these in a few years (Trying to save them for the show at the moment) but I remember Bedtime Stories and Zohan being just as bad as Grown Ups and Jack and Jill. The sad thing is that his lowest box office movies are primarily his dramas. Punch Drunk Love made nothing and it's a beautiful movie so it kind of sucks that that's not going to be as common for him.		It's been interesting to see what works and what doesn't when you look at these movies critically.

{"body":"That's because movie explosions don't look very much like most 'real world' explosions.		An movie explosion like this is carefully crafted. The big yellow flames and oily black smoke come from igniting a lot of gasoline or some other flammable substance that'll create a lot of flame.		By comparison most real world explosions have very little flame and a lot of dust while lasting much briefer than a billowing cloud of burning gasoline. Not very impressive.		At the same time nitro cannons or other directional explosive devices are used to create directional force instead of fire. These are used to blow off doors, wheels and other big easy to see objects in the direction the director wants during the explosion. Sometimes they're used to push the entire vehicle or object into the air or another direction as if thrown by the explosion.		Quite often individual parts of the object that get's blown up are crafted out of some material that'll splinter, shatter or otherwise break in a satisfactory manner. Instead of a solid chunk of wood, a panel might be made of strips of balsa wood or even spaghetti glued together and painted as if it's a solid plate. This will allow the special effects guys to get pieces flying everywhere with much less force than it would take to disintegrate a solid oak panel.		And the reason this doesn't look too different to cgi explosions is that many cgi explosions are really just pre recorded practical explosions that are composed into a scene. They can often look fake because the explosion footage was blended poorly into the scene or the scene was poorly prepared to have an explosion added.","depth":4,"score":108,"ups":108,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheSecretMe","name":"t1_crppqd9","parent_id":"t1_crpixlm","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1432973425,"created_utc":1432969825}

To be fair, Sir Ian McKellan wasn't crying because he was working on green screen, but because he was working in a very difficult real/green screen live composite. He was to work on a smaller wizard-sized green screen set in complete synchronicity with the hobbit/dwarf actors who were acting on the real, hobbit-sized set.  He had an earpiece so he could hear their dialogue, and the camera was controlled automatically so it would be in perfect ratio-corrected sync with the camera on the real set. He found it (naturally) very difficult to meet his cues and remember where the actors were supposed to be at any given time, and honestly I think that any actor would have deeply struggled with that. In the end they got a great scene out of it, but it was definitely a case of the director just expecting too much.

{"body":"Yes, the plot is very good. It IS a ton of action, but all the action is 'earned' in the service of the story. 		The plot is not overly complex or heavy, but it's not too simplistic or predictable either. There isn't any stupid audience-pandering dialogue (you know, where a character says something just for the benefit of the audience). In fact the movie makes you think by forcing you to infer what's going on from the visuals instead of relying on insipid dialogue. 		And the characters are very, very good - by the end of the movie, you actually really care about the characters and are worried about their safety; the movie does a really good job of this. 		There's also a lot at stake in the film, both for the villain and the protagonists, and that ups the ante. 		Here's the (very generalized) plot, without spoiling a damned thing, I hope: There's a warlord in the post-apocalypse who is in control of important resources, some of which are human beings. Some people in the movie take a stand against him for morality's sake (in a world where morality is in short supply), and rob him of those resources, and he comes after them in full force. Therefore you are presented with some great themes in the film, about personal responsibility and moral choice versus heartless pragmatism, in a world in which it would be really easy to just look out for your own ass and ignore everyone else's problems. 		So yeah, there is a ton of action, but you shouldn't be worried, it's not just 'action porn', every scene has something at stake, and it's one of those action movies where you're actually gripping the armrest with your fingernails because someone onscreen is in danger, not the kind where you're yawning from boredom while some ninja does a flying kick or whatever. Despite being a huge cinematic spectacle, it's actually not overly stylized like many action films, which is impressive. 		Oh and you don't need to be familiar with the originals, I haven't seen them either. This is apparently a sort of pseudo-reboot or remix or something (continuity doesn't matter, from what I understand).

They certainly won't think it is horrible, but contrary to the consensus of this subreddit it is not a must see movie for everyone.		On the one hand, I would say that Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film since The Dark Knight (having not seen John Wick). But we can say with certainty that it is only the best action movie of the past seven years. That is, we know The Dark Knight was better. Even if you didn't like action films, you might love that movie. With Mad Max, you have to like action. If you don't like action films, you will probably be bored by this movie. Yes, there is some decent character development, but the dramatic elements are really under utilized compared to the action. Don't get me wrong, the plot is good and the acting is good, but this movie is not for everyone.

The Dark Knight also has its irritating political commentary (illegal eavesdropping is OK if the good guys do it!), and directing action scenes is [definitely not Chris Nolan's strong suite](http://www.openculture.com/2011/12/anatomy_of_a_flawed_action_scene.html) - later confirmed in TDKR's fight scenes which featured extras falling down despite no punches coming remotely near. 		And this is just a personal note, but, I've seen The Dark Knight three times total, once in the theater, and twice since. I've seen Mad Max twice in the theater already, and I will see it at least once more in the theater while I have the chance.

It was just an off the shoulder comment that pissed off a bunch of artsy neckbeards that now want to use every technical argument they can rip from their ass on me and it is hilarious.		I would have also listed down how Rotten Tomatoes also only gives fresh tomatoes to older movies and family films. Still not an action or Horror movie from this decade fresher than 95 so my point still stands.		The thread doesn't at all explain why I'm a fucking idiot it's just a meta circlejerk "DAE" subreddit. I also love how people keep shoving the word "pretentious" in my mouth, too.		I'll give you one thing and it's that you fucking neckbeards sure are imaginative. I mean it's amazing how you got "Mad Max is probably the only movie above a 95 on Rotten Tomatoes that isn't a pretentious boring foreign art house film" out of "Also probably the first summer action movie or any movie that isn't some boring ass "art" house or foreign film to get anything above 95% on rotten tomatoes so it's also got that going for it.".		Since you guys love to be so technical all of the time telll me where I said anything CLOSE to pretentious to describe anything in that sentence? The only hostile adjective in there is "boring"..

I meant shitty 3 hour long oscar bait movies about some dude with cancer and has limp dick syndrome from his chemotherapy or some shit and has to find a woman who can finally get his dick hard. The woman is some snooty chick who knows every one of his cheesy one liners and has no issue calling him out on it.		You see you neckbeards twisted it to "pretentious" because you know everyone else eats situations like that up. I was the uncultured retard who can't appreciate good movies and only watches action movies with big explosions because that's the only thing my simple fucking mind can comprehend...

When you see a group of people uniformly adorned--in this case, they've all colored their skin white, you assume it's some sort of cult-like organization.  Given this is a post-apocalyptic genre piece, it's kind of a given that strange organizations like this could spring up.  This becomes more clearly shown shortly after when the leader (forgot his name) speaks to the people.		In that scene, when the leader speaks to the people, you catch glimpses of people in the crowd with terrible deformities, and people close to the leader with terrible deformities.  I can't recall too well, but I think it may have been addressed by then through narration as well that a lot of the planet was damaged by humans.  The combination of the post-apocalyptic setting, deformed people, and degradation of the earth would lead you to intuit that these people probably have cancer.  Whatever happened to cause the apocalypse had terrible health consequences, so Max being used as a "blood bag" made sense to help these people who were suffering from illnesses.  		Anyway, you probably figured out all of that by the end anyway, but that's what I figured out within the first 15 or so minutes of watching the movie.

{"body":"VFX worker here. Am also frustrated about the lack of exposure of what actually goes into VFX. Usually the best exposes are done for animated features, which follow a very similar process compared to live-action VFX.		>What applications do they use?		Depending on what you're doing, there are a few and which ones are used greatly depend on the part in the pipeline your in. Creating animated films or VFX is akin to a giant assembly line, expept it's all digital assembly. This image is more geared towards animated film, but it gives a great represtantion of the stages in the a pipeline. http://imgur.com/okwu84D		For VFX we need to separate into several sections. CG and  post production on live-action plates. For software, CG elements typically use CG modeling packages very similar to ones that game devs use. In our case we use Autodesk Maya for base modelling, rigging, animation, and lighting. We use Zbrush for high-detail digitial sculpting (where we take the base 3d models from Maya and really work them over in a fashion similar to what a scultpor would if it was made of clay only digitally) and we use a combination of Mari and Photoshop for texturing. In order to get the 3d world we built to match the real world, we need to create a virtual camera and sync it up to where the real camera would be; we use Boujou and Nuke for that. Rendering, we tend to use Arnold or VRay depending on the project. FX (things like explosions, dust, water, fire) we use Houdini and Houdini's renderer of Mantra. When we render, we separate out CG models from FX from CG backgrounds in layers and we use applications like Nuke to merge those layers back together in compositing. We then use Nuke and After Effects to clean up the live action plates (paint out wires and pimples and nipples), cut the actors out (rotoscoping) and place them into our composite.		>Where do they get the part of the shot that's not in the before image (like the throngs of people, the rocks and the vehicles)?		We build them digitally. We build 3D models of each of these which is like a digital posable doll or prop. For crowds, in particular, we make up some code wizardly so that we can assemble the various people by using smaller building blocks and general animations. Basically we make 5 full people, 20 heads and we give the custom-built program limits of what the can randomly change from the 5 people and then randomly change on the heads to make a crowd of uniqe-ish digital people.		> How do you marry them together? How do you erase the stuff you don't want?		Compositing is that process. Think of compositing as drawing on clear screens. If on one screen you draw a cat and on the next screen you draw a flower at a different position. If you put the flow screen on top of the cat screen and take a photo, it would look like you drew a cat AND a flower on one screen.		Erasing stuff works the same way. It also works similarly to painting when talking about getting rid of things that we initially photographed. We just paint over it.

{"body":"The movie begins with stock footage of riots/wars/politions mixed with Mad Max 1 clips, with a voice over of an old man giving the backstory: 		"My life fades, my vision dims..........2 great warrior tribes went to war, for reasons long forgotten.........Max, the warrior Max, a burnt out shell of a man" this section is in 4:3 aspect ratio, but the movie is in widescreen so it looks tiny when watching it on TV.		Then it opens up to the full screen of Max speeding down a road in the Intercepter, he has a dog with him and he's being chases by some bikes and a car.		There's a brief chase which involves Wez getting an arrow in arm, a car crashing and Max turning on/off his supercharger a few times.		Max stops at wrecked truck, and finds 2 dead/dying bodies and some leaking fuel. He gathers the petrol in containers, meanwhile Wez pulls the arrow out of his arm, yells and rides away.		Later Max is driving and spots the Gyro-Copter and investigates, he's attacked by a snake, but grabs it before it can bite him. Then the Gyro captain climbs out of the sand and they briefly tussle before Max and Dog overpower him.		He bargains with Max and tells him where to find a Gas refinery. They travel together in the Intercepter with Gyro having a shotgun pointed at his face, with the trigger attached to Dog.		They find the refinary and setup camp on a nearby hill and observe. They eat dog food. People from the refinary try and escape, but they are run down my marauders. A woman is raped/killed and a man is left for dead. Max arrives and makes a deal: If he brings him home, he'll receive a tank of fuel for his car.		However the man dies before he can verify this deal with the Refinary leader, Papagallow, and Max is handcuffed. This is when Lord Humongus (the ayollya of rock and rolla) is introduced. The Feral Kid is also introduced here, and he kills Wez's boyfriend and cuts off the Chevy Chase look-a-like's fingers. Max says he can help the settlers get the Gas out of the wasteland.			Papagallow agrees and gives Max some fuel to bring the Truck from earlier to the compound. Max sets off into the night with jerry-cans of fuel. The Feral Kid helps him avoid being caught by Humungus's gang.		The next morning he finds Gyro Pilot walking home, still chained to a log. He un ties him and they walk back to the Copter and find a dead bandit (Snakes got him), who had some shotgun shells, and it's revealed that the gun Max was threatening everybody with was unloaded.		They fly the Gyro Copter to the truck, Max drives and the Pilot flies back to the Refinary. As they approach Max is attacked by Humoungus's gang and the truck is damaged, barely making it into the compound.		The settlers get to work repairing the truck and Papagallow asks Max to drive it when they escape, Max declines and just wants fuel for the Intercepter. Meanwhile there's some sub plots of Gyro Pilot and blonde girl romance, and Feral Kid wanting to come with Max.		Max leaves by himself, but he is run off the road by Wez and the marauders. He his injured and Chevy Chase look-a-like sets off the bomb inside the Interceptor.		Gyro Pilot see's the explosion and rescues Max. Later Max agrees to drive the truck.		Then the big finale happens, Max plows the truck through the Maruders cars and they chase him, allowing the settlers to escape. The refinary also explodes.		The chase is an extended action scene, with multiple people dying, boarding the truck, and cars crashing. Wez ends up stuck to the front of the truck, and Humungus crashs his car into it, killing them both. The truck rolls over and it's revealed there was no fuel, just sand.		The settlers all leave, the fuel stored in barrels in the other cars, and Max is left in the Wasteland. The narrator also reveals that he was the Feral Kid, and the settlers made it to "the great northern tribe".","depth":5,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Flint_Vorselon","name":"t1_crpko67","parent_id":"t1_crpji6b","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1432959081,"created_utc":1432955481}

{"body":"> Fewer bullets = more suspense		... Why is that? Do you have proof that Road Warrior had fewer anyway?		> Limited petrol = more suspense		Uh, no it doesn't. The movies have different conflicts. Max and the others on the run from a band of crazy people who want to use the women as sex slaves is suspenseful enough without Max (*and* the villains) worrying about running out of gas. When the truck Max was in got stuck in the mud, it was pretty much the same as if it ran out of gas and they had to refill it before people caught up with them.		> Mechanically realistic vehicles = more suspense		Two things. One, the vehicles in Mad Max were driven through a desert, so I don't see what's so unbelievable about them. Two, how does that guarantee more suspense? Vehicular realism isn't important to the series. Batman movies have suspense in the car chases with the Batmobile.		> Medically realistic people = more suspense		George Miller bases all the disfigured people on actual shit he's seen. He was a medical doctor.		> Geographically realistic chases = more suspense		Two things. One, what was so unrealistic about the Mad Max geography? Yeah some of the places they drove through weren't real, but they were all very possible. Two, *how does that make it more suspenseful?* The movie takes place in a post-apocalypse, the geography being different would make perfect sense and in no way make the situation seem less dire.		I think the only important difference is that The Road Warrior focuses more on story and Fury Road focuses more on action.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RedBarrel","name":"t1_crpjm90","parent_id":"t1_crphioq","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1432956865,"created_utc":1432953265}

{"body":"Ok. I just saw this movie yesterday and absolutely *HATED* every second of it. Prepare for the most high octane (a-yuk a-yuk, a-thank you very much) take downs of a movie that you have ever read. I'm about to prove that all of the unwarrented hype for this shit fest of a movie is totally unjustified. Spoilers ahead!		Mad Max is your basic cookie cutter post apocalyptic story. Period. Nothing special here in the story telling at all. Mad Max (played by a lackluster Tom Hardy) is a post apocalyptic... something. He gets kidnapped in the beginning by some white skinned bald people, and we have no idea why -- this is one of the biggest flaws with this movie. There's no exposition, no explanation. This movie could have benefitted *A LOT* from some continual voice over to tell us what the fuck was happening. Instead, we were left to parse it out for ourselves, and that task was nearly impossible. After a Benny Hill-esque chase with the white skinned bald guys, we then go find out that Charlize Theron, who plays a skinhead lesbian, is driving a truck for some reason, and this bad guy, Immortal Joe, likes to pour water on his city's inhabitants. Yes, I'm not kidding, these scenes happen with no explanation.		Charlize Theron drives the truck in one direction, then inexplicably drives off the road into the desert. Why? We never find out. This pisses off Immortal Joe, and he gets everyone to chase after her. It turns out the lesbian has captured his daughters, and he wants them back. Meanwhile, Mad Max is being used as a "blood bag" (also unexplained) for Nicholas Hoult, who has left any potential career he had after 'About a Boy' in the dirt. They ride off to help Immortal Joe, then for some reason join up with Lesbian Theron. 		What ensues is possibly the most boring, macho, tired cliche car chase in the history of movies. There are lots of explosions and people are dying, but we don't care because we don't know why. Eventually, Lesbian Theron and Mad Max get to this lesbian paradise, which turns out to suck, so they head back to the city they came from. That's right, they negate the entire first two-thirds of the movie by deciding to go back. More car chases, more explosions. Nicholas Hoult kills himself to stop Immortal Joe. They get back to the city and Lesbian Theron is almost dead. But wait! She's not a lesbian! They decide to interject a fucking *love story* in the last two minutes of the movie between Mad Max and Theron.

VFX is about control, and controlling aspects that you normally can't. If you have one car, and you need to blow it up; you have to either be extra meticulous that the explosion is exactly what you want and you have all the camera angles that you could possibly want OR you leave the results up to the fates and environmental factors that you can't control. 		Simple VFX changes like background replacements help save on logistics and make it easier to get your acting crew together or even have them act completely separate of each other. VFX is very friendly to the very busy people because it defers and spreads the decision's out over a long period of time. Hell, it makes it easier to even get scenes added in post because the current cut doesn't make sense and they don't always have to wait for the actors' schedules to free up. They'll just use a digital double. That's why VFX will continue to be used in every film regardless of if you like it or not. You're putting up $20 a person; the producer is putting up millions upon millions and the directors/actors are putting up months of their time...if VFX makes their lives easier, then it will ALWAYS overrule your $20.
