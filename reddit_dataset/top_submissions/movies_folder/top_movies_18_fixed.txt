That is true, I won't argue that, but does that mean that that's what people will think? My point is to consider both scenarios: 		True Threat- Every movie theatre across America that decided to ignore the threat is destroyed *and* various locations nearby. Countless innocents are lost, and sensationalist headlines like "Sony had the power to stop this" and "All for a Dollar" are published along with war rallies against N. Korea. "[We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.	(If your house is nearby, you???d better leave.)](http://variety.com/2014/film/news/sony-hackers-threaten-911-attack-on-movie-theaters-that-screen-the-interview-1201380712/)"		False Threat- Sony pulls back the movie. Everyone bashes Sony like their decisions ever mattered for America as a whole before, and 2-3 weeks later when everything has blown over and settled, Sony publishes the movie.

Which explains why "having an affect" is not really a thing, but would be kind of reasonable for certain insults.

The words you type from your computer are beamed all over the world and made available to millions upon millions of people and sent directly into their head the instant they see them.

Would they ever just pull the movie themselves?		>BEL BRUNO: That's the question that we're asking. The belief is no - that what they're trying to do - at least the tactic that our sources are telling us is you kind of put it on the theater owners. That way Sony doesn't have to make that decision, the theater owners do. **And theater owners are privately telling us that they're angry at Sony for putting them in that position. There's no contract between theater owners and Sony, so there couldn't be any lawsuits from that.**		I think that line is the most important there. Sony first put the theatres in a position where they have to decide themselves if they want to pull the movie or not. Then when the Theatres chose to, Sony said, we will pull the movie. This was a calculated move to preserve Sony itself, they werent backed into anything in my opinion. Sony could have easily said, we will show the movie and the theatres would have backed them, instead Sony chose to preserve their bottom line on that chance that if they didnt move first and see what Theatres would do first, there was a chance the movie could still be shown.		Its classic game theory here, theres no advantage to first mover in this game and Sony knew that very well. Because if they came out to actually back up their "We are sad to see movies censored" claim, then they would have easily just said we are showing the movie and would have had the backing of the Theatres because neither of them want to lose money.","depth":4,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"darkenspirit","name":"t1_cmyo04l","parent_id":"t1_cmym34p","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1418919911,"created_utc":1418919911}

While North Korea does possess the super advanced 1945 technology of the nuclear bomb (though for what it is worse, the bombs have a yield roughly half that of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs), you can see  here they have no actual missilse capable of delivering it to the United States, with the exception of somewhere in the Alaskan Wilderness if we're being kind. 		Lets not forget the Cheonan case where North Korea blamed the entire thing on the US and then warned them to ["behave itself, mindful of the grave consequences."](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-05/28/c_13321709.htm)		Of course, North Korea also spoke out against Team America and tried to get it banned as well, but their reaction then was a bit softer, different head of state, and also that was during a period of the beginning of the Six Party talks. So they had to temper their reaction.		It also [Doesn't Sound like South Korea](http://www.newsweek.com/activists-send-interview-north-korea-balloon-292767) is too worried.		In short, North Korea's own bluster is the only thing that has caused them to turn into "some Mickey Mouse Shit" and I suggest you read up a little bit on it.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Pennwisedom","name":"t1_cmypchy","parent_id":"t1_cmyoq9m","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1418922433,"created_utc":1418922433}

Is there probable cause for every single person who goes through an airline established? No. Is a warrant signed by a judge for search? No? That contract that comes with your airline ticket isn't valid because of what can happen if you refuse. Hell, it's still cohersion when we look at the option of not flying. You want me to drive across the US for multiple days or consent to search and be there in a matter of hours?

{"body":">I am certainly no lawyer so someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this only applies when you are in a public setting		Absolutely not. You have rights innately. They don't change with the tide or your location.		 >An airline/TSA can set policies that require searches when you want to fly on an airplane		An airline may, the TSA cannot (and should not) be able to. An airline does not have the capacity to arrest or detain you. You can negotiate your contract, even. The government cannot *force* everyone to be searched as a condition of travel. 		>If I want to take the subway in NYC, my stuff is subject to search.		It absolutely is not. Unless of course you consent. The TSA forces consent by providing no other option.		> If I want to go to a baseball game, my stuff is subject to search to enter the stadium.		Again, by a private entity which doesn't have a duty to enforce the law and can imprison you. You seem not to get the difference between government and private individuals.		> If I want to fly on an airplane, my stuff is subject to search		If the government isn't doing it then yeah. Because again, private entities don't have a monopoly on use of force, and the ability to imprison people.		>I still don't see how any of this is unlawful.		You're not differentiating between the state and a private entity. We have rights. So do private persons and to some degree, businesses. Businesses have the right to limit their liability. This may include limiting what people can have in their carry on. This does not violate the rights of the people within the contract because they can choose to take part in the endeavor, negotiate terms, etc.		 However, the state derives its power from the people and, the one goal above all others is to protect the rights of people. So the government can and should not be able to search all of it's citizens who fly, because all people are equal in the eyes of the law. People who fly do not have less rights than people who drive. Or walk.","depth":9,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"maflickner","name":"t1_cmyxik6","parent_id":"t1_cmyu9nf","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1418936790,"created_utc":1418936790}

Great, but that doesn't matter in our current reality, because they didn't need to "start something". Why not? Because their threats are apparently credible enough for companies in the *most powerful nation on earth* to take them seriously. In terms of the power plays that a starving third world nation can make, this is not insignificant.

It's the same thing as when a convenience store chain tells their employees not to fight back against a robber. Corporate headquarters doesn't care whether their employees get killed or not, they care about their cash. If an employee dies or is injured, that introduces all kinds of possibilities for lawsuits. They're not "scared" they're just enforcing policies give them the best odds of conserving the most money.		And that's all that Sony is doing. They are using a worst-case-scenario to compare how much money they would lose after a theater blows up to how much they would lose by pulling it now. They're not "afraid", nor do they care that people would die. They care that they might be associated with it and have to pay out to the families of said people.		About the only thing that lends any "credibility" to this farce is now that the announcement has been made, *anyone*, doesn't have to be Korea, could do something stupid and Sony would be in a world of shit.

Lawsuits are the corporate equivalent of injury, and as such they are definitely something corporations fear. Fear of lawsuits is definitely still fear, and it can be an incredibly detrimental thing. It's the main reason behind the prevalence of zero-tolerance policies in schools, for one thing. 		>About the only thing that lends any "credibility" to this farce is now that the announcement has been made, anyone, doesn't have to be Korea		No, Korea made the threat and an American (and Japanese) institutions caved to it- the threat was treated as credible in the first place, and that cred goes to NK. This incident increased the credibility of North Korean terror threats in the eyes of the public, since it's the first significant acknowledgment thereof. Again, I don't think there's a precedent for something like this- prove me wrong?		>Some bored kid could throw a dry-ice bomb made out of a soda bottle in through the exit door and set off a media frenzy of bad PR for them that would cost them more than scrapping the whole thing.

A threat doesn't have to really be credible, it just has to be theoretically possible to carry out.

Plus, American media outlets really spun it up into a big deal, which is why even a minor incident would be regarded as a big deal at this point.

{"body":"It really would take quiet a while because there's so much to go over, but one of the biggest things that stands out to me as awful is the character reversal. We're supposed to understand that Qui-Gon Jinn is the wise Jedi master of Obi-Wan, yet he often does some pretty underhanded stuff like trying to make Watto accept worthless money, lying about Anakin's podracer, fixing a legit bet (when Watto roll his dice), taking Anakin under his wing when the council tells him not to, and taking this kid into the middle of a battlefield. In Episode II Obi-Wan is always on Anakin about being patient, thinking, etc etc. What does he do when the assassin droid flies up to the window, immediately jumps out the window and grabs it when it could have done anything to him. Also jumping into the middle of a legion of battle droids to fight Grievous when they could have shot him to pieces. Don't forget that Anakin was pretty much a loose cannon cop and psycho in II, but in the beginning of III he suddenly wants to be noble and help expendable clones. 		I highly highly recommend that everyone watch [these reviews](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/) (gotta scroll down some).

It's hard to buy into the love story aspect because you're also watching Anakin lose his mind, which kind of makes you question Padme's judgment. 		People who grew up on the original trilogy were excited about the prequels because we wanted to see that epic Obi-Wan vs Anakin fight; and maybe learn a little about what major event caused Anakin to become so bad.

{"body":"> Produced by Britain's Channel 4 television network and co-written and directed by Gabriel Range, "Death of a President," or "DOAP" as it has come to be called by its publicists, has garnered understandable notoriety after making its debut at the Toronto Film Festival and being picked up by the same studio that distributed "The Passion of the Christ." Two theater chains have refused to show the movie, which uses real-life news footage and flawless computerized special effects to create a chilling approximation of an assassination, and a few television and radio networks have decided not to air advertisements.		[Also from their wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_President_\(2006_film\)#Response), 		> The central conceit of Death of a President was much criticised by those who believed it exploited the subject of presidential assassination, and that by doing so, was in bad taste. Gretchen Esell of the Texas Republican Party described the subject matter saying, "I find this shocking, I find it disturbing. I don't know if there are many people in America who would want to watch something like that."[7] Hillary Clinton, then junior United States Senator from New York, told The Journal News of Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam counties at the annual New Castle Community Day in Chappaqua that, "I think it's despicable. I think it's absolutely outrageous. That anyone would even attempt to profit on such a horrible scenario makes me sick."[8]		> The Japanese motion picture ethics committee, the Eirin, prevented Death of a President from being shown in most cinemas in 2007, saying that the film's Japanese title ("Bush Ansatsu", translated as "Bush Assassinated") is inappropriate.		Regal and Cinemark, along with various media outlets, refused to show or promote the film. So basically, yes, someone did make content depicting the assassination of a then living head of state. But he got lambasted for it. Even the supporters of the films remark on its controversial nature. 		TL;DR: 		Can we choose to compromise? You are correct in that certain movies won't get axed (this one because it was smaller studios who wanted the controversy) but that the depiction of the assassinations / killings of heads of states usually receive large blow backs from society. There seems to be a common sentiment that making such films, even for mockumentaries / satire, is wrong. (Btw, this film lost money as the budget was 1 million but made less than 900k worldwide).","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eureka00","name":"t1_cmyrmg9","parent_id":"t1_cmyqx67","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1418926556,"created_utc":1418926556}

No, is it fair for these screenwriters to endanger their audience and coworkers for a laugh? No. If anything this issue exemplifies the American arrogance that leads us to believe we are free to act as we please without criticism or action from other countries. The entire responsibility of this problem doesn't lie solely in the hands of the writers, but it doesn't solely reside in the hands of North Korea either. The screenwriter should be held accountable to write a smarter movie that avoids violence against the people that make them money. There is a very troubling double standard of freedom of speech that is happening in this country. Its bad when it can help people (Edward Snowden, Wikileaks where we've seen no immediate residual harm) but good when it actually harms people, in this case where terabytes of data were copied/stolen. And for what? A cheap laugh? How immature and unprofessional of Franco and Rogen to rely on such a thin base of humor to make money, which is ultimately what this was about, a paycheck.

{"body":"I think satirization is fair and if done well quite enjoyable.  But I also think that a movie about the assassination of an actual world leader--or any real person--is pretty sketchy.		Sure, it's unlikely that a mentally unstable person who sees the movie would ever get a chance to be close enough to Kim Jong un to ever do the deed (Dennis Rodman aside, I guess), but it's still a line I feel uncomfortable being crossed.  What becomes fair game next: a movie where someone stalks and kills not a fictional character but someone who is supposed to be Katy Perry?  Or Kobe Bryant?  Or Rachel Maddow?  Or a movie about not assassinating a fictional President, but actually assassinating Barack Obama?  I was certainly put off by that film that came out years back about the assassination of Bush, and I can't stand Bush.		I think harsh pushback from North Korea was also pretty predictable given how seriously they take their leaders (or their leaders take themselves).  They consider themselves not just leaders, but actually Divine.  You can imagine if something similar were done in a movie with Jesus or Mohammed coming back, and what the reaction would be.		I actually wonder if Sony counted on North Korea to get upset as a way to get free promotion for the movie, but miscalculated about how harsh the response would be.		Anyway, I do agree with the original sentiment: it's too bad that the worst of our fighting is not just making fun of each other.

{"body":"Noseemenow. 		That was the best thing I read all day. You sir get my upvote. 	(you should have seen what they deleted off r/news. It was a beautiful opinion piece that I typed noting that freespeech is limited to being responsible. (which was deleted by mods). 		Its amazing that film artists state they have a right to free speech and can parody the assassination of any world leader they want. 	But I cannot publically disagree without a mod deleting my opinion which in no way disrupted the community. Here is a copy paste of my free speech that was redacted.		The idea that free speech entitles you to say what you want is completely relevant. However there are circumstances in which what you say may have direct consequence. Take mentioning a bomb on an airplane, a fire in a movie theater, or even digressing racist remarks to an opposing race. 		Making a movie about the assassination of a foreign dictator would likely also have a direct consequence. 		In my opinion I have seen much progress in the nation of North Korea. I see their nation???s leader making great strides in improving education, medical and scientific communities. He is an educated man with many accomplishments in his legacy. 		Does he deserve to be insulted publically by our entertainment industry? No. In short this movie is insulting him to the nation???s past paradigm in which he has dedicated his life to improve. Could you imagine dedicating your life to the peace and prosperity of a nation that is heavily sanctioned by neighboring communities? The challenges in which he undergoes on a daily basis are likely beyond what any contributing actor in this film will ever experience in their lives. Did sony let the terrorists win?		What terrorists? The North Koreans respectively took this matter to the United Nations declaring the film as an act of war. Sony had made the choice to continue the launch of this film well knowing that its very creation is placing American interests and lives in jeopardy. (pursuing an act of war). 		This was openly expressed by the North Koreans as an act of war prior to their retaliation. In my opinion Sony is the entity that has openly expressed an act of terrorism. Not the DRPK. Had Sony entered peaceful talks with the national leader in which their company sought to assassinate in parody, prior to filming: the cyber-attack would likely have not occurred??? What right does Sony have to privacy, in the presence of them disrespecting North Koreans national leader???s privacy? Does it make sense to allow a company to deface a national leader but not allow the leader to deface the company?		Secondly, it appears that the general consensus from commenters located in South Korea is that the film destabilizes peace in the region. The South Koreans express fear of military intervention by the North on a daily basis. They feel that the movie is a direct insult going as far as to say that. the studio has acted without dignity for the atrocities associated with the regions past. To be frank I agree. These two nations are torn and in no way would this film help their relationship		It???s as if we were openly mocking Hitler while the Jews were in their concentration camps wrote one user. 		It???s not to say that the movie would be directly attacking the south: But goes to show that in the circumstances it leaves the south on edge. These two nations have a history in which sony failed to take into account. We have literally salted the wound which is equally insulting as compared to the act of the assassination itself. 		The people attempting to launch this film have created a thoughtless international affair, aggressing the stability of North Koreas international relations. I feel that their choice to assemble this as an act of free speech is as notable as their words are crimes in the eyes of the nation of North Korea. The parties should be held accountable not by our own laws but in the laws of the nation they have publically insulted. They made the choice to create the movie in light of all consequences; nationally, and internationally. Thus they should be held accountable to all laws. Both internationally and nationally		Why it was deleted in a discussion about free speech shows the very bias and issue at hand. I suppose we all agree to disagree.

This is a guy who would never write about assassinating a current sitting American president and kill him off by blowing him to bits. We will NEVER, EVER, EVER see that happen.

Sony is a publically traded company, and the value of a publically traded company is largely determined by what the public associates with that company. When bad things surround your brand, the value of that brand will decrease, regardless of whether or not it's the company's fault. What's happened to Malaysian Airlines is a recent example. Sony's obligation to the people who have invested in their brand supercedes it's obligation to protect free speech. 		So ask yourself, what would be worse for Sony's image: pulling a movie because of a major threats of violence, or going forward with the movie and having a horrific act of violence transpire resulting in the death of beloved public figures? 		Also, I very seriously doubt that Sony made this decision alone. It is very likely that the they received information from government intelligence agencies, who, as we know, are pretty good at spying on people. Sony would not have pulled this movie if they believe that these were empty threats. They knew that there would be serious public backlash for pulling the film, and they did it anyway.
