{"body":"The Wrath of Khan music is a masterpiece. There's no other way to say it. Each character has his own musical themes which are developed throughout the movie, and in the climax Horner interweaves them all. The climax music is itself a complete story: the fight between Kirk's and Khan's themes, The genesis theme slowly arising, and then - boom - it takes over. And Spock's theme quietly doing what is has to do, and then arising at the very end quietly and weakly. I mean, just listen to dissonant climbing strings against the genesis theme after Kirk realizes what's happened to Spock. It captures his panic and his run through the Enterprise all at once while not forgetting that a living planet is being born at the same time.

{"body":"You insinuated that I found looking for classical music too hard, or that classical music was too hard, or at least that's what it felt like.  		Part of the reason movie soundtracks get so much attention is because they're sentimentally linked with movies that people like.  The music is inseperable from the image.  So it's easier to get into classical-ish music that way.		Also, most of the classical stuff that's considered "good" by afficionados is surely much more complex than most soundtrack music, and let's be frank, your average listener of music isn't into complexity.  		So, yes, to a degree moving from soundtrack music to classical is "hard".  Not because it's hard to find classical, but because classical is hard to get into.

Some of it is too complex for easy comprehension definitely, but I would argue that because its like trying to learn nuclear physics before you have learned the basics. That sort of music takes years and years to learn how to write, so it definitely takes some time to learn to listen to it too. Then again, can you go straight to hardcore metal without hearing something like Iron Maiden first? I'm not sure.		There is lots of great classical that is quite simple, but still incredibly moving (and actually has some deep complexity more "under the surface").

Hell I like some Jazz but I have literally no idea what is going on really.. I found I learnt the basics by myself just from listening, then only later did I read up on it and find out the proper words for the things I had noticed. 		I'd say its somewhat like films - loads of people can enjoy them (including myself for a long time) without any idea of what is going on in terms of cinematography or mise en sc??ne or any of that, but learning about it (usually) can enhance enjoyment of the very best movies.		There are loads of complex chord progressions, rhythms and even orchestrations in the pop world too - Stevie Wonder for instance has some really rhythmically complex music, but nobody would think you need to learn why to enjoy it.

{"body":"Let us not forget that this was a man who had so many masterpieces in his catalog that they rivaled even the great John Williams in their technical skill and unabashed romanticism. From a man who started out as a young kid scoring one of Roger Corman's productions in Battle Beyond the Stars, he eventually got his big break when Nicholas Meyer tapped him to score Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. From then on, Horner managed to score a litany of classic films with remarkable results.		The Rocketeer, Aliens, *Batteries Not Included, Brainstorm, Braveheart, Glory, Troy, The Mask of Zorro, Field of Dreams, The Missing, A Beautiful Mind, Enemy at the Gates, Titanic, Balto, An American Tale, The Spitfire Grill, Avatar, you can't spit without hitting an impeccable score from the man. But if he should pass on into the hall of legends with Alfred Newman and Bernard Hermann then it will be for his magnum opus, [Edward Zwick's Legends of the Fall,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTp813UjGkE&list=PL0020591AF8DB7DEB) which he recorded with The London Symphony Orchestra that will have cemented his legacy. Containing some of Horner's most unabashedly romantic and intimate music, Legends of the Fall is a testament to the man's creativity.  		I really don't know what to say. James Horner along with John Williams and Hans Zimmer were the gateway to film music. I remember walking in my home town with my old Ipod, the bulky first ones that had the click wheel, listening to his score for The Wrath of Khan and listening to the brutal bursts of trumpets and strings. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before. He has only cemented a legacy of remarkable scores right up to his transcendent recent addition of [Wolf Totem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=febylSOA3XQ). I'm sure whatever he composed that's left unheard of in scores such as The 33 and Southpaw will be equally as powerful and bitter sweet knowing that there will be no more James Horner scores to look forward to with relentless optimism from a master of the craft. 		For now, I guess I'll mourn in the only way I know how in these instances and that's to remember Horner though the music that he gave to us.

{"body":"As a pilot, I feel like I've got to defend general aviation.		It's really very simple. The reason these accidents happen, is generally, people tend to not take flying as serious as they should.		As you gain experience, usually Pilots grow comfortable. They over estimate what they and their machine can do. They don't keep current with maintaining the machine. They fly in bad weather. They don't do recurrent training. And they end up paying the price for it.		Private aviation can be every bit as safe as commercial aviation, but it requires that you treat it with the same caution and respect, and know that if you don't, it can and will kill you.		It's almost always pilot error. Sometimes you're at the mercy of the machine, and sometimes it's a combination of factors.		It's a real shame...but it isn't because "small planes kill people".

When the movie was first screened to Mr. Horner, at the end of the movie he ran out of the theater and into the lobby. The director ran after him worried and found him crying. Horner was so touched he was given the opportunity to score such an amazing movie that he had to run out of the theater crying. 		For me his music touched me so. His music had an emotional sensitivity, in interviews he seamed to be a sensitive soul too. I adore his Cocoon score, and his music from Willow, and his amazing emotional score for The Land Before Time, and his score for Glory. His music touched the soul.
