It's all clearly meant to be a fairy tale, complete with all the tropes and cliches that brings and they did a great job of subverting some of the those tropes.

{"body":"Eh, opinions are opinions. But if you're going to go so far as to call it an 'absolute trainwreck' I'm going to defend it because I think it was a good enough movie that if you're going to point out flaws you should point out better flaws than that. 		The "save the princess story in space" was the whole point of the movie. It's a sci-fi fairy tale. You can't say a movie's bad because it sticks to its genre. That's like saying that Insidious 2 was bad because it was spooky. It was bad for other reasons but spooky is the whole point. Also, you (and a lot of other people) have cliches confused with tropes I think and tropes exist because to date there are very few basic story structures. Save the princess is a story structure that's been in place for a few thousand years. 'In space' is a trope. Cliches are recurring overused phrases, which they avoided! When lizard-guy #1 said "It was a mistake." I really expected this cliche: "The next mistake will be your last." But they didn't use that. In general the dialogue and pacing are really good for a movie attempting to rein in a story of that scope.		As far 'visuals': I assume you mean either the cinematography or the effects shots. The trend these days is to move the 'camera' during establishing shots. Some folks just aren't comfortable with the concept of visual motion in relation to a massive object like some of the gorgeous landscapes or fantastically unique spaceships in the movie. The gravity boots are an awesome concept and maybe you found it hard to follow scenes like that. I can totally understand that, those scenes have a lot of kinetic energy coupled with moving camera angles. It reminds me of the un-followable transformers battles where I feel like I'm just looking at the inside of toaster being shaken up. I would concede that point because it's another cinematography trend that I don't think Hollywood quite as figured out yet.		tldr; It is absolutely acceptable to not like any movie but if you're going to insult it with hyperbole you gotta have valid reasons.

The Prestige takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate how amazing it is anyway. I've seen all the "Cornetto" trilogy, with Hot Fuzz being my favorite. I'll for sure check out Pontypool though. Also glad you've seen Frank haha. It's not for everyone but if you understand the humor it's great.		In Bruges is like 10x better than Seven Psychopaths, just because the dialogue and dark humor are what's so great. Plus Colin Farrell is the main character, along with Brendan Gleeson, who is a very underrated actor. And so is Colin Farrell. The best character is played by Ralph Fiennes and I'm sure you know how awesome he is haha. Overall though, In Bruges, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and The Prestige are three of my favorite movies of all time (if you set aside stuff like Citizen Kane/Leave Her To Heaven/The Big Lebowski-haha.)

{"body":"As a writer, I've been trying to tackle this problem for several years. 		Space Movies always fall into one of the following:		1. Everything breaks, but the main character(s) miraculously survive. 		2. Aliens/Monsters attack. Moon monsters, Mars monsters, whatever.		3. Supernatural: you meet god or esoteric aliens who created us (and are kinda god), or you discover some supernatural thing like worm-holes or aliens that look like your dad or a bookshelf. 		The space Monster movies are the worst. Often devolve into nothing more than cheap horror with glass bowls on their heads.		Then you get a lot of "everything breaks" movies, which can be good, but if you aren't making Apollo 13 based on a real story, then you are making up a fictional ship, breaking parts of it, then having the other parts be able to miraculously pick up the slack. It's a bit like making a character a wizard and having them pull a rabbit out of their ass. 		The Supernatural/Meeting God movies are probably the best of the three, but it's difficult to pull off without sounding like a high 19 year old's shower-thoughts on the universe (Prometheus, Mission to Mars). 		So a lot of movies actually try to hit all three of these tropes. Mission to Mars has all three with that shitty "oh so we came from Martians" ending.   		Interstellar is a good example of subverting the tropes. They actually hit all of them, but each one in a unique way (spaceship earth is breaking, there's a monster...but not what you think, then something supernatural). But [Interstellar has some other issues.](http://lumpyjunk.blogspot.com/2015/05/interstellceptmento.html) 		So the question is how do you make a space movie without falling into these overused tropes? Like you said, well, we could just tell a story with space as a backdrop, but that doesn't really feel like an answer. 		Apollo 14: Everything Goes as Planned - doesn't quite seem like a movie (though I would watch the shit out of it). 		I think the answer is to find a story that's character driven, that gets at the heart of why we explore, finds tension and drama in things other than explosions and monsters, and doesn't resort to sophomoric philosophy. 			I'm actually working on a trilogy of novels about eccentric billionaires building their own space programs. Book 1 and 2 are out, and [Book 1 is currently free on kindle.](http://www.amazon.com/Space-For-Sale-Jeff-Pollard-ebook/dp/B00HGCIRXC) 		In the books, things do go wrong in space, but not like Gravity's over-the-top angle, and so when they fix things, it's always based in reality and not a magic wand. And I also try to find humor and absurdity in what is ostensibly a completely realistic story. It's one thing to make up an unrealistic story, it's another to come up with a crazy series of events that could really believably happen. 			But as a screenwriter, I don't think my trilogy here is all that relateable to the big screen. It's a lot of smaller events, not a single big event. And a lot of small events can add up to a story in a novel, but it's much harder to do in a movie and this trailer illustrates why. 		So the question remains: what's a big event in space that is movie-worthy, that's not shitty philosophy, doesn't involve blowing up the ship and spending the whole time trying to get home, and doesn't involve alien monsters?		Just a mission to mars isn't enough because Red Planet, Mission to Mars, and The Martian, all involve basically everything going wrong.  		How about a movie about the first Mission to Mars where NASA sends three married couples on the mission, but it quickly devolves into a man vs. woman Lord of the Flies kind of situation. I call it Venus vs. Mars.  		I'm working on a screenplay, but I won't go into much detail. I'm hoping to make something realistic, dramatic, cinematic, great visuals, funny, that doesn't resort to sophomoric philosophizing or space monsters or "everything is breaking" syndrome.","depth":3,"score":339,"ups":339,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jeffp12","name":"t1_crzjirg","parent_id":"t1_crzhurm","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1433783174,"created_utc":1433779574}

I listened to an interview with the author, and he spoke about issues in science fiction that are very similar to the issues you have with the genre.

The author must have felt strongly about your problem with most space catastrophes being solved with tools that turn to magic, like a wizard pulling a rabbit out of his hat.

{"body":"Have you read it yourself? (sounds snarky, it's not) I just picked it up today and about halfway through and it's great. Really really great.		With regards to the above comment, I feel Weir address the common trope of using broken equipment to stimulate conflict. What I've noticed is that Mark is *not* fucked. A lot of really great things that could have gone wrong went smoothly in his early quests to survive. Certain modules that shouldn't break don't break, and equipment based on the real thing seems to function as it should--that is-- as a high-tech component of NASA-designed space tech. I find it thrilling to read about Mark's *success*. It's interesting as a reader to be rooting for this character, watching his days unfold through his logs.		I'm only about halfway through, but it's already panning out to be at least a human-driven story and not a story made for thrills and excitement. Space is exciting, but there is a problem with almost every decision made out there, and The Martian really hones in on the dangers but also the brilliance of the engineers they send on missions. All of Mark's situations seem entirely plausible, from fertilizing ~~soil~~ sand with his own feces to figuring a way to drain hydrogen from his lander can.

{"body":"Well, one of the reasons that people would set sail was because of imbalances of power: I.e the secondborn son wasn't ever going to become a chief, or he disagrees, so he leaves in search of another island. There's also ecological reasons: there is a noticeable lack of resources on this island to support the full population, so an exit strategy needs to be researched. 		There's a possible pattern of exploration in places like Fiji where very small groups of individuals established long distance base camps and remained there for a while, before potentially bringing the remainder of their people on successive voyages. 		I personally haven't had much of a chance to read the space-related research but I can immediately understand why Polynesians were used as a model.  The Seven Voyaging Canoes of the Maori, to me, sounds like the kind of narrative that would be used with long-distance colony ships, and the fact that entire populations might have been banking on this exploration seems to carry the most relation to space travel. Communities can be small and very isolated (which is why NASA also sends anthropologists to study conditions in Antarctic research facilities). Additionally, the sheer distance between the homeland and the colony means that a lot of Polynesian cultures are similar, but also very different, and I think this will also happen with interplanetary colonization.  Finally, I think it will be the case that in the distant future, there will at least be a few cultures in which space travel is an integral part of their culture in a lot of ways, much like the sea is itself crucial to several Pacific societies. 			I should say, these are things that are mentioned in the literature, but I think anthropology is very useful for science fiction, particularly speculative fiction that uses space as a vehicle for discussing humanity (think Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, etc.).

The amount of stupid decisions made by the characters and their incredible lack of common sense really ruined the film imo.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"das_bearking","name":"t1_crzo6zm","parent_id":"t1_crzfrt6","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1433790701,"created_utc":1433787101}

{"body":">i think that the trailer didn't give away a lot		Well it did, it gave away just about every plot point. But that doesn't mean it won't be an enjoyable film. As somebody that hasn't read the book I can see this much happening...		From that trailer I saw a crew is on Mars. Shitty storm hits, they abort and leave Mars back to Earth/ISS like station thinking Damon is dead. He isn't, he survived. NASA dude gives press conference that he is dead, and eventually he'll probably keep lying to save face because how dare NASA leave somebody behind. Hence why he's demanding no return to Mars, the crew has orders, but they will defy these orders after finding out Damon is actually alive and sent a distress signal. Which by the way we find out that him figuring out how to contact them was a success! Since we hear the crew saying "*Hey, he's alive, but we have orders to... baaaah fuck the orders we're going to go save him!*" We also see him saying he has like a months supply of food and needs to figure out how to grow food on a planet that isn't grow-friendly, but then see him marking like 481 on the side wall showing that hey.... he figured it out! He's alive with a beard, figured out the food growing situation. Showed him fondling a green leaf yaaay food. 		Literally the only plot point that isn't directly shown is if the rescue crew successfully save Damon. That's it. The entire rest of the movies plot points are directly told to you in that 2 minutes. 		But again even knowing all that if it's a good movie it's a good movie. Might have a solid cast, enjoyable characters and development, beautiful cinematography and successful buildup of tension, etc. It might not have any surprises because of that trailer but I can still enjoy it despite that. As I also see from the trailer that it'll have a heavy focus on Damon and he isn't rigid but rather pretty smart and charming with a good wit about him despite the dire circumstances.

{"body":"Personally I felt it revealed too much because the way the book is structured it keeps you constantly guessing from start to finish. The author nails everything, but the part that impresses me most is how he sets up a million red herrings and makes it impossible to predict what goes right and what goes wrong. Sometimes the blatant foreshadowing amounts to nothing, sometimes it amounts to something, and other times shit happens totally out of left field.		For example, you get almost halfway through the book before any other characters are even revealed. It might be less than half, I don't remember exactly, but it was quite far in the story. You spend all that time wondering if the whole book is going to focus on just this one character's survival struggle. I get that they have to advertise the incredible cast, but they go so much farther than that. One of the big plot twists is definitely spoiled in the trailer (I won't say which one) and you can kind of figure out which disasters happen and which don't based on all the scenes they show.

{"body":"Agreed, I feel like I just watched a 3.5 minute movie, I doubt anything in The Martian is going to surprise me. In the old days, trailers used to leave you with more questions than answers, which would be answered during the course of the movie. 		Nowadays, trailers pretty much answer all the questions you have and leave you with maybe one or two, for example, in this one (which I find particularly egregious) the only question I have remaining is: Will Matt Damon make it back to earth intact ? A more subtle trailer which would have made me far more interested would have left me with many more questions (will he make it back ? how will he survive while waiting for rescue ? how will the rescue attempt be planned/executed ? How did he get stranded in the first place ? etc. (I can think of a dozen others right off the top of my head) All those questions but one were answered during the trailer. 		Admittedly, without watching a trailer, none of those questions would crop up until you reached certain points in the movie, but as it stands now, I know that he survives the storm, I know that they mount a rescue mission, I know that he at least finds a method of surviving the time until he is rescued, so none of the things which would have triggered a sense of suspense before (the storm, the question of a mission, the question of survival) will do so anymore.		I don't know if the studios just think that the general public is too stupid for subtle trailers, or they themselves are too lazy to make subtle trailers which don't give away the whole movie.

{"body":"Though I felt that it got to be kind of formulaic I'd argue that, objectively, the Martian isn't an _awful_ book.  	  	It's well paced and effectively builds tension even if it doesn't always deliver on it. I was also kind of disappointed with the ending, though if it hadn't ended when it did it might have overstayed its welcome.  	  	Sounds like your main gripe was with the main character, Watney, which I can understand why people might not like him. I never got the impression that he was "whiny". In fact, his whole attitude towards his situation is what endeared him to me. No matter how much stuff gets thrown at him he manages to maintain his whimsical attitude and keep on going.

However, in the case of the Martian, the vast majority of the science in the book is realistic and well explained.  I'm not going to fail the book because the author uses a little bit of smoke and mirrors in a situation where ~95% of the audience won't notice.		To give you an example of how accurate the rest of the book is, the author wrote his own orbital dynamics program that calculated the courses the space craft would have taken to get to Mars.  Given the technology used and the stated capabilities, they're accurate.  Given that level of accuracy, I'm willing to grant the author a little creative license.  Even with the errors, I think this type of book really helps get people interested in science, Mars and space exploration.  That's a good thing in my book.

{"body":"Oh, I totally agree, in most respects. In fact, I personally think Mars One is a scam. I think their administration is a joke, their engineering is vapourware, and their mission plan is fantasy. But their *science* is good. And Weir's, I'm sorry to say, is not as good.		I'm old enough to have followed the Viking mission when it was on. At one time, I could sit and draw you accurate, detailed pictures of the vehicle at every stage of the mission, and explain it completely. That was a long time ago. But my point is that I've been following the actual *science* of Mars all along, and the moment a friend told me about this book (before the film was a reality), I was immediately sceptical -- for the reason above.		I already knew this, but was looking for a source. I'm sad that that's the only one I came across in a short search that put it into the right words. Other sources, in the modern style of love of hyperbole, love to talk about how violent Mars' weather is. But they never break it down this way, to the practical matter of what it's really like. Yes, high winds. Yes, storms that rage for days across huge areas of the planet. But the air is *so thin* that while the numbers look terrifying, on something like the Beaufort scale it's remarkably mild for all that by human standards. Weir's book and this movie completely ignore that scientific reality.		And it doesn't stop there. I've read other examinations of the book by people who know much more than I do, and it's clear that Weir lacks the adequate knowledge to make this work. It's great drama, but it's just not realistic. It relies on weather conditions that don't exist, and engineering and operational deficiencies that haven't been known since the Soviet space programmes of the Cold War. It's not plausible. NASA is never going to publicly badmouth anything that makes space look exciting, but this is actually pretty insulting to NASA.		It's so very disappointing because it *could* have been great. Weir did what was necessary to sell it to the public, but stopped well short of what would have made it actually great scientifically. People with knowledge of engineering, especially aerospace engineering, are going to immediately spot the problems with the story. People knowledgeable about the real meteorology of Mars will be put off by the bullshit premise. People familiar with any modern space programme will be put off by the dramatically necessary insults to how things are actually done by those agencies.		Maybe Weir couldn't tell this story otherwise; in which case, I would have suggested he think twice about it. Maybe he did, I don't know. Maybe the money was too good, who knows. For whatever reason, a man who's intelligent enough to have avoided these pitfalls didn't. And for some of us with a deep respect for science and people involved in real space programmes, that's enough not to bother with this.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sylban","name":"t1_cs0aljj","parent_id":"t1_cs08xog","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1433830391,"created_utc":1433826791}

{"body":"Matter of opinion, I suppose. It didn't give away anything *I* care about or didn't already know. In this day and age, you really can't prevent spoilers anymore. It's sad, but that's the way it is. If some jackass on TV isn't squawking about it, your friends online will be, and there's no way you can avoid it and avoid learning what you don't want to know, so even the concept of spoilers is dying out in our time.		The much bigger problem, perhaps, is that even without all that, the people who make trailers nowadays honestly don't see the problem with it. I heard an interview with a couple of them, and they don't see it the same way. From their perspective, as long as there's *something* left it, the film is not 'spoiled' for you. I strongly disagree, but I'm the one paying them.		What's maybe more compelling is *why* it's like that. As near as I can tell, modern filmgoers just won't take a chance on a film they're not confident will make them happy. If the trailer doesn't give them adequate assurance, they won't spend the money, and that's what the game is all about. Hence, trailers that give away too much, to make sure that people will buy tickets.		That may seem counterintuitive to people like you and me, but we are not typical of the hordes of people who buy tickets, and this is a game of numbers. It's kind of like how I hate most of what's on TV, but TV does fine without my love because there are far more people who not only don't hate it, but somehow *love* it.		Welcome to the future. We'll be spending the rest of our lives in it.		I won't be seeing this anyway. I come from a family of scientists, and I'm sick of films that 	pay deference to popular notions of coolness and attractiveness and manliness and what I assume is popular humour (that I don't find very clever at all), but pretty much shit on science and all those boring eggheads who care about it. It's somehow even more offensive to me when it seems to *pretend* to be truthful and care, but anyone in the know can see how it isn't and doesn't.		The very premise of this story seems extremely dodgy and gimmicky, and it doesn't get better after that. In the book, the character's first line upon realizing his situation is something like, "I am deeply fucked." Ha ha, I was a college freshman once, too, and said things like that. Who honestly believes that a trained astronaut who has qualified for a mission like this, made it through all the psych and social evals and all the rest, is likely to think or talk like some damn kid who slept through cram night? Oh, it doesn't matter because it's "fiction"? Fuck you if you think that way. Why not just give him a magic wand, too? It's only fiction, right? What's the point of 'science' fiction that doesn't have any respect for science? Let's just drop the pretence and admit that this is just an old frontier tale updated with spaceships and CGI. Better yet, just set it in the late 19th Century where it belongs, and stop insulting educated people and bullshitting everyone else.		The sad truth is that people don't really want to see anything like real science fiction, or any films that involve thinking. And that's a big reason why trailers are the way they are now. If people respected those kinds of films, then they'd get made -- and they're not. And they also don't respect trailers that demand they think, either, and won't line up for films promoted with them. JJ Abrams was able to get away with insubstantial teasers for his pompously titled *Star Trek,* mostly because people have at least some clue what Star Trek is already, but before it was out there were full-length trailers showing us pretty much the whole thing. That was essential to Paramount's business model, because Star Trek fans are not numerous enough by themselves to justify a big movie. You need to also attract everyone who likes to see loud shit flying around for any reason (or, more commonly, no good reason); you need the Fast and Furious crowd to see it, too, or you'll lose your money.		I've long hoped that the cost-cutting opportunities of CGI would lead to a new generation of smaller, indie-circuit SF by and for thinking people, but it hasn't really happened yet and I'm not sure why. Intelligent SF used to be sellable as mainstream film, but that stopped sometime after *Star Wars* came out, and maybe because of it. Why it hasn't re-emerged in indie circles, I honestly don't know.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sylban","name":"t1_crzx65q","parent_id":"t1_crzvdt7","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1433805089,"created_utc":1433801489}
{"body":"Indie cirlces struggle to find budget for a normal movie, let alone the speciel effects required for sci-fi. Look at Kristen Wiig, she has made a few indies with very low budget but only because she is well known those movies were made. You need someone big like her to find investors and to find proper actors willing to work alongside them almost for free. Then the small movie distributors will only have access to a limited 2-5 theaters and only if they exceed a certain box office level they will extend their count. Bottom line, no sci-fi movie is going to come out from the indie circles without one of the big distributors backing it up. Of course, a indie movie can be picked up by Sony or Fox etc but only if they consider it commercially viable or critically acclaimed: eg. [Diary of a Teenage Girl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3172532/) , which they'll do very rarely(once a year)","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"qmak","name":"t1_crzzauw","parent_id":"t1_crzx65q","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1433808922,"created_utc":1433805322}

I assure you there are far more than "2-5 theaters" out there for indie films. There are more than that just within an hour of me.		Let's be realistic.

We, then, get a shot of the stellar cast of actors amassed by Ridley Scott and you realize, ???Holy shit! Donald Glover is in this?!??? Will McCaVoy (Jeff Daniels, The Newsroom) then sounds off and we???re in an old familiar territory, MUTANY!
