{"body":"I mean, the problem with a film like Gravity isn't that the scientific inaccuracies are any more glaring than they are in nearly any other film with space stuff going on, because they aren't. The issue is that in Gravity, the *entire film* is about Sandra Bullock moving around in space, and trying to survive the wrenches getting thrown at her: it's not "oh, they're fighting aliens and it happens to take place in space" or "they're on a grand adventure, travelling through space" or "serious interpersonal drama, in space." It's just "Sandra Bullock in space." The only conflict is her, trying to survive, not from an alien attack or a serial killer or anything like that, but just trying to survive in space.		The core conflict and driving force of the plot, then, are based on these things that are heavily grounded in science -- there aren't character motives or anything here taking precedence over that. In 2012, all the science is nonsense anyway, so even a half-assed handwave explanation would have sufficed, and it gets criticized because they only went, like, 1/10th assed with the mutating neutrinos. But in Gravity, the things that are happening in space are real: or supposed to be, anyway-- and are the *only real conflict the main character is facing*. In other films, it's much easier to say "we're ignoring the finer details of space travel because we're telling a story about [whatever the story is about], not a story that's just about someone in space," and even a scientifically savvy audience will buy that, as long as you don't completely 1/10th ass it. But Gravity *is* just a story about someone in space. And in a lot of ways, it does a really good job of being that. But the fact that they're playing fast and loose with the rules, when those rules are *the only thing* acting to drive the film's plot, hurts the film.","depth":3,"score":103,"ups":103,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iamthegraham","name":"t1_cqoqiz1","parent_id":"t1_cqoplzc","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1430012750,"created_utc":1430009150}
{"body":"I think the biggest problem with Gravity is that people have somehow lost the ability to read films anymore. If you think Gravity is a movie about Sandra Bullock in space, then you weren't paying attention. The entirety of Gravity is a visual metaphor for the struggle between giving up and giving a fuck. 		The story in Gravity is kept at its most simplistic form, not because the screenwriters were lazy, but because telling the story with words wasn't going to be the answer. Bullock's character is a woman who lost her daughter and has been struggling with a reason to live. She was fighting her own inertia, she had been floating around aimlessly, long before she ever got into space. 		When something shocking happens that rocks everything to your core and you feel like you're drifting aimlessly into the void, what keeps you going? 		That's what Gravity's about. Only, Alfonso Cuaron is an inventive enough filmmaker to say, "You know what? People won't find this movie interesting if I explain in words what happens in this movie." Gravity is meant to be watched and experience. If you mute the film, you'd realize that most scenes in the movie establish some kind of order for a stage of life. When she first goes inside the station after the wreckage, she curls into a ball and the shot resembles a fetus. 		There's another point in the film, one of the heaviest emotionally, where she looks out the window at the most remote place on the planet.		The point in the film where she's swimming and you see the frog swimming up next to her. It's meant to show how flawlessly that frog is swimming to shore versus her struggling to stay alive. It's about a journey from losing all meaning to life to literary fighting tooth and nail to stay alive. 		We're not used to being told stories visually that way. I mean, it's almost as if the entire movie works mute. He's telling our story, the story of all our struggle, with a metaphor about an astronaut adrift in space. 		That movie deserves a hell of a lot more credit than it got because I truly believe it is one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. Not only because of the way it was made, what it attempted to do in a storytelling sense, the impact and the sheer uniqueness of the experience of watching that film in 3D in IMAX, it truly awakens you to the simplest enjoyment of films if you're willing to let it take you there. The only shame is that we live in a very cynical, very nitpicky environment where visionaries with an idea about how to provide new forms of entertainment to people are blown to hell while the people who make Fast and the Furious and The Hunger Games get away with selling the same movie with a different title 7 times and call it "what the people want."","depth":4,"score":28,"ups":28,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"solarandlunar","name":"t1_cqoxbhe","parent_id":"t1_cqoqiz1","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1430027672,"created_utc":1430024072}

No, it had plotholes, and maybe the average moviegoer doesn't have enough of a knowledge base to sit scratching their head, but for people who do, it made the film worse than it would have been otherwise. That's not nitpicking, it's the straight truth. Movies don't all have to be documentaries, but if your entire plot is driven by technical minutae, than yes, you do have to get the technical mintuae right, or at a bare minimum not get them wrong (which means glossing over/handwaving).

Or do you think Moby Dick is LITERALLY a story about the whaling industry?		It doesn't matter that her story is simplistic and that she's merely an archetype; it's designed that way in order to make her struggle universal.

You're saying the movie isn't impressionistic just because it involved a lot of science? Or because it's a Hollywood movie? I'm not understanding your point, AT ALL.

The destruction was reportedly carried out by an SC-19 ASAT missile with a kinetic kill warhead[7] similar in concept to the American Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. FY-1C was a weather satellite orbiting Earth in polar orbit at an altitude of about 865 km (537 mi), with a mass of about 750 kg (1,650 lb). Launched in 1999, it was the fourth satellite in the Feng Yun series. The missile was launched from a mobile Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL) vehicle at Xichang (28.247??N 102.025??E	) and the warhead destroyed the satellite in a head-on collision at an extremely high relative velocity. Evidence suggests that the same SC-19 system was also tested in 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2013,[8] although none of those events created any long-lived orbital debris.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Burnt_Frost","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GBU-28","name":"t1_cqowjq6","parent_id":"t1_cqow949","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1430025743,"created_utc":1430022143}

{"body":"The theory I just came up with is that there are three levels of science abuse in movies and other entertainment.		Level 1 is making up new science to justify a plot device. This is basically just saying 'magggiiiccc' and no one really cares. 'Element zero lets ships travel faster than light' or 'unobtainium in the trees lets them merge their brains together.' Ok, magic, got it.		Level two is overlooking real science and skipping over plot holes. Like Sandra Bullock's flight speed. Sure, they could have a scene showing her cruising through empty space and calculating complex orbital trajectories. But that would be boring and much less dramatic. Level two science abuse is just like any other plot hole; its annoying when you stop to think about it, but its also pretty clear why the director chose to do it, and you can't really fault them for it.		Level three science abuse is when the movie tries to use real science (or real science words) to justify unrelated/impossible things. Like 'the sun is going to explode because of excess hydrogen-3' or 'I'm going to stop the hacker by unplugging this terminal!' This is super annoying to anyone who knows the science they are abusing, and yeah, we are going to rant about it.		Then of course there's also the point that when a bad movie has a bad line, you are just like 'lol this is dumb.'
