{"body":"Thank you for sharing! You beat me to it because I'm in London!		Last year I learned that the more fun I have promoting after-school all-stars, the more fun you have watching and the more you get engaged. So it's my Trojan horse - I do ridiculous things and have a great time, but I get you to pay attention to something really close to my heart. This isn't a vanity project - I know the power of after-school programs in kids' lives and that's why I started After-School All-Stars more than 25 years ago. I've talked to teachers, police officers, parents, and most importantly, the kids themselves and I've never seen such unanimous agreement. But still, some politicians mess around with the funding because the kids don't have a high-paid lobbyist like all of the adults do and their parents are too busy working to fight - 70% of households include two working parents, so 70% of our kids lack the supervision and growth and love from 3-6pm that they deserve and need. Our biggest responsibility is to our kids but they are unquestionably the most underrepresented in our capitols so we end up spending lots of our money on the adults, on the present and the past, and not on our kids, the future. That's why I fly to Washington every time they talk about cutting the after-school funding to make sure they don't screw over the kids. But whatever you do, please don't call me a lobbyist.		Last year, I also realized that you guys here at reddit are the most powerful ally I could have in my crusade for after-school programs. The fact is, I have quite a platform. I can talk about this in the 20 interviews I'm doing about Terminator today and post to Facebook and Twitter, but even I can't do this alone. And when I join forces with you guys, great things happen. Last year, we raised millions and millions of dollars and 1.1 million dollars with our Omaze campaign alone. This year, I want to do better. I will match you guys up to $500,000.		I will do every fun and ridiculous thing I can do to elevate the issue. All you have to do is join me. All of you have something to give. If you can't spare the 10 dollars to donate, give your time - teach kids sports or technology, read with them, or just hang out and let them know you care. You can find our programs at www.afterschoolallstars.org or you can volunteer at whatever program is near you.		If you do have 10 dollars, enter and come to the premiere with me. I'll bring the schnapps and I promise we will have a good time. www.omaze.com/terminator.

{"body":"Arnold Schwarzenegger has this life thing completely figured out. He always has. I contend that the secret of his success is not his work ethic, tons of people out there bust their ass but do not rise. It is not his genetics that allow him to be physically massive with proper diet and exercise. Tons of people have that too yet do not rise. 		It is his attitude. I have seen interviews where interviewers are trying to dredge Arnold through the muck and he just keeps a smile on his face and puts on a positive spin. He does it so much that it unnerves the interviewer. THE MAN REFUSES TO BE NEGATIVE. 		This is such a rare trait in today's society that people like this will rise. Being outwardly positive all of the time is hard. Because of this trait, people just naturally gravitate towards him. Why? Because deep down they wish they could be the same way. Everyone wants a positive person as a friend, on their team, at their job. 		Why doesn't everyone just be positive? Because it is HARD. It take a lot of effort. You do not allow yourself to slip into the negative. You are always in control of your emotions and when negativity creeps in, you boot that out real quick.
