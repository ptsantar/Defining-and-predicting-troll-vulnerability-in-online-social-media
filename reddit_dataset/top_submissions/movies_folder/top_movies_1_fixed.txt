It's understandable, but it just tires me.  		edit : apparently, I need to add that I'm French. So I'm not some 'murican who don't like me sum chinamen stealin' our 'murican movies and jerbs. The reason I say this is because many people tried to insult me saying I'm some jingoistic American WASP. Well, I wanted to correct them so that Americans don't take the blame for what I say. Also I think it's relevant that I have an outside perspective, and if you want to insult my person, insult my Frenchness. :)		edit2: the scripts are obviously changed specifically to eventually mention Chinatown or China, or some Chinese actor. It's comparable to product placement when they add some line mentioning a brand to satisfy their sponsors. It's entirely commercial, and not made to make the movie any better. Now you can be the offended guy to comment the same exact thing as dozens of others have if you want to, but you're wasting your time.		edit3: Jesus Christ... I feel I still have to add that I have nothing against the Chinese. That's not the point. The point is that it's comparable to product placement, or as someone else rightfully answered, adding a romantic subplot to pander to female audiences. Doesn't make the film better. i'm fine with films set in China, when that's relevant to the plot. But it's a WELL KNOWN FUCKING FACT that some blockbusters have some useless scene mentioning china for purely commercial reasons. I'm criticizing commercialism, not China.

We had a shit load of international students from all over the world, even traditionally third world countries like India, Russia, the Balkans, North Africa etc. The main university had a massive chinese contingent (probably the single largest group of internationals- our university apparently has a disproportionately high reputation in China). There wasn't a single mainland Chinese medical student. On asking one of the Chinese engineers he explained that because the medical terms they used were all Chinese, trying to go home and get qualified if you trained overseas was a nightmare. I mean we had a larger vocab list than the languages students just because of the sheer number of medical terms that exist so having to relearn them in a different language must be a nightmare. For this reason, it's pretty difficult to read and write in the English language literature for a Chinese researcher or physician and also to train overseas. If you look through the literature, again it's a struggle to find papers written by chinese teams whereas finding them from other third world countries really isn't so bad.The only other evidence I have is the word of various people who have spent time over there. The prof who visits there told us about how behind the evidence they seem to be in various aspects of treatment and one of my friends who did his elective there felt the exact same way.

However, if they thought it could make them money, Hollywood would definitely prefer to film everything on set, the 40s and 50s made a lot of good films doing that and made a lot of money -- times are different however. 		China is really, really ignored pretty hard in the West culturally even though they have a billion people and a very large economy. Like, ignored hardcore, I think it's only fair that we are starting to see the trend reversed. EU, US and China are the world's three largest economies, yet Chinese culture is so alien to the West. That should change. China is also interesting. 		I say all this as a Russian, just to note. You are French. I am glad we could discuss this as two Europeans (I know, Russia=Europe is funny to say now...) because I feel that neither of us have an inherent reason for bias as a Chinese and American person would.

I'm not saying there is or isn't anything wrong with that practice.

Plot is a tricky thing, it can take anywhere in the world, but it usually takes place in US or Europe. Because that's what makes money, or at least before it did.

It strained credulity at best. 		In the other hand, in TDK we are introduced to a villain and told he is from China pretty quickly. Then, he runs away to China to avoid batman, and this is explained in a scene where they also outline why the villain would be motivated to escape to China in the first place, and why that means he's off limits to the Gotham authorities. So when batman proceeds to take off to China, and the film spends the next 20 or so minutes there instead of in Gotham, it seems completely natural. The plot took the movie to China, rather than China being forced in. 		It's not bad that this trend is occurring, and it's not bad for movie execs to want to cash in on a new market.

The Snow Queen is more of an entire plot line rather than a single idea for Frozen to derive from.  	  	Having said that, I am very tired of, and obtain nearly no entertainment from, the latest installment of super hero X's adventures. I can handle the first reboot of a super hero in the modern film era. I.e. the 2000s modern super hero versus the 1980s kind of ghetto-tastic super hero.

{"body":"> Paul W.S Anderson gets to do movies because his Resident Evil movies are actually pretty low budget by Hollywood standards. The last one had the budget of "only" 65 million. His movies do shit ton of money and they don't cost "that" much.		This is so fucking important that it's really game changing when you ask the question "Why this movie [produced/succeeded/has a sequel] and not that movie?"		Here's a good example. Why the Twilight films? Aren't they universally known to suck? Well, but for the fact that they only cost about $40million. Why Tyler Perry movies? $20million. Here's the kicker: why Pixar movies? $80million. These aren't actually very different production styles if you consider them *as niche audience productions.* Twilight *isn't FOR YOU,* it's for 13 year old girls. Tyler Perry *isn't FOR YOU*, it's for black Southern Baptists. Pixar *isn't FOR YOU*, it's for children and families. But Pixar gets a lot more respect because they manage to bring in an audience outside their niche. Which raises the question: is it necessarily less 'respectful' to make a movie for only a specific target audience? Do the producers of Twilight or does Tyler Perry deserve less respect as filmmakers because they have a different audience in mind than 'you'?		Now compare to Transformers. To me, Transformers is equally as terrible, stupid, obnoxious, and dull as any sort of Twilight or Tyler Perry movie. But it has a different 'target audience': the BIGGEST one, 14-28 year old boys, as well as an international audience. Thus it gets more money, more audience, and more respect. Just as stupid and terrible as Twilight (yes I mean it), but it gets a LOT more respect as, "Well yeah I know it's fucking stupid but *it's just entertaining.*" Twilight? Ruining women. Tyler Perry? Ruining black people. Transformers? 'Just entertaining.' (There's also something to be said about how it's okay boys can be boys, even if they're no longer boys, but girls and black people need to twice as adult and half as girly and black. On the flip side there's also something to be said about how Transformers is funded by toys, product placement, and state film incentives).		Why can't Terry Gilliam have nice things? His ideas are expensive and his audience is tiny. Why can Christopher Nolan basically do whatever he pleases and shoot on IMAX 75mm film too? Because his ideas may be expensive but his audience is huge. Both of them I like for the exact same reasons: their movies are really sort of ridiculous when broken down, but damn it, they go all out because if they're going to make a movie, they're going to fucking make it MOVE. I love both of their work. But one of them simply can't make a profitable film. He just can't. 		There's a quote in Robert McKee's book *Story* where he's interviewing this French filmmaker Alain Robbe-Grillet, which if you've never seen his work is *fucking amazing*. McKee asks how he can keep movies when his movies are mostly meta-narrative, philosophical pieces rather than rotely structured Hero's Journey sort of stuff. Robbe-Grillet says, "Well I know I can only get enough audience to make about $20million, so I have to make the movie for less than $20million." McKee follows it up with the statement, "If you try to do something different, *your audience necessarily shrinks.* "		So many people I know read that as an argument not to do anything different: they read McKee as saying you shouldn't shrink your audience. But when taken as a whole, the way McKee bothers to look into filmmakers like Godard and so forth to give them due consideration to his thesis that a good story sells film the most, he doesn't really seem, to me, to be saying that you shouldn't make things different. He is just pointing out that if you do something other than focus on story, you have to be much more considerate of audience, and plan to have a smaller budget.		Meanwhile, I think what's going on within the studios are that the good writers are putting their original ideas *within* familiar franchises. *Captain America: Winter Soldier* was *Enemy of the State* but with characters we already know the moral drive and motivations behind. No need to make an 'original' movie about the surveillance state, since we already have Captain America to lead us gently into that good night. 		The worry right now that [this new serialization of film financing and production](http://grantland.com/features/2014-hollywood-blockbusters-franchises-box-office/) is going to cut out the mid-sized movies, the little niche audience studio indies. On the flip side, luckily we have things like crowdfunding and Internet distro (though as a filmmaker myself, I have certain suspicions, like I've noticed most successful YouTube channels are basically cooking shows and... superhero and videogame ~~movies~~ REFERENCED shorts). But nevertheless, for those still trying to find a way to write original concept films, their best bet is just to remember: *your audience necessarily shrinks.* Budget accordingly.","depth":3,"score":617,"ups":617,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"PolarisDiB","name":"t1_cn9ld2z","parent_id":"t1_cn9iath","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419969284,"created_utc":1419969284}

{"body":"You make some awesome points, but there is one glaring ommission from the subsequent discussion here: the escalating 'Chinese box office:domestic take'' trend.  This might sound irrelevant at first to most, but this is a trend that is coming to dominate studio/financier decision-making.  Let me roll it out ...		 	**1900's - late 1920's.**  	Global box office was primarily American / European box office.  Silent film meant barriers to entry looser because of language.		 	**1930's - mid 1960's.**  	Establishment of star system.  Sure, Keaton and Chaplin had appeal - but not on any level like this.  World War 2 meant Americans needed propaganda - and the golden age of Hollywood filled this niche.  Not consciously of course, but it gave people certainty of identity.		 	**Mid 1960's-mid 1970's.**  	Brief window of auteur cinema you are talking about.  You mention you want to create original stories?  Well, this was your time.  Based on favourable economic conditions and popularity among some of progressive European/world cinema - studios favoured a more auteur-based model.  This meant that people could make personal films at much higher budgets.  Sure, a lot of popular crap was being financed, but we're talking broad trends here.		 	**Mid-1970's-2010.**  	Jaws/Star Wars until resurgence of Chinese economy.  Most of us know this period as our only reference point for a studio funding model.  Marketing in Hollywood becomes a lot more metrics based.  The tentpole becomes refined - but my main point here is that it is the domestic box office that decision making is based off.  Which, of course, brings us to ...	 		**2010-singularity??**		Transformers.  Guardians.  X-men.  Pick one.  They're all the same to me - campy CGI romps.  But these films obviously are billion dollar franchises and is what makes studio x's heads look very good at their financing partner's annual-general meeting.  		Now, previously, these films were being made based on domestic market research and take.  However, the studios now realize that Americans are tiring of Transformers 19.  You wouldn't believe that with all the marketing you see in your face each day, but box office is generally seen to be dwindling and the studios know their old prized Kentucky Derby horse ain't responding to all that-a-flogging.		So if box office dwindling, why you makes shitty CGI reboot?  This is where shit gets interesting (Because China is obviously the answer to that last question by the way).  		In my opinion, I believe we are entering a new era of global film production dynamics.  I believe the American domestic market is no longer the primary litmus test for a film's bankability.  I believe it is now both the Chinese/Korean mainstream cinema-going public that factors in to decision making for studio heads.  This means that:		 	*A*	 	**GDP**.  Unless you're living under a wok, you should know China has surpassed the mighty US of A as the worlld's largest economy.  Whatever, hipster US says, "we were into economic domination before it was cool".		 	*Plus B*	 	**Status**.  With the current economic good times in China, comes an aspirational middle class.  Much in the same way that Western culture looks to Western Europe for ideas of class and higher culture (French wine, Italian suits, Mozart and shit), China (and India, and Korea, and ...) looks to late 20th Century America as status symbol.  Your Korean cousin with the huge Ralph Lauren logo on his sprayjacket?  The popularity of 'Friends' and Starbucks coffee culture it marketed to upwardly mobile Asia that Gangnam Style fired shots at?  All symptoms of this trend.   For all the anti-American vibes from these nations, big brands like Michael Jordan, Starbucks, and - most important - Star Wars are huge cultural touchstones for upwardly mobile Asia.		 	*Plus C*	 	**Spectatorship**.  Most interesting point here, the way mainstream Chinese watch films are very, very different to us.  When we go see tentpole movie x, we still hope to see some semblance of emotional aspect to the film.  Some form of intersting relationships to make us "buy in" to the story.  Even a couple of decent jokes, ffs.  Chinsese audiences?  They basically approach these films like they are amusement park rides.  Their mode of spectatorship that is culturally very different.  Obvi's get their feels elsewhere.		 	*Equals* **?????????**	 	An era where we have reboot after reboot of franchises, featuring minimal character development and lots of big shit blowing up.  Americans, who love a good story with their explosions, are now no longer the ones the studios are basing their business decisions on.  I'm not saying good or bad, just pure market forces at work.","depth":4,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cnaeyxh","parent_id":"t1_cn9ld2z","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1420044278,"created_utc":1420044278}
{"body":"I agree with all of your points, they explain the numbers behind franchising better than domestic gross. Within the frame of reference of domestic gross, my post is mostly about how movies are received by viewers and critics as if they're one-to-one in competition with each other both financially and audience-seeking, when in fact some movies aren't seeking that audience and their finances reflect that. 		Which also, by the way, leads me to my theory that Hollywood isn't 'American cinema' but 'corporate cinema', reflecting the values and perspectives of corporations rather than American values and perspectives, and American independent film constitutes 'American cinema' like any sort of Euro art or foreign film is taken to represent their countries and cultures. However, complicating that issue is the overlap between studio franchises, studio indies, indies distributed through the studio system, etc.","depth":5,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PolarisDiB","name":"t1_cnafab3","parent_id":"t1_cnaeyxh","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1420044895,"created_utc":1420044895}

{"body":"> Well yeah, but that's when he became fully interested in making money off the franchise and highly interested in visual effects.		If we're making speculative arguments about when we think Lucas' motivations changed:  Lucas resigned himself to not giving a shit about story ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark's success.  This is pretty well outlined in an interview with Kurtz in 2002 with IGN.    So either Lucas already checked out creatively when they were working on Empire or we can just disregard this entire line of reasoning.		>If you consider the actual words coming from people's mouths as speculative, then that's pure ignorance.		It's called weighting opinions versus facts.  While we're playing Redditic-tac-toe either you're aware of how that works and pretending not to be, or you're not aware at all.

I'm not sure if you know this or not, but according to Kershner, he pretty much ghost-directed ROTJ. Or do you find that "speculative" too?		So, are you trying to tell me that Lucas is a control freak?  I'm already convinced of that.  Either he's a megalomaniac and ROTJ and Empire did well in spite of him (clearly once he had the house, senate and executive he blew it completely), or you're so beholden to Lucas you can't accept that he has a habit of coming up with the rough outlines of a vague idea and taking the credit for all the creative input that filled in the other 90%.		Do you stay up nights arguing with Pauline Kael's corpse about Mank's role in Citizen Kane too?  Basically all this amounts to is you can't agree that a director directs, a producer produces and a writer writes...  		<sanctimonious asshole nerd inflection> Well I'm sure *you* know that Lucas has admitted that he's a terrible writer, right?</sanctimonious asshole nerd inflection>		So instead of being satisfied making everyone including Marquand uneasy on set (yes, I heard THAT too) he had to go and completely shit on their creative input, and even more so in the special editions, turbo editions, mega-super-duper editions, re-engineering to death some important scenes, mucking them up with unnecessary and downright horrible stylistic choices.... as a final "fuck you" to the work they did...  Maybe the guy is socially unaware (in which case I understand why so many Redditors love him), or maybe he's bitter.  I don't know and I don't care.		It wasn't enough, then, for Lucas to be an egomaniac on set then and accept that film *is* a collaborative process and that he should trust the opinions of those better than himself.   He had to keep on shitting on others work and redo it himself, making it unbearably awful to ever watch again.		Got it.  Thank you.

Because they aren't definitive at all, there's a great story from Terry Gilliam about when he worked on Fear and Loathing, two writers got credit from the WGA for the movie despite the fact that nothing from their draft was used.

Well Pauline Kael barely ever added anything intelligent to film criticism but there's a reason why it's successful because of the screenplay (that is one part of it) but because of Welles's direction.

{"body":"I think that is precisely where Interstellar fails in comparison with 2001. 		In 2001, that part is there and Kubrick does not bother explaining, because he expects the audience to be able to figure it out for themselves and any answer they get out of it is good because it was reached through them and not the film alone. It also has an alienating feeling that has been ratcheting up since the film began, culminating in that gang-buster-weird scene at the end. Here, Kubrick succeeds. In contrast, Interstellar chooses to take away any semblance of wonder or alienation and awe in place of stale presentation. Here, Nolan completely drops the ball and reinforces one of his main faults as a director: his over-reliance on exposition as a means to take away from the audiences experience. Nolan, to me, has very little respect for his audience. For all his pondering and posturing and the claims made for him as "the thinking man's blockbuster", his films barely give you anymore credit than the average blockbuster. And the final sequence of Interstellar proves this rather brutally. Instead of leaving it ambiguous and subject to audience interpretation and reading, everything is instantly spelt out for you. The wonder and magic of this scene is sucked dry by some comical logic and the strange insistence the film has on proclaiming love as some sort of universal truth or higher dimension while not really proving it at all, either visually or conceptually (script). It dumbs down the surreal nature of the sequence to a point of meaninglessness. Nolan shares so little trust in his audience that I'm kinda surprised that most people don't seem to catch on to this. Pretty much every one of his films (with the exception of the Prestige, which is not his material, and Insomnia, which is a remake and an inert one at that) holds your hand. The most blatent of this is Inception, who's entire dialogue could be summed up as Exposition the Motion Picture. 		I'm not against exposition, mind you. Some directors use it to a masterful degree. David Fincher films are practically full of exposition, but in his films, Fincher uses exposition as the action and not just filler. Zodiac is a good example of this. Scorcese's masterful thematic trilogy of Goodfellas, Casino and TWOWT share this in spades with a heavy use of narration that codifies the themes and atmosphere really well and serve as part of the experience. 		Nolan just can't seem to let mystery lie or integrate his exposition better into his films. 		Edit: got kinda carried away there. Interstellar was an entertaining film, with some strong elements but ultimately a very flawed effort.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BLUYear","name":"t1_cna5rqi","parent_id":"t1_cn9lvd5","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1420011171,"created_utc":1420011171}

{"body":"I'll tell you why I think it deserved a 73% and I don't think it had anything to do with the quantum love.		The film was stretched too thin, and asks too much from the audience. The little annoyances add up to a big part of the film that left me feeling empty and unfulfilled.		We're thrown into a dystopian future that just looks....normal. Sure, there's a dust storm. So what? I didn't *feel* like the earth was in jeopardy. Nolan didn't set up the premise properly. That sets the tone for the rest of the film for me. I've already been let down and I can't get back into it.		Then, I'm supposed to believe this swashbuckling dirt farmer is a former pilot. The dream sequence doesn't do it for me. His long, rich career is relegated to a wisp of a memory. I don't *feel* his expertise and I don't buy into the idea that he's a former pilot. He doesn't talk like a pilot at all (purely subjective, I know.)		I'll skip over the gravity oddities and anomalies since they're crucial to the plot, but I never really "bought" that either.		Then, the changeover. We are in a cornfield one moment, then in space the next. That's a chasm of an intellectual jump for the audience to make. It doesn't carry you into acceptance. It just thrusts you into space out of a cornfield. Again, it leaves me behind, wishing there were more dots connected.		And now for a few more annoyances: the time gap should have left the remaining astronaut elated and stunned to see his partners return from the ocean planet, but instead he just seems...fine. "Oh, hey, yeah, it's been 25 years but welcome back." No emotional breakdown, no apparent wear and tear on his mental state, no change in his personality -- nothing. Just slightly older looking and maybe a little tired.		The robots: fucking nonsense. Giant awkward pillars with legs that look like they're operated by a puppeteer. Possibly the most annoying part of the film. There is not one aspect of these droids that didn't seem forced. They were hilarious and I loved them, but they took me out of the film because the mechanics of such a droid seem so awkward and unsuited to the challenges that beset them.		Then there's the music. Ugh. Most of the time, it was on cue. But so many shots had a blaring emotional swell when the on-screen action was really just mundane. The music was screaming at me to feel something I didn't even feel in the first place. It felt too reaching, desperate, and awkward.		I think the film got exactly what it deserved. 73% seems right to me, for the reasons I've listed. Everything else was spot on and I relished those sequences. But when you get something 73% right, the part I remember most is the 27% that felt...off.","depth":3,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ophello","name":"t1_cn9pz09","parent_id":"t1_cn9lfo9","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419977177,"created_utc":1419977177}
{"body":"Ignoring the fact that that is not what a 73% means on rt, it sounds like you want someone to hold your hand through a movie. The fact that a dystopian future resembles today is crucial- not only does it make everything more identifiable, but it makes sense. After a catastrophe, folks want a semblance of what things were like before, and kept their basic creature comforts, eliminating the advanced machines and technology held so contemptuously due to their supposed indirect responsibility for the food shortage. Of course the bodies were buried and everyone tried to fake it, and there was famine, not global warfare that destroyed basic infrastructure. 		Also, I don't know how a pilot is supposed to speak, outside of the military they're rather rare. The dream sequence is supposed to illustrate what about his old career still haunts him, why he is dogged by it, not some shitty 'Top Gun' montage to tack a half hour onto the film. 		And going from a corn field to the stars is exactly what makes the film so great- it takes a massive leap that is just so awe-inspiring, and pulls it off with aplomb. The music swells I never found jarring, I mean, they're in space, going through a worm hole, or on another planet- what about this is not mentally immense, emotionally stifling, visually crushing? 		The dude should have cried when they returned, agreed, but I think his character was supposed to be a really dry, tired scientist, and became moreso by the time they got back. He had probably come to the 'acceptance' stage of grief. The robots are goofy, but also fairly original, funny, and sleek. 9/10 film, I've seen it in a normal theater and IMAX, will try to see it again.","depth":4,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WhamBamMaam","name":"t1_cn9tj3b","parent_id":"t1_cn9pz09","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419983699,"created_utc":1419983699}

{"body":"No, you lose all the immersion. With make up you'd probably need at least 6 actors to feasibly make it look like someone was aging over 12 years (kids change a lot in just a year). If you could find 6 child actors who looked that similar to make the human brain honestly believe that it was watching the same person actually aging, then you are a god. Take a look at Looper for example, even with make up and the prosthetics, my brain didn't believe for a second that JGL's character actually grew up to be Bruce Willis. And that's only one character at two different ages. With Boyhood, every character ages, and it's 12 different ages, not two.		On top of that, you lose all the great nostalgia and etc that came over 12 years of filming. All the songs, the pop culture references, the Star Wars conversations, the Obama campaign and everything that was relevant when they were shooting would be lost if they just shot it over three months with different actors. Obviously they could fake it, but it wouldn't be genuine. The Star Wars conversation is so great because the audience knows they genuinely didn't think there would be an episode 7 at the time of filming. 		The only reason Boyhood works so well is because the audience can tell that it's actually real. It captures real lives and a real span of time and shows real characters aging that would be nearly impossible to achieve if it wasn't shot over those 12 years. So no, it's absolutely not a gimmick. I can understand not seeing the point of the film or finding it boring, but calling it a gimmick is simply ridiculous.","depth":9,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"taylorswiftfan123","name":"t1_cn9nt49","parent_id":"t1_cn9mzbf","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419973457,"created_utc":1419973457}
{"body":"Okay, maybe gimmick isn't the right word. It isn't in service to the story would be a better way of putting it. And naming Looper as an example of anything other than bad makeup is disingenuous. I can think of several films where characters have aged or been matched with young children and it was done well. Sometimes siblings are used to make it more natural. Again, beside the point.		When you say "you lose all the great nostalgia and etc that came over 12 years of filming", that's just silly. That's like saying "American Graffiti" would have been a better film if it was made in 1962. It doesn't hold.		Look, I'm not saying that "Boyhood" isn't a great achievement. If you read my next comment, you'll see that.

Our current science describes the universe from an objective perspective, but we all experience the universe from unique, individual, subjective perspectives. Currently we don't know nearly enough to explain what gives rise to this subjectivity. Just as Interstellar deals with the limits of our understanding of black holes, wormholes, and the like, it seems to speculate on the possibility of real, "quantifiable" forces at the heart of human subjectivity. It asks the question: what if our true selves, the source of our subjective experience, exists in and affects areas outside of our current understanding of space and time?

{"body":"I thought it was a very boring iteration of a standard sci-fi premise. I'm a big sci-fi and fantasy fan. My favorite straight up sci-fi of the year is probably Edge of Tomorrow. 		Anyway, during no point in the movie did Nolan sufficiently do enough work to convince me I should care. I think he throws a lot of archetypes and styles at you to vaguely convey a crapsack world(dust bowl, real original) that we should for some reason want to get better(despite the fact that it is SOLELY due to human incompetence. In other sci-fi films external agents threaten humanity. Not in Interstellar though, we fuck it up ourselves, and yet I'm supposedly supposed to care)		Secondly, maybe this isn't a popular opinion on reddit but I'm not so spooked by this dystopia in this world, at least how he frames it. How are the other ways this society is being controlled besides whether or not scientific advancement is stifled? Am I solely supposed to be aghast at that? I want to know these things but he sheds no light, instead, there's a vein of science worship in this film, as if the structures of modern science in the 19th, 20th, and 21st century are the only valid way to interpret reality. So in that way its very reductionist at its core. 		Combine that sort of odious stuff with Matt Damon's hilarious space madness, and Anne Hathaway cringeily speechifying themes that were already pretty obvious, plus an annoyingly puzzle-box like plot where Matty McConnaughey did it all along, and that the clues sent back were probably just advanced humans who are super awesome really were boring.

{"body":"Hmm. That is an interesting interpretation of the film. The crew being wrong is something that I had not thought of. However, I still think that your interpretation muddies the thesis up. My biggest problem with the film is the two contradictory statements I feel like it tries to make.		1. It lets out a big "Fuck yeah! Science!" throughout the whole movie. This can be a good thesis for a film. *2001* and *Star Trek* are good examples of this.		2. It also says "Love is a powerful force" throughout the whole movie. This can also be a good thesis for a film, if a bit overused. But it can still be good! Look at *Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind* or *Upstream Color* as good examples here.		The problem comes when the evidence for the themes contradict one another. You can't say that logical reasoning is great and the have Brandt's irrational desire to save her boyfriend end up being correct. The movie strongly implies that she only wants to go there because she loves him, not for any logical reason. However, we are shown that the planet her boyfriend was on was correct. That contradicts the whole "fuck yeah science" thing. On the other hand, the movie portrays this selfish nature of humanity (both with Brandt and with Mann) in a negative light. Brandt as shown as selfishly putting her love above the needs of humanity. But then again, she is shown to be right. Mann is used to show that man's animalistic selfishness is what hold humanity back. But it is also shown, through Brandt as a good thing. This is seems, to me, to be confused and contradictory, ruining the potential impact of the film for me.		The movie also implies that the crew is correct. I don't see the evidence for your interpretation other than "it makes the movie better if its true". If you could provide me with the evidence for it, that would be greatly appreciated. However, the movie does imply that the crew is correct. The bookshelf scene in general is Cooper have a revelation which is proven to be correct - the information he gives is correct, after all. Because the information surrounding the "future-humans" and "power-of-love" bits is proven correct, we must also assume the other information is correct. I don't know though; if you can prove me wrong, I'd be more than happy to admit it. :)		I didn't find the movie corny and outlandish. I found the movie confused (not confusing) and muddied. To me, a movie must pose a powerful question, or provide evidence for a fundamental theme in order to be good. Interstellar, in my opinion, tried to push two themes with contradictory evidence.

I don't really have much evidence beyond my own interpretation of the happenings and what I believe they were supposed to imply though, I'm afraid. 		What I took away from the whole Brandt/Edmonds fiasco was that humans are both empowered and weakened by our intrinsic connection to emotion, and the extent to which is controls us. It clouds our logic but sometimes you get lucky and the two align. In this scenario it works to drive you harder down the correct path. I certainly didn't read it as 'Brandt's love was a force that was pulling the crew towards the correct planet', simply a happy coincidence. 		Similarly with Coop/Murph, again I believe the whole sequence of events was orchestrated by the future humans purely because they realised at some point in their development that Murph was the one to resolve QM and Gravity. They had to ensure this came to be to ensure they would exist at all (remember, they see all of time and time is cyclic). Murph was the one they needed, not Coop. Coop was a puppet that they used because they couldn't locate points in time due to their 5th dimensional existence (this was explained briefly if I remember correctly). Coop saw it as "they need me because my love for Murph will guide me in the tesseract" when in reality, his intimate knowledge of her and her life made him the best candidate to deliver the 'knowledge package' to Murph at the correct time and in the correct place. 		The whole movie was about the future humans trying to ensure their existence, more so than the present humans trying to ensure their survival. A similar analogy would be the future humans dropping the apple onto Newtons head to ensure he would consider why it had fallen.

{"body":"POSSIBLE SPOILERS...I think.		While I'm not trying to start anything at all really, other than maybe a nice dialogue like yourself, I share the same opinion as you. 		I felt that the film, outside of the rather brilliant and undeniable technical ability of Nolan as a filmmaker, was the usual Nolan affair of half-thought out twists with ambivalently tenuous ambiguity. For me Interstellar shared a lot with Inception insofar as while everyone got to ponder the ambiguity of certain points in the film's narrative, there existed simply too many of them for it to be wholly conceived of. Certainly, upon re watching these movies,  it becomes clear that it is simply lazy narrative composure hiding behind fantastic cinematography, a breathtakingly over-the-top score, and a quality eye for exploiting any opportunity for suspense and tension in the screenplay.		Furthermore I felt that while there were initially great moments of homage to Kubrick (re. 2001), Interstellar began to become a flawed pastiche that almost veered on plagiarism at points. A good example of homage would be the use of close-ups on the astronauts' faces and visors as the miracle of space sweeps past in vibrant glory set against a stunned gaze, locked on the sheer infinity of the whole experience. However, the boundaries between tribute and lazy theft blur as the film traces an incredibly similar plot regarding the progress of man as experienced in the climax through a mind-bending, introspective experience within the black-hole/dimensionless dimension. Ultimately everything calms down and the audience is left to contemplate. For Kubrick fans, it was a metaphysical statement that bordered on the esoteric - questioning man and the urge for progress; where it may take us and what it might mean depending on how we experience it. The ambiguity was crafted to be brilliantly and genuinely interpretive. For Nolan acolytes, there was little of this outside direct plot devices - the ambiguities focused on the literal and the metaphysical seemed lazy, unfinished and rather banal.		Some gave out about the science. I wouldn't dream to do that - not my place or area to critique. However, the pop-philosophy and armchair naval-gazing of Interstellar infuriated me. It was simultaneously an exercise in middle-class wishful activism and a neo-Platonic nightmare of vaguely neo-conservative platitudes (a ground not unfamiliar to Nolan, as has been covered elsewhere). The first hour of the film shared more with that pitiless shit-storm Transcendence (also of the Nolan stable): a dirty veneer of "Oh no, the planet's fucked with dust-storms and famine!" Why? "Eh, well... Look! Some scientists are in a lab with a piece of corn. Rekt, obviously..."		Aside from other easily avoided narrative holes, such as why he had to steal that ship at the end, it was quite simply too long and too hollow for me to enjoy myself for 3 hours. The third act was entertaining, no doubt, but could not make up for a painfully random first act and a somewhat stalled second.		But hey, that's just my opinion.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"effrum","name":"t1_cn9xt6g","parent_id":"t1_cn9ppm5","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419992233,"created_utc":1419992233}

My central problem with *Interstellar*, and Nolan's films in general, is their weakly formed cores. He always builds his films around a thesis, but in Interstellar I found that he failed to build a convincing argument for either "the power of love" or "the power of science".

He often gets caught between a faintly liberal ideology and a Cold War survivalist mentality. It is confusing to digest for the simple reason that I think it is somewhat confusing in conception itself.		Outside of this, in the more literal world, I feel that the more autonomy Nolan is given by studios, the more his work suffers from this as the scale simply gets bigger and bigger. His smaller, earlier work was constrained by financing and production obligations. But since he's gone, as some people hyperbolically assert, 'auteur' (*shudder*), he has been given free reign to paint his confusion on a far bigger canvas that is subjected to far less intra-studio critique. 		What I mean is that what was intriguing and tonally clever in his smaller pictures  was revealed to be somewhat hollow and illusory in his bigger ones.

I do believe if he could make another great movie. But, I think he needs to lose the idea that complexity means greatness. Though he does have an eye for good cinematography. So I hope he finds a way to blend them both.

TDK feels far more contemporary and seems more like a Michael Mann thriller film in a Batman skin. There's less of a stylistic shift between TDK and TDKR- but TDKR partially returns to the idea of legend and comic mythology in the first film, even as such- it changes up the franchise as the second is a an ultra-tight, too-fast, nocturnal Batman thriller and the third one removes Batman from his nightime vigilante role and turns Wayne into a recluse who fails at returning to his former state- a considerable amount of the film shows him weak, trying to redeem himself while Gotham falls apart in a far less underground/seedier way.

{"body":"Edit: TL;DR at the bottom that's probably still a little long, but much shorter than the post. Also, I agree they're not realistic, but they are pretty dark and don't gloss over the realism in the same way many Batman adaptations have done.		--		1. This is one of many criticisms I level at the silly Evil Plot Device of Doom. I wish it had been slightly more... "Realistic" than a magic microwave transmitter. That's not how microwaves work.	2. Magic cape.	3. The Joker escapes jail because he knew what was going to happen and where the explosion was going to be. I assume he also made sure there was help waiting (etc), but we never saw. We presume others survive the bombing, but being minor characters, we never find out who. The third movie... Eh... I think it's the weakest of the tree, but the timeline isn't terrible so much as the deus ex machina is a bit transparent.	4. I generally let a film have each main character have one or two slightly unbelievably lucky moments - by my reckoning, they got lucky (or were really good at what they did) to be worthy of having films made about them. It is pretty silly though.		When I criticise the third film (The Dark Knight Rises), I have plenty of other criticisms to make:		* Fusion Reactor -> Bomb? Do we have to try and get the public even more riled up over nuclear power, when Fusion like that is so far away, it's mere speculation right now? It seems to me that it's quite unlikely you'd make a bomb in the way they did, and you could have just used a regular nuclear reactor for it without me levelling any criticisms. A minor point, but one that stings me more than many others.	* Bane is a fantastic villain for appearances, but we don't see as much of [TDKR Spoilers](#s "the woman pulling the strings"). When compared to The Joker, and even Twoface, he falls a little short - no character development, no real attachment from Bruce/Batman, and little reason to empathise with his cause - in short, he's almost a stock comicbook villain. By comparison, Begins had Ras, Bruce's friend and mentor, and TDK had The Joker, the antithesis of Batman, who almost stole the film. Bane is just... Good, and that makes him feel weak in such a strong trilogy.	* Why does Bane put him in a prison somebody has got out of and assume he won't get out? Why are there no guards? Why does nobody tell him he got out? Cameras? Anything?	* Why didn't the military try anything more than the two tiny attempts we saw? I understand being cautious, but it just felt like the power of plot kept them out - we had little to reinforce the power of plot and few reminders of it that it felt strange watching the film a second time. It's as if the outside world doesn't exist, which felt too clean from a narrative standpoint.	* How did the Police get kept underground for so long with nobody finding a way out? Again, it felt like cop-out (pardon the pun) for an easier narrative. It wouldn't be so bad if TDKR was set over a short period of time, but quite a lot of time passes and... Nothing changes? It's downright weird.	* Why does Anne Hathaway seem so damned cool when she does comparatively little in the film? It almost bothers me how much I enjoy her performance, despite a lack of action for her character - she's almost purely reactionary, and has little depth beyond doing what is needed. Kudos to the actress though, and the people who wrote her dialogue.	* Why did nobody link the break in at the stock exchange with Bruce Wayne suddenly going bankrupt? Was there no way he could appeal? Nobody who could be brought forward as the person in charge of managing his stock to say "No, we did not do this"? Looking from the outside in, as a lawyer it'd be a case to fight over. Winning back the Wayne estate would be a *huge* payout.	* During the penultimate fight scene, why does nobody die during the initial charge at the gun-line? Why does the brawl go on for that long with nobody going down? It feels like it's purely background to another fight... Which further lessons the action we're supposed to be paying attention to.		---		**TL;DR:**		When looking at the third film - I liked the Bruce/Batman character in it. Bane was a competent villain, Anne Hathaway delivered a really good performance, which was more than her writing ought to have got and there were so many shortcuts taken when writing the plot to make it easier for the audience that it felt like it should have had more depth.		I still really enjoy the film. It's well paced, has a good mixture of action to story progression, is well shot and directed, well acted, and the dialogue is also pretty well written. Many of the action scenes are incredibly well done (e.g. the beginning, the American football stadium, the final climb), but similarly, much of the background to all of that feels like it is "background" ("filler"), and that cheapens it (e.g. the Pit, the Police Deptartment, the isolation of Gotham, the final fight).		It's still my favourite series of superhero movies, and probably my favourite trilogy since Lord of the Rings, but I *really* wish that they had just made the third film that little bit better.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Korlus","name":"t1_cn9w2o1","parent_id":"t1_cn9qbi8","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419988662,"created_utc":1419988662}

{"body":"This hasn't always been the case. The franchise building phenomenon is a relatively new facet to Hollywood and you didn't really see it at all until the 1980s. Here's a brief history:		In 1969 both Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy came out. Both films were very raw, subversive, shot on location with cheap camera equipment (relative to the time), had young directors (although Schlesinger had experience in Europe) and most importantly both mopped up at the Oscars and both were huge financial hits. Young audiences flocked to see these movies, which surprisingly enough was a demographic that Hollywood was having trouble to engage. But all of a sudden there were these films that had cursing in them, drug use, homosexuality, rock n roll, and realistic depictions of racism. And the young counter culture audience ate  it up. 		So now you had a template for Hollywood to follow and Hollywood loves templates! Give a million dollars and some cheap camera equipment to some snot nosed film school graduate and have him go out onto the streets and shoot the most subversive film he could possibly think of. People refer to this time period as the "New Hollywood" or less affectionately as "The Hollywood Brats Generations." This was undoubtedly one of the most exciting times in American film. Famous "brat" directors were: Scorsese, Coppola, Bogdanovic, Altman, cimino, friedkin, Polanski, Spielberg, Lucas and many more. 		Now I know what you're thinking, "what the fuck does this have to do with film franchises?" Well hold on I'm getting to it. In a lot of ways there are 3 films that were made by this generation of film makers that shifted the perception of not only audiences but of studio executives. The first was The Godfather: Part II (1974) which was the first sequel to win Best Picture. It validated the integrity of film sequels. Before that sequels never did as well as the original and it was mostly reserved for comedies. The second film was Jaws (1975) which was the first wide release. Before that films were campaigned from city to city and hype was slowly built. And of course the last film was Star Wars (1977) which, among other things, made an absolute boatload of money in merchandising. With that film Hollywood realized that they could make more money selling lunch boxes than they could ever make producing films. When you mixed that with the huge financial flops that were put out by the artsy'er "brats", most notably Cimino's Heaven's Gate (1980) and Coppola's One From the Heart (1982) "New Hollywood" was officially over. 		And thus began the age of Hollywood lunch boxes. Franchise building and merchandising became much safer bets than taking risks on newer projects. Look back at the many film franchises of the 1980s and it's plain to see. Star Wars, Alien, Rambo, Die Hard, Rocky, Lethal Weapon, Mad Max, Indiana Jones, Terminator, Robo-Cop etc etc. 		This notion has been exasperated further by the explosion of comic book movies. Brought on by Tim Burton's Batman (1989), which started the trend of making superhero films dark, and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) that legitimized CGI technology. 		So this is where we find ourselves. In the midst of an endless parade of superheroes and Sci-Fi films and an even more endless parade of sequels and spin-offs. But, like all Hollywood trends, this one will end as well. It may be hard for you to imagine this ever ending. How could it? They're so popular! Well that's what they said about the western, the epic, the screwball comedy, the musical, the rom com, the noir, and our subversive "brats." Tastes change, perception changes, technology changes and things get over saturated. And if you ask me I think we're witnessing the beginning of the end for the comic/Sci-Fi explosion. I think it'll be done once the Avenger franchise runs its course, and the Justice League, and once the Avatar franchise is done. I just can't imagine where else directors can take the genre once those behemoths are finished. But who knows.

The thing is, Spielberg doesn't always appear to be sincere to me, sometimes it seems to be contrived, or sentimental, but I haven't watched enough of him to judge in every case.		I do sometimes have a guilty pleasure watching series like Back to the Future, but from any objective standpoint I wouldn't think of it very highly. It is a bit charming though, and I see that child-like sincerity in it, so I understand what you're saying.		To me, the movies that are the deepest and greatest but STILL manage to be entertaining is something like It's a Wonderful Life. That's one of the most charming movies I've ever seen. A lot of movies directed by Capra are emotional and sincere in the same way. Many movies back then had this child-like sincerity, but still managed to be subtle and sometimes even emotionally deep.		A more recent example would be Woody Allen. Yes, he's often comical, yes, it's often immature, but he has this artistic-but-still-charming side of him that manifests in in movies like Danny Rose, or more recently, Magic in the Moonlight (with still having a fairly witty screenplay).

However, as the movie progresses it's clear that the whole speech has nothing to do with romance at all.		A major point of the film is the [Spoilers](#s "Gravity can travel through dimension") spiel. Obviously the understanding of this is vital to the films plot resolution. Yet the 'love' part isn't, since they ignore Anne Hathaways plea anyway. So why is it touched upon?		[Spoilers](#s "Cooper getting to see Murph again, Cooper finding himself in 3D Murphs bedroom simulation, Cooper flying to meet Brand at the end") all these things can be interpreted different ways. (Obviously point 2 is explained fully, but it is interesting to think about whether 'love' had any part.) But the fact is, at the end, Anne is not proven wrong. Whether Love was or was not the reason, nothing has contradicted her. In fact, if anything, the events of the film lend weight to her theory.		Anyway, I'm rambling. The fact that these things happen, combined with Anne's speech, imply that she has a point. But that's the best bit about it. The film tells you she's wrong. It gives you clear explanations as to why these things occur, but the speech still resonates because it's clear she's not *wrong*. 		Also, ask yourself. What was Coopers motivation? What was Brand's? Both of them drawn away from the ones they loved to save them, both of them drawn to each other in the end as a result to start anew.		Gravity can pass through the dimensions. We know this because we understand it. Does Love? The film asks you this question and then proceeds to dismantle the theory by giving more plausable explanations.

{"body":"Alright, after reading part of *The Science of Interstellar* apparently it's because the fifth dimension is very much compressed compared to the lower dimensions.		I'm going to type this all up, a summary of the chapter about bulk space. Gimme a few minutes.		**Explanation**		So, first, gravity. Gravity in our regular universe decreases by the inverse square law, and you can visualize this by drawing lines out [(see diagram on the left)](http://astrobites.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tendex_lines_in_orbiting_plane_of_binary_composite_figure.png) outwards from any body with gravity, let's say the sun.		Now, if I am at distance r, the number of tendex lines over a certain area at that distance will give me the strength of gravity. This means in three dimensions, it correlates to the increase in surface area of a sphere. So, let's say at 1 meter from an object the gravity is 4??r (r in this case is 1) m/s^2. At 2 meters, it would be 4??4, or 16??, since 2^2 = r^2.		Now, since gravity can transcend dimensions, this means that gravity would also propagate in higher dimensional space. This means instead of the surface area, the strength of gravity will fade based on the change in volume of the sphere. (Integrating surface area) which would be 4/3??r^3. This means gravity would run by an inverse cube law, which means it would be incredibly weak and the planets would fly off.		So how in interstellar can people traverse meaningful distances in the 4th dimension, but not fuck up the rest of  physics? Well that results in the ante-de-sitter warp of the bulk. So let's assume we go back to Romilly's paper universe, where our universe is two dimensions (paper thin) and the "bulk" or hyperspace is three dimensional. We can't have gravity escape away from the paper, so we instead only allow it to escape an infinitesimally small amount by having the amount of traversable space in the bulk decrease with its distance from our universe.		[Here](http://i.imgur.com/cbP43AT.jpg) is a diagram of how this works. The lines are tendex lines of gravity, and the out-back direction is the direction of hyperspace. Our universe (or "brane") is the orange plane. This basically prevents the volume of the sphere being significant and prevents it from dispersing gravity.		This also presents another possibility - that the space in the bulk between Gargantua and Earth is *much* smaller than the distance in real space, although this is technically not a wormhole.		[The distance would shrink by a factor of a few trillion, changing the distance between Coop and Earth from billions of light years to only tens of millions of miles (1 AU)](http://i.imgur.com/BkCZQ5u.jpg)		The "confining branes" 1.5cm from our universe are at the distance necessary to allow for gravity to not screw up, but allows for space to accomplish meaningful actions outside of our brane. (This is where the tesseract was located)		Therefore once the tesseract collapsed, Coop had already travelled the distance back to earth due to the excessive time dilation he had already experienced around the black hole. As a fun thought experiment, ante-de-sitter warping is actually one of the theories used to unify string theory and it's 11 dimensions and the escape of gravity as a way to account for dark energy repulsing the universe. (Gravity forces could be leaking into our universe from the bulk, and it's only noticeable on very large scales such as galaxy clusters)		**tl;dr Space inside the tesseract was smaller than regular space because physics, and this with the time dilation meant Cooper was already home by the time the tesseract collapsed. Hyperbeings just needed to push him in the right direction.**		Also the pictures are from a later chapter of [the book](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Interstellar-Kip-Thorne/dp/0393351378/) that my sister got me for Christmas.

{"body":"I thought it was an experience that I needed from a modern movie. It was a blockbuster where the director had actual creative control. Within the scope of this project, I was also happy to see that one of the main inspirations for the film (2001: A Space Odyssey) was paid respect by being subtly referenced multiple times. It made me experience awe and excitement in a way that had much more substance than a typical blockbuster. Movies like Avengers are fun, but they don't really make you feel any sort of emotional attachment beyond a very basic "hope that the good guys win" feeling. Interstellar was much more immersive, desolate, expansive, and full of wonder. Yeah, it insulted my intelligence a bit, and I kind of wish it was more cryptic than it was (2001 may have been too cryptic for some, and as a result might not reach the same scope of movie goers, but I digress), but it left enough to our imaginations. I wouldn't place this film anywhere near my top 5, but it's definitely in my top 15. 2001: A Space Odyssey is my all-time favorite film, and I was glad to see a film attempt to be more than just a blockbuster, while appealing to that crowd at the same time.		I also understand the subjectivity of taste in movies and music. One person's 2001 could be another person's Going Bananas (Dom DeLuise, and that kid from Over the Top).

Additionally there is plenty of good and varied discourse and analysis about how much emphasis and responsibility companies should place on stockholder gains.		Furthermore, we have the history of merging and deregulation as context to take into account. I could personally finance the best blockbuster ever created, and yet it would be nearly impossible to secure a wide release in theaters because I have only one film and not an entire slate of films to leverage in negotiating against the competition, which keeps the theaters in business.

All the criticism for Interstellar about it being a cliche love story and how Nolan is a bad writer for writing tons of exposition and having to spoon feed the audience.

Yes, Nolan was wholly original but maybe it wouldn't have caught the studios attention if it confused the audience.		I've read many comparisons with 2001 Space Odyssey with Interstellar, and the general impression I have gotten is that the reason why 2001 is vastly superior is because it was able to be ambiguous and its meaning could be debated many years down the line (which it has) but would it be possible for a film like 2001 to be released to today's audience and find success? Look at when it was first released, the reception was lukewarm, and didn't harness the blockbuster money making movie quality that is expected nowadays.		I just got out of my second time watching Interstellar, and I thought it was great, but was wondering if it had to be dumbed down to be accepted to a larger audience.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EPiDEMiC77","name":"t1_cna5t2h","parent_id":"t3_2qtw77","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1420011286,"created_utc":1420011286}

{"body":"I liked Interstellar, but I don't see how it was any less "original" than the likes of Guardians, Dawn, Maleficent (which was bad but original), or How to Train Your Dragon 2. Yes, those used preexisting characters in several ways, but they told unique stories and used all kinds of originality. 		Meanwhile Interstellar, sure, had new characters and a new world, but it cribbed all kinds of thoughts and concepts from other sources. 2001 is an obvious inspiration, for one. I think this comparison is totally arbitrary, but Guardians felt much more "original" to me personally. Interstellar doesn't feel wholly original to me at all, and Nolan's citation of inspirations and sources backs up that notion.		All that said, this feels entirely arbitrary. "Originality" is just one component of a movie's quality that could mean everything or nothing. The most original movie in the world could exist but also be terrible because it doesn't learn anything from any other film. I'm much more concerned with moneymaking movies being good, and not being created solely as cash grabs by the creative players involved. Interstellar was made by a studio because they see Nolan as a moneymaker, just as ASM2 was made because they thought Spider-Man was.		As for money made, of course people are going to invest more in a product they feel they know and can rely on rather than something totally new. This is the business side of Hollywood, folks. In the same way, many people would rather buy a new Samsung TV because they've learned to trust the brand rather than some new unproven startup (others like trying out the startup).","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cn9mf8c","parent_id":"t3_2qtw77","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419971074,"created_utc":1419971074}

{"body":"There's a lot of hate for franchises, but the thing is, franchises are not intrinsically a bad thing. 		Franchises have been with us (humans) for a really, really long time. The pantheon of gods/prophets in most religions is at its core a franchise. Lord of the Rings (in the era when they were just books), Dune, The Iliad and Odyssey, the Greek Tragedies and Comedies. The Brothers Grimm and their tales were a kind of franchise (to put 2014 marketing words on it, they were a brand with a shared universe).		So, the idea that franchises are something created by hollywood executives to fatten their wallets is fallacious. Having said that, hollywood has wisened up (probably in large part due to seeing long term audience investment in more film-like TV shows) and now uses the 'franchise' model for films.		The model itself makes a lot of sense. Making an audience care about something, anything, is hard. If a movie runs 120 minues, it probably takes about 10-20% of that runtime to just get you invested in the protagonist, and another 5 or so % for every other major character. By using the franchise model, you can recoup investments in character bonding with the audience made earlier in the series. If an audience cares about your protagonist at minute 0, you've got 20% more screentime to tell a great story about them.		Now, the franchise criticism bit that is valid, is that with great power comes great responsibility (a line from a franchise, btw, and i'm talking about the comics and the shared marvel universe). As a hollywood exec, you can either do your franchise right (as has been done effectively many times, Dark Knight, LOTR, Harry Potter, Fast and the Furious to name some of many) or you can use it to con your audience out of their dollars. The latter has also been done many times (Cars, the Star Wars prequels, Transformers, LOTR depending on where you land on those films).		What I'm saying is: Just because something is a franchise doesn't make it an inferior film. In fact, many times a franchise can be used to tell a better film than a standalone because you have lots more to build on. You can, in essence, make a moment have strings that connect back deep into the history of a character, maybe many films past, or perhaps even from a different medium. That's rich stuff.		And finally, there's the issue of how many stories we tell. I forget who said this, but there's merit in it: There's really only a finite number of archetypal stories we create. This isn't because there's a lack of creativity, but because our brains are actually hardwired to process certain types of narrative structures, and because fundamentally, 'being human' has a limited palette of emotions and ideas.		Even when a film is wholly original, the likelihood is that it draws on these archetypal stories and weaves something new with them. Whether it's a franchise or not, ultimately it's pulling from a similar bucket.		At its basest level, Interstellar is a story about a man who wants to explore. A story about making sacrifices to save humanity. A story about a family torn apart but brought together by the bonds of love. A story about people in tough situations acting in self interest.		Any of those sound familiar?		So, to TLDR this, judge a movie based on how it tells a great story, using those fundamental human ideas to weave a compelling narrative that ultimately transports an audience from point A to point B and transforms them in the process, and not on whether or not the characters are familiar or part of a universe with an existing history within your mind.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rahmad","name":"t1_cn9lmtl","parent_id":"t3_2qtw77","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1419969742,"created_utc":1419969742}
