On weekends when not racing LACR, San Bernadino or Carlsbad, we would drive up to Bean Canyon and just have a blast riding all weekend. Hell even rode up to the top of a butte near Edwards dry lake bed and watched the Shuttle land, at one point it was damn near eye level with us as it came in. 		 There were several times riding out in the desert we came up on film crews, even rode up on the set of the Army of Darkness, had no idea what was going on and kept ditching security they had on quads.

{"body":"The short version? Money.		Distributing a film is expensive (theatrical, at least). Like, very expensive. And to think, this was 15 years ago, when everything was film. You have to foot the bill for every 35mm print that's going to theaters. You have to pay for marketing. You have to get trailers cut. You have to pay for all kinds of shit. It is not cheap, by any means. And if you don't spend this money, no one will even know your movie exists. 		Here's a good example. I worked on a feature film, partnered with FOX. The production budget of this film was around $40 million. The marketing budget (solely on FOX as the distributor) was over $100 million.		We made back our production budget at the box office, but that marketing budget probably won't ever be made back.		So, back to the money. It is really hard to find a distributor if your film isn't good. Most of the time, you want a distributor before you even make the movie, that way they're involved from the get-go and your movie will come out. If you make it without a distributor, there's a chance that no one will want to distribute it, and you're left in 'distribution hell'. Just like what happened here. They couldn't sell it to anyone, so it got locked away forever. It happens more than you'd like to hear..

{"body":"I think it's even more than that. American Dad is more consistent and polished. 		Watching Family Guy, I get the impression that the writers just brainstorm a hundred jokes, then work out ways to string them together -- the characters and stories exist only to provide options for that. Some of those jokes are really funny, but overall even the best episodes feel lacking in effort. 		American Dad seems like it has a lot more care put into it, like they actually spent time on giving personality to the characters and thinking about how they behave and interact, and then putting those characters in entertaining stories, before peppering the episode with jokes. There are fewer jokes per episode, but the overall feel and entertainment value is higher, and I think it makes the show more enjoyable and engaging.		Interestingly I think The Simpsons has gone the opposite way, compared to Family Guy. The Simpsons nowadays seems to spend 90% of its time on the episode's plot, to the extent that they almost forget to put jokes in at all. I assume this is because after 570 episodes, the only story ideas they have left require elaborate set-ups and extra characters.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Malteir","name":"t1_cr7b4o0","parent_id":"t1_cr75u70","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1431485975,"created_utc":1431482375}

Add to this that it was 2001, prior to all the digital distribution options filmmakers have today, I'm not surprised something like this wasn't distributed.

{"body":"I got a whole alcohol, marijuana, and sexual activity (probably the kind that is determined to be bad by the church) leads to seances which leads to bad spirits (or skip the seances to the bad spirits) vibe at first. It read like a bad "drugs are bad" type movie at first and then kind of went into a Freddy Krueger type vibe as the movie went on. The acting was flat (one part that sticks out was the whole woman1: "bitch!" woman2: \*slap\*. woman1 and 2 fall on each others shoulders crying as though, but not in a natural way. More like they are trying to remember the script the whole time). The script was horrible.		Why did they turn out the lights and light candles for a random story then turn them on again like it was just something they did? They seemed pretty calm after they just witnessed a murder and the police were at the door. Did she just hit the windshield with her seat-belt on? Did they just split up after knowing that they could be picked off and just witnessed one of them just getting picked off? Did he just leave the hospital room without calling in a nurse? Why did that old lady just say "never despise the poor" after he apologized for getting her involved? It's your fault and then it's our fault in just a short time.  Wait, did they just say they should forget the cops and are going to go "kick his ass" when refering to a real-life, proven killer... and then just decide to break into his house and possibly ruin evidence that might help to link him to other murders that he did? "there's a door"... really? Random swastikas... is the kid hindu? Random homeless guy? "I'm a black-belt, Eric" really? really? Are they idiots too? I don't believe in that crap, and still would take it way more seriously then they are given those events actually happening... it's not like a fender bender happened and some hack said something bad was going to happen in their life. There are murderers happening and they are actually watching it in real time. WTF. The characters actually believe it's happening and treating it like they are about to get a bad grade on a test rather than like a murderer running around. ... wait, dream fighting... and without consulting anyone else? Where did they get how to do things? Do they just make it up as they go and assume that it will be that way?.. Wait.. WTF! He had a gun the whole time?!... lol, ok. I didn't see that ending even though it isn't exactly something new. They left the candles burning. Don't leave the candles burning. Overall, weird.		A few good things I guess...  I didn't stop watching it for some reason. It was free. Side boob. Killer CD was pretty funny.		Other than that, I think the worst part is that some people actually believe stuff like this happens, but that might actually help the movie in some way. I guess if you believe in supernatural stuff, it might be scarier for you. Not sure, but imo it feeds in to this occult type thinking.		Bad enough to be good? IDK. It's free.

Resolution, FPS, general lack of stuff destroying the video like a limited focus range or motion blur requires you to pay more attention to what you're filming and how, because it looks more like a window into reality but we pick up on little details a lot more when it's supposed to be real. Stuff like the uncanny valley effect exists - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley		Destroying the visual quality by messing up stuff with all of the above~ is something that you can do, but i don't think it's the way forward. In 10 years only the die hards will be viewing low resolution, low FPS content.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"-Aeryn-","name":"t1_cr7lvpx","parent_id":"t1_cr7f8yh","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1431516883,"created_utc":1431513283}
