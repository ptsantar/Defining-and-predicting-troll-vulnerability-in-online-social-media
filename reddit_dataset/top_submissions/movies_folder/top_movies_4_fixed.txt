{"body":"At the very first Academy awards there were two Best Picture categories designed to honor different but equally important aspect of filmmaking. Outstanding Picture which was won by massively budgeted war epic *Wings* and Unique and Artistic Production won by the art film *Sunrise: A Tale of Two Humans*. Sometime between then and the second ceremony the Academy decided that they didn't want the unique and artistic production award anymore and decided that Outstanding Picture was going to be the only award. But they also retroactively decided that Sunrise's win the previous year wasn't on the same level as Wings's so it got dropped from Academy history basically. Outstanding Production changed names a few times until it finally settled on Best Picture in 1962 so Wings is the only "Best Picture" winner from the first academy awards despite Sunrise winning an equal award at the time. It also leads us to today when the award is called "Best Picture" and not necessarily the "best" wins but that's because it's not really the intention of the award.			I just said Streep because she's famous and an Academy darling.

I guess the U.S. Army furnished pretty much all of the military hardware and soldiers (the extras). So, these tanks were likely the M1917 which was a licensed copy of the FT (with some improvements). Upon closer inspection, they have the polygonal turret of the M1917 and the mantlet (armored plate around the gun) with the rounded bottom, so I would say this is confirmed.

{"body":"> Not to mention how amazing early Technicolor films look.		The first feature-length Technicolor film was 1917's "[The Gulf Between](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulf_Between_(1917_film\))" which no longer survives except for a few clips. 1922's "[The Toll of the Sea](https://archive.org/details/TheTollOfTheSeanovember261922)" does survive, and uses the "two-strip" Technicolor process, which didn't have very good separation between the colors blue and green.		What you're probably referring to is Technicolor's "three-strip" process which premiered with Disney's "Silly SYmphonies" cartoon series in 1932. This process, or refinements of it, was the one used on 1930s films such as "The Wizard of Oz", "Gone With The Wind", "Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs", and earlier films such as "Becky Sharp". 			Incidentally, Disney had an exclusive contract with Technicolor until ~1937 to be the only cartoon studio to use the "three-strip" process. So, other cartoon studios had to resort to using the inferior "two-strip" process or else use a competitor like Cinecolor, which is why early color cartoons by [Warner Brothers](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x25i0mf_into-your-dance-1935_shortfilms) and the [Fleischer cartoon studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p17kBv8F5I), among others, don't look as good as the color [Disney cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kT2Kt8TVPU) from the same era.		**TL;DR:** Color and even Technicolor film had been around for more than a decade before the transition to sound, but it wasn't until the 1930s that more realistic color films began to be produced.","depth":2,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mayor_of_awesometown","name":"t1_ct24t1l","parent_id":"t1_ct1uizw","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1436824117,"created_utc":1436820517}

Even after Western culture and specifically Western film came to Japan, Japanese directors maintained many of their own techniques instead of adopting the Western way of making films.

{"body":"> speed standard		Complex question. Modern camera and projection speed is 24fps (with exceptions). Silent camera speed varied from about 15fps to 24fps. Early silents were often filmed at slower frame rates, tending to increase to 24fps by the end of the silent era. Within the same film, different scenes might be shot at different speeds (e.g., under-cranking chases to make the action look faster). Some silent cameras were hand-cranked, so camera speed might not be totally exact or completely constant within a shot.		Without synchronized sound, theater owners could project at different speeds, and sometimes projected a bit fast to shorten running time (more showings, more money). 		The "30% too fast" effect is the result of using modern projectors designed to run at 24fps. Something shot at (say) 18fps and projected at 18fps would look "normal" (if a bit flickery, that's why they called them "flicks"). Something shot at 18fps and projected at 24fps in a modern projector will look too fast. It gets tricky when you want to put silent material on DVD or Blu Ray, since most TVs (in the US) are 30fps. In the mastering process, you can "correct" non-standard film speeds using interlaced transfers at various pull-down ratios (a variation of the 3:2 pull-down used to put 24fps film on 30fps devices).

{"body":"When TV was developed in the US, they used 60 cycle line current as a clock. Analog TV was interlaced, i.e., it drew the even raster lines (one field) in 1/60 of a second, then drew the odd lines (one field) in 1/60 of a second, two fields per frame, for a 30 FPS frame rate. 		The traditional solution for showing 24fps film in 30fps video is [3:2 pull-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-two_pull_down). Basically you display one film frame in two TV fields (one TV frame), then you display the next film frame in three TV fields (one and a half TV frame), and so on. The 3:2 cadence places four 24 FPS film frames in ten TV fields, a/k/a five 30 FPS TV frames (hope I've counted the right number of fingers here). The 3:2 cadence therefore make film come out "evenly" in the TV system.		Note that the even film frames are on screen 50% longer than the odd film frames. The difference is sometimes visible. In a slow pan, for example, you often see jerkiness as a result of the unequal film frame times displayed on video. The artifact is called judder.		This system can work at any film frame rate, provided you select a suitable cadence (which was the point when discussing silent film speed).		All of the above applies to US video. In Europe, line current is 50 cycles, so European PAL TV had two interlaced fields at 1/25 second each. On DVD, it was pretty common for video transfers originating in PAL to be ported to US video without compensating for the difference in video frame rates. PAL-sourced material would play a bit fast on US systems, and presumably *vice versa* for US video crudely ported to PAL video.		Everything above applies to TVs, which tend to be built for the local TV frame rate (now often a multiple of it). Computer displays and the graphics chips/cards that drive them don't have to follow the TV standard. I'm out of my depth in video for computer games. I suspect the displays are running at a pretty fast frame rate (probably some multiple of 60). I suspect the graphics card is generating frames at a specified rate and then doing some kind of pull-down like mathematics to send the display something it can draw at its native rate [edit: or maybe they're "talking" through a buffer].

I think using different speeds was also more common, though, especially fast motion.  In the age of hand-cranked cameras, they would deliberately "undercrank" through action scenes so that they'd play back faster.

It also wouldn't be that good if it took itself seriously, but I think the director knew it was going to be bad otherwise, and made the film mostly a visual spectacle. But it works.		I'd probably rank it lower on a list of great 1927 films (I personally think Seventh Heaven should have won Best Picture over it, and The Racket was better too), but I do think it belongs on that list.

Another modern film to compare it to would be Avatar.  Both were insanely impressive production quality wise and just taking the visuals to places nobody had really gone before.

{"body":"Apocalypse Now and 2001: A Space Odyssey are slow films. Not in length of time it takes to watch them, but in pacing. From the same directors, The Godfather and The Shining both move a little more quickly (although The Godfather admittedly starts slowly). I've seen several hundred movies, new and old, and 2001 is one of the slowest I've ever seen. I am a millennial and my preference is for older films.		In all film eras you will find movies that seem to move quickly, and those that seem slow. *Seven Samurai* is about as long as *Lawrence of Arabia*. Both are regarded as classics, but I feel Seven Samurai moves at lightning speed by comparison. *Arabia* probably *wanted* to feel slow because it takes place over several years, and across great distances.		From [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018578/), Wings is 2 hours and 24 minutes long. But [Sunrise](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018455/) is 1h34m. You can go even shorter: the masterpiece [Man With a Movie Camera](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019760/), shockingly modern and innovative even today, is 64 minutes long. [Sherlock Jr.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/), a film of dazzling creativity and special effects achieved only with a camera and an imagination, is 44 minutes long. Last I checked, it was on Netflix too. If you're really pressed for time, skip the first 18 minutes and get to the part where the projectionist in the movie falls asleep.		My strategy for watching movies I wasn't sure about was to watch them 10-20 minutes at a time on Netflix. Then the pacing doesn't bother me as much. But something like Man with a Movie Camera or Sherlock Jr. moves so quickly that you don't even need such concessions.		I really like *Fast Five* (2011) and *Fast and Furious 6* (2013). There's something to be said about a fast-moving, stimulating modern film.		If you're just getting into old movies for the first time, I wouldn't start with a silent movie. My first silents were *Modern Times* and *City Lights*, and I thought they were good but not as interesting as talking movies. Now I have a few silents that I [enjoy](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls077107675/). There might very well be an acclimation period, where no matter what silent movie you pick first, you won't like it, but after a few movies you might start liking them more.		My history with movies is that I had barely seen any movies, so I sought out classics like *Citizen Kane*. It depends what you're looking for: for me *Kane* is an excellent mix of cinematography that I have not seen **before or since** as well as a well-written story with a funny script (although it is not a comedy, there are some jokes in it).		I made an IMDB account and started plugging away at the [top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top): not in order, but just looking at what other people like. Notice how highly an old movie like *Casablanca* (1942) is rated. One thing critical to understand is that black-and-white movies were sometimes shot in black-and-white for stylistic reasons, not because of lacking technology. As late as 1960, with *Psycho*, and 1962, with *The Trial*, movies were shot in black and white even though other movies of that era pulled off color just fine. [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/BLWhUUB.png) of Seven Samurai is my go-to example for something that would not look the same in color. I suspect *The Trial* was also black-and-white for budgetary reasons. Black-and-white filming has always been cheaper than color. *Clerks* (1994) was shot in black and white because such filmstock was cheaper.		*The Wages of Fear* (1953), the restored cut (it was originally shortened for American audiences), has a long, boring first hour that is almost worth skipping entirely. That's the setup for the story: some truckers have to deliver explosives on a dangerous cross-country route. But then they get on the road, and it's the most white-knuckle thriller you'll ever see. All my boredom went out the window as soon as the keys were in the ignition.		*Some Like It Hot* (1959) is a hilarious comedy. By virtue of it being a comedy, it moves more quickly than a typical old movie.		I'm kind of rambling, and I'm getting defensive by describing what old movies are not. But here's what they are: they're more real. There's little or no CGI. Modern movies cut back and forth between their characters over and over. You can't take in a scene because it's always changing. This is partially to save money and prop up bad actors who can't deliver a few paragraphs of well-acted lines (especially difficult for a comedy movie).","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Doomed","name":"t1_ct1y9n2","parent_id":"t1_ct1wlcb","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1436814568,"created_utc":1436810968}

{"body":"Try again when you are older. When you are 30 + you'll have seen some shit by then and perhaps you'll be able to deal with the pacing better. Arguably, those of us who are older grew up as the MTV generation (Gen X) but I absolutely love slow paced films. The reason why is because the slower buildup ultimately has a better payoff. To me, 2001 wouldn't have the same effect emotionally if it were cut down to say an hour. It gives your mind time to ponder, to wander, or to leave the introspection of your brain and just absorb the images.  One of my favorites is Once Upon a Time in the West. It's brutally slow paced but if you stick with it, by the time you get to the last 10 minutes...well the payoff is incredible. But you have to earn it. Watch the films you love now, with no regrets.

Just enjoy your films. Even as a film student, it's better you learn the business than spend your time jerking off to Eisenstein and Lang.		If you enjoy movies, enjoy them and STFU about the cinematography bullship. If you're a film major, remember my story: I was working for a company that edits film for major motion pictures. The owner has contributed to countless films you've probably seen and quote all them time. He once heard a coworker and I discuss film--this is what he said "I don't know half of what you two are talking about and I'm the one who's actually made movies. haha." This was 100% true. Same goes for several producers I've met. They're clueless about classic films, standards, and theory--they know what people enjoy and they understand the business. Everything else is who you know and how much money you have supporting you while you intern and pay your dues. This is the part they leave out in film school and this is the reason film school graduates end up bringing coffee for low-line producers for 5 years before they get their big break as supporting grip on a crappy direct-to-DVD movie. 		If you're not in film school, again, enjoy the spectacle and wonder that is film. Stop trying to analyze cinematography.","depth":0,"score":-10,"ups":-10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"the90stotallysucked","name":"t1_ct219az","parent_id":"t3_3d4fuw","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1436818961,"created_utc":1436815361}

{"body":"I believe what he is trying to say is that cinematography  traditionally refers to the use of a camera to record film and all the lighting that goes with it (i.e. the director comes up with a shot and its framing, while the cinematographer does his best to make it  happen, and make it look good.)
