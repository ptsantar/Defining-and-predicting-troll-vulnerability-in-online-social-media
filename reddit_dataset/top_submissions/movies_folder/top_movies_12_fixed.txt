Revan was originally apart of the Jedi Order, and was amazingly powerful in the force, then there were the Mandalorian wars in which Revan and his followers- including his apprentice Mallak- went to battle. The Mandalorians were devastated by the war and Revan and Mallak weren't the same, Revan had gained the hunger for power. So Revan and his apprentice Mallak turned away from Jedi order and declared a type of war on them and were close to destroying the order and instilling the power of the Sith in the Galaxy. Until Revan "died" after being betrayed by Mallak. Turns out that he wasn't, he beats Mallak gets married and kinda does whatever he wants for like a few years with his wife and son.		Thats pretty much the cut and dry of Revan without spoilers, mainly to Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars The Old Republic.

{"body":"A Force prodigy, best of the best, master strategist, master duelist, unparalleled leadership skills, force abilities, everything, he's effectively Force Jesus. 			Starter life as a Jedi, fought in the Mandalorian War, came back a changed man with a lust for power. Turned to the dark side, waged a war against the Jedi and was extremely close to wiping out the Jedi Order and establishing his own Galactic Empire, he's the very reason the Sith thrived and grew. Just as Revan was closing in on victory he was betrayed by his apprentice Malek, who also fought alongside Revan in the Mandalorian War.			The game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic takes place at this point, the second game not so much at all but the first game is Revan focused.			SPOILERS			Revan wasn't dead, as thought. He makes a comeback, becomes the saviour of the Jedi and takes Malek down, saving the galaxy from his own war machine.			He dies, comes back, disappears, dies, over and over for a while, gets involved in everything. Honestly, the character of Revan becomes victim to the every whim and fantasy of several different authors and writers. 			Long story short, a very long story short, Revan comes back from the dead, just like Jesus, takes control of a group of guys who during Revan's lifetime studied his teachings and ultimately worshiped him as a god, just like the Apostles, and takes over the group as his own and thats where his story ends.			Revan started as a Jedi, became a Sith, became a Jedi again, loitered towards the Dark Side again and ultimately transcended all sides of the Force and was neither Jedi nor Sith.			Its very unlikely the person we see in the trailer is Revan, despite the similarities in concept arts, which I suspect are due to Abrams being a SW fan and him using a mask to hide the features of this new mystery character knowing information would be leaked at some point.			If it was Revan, he would have a proper lightsaber. As of Episode VII Luke is the only person who knows how to build a lightsaber, the mystery character has a ghetto lightsaber due to attempts at creating a lightsaber via unconventional means. Its unstable, its a mess, it has vents on the side, its ugly, its big and misshapen, its not the typical lightsaber at all.		Revan knew how to build a lightsaber, he knew that shit.

Posing as mercenaries, the pair spent months learning everything they could about the Empire and its ruler, and they soon uncovered the Emperor's plans for an invasion of the Republic. But instead of warning the Republic, the two Jedi???proud and overconfident???believed that they could defeat the Emperor alone, and they looked for a way to infiltrate the Imperial Citadel in the Empire's capital city of Kaas City so that they could confront the Sith ruler. The pair received aid from Yarri, a member of the Imperial Guard who protected the Emperor, but the Jedi were unaware that all Guardsmen were bound to the Emperor's will and that she was leading them into a trap.**		**When Revan and Malak arrived at the Emperor's throne room, the Sith ruler was ready for them???instead of fighting them, the Emperor reached out and dominated their minds, twisting the pair into willing servants and completing their fall to the dark side before he scoured their minds for useful information. Anointing his new servants as Darth Revan and Darth Malak, the Dark Lords of the Sith, the Emperor sent them back to the Republic as a vanguard to his own invasion, ordering them to make use of the Rakatan Star Forge and to report back when they had crushed the Republic's resistance. Publicly, the Emperor announced that Revan and Malak had been Republic spies, showing images of the pair to his people and proclaiming that they had been executed in the depths of the Citadel.**		Furthermore: He fights the Emperor in combat later on and loses pretty badly, then gets shoved in stasis where the Emperor feeds off his power and knowledge for a long time. 		Also Nihilus has sucked the entire life force of a planet dry just with his own will. If he wanted to kill Revan it'd be nearly nothing to do so. Again Revan was a renowned military genius, he was not a god, and does not hold god level powers within the Star Wars universe. He was never an Emperor nor was he the head the Jedi.

I didn't say he was a God, I said he was a man who tried to grapple with Gods, and yeah, he cocked up on the Emperor, but he survived, and he has a plan. Kreia explains that Revan was far less corrupted than Malak, and that he only defeated planets, he never destroyed them like Malak. Darth Revan was systematically galvanising the Republic, so that he could take over it's infrastructure to fight the Emperor in a different way. He knew he couldn't fight him one on one, so he tried another tactic.		This isn't Dragon Ball Z, raw power level means little in the grand scheme of things. The death star was felled by a boy in an X-wing.		Revan is not a God, he is a man. A Nay-theist who does what he must, even if he's fighting an impossible battle.

Therefore for the most part the only experience anyone has on lightsaber dueling comes from sparring and theoretical approach.

However with a light sabre you can't move your grip. This is why no one has ever seriously deployed double ended swords as a weapon.		On the other hand the extra 'blade' for the light sabre offers far more utility, but does give the chance of potential injury to the user.

The fact that the term "movie Picard" exists (setting him apart from series Picard who would never attempt the crazy shit he pulled in First Contact, for example) exemplifies this. They were all about action too. And that's okay, you have to adapt it for a big screen audience. So knowing that Star Trek is naturally a small screen show, and that 2009 and Into Darkness were typical for Star Trek *movies*, I had no problem with the JJ movies.","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PorcaMiseria","name":"t1_cmffb9a","parent_id":"t1_cmfcrkx","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417198409,"created_utc":1417198409}

Ships from all Trek movies were from or reused in the series; the rules were consistent across the board (at least after TNG launched; TOS had issues). Then comes JJ And completely pisses all over he established lore, and to top it off screws up the prime continuity to "launch" this "alternate universe".		If it had been a straight reboot with no links to the original universe it would have been better, because there would be no expectation of consistency or continuity that way. But by refusing to truly let go and having the time travel element and Spock cameos, we keep being reminded that this is supposed to be be an alternate reality that branched off the Star Trek we know, and there's no way in hell anything will fit.		He doesn't even seem to know when his universe is supposed to have branched off. Star Trek 2009 seems to want to think it happened when Nero emerged in the past the day Kirk was born, but there's far too many changes and design inconsistencies that can't possibly have been altered by it.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yyv","name":"t1_cmfgh6o","parent_id":"t1_cmffb9a","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417200977,"created_utc":1417200977}

Maybe his childhood is talked about, or shown up in brief flashbacks but that's it. Episode One should have been a merging of The events of I and II. The rest of the films should have been closer to what the clone wars animated series is about. Anakin and Obi Wan as pals/rivals going on adventures through the galaxy and what not. Also, having everyone able to Force lightning like it's no big deal. That sucked.

I never said those words were big, but simply making a joke (one that flew over your big head) that those words aren't commonly used without the aid of a thesaurus. So what did we learn to day?

This is a reality where starfighters fly like atmospheric craft and we hear all sounds in the vacuum of space^1, anyway.

{"body":"I'm saying that even though that character is thinner than Mark Hamill, it could still be Luke Skywalker. The character is masked and Hamill could only be providing the voice. Or, the character could have Hamill's face digitally super-imposed on the body of another actor, like the weakling version of Captain America which still had Chris Evan's face on it. Maybe they could even do an all digital version of his face, like CLU in Tron Legacy was done from Jeff Bridges.		Hamill has extensive voice acting experience , doing it almost exclusively since 1992 when he started as The Joker in the Batman animated series. He knows what he is doing with voice acting. In the trailer, the voice that says "The dark side... and the light" actually sounds a lot like him. It is not unreasonable to think that he could be doing voice acting. 		Also, we have NO idea what the plot or timeline of this movie is. Disney essentially threw out all of the Expanded Universe so that they could have freedom to make a good movie still. It could take place only 10 years after Return of the Jedi and all the veteran actors are playing highly digitized versions of their characters.","depth":7,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Emperor_Neuro","name":"t1_cmfybrj","parent_id":"t1_cmfwfzb","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417243002,"created_utc":1417243002}

{"body":"Don't get me wrong I loved the staff saber and still do, and I love this new cross guarded saber, as long as it isn't just for showing off a new saber idea. The saber staff worked because it was fresh and Maul was vs 2 jedi which hadn't been seen in any SW movie yet. I did not like the 2 sabers or the 4 sabers regardless of who or what used them. Dookus hilt didn't bother me at all, it was just new at the time.

"The entire setting is *based* around water, that negative is stupid." "Sure! Knock it down to a 7.8 just because there's 'too many water.'" Etc, etc...		The complaints are especially irksome because, according to IGN's scale, 7.8 is considered a good game. Additionally, it's not like she rated it a 7.8 just because of the water issue. The godawful HM system, the atrocious frame rate, the lackluster 3D, etc.		I haven't played the remake, but I would definitely say there was too much water in the original Ruby/Sapphire. Too much surfing around, too much fighting the same random pokemon because there's only so many water pokemon that fit the level area of where you're surfing, too many water trainers, etc.","depth":2,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"puppymehard","name":"t1_cmfbvv3","parent_id":"t1_cmfbjhm","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417190290,"created_utc":1417190290}

{"body":"Well, if the lightsaber is meant to be at all functional like a real sword, it makes perfect sense. Swords have that to guard against another sword coming down and sliding right down past the blade and into your hand. It is called a crossguard. For the same reasons it would be implemented on a "real" sword, it makes sense it would be on a lightsaber. IMO this was where lightsabers fell short originally, because they had a lot of scenes where the two blades would hit each other or push hard against each other and yet, if a single slip happened, that's somebodies arm, leg, or whole body. 		This is in opposition to the "dual lightsaber" from Phantom Menace, which I don't think was functional at all. It's "actually useful" vs. "looking cool".		Inb4 someone explains dual lightsaber physics and how that is practical for a real battle.		Edit: To everyone saying it is based on a bow staff from martial arts - I studied Okinawa Shorin Ryu using a bow staff for years. Here is the thing: If you tap yourself with it, you don't cut a hole through yourself. If you touched yourself with it and it DID cut a hole in you, it would NOT be utilized in that way and probably wouldn't be utilized at all. And the way that you hold a bow staff is NOT directly from the center, where the hand grip on the dual blade is. You hold it from the center AND from another point, usually father back.		Not saying you guys are wrong, but I AM saying that, even if it's based on a bow staff, it is not practical for what it is. It makes no sense. A staff relies a lot on weight and leverage. Even a halberd or a long-bladed spear doesn't have a blade taking up 7/8ths of the length of the weapon. You would cut yourself to pieces trying to use that. In a risk-reward, it makes no sense.

Not to mention this means they're likely going to go with the ridiculous prequels style lightsaber fights instead of the reserved fencing matches that they had in the original trilogy. The lightsaber fights in the original trilogy were great because every hit was important. A single blow could kill someone, and did (maybe) in the case of Obi wan. So the fights were choreographed like a fencing bout, with a lot of subtle maneuvering and quick, unimpressive strikes. 		The original Star Wars relied on its setting and sense of scale for its cool factor, instead of leaning on over the top, unrealistic action, and even if J.J. nails the visual style, he still won't capture the spirit of the prequels if he doesn't understand how the action in them was choreographed.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HerbaciousTea","name":"t1_cmffh9o","parent_id":"t1_cmfbfvd","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417198781,"created_utc":1417198781}

{"body":"The lightsaber effect is interesting. I wonder if it's just an overpowered lightsaber or if it's a new take on the lightsaber effect by making it more unstable looking than the normally pristine clean blades from the previous trilogies. My guess is the antagonist has an amped up saber that can do more crazy stuff and has a unique look to go with it rather than just being another "evil red bad guy saber!"		I thought the inclusion of the short side blades was weird at first, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that their inclusion makes the lightsaber both significantly more dangerous offensively and defensively. With the original styling you had a case where one of three things could hypothetically happen if two lightsabers clashed in line with each other: 1. the defending person would have to pivot at angle to completely block the attack, 2. the attacking blade would glance the side of the defense blade and still continue downward toward the target, or 3. the blades would stick and the opponents would be saber locked. With the guards on the sides the defensive window of the lightsaber is dramatically increased and can serve to better block an inline attack, and the guard itself is also dangerous as they are presumably just as effective offensively as the main blade itself, allowing for more diverse methods of attack.

Looking at the thing practically the extensions of the emitter past the profile of the main saber makes them vulnerable, but I think the same practicality checks made on the unknown movie saber applies to the known saber types in the previous trilogies. The very tops of the emitters of conventional sabers are as vulnerable to precision attacks just as these side guard emitters are. The double bladed saber was vulnerable and exploited when Obi Wan cut it in half versus Maul. Leaving aside the standard amount of leeway fictional weapons such as the lightsaber are inherently granted the only counter point I can offer is that the antagonist who seeks to benefit from the potential advantages of this kind of version of the lightsaber must also deal with the draw backs in exchange.		Ultimately we won't really know if this design offers any tangible advantages until we see the antagonist use it in a fight.

{"body":"The X-Wings are definitely a new, post-Battle of Endor design, but you can still see that they have been used in multiple engagements before. They almost act as our measure of how much progress and restoration in the armed forces of the nascent New Republic and it appears that the post-Galactic-Empire renaissance has not yet brought shared culture back to the sophistication the old Republic had during the prequels.		Overall, this teaser hit me with awesome three times: The X-Wings flying in formation over the water at high speed, the Sith Lord with the crude, cruciform lightsaber with a haunting gait, and finally, the camera very instensively following the Millenium Falcon as it performs acrobatics to out-maneuver TIE fighters which gives me chills everytime I watch the trailer. What I love about those things are that they feel so Star Wars, but never something Lucas would do, thus leaving me with the feeling Abrams has bring his A-game and he is asking himself "What do fans want which they don't know they want?"		This what I've been looking for: an equilibrium between the classic trilogy's practical effects and the prequel trilogy's aptitude for lightsaber duels and star-fighters. It feels like J.J. Abrams personally believes Han shot first but but likes to responsibly use CG. This trailer would be a lot more interestingto analyze if Abrams was interviewed in *The People v. George Lucas*.		I hope to see a meatier trailer with one of the original three cast members showing us what they're up to now (Luke as the Master of the Jedi Order, Leia is at least a senator if not the supreme chancellor, making Han more or less the First Dude as he now likely married to one of the most significant figures of the New Republic and no longer does smuggling runs for Jabba).","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Xskills","name":"t1_cmfzbuu","parent_id":"t3_2no7ht","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417246672,"created_utc":1417246672}

A four legged walking tank gives a height advantage, giving you a better viewpoint over your target while still being able to carry smaller craft and soldiers to a target to take out the inside once your main guns have incapacitated the outer defenses.		The Death Stars proved worthy in practice twice: once as a demonstration where it displayed its full power (Alderaan), and in the battle of Endor where it efficiently took out individual ships despite incomplete construction.		When you are down and out, you really look deeply and/or creatively to solve a problem. Who knew that the rebels would find out about that exhaust port? And they *only* knew because they had the plans. Without those plans the Empire would have destroyed most of the rebellion at Yavin.

Luke/Vader in ESB was like a combination of a chess game and a cat playing with a mouse: every move Vader made was to toy with Luke, to test his abilities and potential, and to defeat him without killing him. Luke/Vader in ROTJ was used as a force to attempt to get him to cross over to the dark side. 		Where are the same things in the prequel trilogy? Nowhere. The closest is the Anakin/Kenobi duel in ROTS, but the execution turns what should have been amazing into something boring.

Things I noticed:		1) Probe noises when the black guy wearing a stormtrooper uniform appears, indicating he is being chased by the empire. Maybe he is disguised or maybe he is a traitor who witnessed some crazy Empire shenanigans and is on the run from them.		2) Definitely updated stormtrooper gear, looks good. Hope they aren't as useless as in the original 3 movies and become more of a threatening presence overall.		3) The Xwings look almost refurbished, it has been 30 or so years. But I am imagining this in a similar scenario to the F15/F18s of our day, where they just keep adding better systems into it, rather than making a new plane all together. Hoping to see the Y/A/B wings kicking around too.		4) The Millenium Falcon is definitely changed, but that was the highlight of the video for me, just seeing the Tie Fighters fly past firing at the MF.		5) Yes the Jedi sword, I think it is a cool idea, definitely has a good on screen presence, similar to how I felt when I first saw the Phantom Menace trailer and saw Darth Maul with the double edged light saber.		All in all, pretty stoked for this, as I'd imagine 95% of people are. I think that the story overall will probably be some evil awful Jedi coming back, Luke probably gets his ass kicked by the Jedi and then tries to find other Jedis to train.		Not sure how Leia will play into this, but she has the abilities that Luke has more or less, so maybe she will be a badass now.		Not sure if they are going to have Leia and Hans kids from the novels involved in the storyline, or maybe just different kids from those novels. I know the novels aren't canon but I always enjoyed them, especially the Timothy Zahn series. Which I had hoped they would just adapt into a film series itself, but I guess new ideas work too.

{"body":"This is a very big debate among fans of the series. If you want to stick true to the order it was released, you would start with Episode IV ("A New Hope"), and just follow it up with the sequels (Episode V: "The Empire Strikes Back," and Episode VI: "Return of the Jedi").		That said, this original trilogy came out quite a long time ago (Ep. IV was released in '77). So if you're a little younger, and if you're used to the "special effects" in today's movies), you might find the original films to start off kind of "slow." (It takes a good 30-45 minutes to really get into the action, but if you stick with it, it's great.)		On the note of the prequels (Episodes I, II, and III), they are newer films, so they are a little more fast-paced, and the special effects are brilliant. However, they are often criticized for their, at times, cheesy dialogue. Additionally, some fans find that they lack the "gritty" realism of the original trilogy from the 70s-80s. But if you're more accustomed to the constant action, blow-up-in-your-face excitement of today's action movies, the prequels will definitely have you covered there. *Note: some people hate, hate, hate Episode I (mainly because of a certain character who was added as comic relief, but just came across as annoying). You could honestly get away with skipping Episode I and just watch II and III instead, but it totally comes down to personal preference.*		Personally, I'm a fan of watching them in a very particular order: 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6. This means that you start with the originals, the classic films that draw you in and introduce you to the main characters. Then, after Episode V, you go back to watching Episode I as a sort of "flashback" (it works really well, actually). You watch the prequels through Episode III, and then finally, top it all off with the grand finale of Episode VI.		This new movie is Episode VII, so it picks up after the events of the original trilogy. So if nothing else, watching Ep. IV, V, and VI should get you prepared for what's to come.

I suggest you add a spoiler tag to your post above.*		Thinking about it now, I can't remember a time before I had seen Star Wars. I know I had watched the OT first, but I don't actually remember my first time funnily enough.		*Spoilers for the person I originally responded to:*		In my opinion, an R-rated Star Wars would just too great a shift in tone. Partly inspired by serials, the first three were meant for all ages, and I'd like to see it remain that way. Though many people do die in all the films, suffering is never really shown save briefly Luke in ROTJ and Anakin (or Darth Vader, by that point) in ROTS. I had no desire to watch Anakin slaughter children, the implication of Ewan McGregor's face was powerful enough for me.		*Spoilers over.*		Many things went wrong in the prequels, and I think Christenson's acting is one of them. He didn't have much of a script to work with, but I do think McGregor did a great job as Obi-Wan, and Ian McDiarmid was good as Palpatine.		Back to the trailer, though. One thing I thought interesting was that shot of Stormtroopers inside of that drop ship. It doesn't look like anything else from the previous films, which I find encouraging. The rest of it was classic Star Wars, but I'm glad that it looks like from this limited information that JJ is not only trying to emulate what came before. If anything, it looks most closely related to the Clone Wars TV series. It's a fine balancing act, I recognize, reconciling the tone and feel of the film with what came before while trying to not stay stuck in the past.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cmfytb8","parent_id":"t1_cmfybkg","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1417244710,"created_utc":1417244710}

For me Star Wars has a very well established visual style, and IMO, a continuation of that main story should be told with those tropes.

{"body":"Honestly I'm amazed that adrift in a sea of over 10000 comments full of girlish squealing upvoted into the stratosphere, that anyone found my surly ass to agree with. So thank you for letting me know I'm not alone in my skepticism. It's appreciated.		For better or worse, the trailer has had me talking and thinking about Star Wars all day. So, in that sense, I suppose it was successful. I can't watch just any ol thing and get excited about it. I will admit that there are some things in this teaser that are cool, or badass, even, but I feel that they're out of place in this setting. So many people are so willing to burn any memory of the prequels to the ground, they've lost sight of	maybe the only thing he did well in them, which is the cinematography of Star Wars. 		Lucas draws so heavily from John Ford, Kubrick, Kurosawa, William Wyler, David Lean, and a bunch of people I've probably never heard of ... they're all apart of why Star Wars is so iconic. Losing that aspect of the story is/will be noticeable for me, and it will be for a lot of other people though they may not realize it as quickly. If it ends up being JJ's usual style, I suspect it will haunt the film in the decades ahead; especially when they're seen in a series.		The good news is Larry Kasdan is helping with the script, and I think his input was sorely missing from Star Wars and Indy in the new millennium. I'd have been super happy if they'd tap him to direct, as well. I'm hoping he might be able to keep the ship moving in the right direction.

I may be reading too much into this but one of the many big problems with the prequels were the lightsaber fights; they felt too over-choreographed and more like dance numbers with sticks than actual fights.		The thing that made them so good in the original was that they weren't pompous, they felt tense and more like actual sword fights with emotion in them.

{"body":"At first I didn't like the new light-saber. I thought it was more of a shoehorned design, but then I thought deeper about the storytelling of it. Traditional light-sabers are usually interpreted to represent the Katana, (Japanese samurai sword) and Jedi are the samurai. This makes sense because of their elegance in battle and how they conduct themselves, which is very reminiscent of Bushido (the samurai code of honor.) This new light-saber, however takes out the Katana aspect of the light-saber and replaces it with a more European type of sword, namely a Claymore, which is a heavy, brutish weapon. I feel that this design was likely intentional and this character is going to be more cold blooded than Darth Vader, the emperor, count Dooku, or Darth Maul. He will have an air about him somewhat similar to Grievous, but amplified a thousand times. This vilan cares not for grace. He will be a "Get the job done" type of enemy, but could relish his glory. Despite his blunt style, he will be an incredibly tough foe, hand to hand, but I don't see him whipping around deflecting blaster shots at lighning speeds. He will be powerful, and make sure everyone knows his power. I doubt he'll be the politician type that so many before him has been. (When you think about it, none of the Jedi or Sith in the movies so far haven't been politicians.) He is in it for power. He will be cold blooded, brutish, and blunt.

It's like *Into Darkness* when all the bits people liked from *Wrath of Kahn* where stitched together, the reactor core scene being the biggest sinner. 		It has been the biggest flaw in the Expanded universe that people keep trying to re-create the original trilogy and it ends up feeling like self - insert fanfic on the part of the writers, the latest MMO, had a Wookiee and smuggler duo for heaven's sake!

{"body":"> My assertion is an objective statement of fact independent of your specific tastes.		It isn't an objective statement because you have pre-defined your understanding of my "paradigm" as personally and emotionally biased (comfort is a feeling). Therefore, you are developing your argument based on your understanding of my sentimental basis (which you have virtually no understanding of). That makes your argument not only subjective, but also entirely speculative as well.		And furthermore, this is not about me being closed minded. This is about Star Wars weaponry making some semblence of sense within the confines of its own universe. First, a crossguard consisting of lightsaber blades reduces the range of movement of the user's wrist, preventing the wielder from executing the fancy flourishes that both Jedi and Sith make use of countless times in the movies and in the EU. Second, the emitters are placed such that two of the primary functions of the crossguard (protecting the hand and catching incoming blades for the purpose of disarming) cannot be reliably fulfilled, since these emitters can be cut off easily by another saber.		On the other hand, if it were simply a Cortosis Weave crossguard it would have none of these problems, and would even bestow an additional tactical advantage in that it would disable an enemy's blade, making disarming even easier. If one MUST put a beam crossguard, one would be smart enough to encase the bottom half of the blade beam with some kind of enclosure of saber-resistent material to prevent the user from slicing himself, or upturn the beams (a la *cinquedea*) so that they don't get in the way. 		> Tell me, does a Tie fighter 'make sense' to you?		The TIE Fighter is one of the iconic vehicles of the Star Wars universe. It was featured over and over again in the original trilogy. There is very little about it that one can complain about since it's been there since the beginning. This "new" saber on the other hand, has no precedents in the movies and has only minor precedence in the EU. Therefore, yes, I am going to complain about it if it doesn't make sense. 		This saber seems to exist because someone wanted to make the weapon look impressive without knowing anything about sword/saber combat. If it made tactical sense to add the bladed crossguard, then I would certainly accept it as a new addition to the Star Wars universe. But, unfortunately, it adds nothing to the tactical value of the weapon, while at the same time taking away a great deal of its functionality. There is a point where one has to draw the line at what is "too ridiculous" for even the fantasy genre. When you throw all sense of reality out the window, then the story ceases to be relatable to the audience.
