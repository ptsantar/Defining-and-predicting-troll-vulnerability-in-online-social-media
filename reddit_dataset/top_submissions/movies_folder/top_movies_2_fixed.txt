There was some wide horizontal artifact at the bottom of the frame that constantly appeared after each camera cut in a scene that was swapping back and forth between two characters in a conversation, and it was kind of distracting. I was hoping for higher contrast ratio too, this movie obviously has a ton of inky blackness of space, but it just kind of appeared grayish. The image was also heavily vignetted at my theater. I'm sure the flickering/vignetting is from my theater's projector rather than the film stock, but it still just degraded the experience.		I'd probably see it again in IMAX.

We had dark shadows when I first started and it was blah(not to mention a crappy movie). Same with the hobbit. It was nice, but not much was added by seeing it there as opposed to a regular theater.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"woolooloolooloo","name":"t1_clucxrc","parent_id":"t1_club3ql","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415244005,"created_utc":1415244005}

{"body":"That's what they're doing at the local IMAX. They moved to digital a year or two ago. It was the strangest thing, too... I was walking down the street in downtown Montreal, and I saw a bunch of guys wearing IMAX t-shirts. It was strange, I'd never seen anybody in an IMAX t-shirt before, it's not like they have gift shops. But there were a bunch of them in a group, all wearing the same shirts. The thought process went something like "Huh, they must work for IMAX. I wonder what they're doing in town? Wait a minute... No... Please no.... Don't take away the film projector!"		The next time I saw a film in IMAX (probably a few weeks later), I remember thinking that the image during the intro video (the one where they have the big numbers and the camera flies through them in 3D) was out of focus, because I'd seen a lot of films in that IMAX theatre, and while it was a rare treat to see anything *actually* shot in IMAX, I was pretty darned familiar with the opening video and the level of sharpness.		Sure enough, at the end of the video, up comes a title card that says something like "Powered by Texas Instruments DLP Technology". Yup. It finally happened. They replaced the amazingly high resolution IMAX film with the crappy 2K projectors that are lower resolution than what they use in the normal "UltraAVX" movie hall...		Anyhow, fast forward to today, and IMAX's website says that Montreal's IMAX is showing Interstellar in 70mm... Clearly the old projector is still there, and it's going to be QUITE a treat to see the old girl in action one last time, and on a film with a whole hour of footage shot on real IMAX!		Seriously, though, I have no idea how IMAX thought that they could take projectors that pump out something with 16K equivalent resolution, and replace it with 2K projectors... That's not even remotely state of the art, by the time they put those PoS in there, the cinema already had 4K projectors in other halls! And this was a real purpose-built IMAX hall, too. Even though it was in a multiplex, the screen is huge compared to the regular ones. They also used to do a laser lightshow before each show, although they haven't done that in years.		Anyhow, the big advantage of IMAX was always that the quality of the presentation was (at least on purpose-shot content) dramatically better than a regular 35mm or digital projector. They could at least have tried to do better than the typical digital projector when they went digital... Either develop an actual 8K digital projector, or go for a solution that integrates multiple 4K projectors into a single unit (to reduce calibration difficulties). The technical capability to do that has been around as long as 4K projectors have been.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"guspaz","name":"t1_clug89b","parent_id":"t1_clu7l5n","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415251089,"created_utc":1415251089}

You gotta remember movie theater concession prices don't match inflation or reality at all.  Whats a large tub of popcorn cost now at the movies 8 maybe 10 bucks.  The cost of making a large tub of popcorn isn't just the kernel.  There's oil, butter, seasoning, packaging, employee, power, and then waste.  With 4 and 5 dollar an hour employees, we'd burn a batch probably 2 to 3 times a night.  We'd have so much extra.  In a 10 to 15 member crew, we'd all walk out of there each night with a garbage bag full of popped popcorn that would just normally be thrown out.  It was a huge was.  We'd go through about four to six 5 gallon drums of oil a night.  That was with just two poppers too.  It was literally pumped up into the pan and just continuously popping.  The biggest difference I feel between 20 years ago and now is there was no netflix, torrent sites, and piracy like there is now and movie theaters were way more profitable.  Not anymore.  So I think if they were as popular now as they were then, we'd probably be looking at higher costs for concessions or tickets.

{"body":"OK, I feel like playing the Monty Python "You were lucky" game....		First real job was at an 8 plex in Atlanta. On slow days we would run the building on 2 people. I would handle projection and sell tickets and a concessionist would handle the rest. That would be for the first 2 shows, and then the projectionist would come in for the evening, and leave everything threaded for the next day.		Later, went to work for a smaller theater. Ran the place solo (tickets, projection and concession) for the first shows on slow days. Did all the breakdowns as well. Occasionally had to go downtown to pick up films from the depot on Friday afternoon and put them together because the film had just been returned from the previous theater.... or worse, driving to the other theater to pick up the print just so we could have it Thursday night to avoid a rush to put them together. Bro-in-law would drive, then we'd go back and put the film together and then off to Waffle House.		Some fun moments:		Getting to the theater with the print only minutes before showtime, praying the whole time that the reels were heads-up, and some jerk didn't put them in the can tails-up. Loading the first reel on the projector and starting it to give me time to assemble the rest of the reels as fast as possible on the platter. Then, as the projector was just about to finish the first reel, yank off maybe 20 feet of film, splice it onto the rest of the movie that is sitting on the platter, and keep going without stopping the projector. If you haven't done a splice on a running movie, you haven't lived! Probably only had to do that twice, but I still feel like a Ninja.		More Fun: Sometimes the takeup platter might get stuck, and you had the projector on unattended start. You come back into the booth at the end of the movie, and the whole film is sitting on the floor below the projector. Pull the whole movie off the floor in 20 minutes without tangling... rethread and start the movie without being late.		Yet more fun: Thread the same film through THREE projectors for the Tuesday kiddy show. We would sell out 3 auditoriums with kids, and only had one print, so the booth was set up to run one print through all three. Had to balance a roller on the film here and there to take up the slack that would build up over 90 minutes. When everything was ready, do a sync-start on all three and pray that everything was set up right. Still amazed that my bro-in-law figured out how to do that.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JaunLobo","name":"t1_clu9t99","parent_id":"t1_clu28i8","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415237714,"created_utc":1415237714}

{"body":"You don't see them much anymore, even in theaters showing film. Older theaters had 2 projectors for each screen, and each reel had to be loaded every change, every 22 minutes. Most films were about 5-7 reels. Another interesting thing in that clip is the bell. As the reel empties, it spins faster, and a little bell attached to the machine starts to ring. If you've worked as an old school projectionist, anytime you hear a distant bell or anything close to that sound, especially when falling asleep, you kindof have a mini heart attack. 		Many switched over to platter systems in the 60's and 70's, like the one in OP's picture, [but not quite that big](http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/movie-projector-platterfull.jpg). It allowed the entire movie to be spliced together in one big reel and run continuously, so only 1 projector needed, and much less manpower in the booth. It allowed a single operator to run many screens at once, and it helped start the multiplex.

A 35 mm original master can push up to around 4k equivalent, but what you see in theatres is [closer to 1267x685](https://web.archive.org/web/20051014193744/http://www.cst.fr/IMG/pdf/35mm_resolution_english.pdf).		.		[Here is an old post of mine on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14swqj/the_hobbit_imax_dmr_print_6ft_wide_over_1000/c7gchmw?context=3):		This is actually a much more complicated question that it would appear to be.		First things first, the question isn't [H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC) versus [35 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film). H.264 is a compression format, [4k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) is a resolution. Resolution is the closest equivalent to film size that we're going to get.		One of the main problems with traditional film is that it suffers wear and tear. A film one week into its run won't look the same as it did on its first day. You also have to be careful with how you handle it. I once saw a Twilight film **catch on fire** while playing because it got caught on the tray and the projector burned right through it (that was a fun night). For the purpose of this comment however, I'm going to assume that the film is in perfect condition.		Right off the bat, we've got the problem that there is more than one type of film. The two main types are [35 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film) (normal cinemas) and [15/70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film#IMAX_.2815.2F70.29) ([IMAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX)).		IMAX film is simply amazing. If you've seen the home media release of [TDKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises) and compare it to any movie filmed on 35 mm, the difference is **VERY** visible, and that's not even the full IMAX resolution. The cameras are better than 35 mm cameras, and more care is taken all the way through the production line. The problems with IMAX are that the cameras are loud (which is why the dialogue scenes in TDKR aren't filmed in IMAX), the cameras are [gigantic](http://i.imgur.com/ftCGB.jpg), the film is unwieldy for projectionists to handle (as seen above), and it is a lot more expensive to produce all the way through the distribution chain. It is considered to be about equivalent with anywhere from 16k (15360x8640) digital cinema on the high side to [4k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution)-6k on the low side.		Then we have 35 mm. This is **REALLY** old. It's been around since the 1800s, although what you see now isn't the same thing as what was around then. Most noticeably, the cameras have gotten **MUCH** better. The lenses are larger, the glass used in the lenses are better, etc. It results in more light going through, but those techniques can also be applied to digital cameras. People claim that 35 mm is the equivalent of anywhere from 4k (original master vs. digital) on the high end to about [1267x685](http://www.cst.fr/IMG/pdf/35mm_resolution_english.pdf) on the low end.		When it comes to digital, you know what you're getting every time. There's no degradation over time (unless [the HDD fails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure), which usually means that it goes directly from "full quality" to ["doesn't play what was on the failed sector"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption), or the bulb is burnt/burning out), and there's no degradation from the master to what you're watching. On top of that, [the cameras are tiny](http://i.imgur.com/Fa2Gn.jpg), which opens up new avenues for how things can be filmed. There are two types of digital cinema projectors in use right now (2k and 4k), and two more around the corner (8k and 16k). The biggest problem with digital, is that it improves too quickly. Movie theatres don't want to replace their projectors every 5 years, they want to replace them every 50. And that is why there are [phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_J_Butterfly) coming out that are almost the same resolution [as some cinema projectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema) (1920x1080 vs. 2048x1080 AKA 2K digital cinema). Not to worry though, [8K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_UHDTV) is expected to be in North American homes by 2015-2020, events are already being filmed in UHDTV, we've already got [2560x1600 tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_10) available for $400, and some 2560x1440 monitors are below $300. If movie theatres want to remain relevant, they'll come around, upgrade to 8k and 16k, and upgrade their sound systems as well.		* **Now, onto frame rate.**		I know you didn't ask this, but it's one of the big differences between traditional film and digital cinema. With traditional film, doubling the frame rate physically doubles the size. With digital cinema, doubling the frame rate doubles the storage media needed (if no compression is used), however the physical size of the storage media will stay the same (they might have to grab a more expensive storage device though).		Most movies are filmed at 24 Hz (23.976 to be precise). That means that each eye sees 24 different frames per second (which in the case of a 2D movie means 24 frames per second). In order to increase the number of frames shown, the reel has to move at a faster speed, and there has to be more film available per second. In order to show a film at 48 Hz, 48 frames per second need to be displayed, resulting in a doubling in costs and print size. In order to show a 3D film at 48 Hz like the Hobbit, the film would have to show **96 FRAMES PER SECOND** (48 per eye per second), resulting in a quadrupling in costs and print size. That's just not reasonable for film. You'd be looking at prints even larger than above, especially if things move up to 120 Hz like they are with gaming and [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television).		Unfortunately, 24 Hz, while enough for the image to seem continuous, is not enough for a perfectly fluid image. That's why everything seems to jerky any time the camera moves. It is commonly accepted that [at least 75 Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold#Display_refresh_rate) would be needed for a perfectly fluid image, although there is evidence that it would need to be even higher than that. Thankfully, digital projection can handle this (and more) without too many changes to the existing technology. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a 120 Hz 3D movie (240 frames per second) in theatres some time in the next decade.","depth":3,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Charwinger21","name":"t1_clu9mf8","parent_id":"t1_clu4rif","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415237339,"created_utc":1415237339}
{"body":"About the issue of replacing projectors every few years: There's a practical limit. You only need enough resolution so that the eye can no longer distinguish individual pixels.

This is what Apple calls a Retina Display. You basically need around 60-80 pixels per degree, which depends on not just resolution but how far the viewer is from the screen.		Unfortunately, that is misleading.		60 PPD is the point where someone with 20/20 vision (which is not actually perfect) would stop being able to differentiate individual pixels. It is not the point where you stop gaining benefits from resolution increases.		If 60 PPD was the maximum resolution that you could benefit from, then Apple would have stopped there. Instead they currently have a phone with an 85 PPD screen, and a desktop with an 88 PPD display, and [all indicators point towards the fact that they intend to go even further](http://www.cultofmac.com/173702/why-retina-isnt-enough-feature/).		.		[Anandtech has a great article on the topic](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7743/the-pixel-density-race-and-its-technical-merits).		"For example, human vision systems are able to determine whether two lines are aligned extremely well, with a resolution around two arcseconds. This translates into an effective 1800 PPD. For reference, a 5??? display with a 2560x1440 resolution [at 30 cm] would only have 123 PPD."		There are diminishing returns, but there definitely is a benefit.		That article was mostly about phones, however it can be extrapolated to larger TVs and movie theatres that are further away (as it is the angular resolution that matters for this, not the actual size or distance).		.		>A typical 52x22 ft theater screen is fine with 4k as you'd see 77 pixels per degree at 52 feet away, the screen width.

[And in order to hit 1800 PPD](https://web.archive.org/web/20130514134707/http://home.roadrunner.com/~res18h39/calculator.htm) (as per anandtech, the U.S. Air Force, NHK, and others) on that 35.7 m screen in the first row (~4.5 m), you're going to need a ~300k 1.43:1 projector (429,000 x 300,000 pixels).		That is a 128,700 MegaPixel image, of which a single frame would be 193.1 GB in RAW12 (you would likely be working with an even more expanded colour space by that point though), 772.2 GB in TIFF, or 1 TB in OPENEXR. RGB24 video at 120 Hz would be 46.4 TB/s, or 334,080 TB for a 2 hour film (uncompressed). It is hard to comprehend the sheer size of that data currently.		.		Now, that isn't realistic any time soon, and probably isn't worth the extra costs, but **that** is the upper limits of human vision.","depth":5,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Charwinger21","name":"t1_cluhkxk","parent_id":"t1_cludjog","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415254734,"created_utc":1415254734}

{"body":"A few of your questions are a little beyond my ken, since I've mainly been just a projector technician, without the full knowledge behind how *everything* works, but I'll try to the best of my abilities.		Digital projectors can't do 70mm, just in technical terms, because 70mm (or 8mm or 35mm, etc.) is strictly a film designation. It just doesn't apply to the digital image, it's strictly a measurement of physical film size. Sort of the same way you would use, say, "45 rpm" when talking about a vinyl record, but never for a CD.		The aspect ratio of our new projector is not quite the same as the old one, but I think that has more to do with our particular system, and not, say, the complete inability of a digital projector in general to project across the same screen-space. 		In the future, it's possible that digital might get to the same resolution as film, but for right now, even for being such a rudimentary technology, film image is just hard to top. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it seems to hold true, especially when you see it up close on a giant screen, the sort of clarity that film has that digital doesn't, or at least, doesn't *yet*. I'm sure it's possible for it to catch up, in fact, I'd say it's probable.

{"body":"Certainly the problem is not in the optics of the digital projector. The problem is rather in the electronics. If you wanted to display this movie on a digital projector with a picture quality true to the analog 70mm projection, you'd need a digitized version of the movie. And you'd need some kind of hardware to play back that digitized version of the movie. The bandwidth requirements of displaying that digital movie would be higher than what current technology can allow. And you'd need signal processing chips able to handle all that data, and again it would be too high for current technology. There are many "tricks" that could be utilized to reduce the footprint of the digital file and make it manageable for current tech, but there is also a cost issue. It's simply put much cheaper to to just use analog projectors and 70mm film, and there is no economic benefit or advantage in terms of image quality in displaying it with a digital projector.

Most film archival experts advocate scanning at higher resolution than the information content in the film and scale down the scan later in the workflow, but let's just say we decide to scan it in 18K. We choose to digitize it with a 48-bit color depth to allow for more legroom should we want to ajust the colors later on. So there is 16-bits of data for each R, G, and B channel, 48-bits of data per pixel. Without compression, that results in 10800000000 bits per frame, which equals 1.35 gigabytes per frame. This movie being a 70mm IMAX film, it has 24 frames per second. So one second = 1.35 gigabytesx24 = 32,4 GB/second.

Yes you can.

{"body":"Just a little nitpicking:		Downloading usually require very little compute power. Your computer would most likely idle during the entire download process. Modern desktop computers idle at less than 100W, usually somewhere around 50W. No PSU is 100% efficient, so the draw from the wall is roughly 10% more than the internal draw. So if you're using around 50W, the draw from the wall will be slightly more. So then you can divide your cost by at least 10 to get the real figure.		We must also assume that the average internet speed will increase in the following years. It's likely a very long time until 18K movies are available for download. Let's assume it's 20 years or so until this becomes a reality. I couldn't find any good data on average US connection speed over a long time interval, but let's be optimistic and assume it doubles every 5 years. Then we will all be sitting with 502,4 Mb/s (down speed) internet connections in the year 2034. With this speed, the download time is only **59 days**. Now obviously we wouldn't download this movie in a raw format, right? We'd be downloading it in a compressed format like the movies found on TPB or similar.		According to the [H.264 Primer](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/video/articles/h264_primer/h264_primer.pdf), there is a formula to compute the "ideal" output file bitrate based on the video's characteristics. The formula is as follows:		[image width] x [image height] x [framerate] x [motion rank] x 0.07 = [desired bitrate]		Where		*The image width and height is expressed in pixels.	The motion rank is an integer between 1-4, 1 indicating low motion, 2 indicating medium motion, and 4 indicating high motion, where motion is the amount of image data that is changing between frames		We'll assume a motion rank of 3 for this movie.		18000x12500 pixels x 24 x 3 x 0.07 = 1134000000 bps =  1134 Mbps = 141.75 MBps = 0.14175 gBps.		Compared to 32,4 gBps of the uncompressed movie, x264 reduce the size of the raw data **228 times**. That means the x264 compressed movie will "only" be 1403,325 GB, or 1.4TB. With our 2034 502,4 Mb/s internet speeds, we will download files at a rate of 62.8125 MBps. That means:		1mB=0,0159203980099502s	1400000mB = 0,0159203980099502s*1400000mB = 22288,55721393028s = 371,5 minutes = 6,19 Hours.		-But wait! There is more. 		x264 is roughly 10 years old. x265 is on the horizon, and will in the coming years replace x264 on both 4K blu-rays, internet movie streaming, and movie rips like those we find on torrent sites today. x265 roughly doubles the encoding efficiency over x264. If we assume that this trend continue, that there will be a similar replacement of x265 in ten years time with 2x the performance, then we can expect the 2034 rip encoded in "x266" to be 1/4 the size of a similar x264 rip. So then, **in 2034 we will be downloading a 350 GB file on a 62.8125 MBps internet connection, in 1,5 hours.**		Assuming you pay 37.34 cents per kwh in the future, you're not gonna spend a lot downloading this file.	I cba to do more silly math now, but consider that your futuristic machine is probably much more miniaturized than computers today, and therefore draw a lot less power.

{"body":"Well DNA storage doesn't solve the problem, it just basically take advantage of the z direction and store data in three dimensions. Once the manufacturing process approach the atom size of the substrate, you hit the limit of the particular design, at least within the current understanding of applied physics. HDDs store data on magnetic platters, and the surface area of the platters and the density dictate the storage capacity. Now if you could store data in many layers in the z-plane you could increase the capacity many orders of magnitude. DNA storage kind-of does that, in that information is stored in molecules that can be packed together tightly in three dimensions. DNA storage has severe limitations though, in that encoding and decoding is prone to errors (sequencing struggle with this already), takes a long time, as well as requiring large machines and lots of compute power. And most importantly, it's not possible to sequentially read or write DNA data, and it's not searchable until after all the data has been read.. The claim of 700 terabytes is the theoretical maximum density, however because of the way reading and writing is done you need huge redundancy, meaning the same data needs to be stored over and over again. So while you might be able to store a lot of data, you won't able to store a lot of *unique* data. I wouldn't count on that as a solution any time soon, or even ever.

The optics and the camera play a large role in the resolution of the final image on the film.

How much resolution the IMAX camera can produce is still unknown to you and me.

The sweet spot is relative to the resolution of the content on the film, not the film it self. If I smear vaseline on the lens and shoot a movie with the IMAX camera, there is no point in digitizing the film in 9K, the resolution of the content would be far to low to necessitate such a high scan resolution.		>Anything higher will give very diminished returns and is only going draw further attention to the grain structure of the film		Noise removal algorithms can work better if you have more resolution, and down sampling a higher resolution scan will give better image quality than scanning at just the resolution you need.

IMAX film is not a special magical formula. It's just regular film, but BIGGER. And regular film tops out at around 100 - 120 lines per millimeter (LPMM) for real world shooting. If each line is a pixel, then you get around 7,000 pixels for 70mm wide film. 7K-ish. You would therefore expect 24mm wide film (AKA super 35mm film format) to look less sharp then 4K digital, *and it does.* You can over scan for grain smoothing if you want.		> Noise removal algorithms can work better if you have more resolution...

I have no issues with that article in it self (I've read it before). What I don't agree with is your claim that is is a valid comparison between a hypothetical 6K digital sensor and the IMAX camera. Until we have a numeric value for the resolution output of the IMAX camera every comparison with digital sensors are guesswork. 		The D3X and the Mamiya 7 have different lenses. Find me a MTF chart for both of them and we can compare them. All lenses on the market today are limited by diffraction and lens errors also. Some of them quite heavily.  Further more the images have been upscaled, and the item photographed doesn't give on any objective information about the resolving power. If there were sample pictures of a resolution chart instead of the lens it'd given us something more than a subjective assessment.			>Nope. Believe it or not, its not a big mystery. IMAX film is not a special magical formula. It's just regular film, but BIGGER. And regular film tops out at around 100 - 120 lines per millimeter (LPMM) for real world shooting.		That depends on many factors, including the f-no. Some Carl Zeiss lenses set at f/8 and f/5.6 resolutions are known to have hit the very limits of the best color films available. High quality color films do reach resolutions in the region of 140 line pairs per millimeter, and some like Kodak Ektar 25 can give up to 200.		That's all irrelevant though. Kodak states that 35mm film has the equivalent of 6K resolution according to a Senior Vice President of IMAX.^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution#cite_note-IMAX-6). The IMAX film cameras use 65mm negatives running horizontally where every frame is almost three inches wide. So the negative is three times larger than 35mm, giving us roughly 18,000 pixels across.		>The box that holds all that stuff together doesn't contribute.		True, but there are all sorts of internal stuff in some film cameras that do effect resolution, like ceramic pressure plates for instance.

{"body":"> All lenses on the market today are limited by diffraction and lens errors also. Some of them quite heavily.		Yes. But for good lenses, the sensor will limit it first. [Here are some film limits (cycles / millimeter):](http://imgur.com/a/NPOuP)		Those were:		[Kodak Tmax 100](http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/f4016/f4016.pdf) (B&W neg)		[Kodak Portra 400](http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/e4050/e4050.pdf) (color neg)		[Fuji Velvia 50](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/professional_films/pdf/velvia_50_datasheet.pdf) (color slide)		> The images have been upscaled.		They've been upscaled to the same magnification. So there isn't a problem (*Downscaling* would be problem).		> The item photographed doesn't give on any objective information about the resolving power.		It doesn't give numbers in LPMM, because it's a side by side real world comparison. You can just look at it and tell which appears to be resolving more detail. These kinds of tests can often (but not always) be more useful then shooting test charts. 		> If there were sample pictures of a resolution chart instead of the lens it'd given us something more than a subjective assessment. 		This can give misleading results in comparison of film and digital. Film has an unusual advantage photographing test charts because it can resolve very high detail when when shooting high contrast subjects, like black and white test charts. When shooting in real world conditions this unfair advantage will be taken away because normal shooting conditions don't include extremely contrasty subjects (most of the time).		[Various Medium format lenses tested for LPMM](http://www.hevanet.com/cperez/MF_testing.html) Note: most film + lens combos top out around 75 - 100 LPMM, while a few of the best can hit 120. These tests were done on Tmax 100 film, perhaps the sharpest film on the market today, easily sharper then any color film. Many of these lenses are state-of-the-art, non-retrofocus designs.		Another film vs digital comparison, this time using the same lens for both film and digital: [36mm wide film vs 5.5K digital RBG bayer sensor](http://imgur.com/ImNI8mq). [Source](http://www.redbubble.com/people/traviseaston/writing/2531282-digital-versus-velvia). Look, this test can't be more clear. The film has an advantage, being 36mm long, with 220% more surface area then Super35 film. The digital sensor has a *disadvantage* having a Bayer sensor over the top of it. *And yet digital still has more clarity*. The lens was the same for both tests, and it is clearly limited not by diffraction or lens aberrations, but by the sensor.		> Kodak states that 35mm film has the equivalent of 6K resolution according to a Senior Vice President of IMAX.		Okay, no. While you can scan 35mm film at 6K if you want, it won't match a native 6K digital camera until hell freezes over. I have sat in a test theater with over a dozen Hollywood DPs and *blindly* compared 35mm footage  against 4K digital. The 35mm film was distinctly softer. I can guarantee you that if you shoot a real world movie scene (not test charts) you will see that a 4K digital camera has superior resolution. I don't have a source for this but if you really want, I can get it for you. "4K digital is sharper then 35mm film" or something like that. 		If you scale the above assumption to 65mm IMAX, then an 11K digital camera clearly beats it, and I would say an 8K camera would right about match it.		[Here is another test of a 7.5K digital RGB sensor vs **85mm** wide film.](http://imgur.com/a/YVIRR). (Digital on top, film on the bottom). Granted, this one isn't a *very* good comparison, as the film wasn't scanned with a professional scanner, but still. A good scanner can only show so much more detail.		Look, I am not trying to bash film. I love film. I'm building a film camera right now while my $3000 digital camera sits in the closet. I would be over joyed if film could capture as much detail as you (and apparently a VP at IMAX), are suggesting, but I have never seen evidence of it. *Every* practical test I've seen has shown the limits as I have stated above. Film is wonderful, but the sharpest lens on earth isn't going to show you what it physically can't record.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TildeAleph","name":"t1_clvq9gm","parent_id":"t1_clvj2p6","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415371453,"created_utc":1415371453}

In 2002, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and an IMAX-format re-release of the 1995 film Apollo 13, were the first official applications of the DMR process. Because of the projection limitations at the time, Apollo 13 and Attack of the Clones had to be edited down from their original length. As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters, the later DMR releases did not have this limitation; current platters allow a run time of up to 175 minutes.

{"body":"So there are some simple reasons for the differences in numbers, and one kind of complicated one.  For the simple stuff, most of the tests you speak of were done on older stocks or even still stock (to save money for the test), which weren't as sharp, and many of them actually scanned the film at 4K first before measuring.  I throw "35mm" around a lot, but what I really mean by that is the modern Vision 3 stocks, and nothing less, because that is what would be used to shoot a film these days...  We don't use EXR anymore, or even any Vision 2.		Arri did a study not too long ago to test their Arriscan 6K>4K scanning technique.  They measured an increase in detail going from 4K to 6K to 8K and even to 10K.  Now, one of the reasons this debate is so hard to pin down is because the detail of film drops off slowly as it nears the top, and translating the film image to pixels is also not entirely intuitive.		Now to the complicated reason. If you were to measure the resolution of a single frame of film, it will measure at a lower resolution...  Usually somewhere between 4.5K and 6.5K depending on the stock and exposure.  Arri's study I mentioned above shows this, and also accounts for the slow drop off in resolution as you move up, because with each step they measured more detail gained from the scan, but for each step up in scanning resolution there was not as much detail gained as each step before that.  So there was a sort of diminishing returns to it.  At 10K there was a bit of detail added, but not much.  Now, if you were to do the exact same tests, except do it while the film is also moving at 24fps, then you get a totally different story.  Your tests go from measuring between 4.5K and 6.5K depending on the stock and exposure to measuring between 7K and about 9K...  Which averages to around 8K.		So why does this happen?  The reason is a combination of persistence of vision and the random grain structure of film stock.  When you point a 35mm motion picture camera at an object and roll the film, each frame is captured to a different area of the negative, which has a different arrangement of grain. Detail captured in frame 1 might not be captured in frame 2, only to be captured in frame 3 again, due to the changing grain structure. When the film is played back, our eyes combine detail in adjacent frames to form the image as we know it, which results in a higher amount of detail than what is actually contained within a single frame.  This allows 35mm to average out at about 8K when shown at 24fps.  Interestingly enough, you could push way past that if you shot even faster frame rates, which is one of the reasons why Showscan was so interesting when people were experimenting with it, and why the Hobbit HFR has sort of been a bit of a dull thud, because a higher frame rate with digital capture and projection wouldn't see a benefit in spacial resolution.		Now you might be a little confused by why I said specifically "if you scanned at 8K and did an 8K film out" in my previous comments.  This is because when you scan you actually have to scan at a higher resolution than the film technically has in order to capture the grain at a high enough resolution for this phenomenon to be preserved when going through the digital realm.  It is arguable that 8K is just about enough to preserve this phenomenon.  But you would see a benefit from scanning higher than that anyways.		But at the end of the day, most workflows will be either 2K or 4K.  A bit of a waste?  If you ask me, yes.  But film is enormously archivable and flexible to future formats.  My lab is about to start work on a TV show that was shot on 16mm, which we will be remastering to 4K.  Down the line all those films that were shot on 35mm but mastered at 2K, for example, can be remastered at 4K or even 8K when needed.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vatakarnic33","name":"t1_clv8e2z","parent_id":"t1_clv665b","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415318806,"created_utc":1415318806}

Last time I checked, Arri does not have their scanning study online anymore.  Everything else I've talked about has been compiled through our experiments and tests here at my lab.		I absolutely think there is a benefit to shooting motion picture film over any still film, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend using a prepackaging service due to cost and potential issues with the process.  		Motion picture film can be obtained really cheaply from short end suppliers.  I've gotten rolls for about $.08/ft, and a standard roll of still film would probably be around 3 feet long, for reference.  You'd have to spool it yourself into reusable cartridges, though.		It also generally has much higher quality control, because there can't be any variation in the emulsion for an entire 1000ft can, let alone too much variation between cans, emulsion numbers, and even entire film stocks.  The quality control doesn't just help with the variability of the film, but it also results in more accurate colors, tighter grain, and even more consistent grain across ISO's.		The only downside is that you have to find a lab that will process it for you with ECN-2 chemistry (I wouldn't really recommend using C-41, since it really wasn't designed for that process).  I have personally helped a couple Redditor's with their ECN-2 processing of still rolls recently, since I have access to processors.

You can order a Red camera with 6k right now, and I would expect an 8k sensor to come out within the next two years, and probably a 12k two or so years after that.		But really, you could probably make something more effective right now, there's just no one making that specific camera, because there's no market.  IMAX cameras are huge, heavy, and expensive.  like, 200+ pounds heavy.  A fully done Red Epic weighs around twenty pounds, and that's with all the widgets attached.  You can have an operable Red Epic that weighs about six pounds.		Similarly, IMAX is way more expensive. Like, you can't buy them expensive.  They're only available to rent, and for about 15,000 bucks a week. And storage space is at a premium, to the tune of about 15 dollars per second, which means that, in a 90 minute film, if you shoot a pretty judicious 3:1 ratio, you're spending a quarter of a million dollars on film stock.  Meanwhile the Red is 2,500 bucks a week, or about 50k to buy, and storage space is essentially free and reusable.			Really the barrier to creating a digital camera on par with 1570 IMAX right now is that nobody would pay for it. It would be big, heavy, and expensive, and it would only appeal to people who already have the resources to shoot in imax, and those people usually have a love affair with film that you couldn't change with a side-by-side comparison.  So they don't.  In ten years, I'd say, we'll have something that can outresolve IMAX That'll be the size and weight of a modern professional DSLR camera, and will cost about 30k.			The more fun question to ask, is when will digital photography catch up to the Land 20x24 camera, which, theoretically and using crude math and equivalents, would put out a 70k image at approximately 4 gigapixels.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bushiz","name":"t1_clu8xog","parent_id":"t1_clu65ke","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415235973,"created_utc":1415235973}

{"body":"The most basic answer is that 70mm IMAX film is comparable to shooting and projecting digital at 12K. We mostly shoot and always project digital at 4K right now. Once we're at the point that we're shooting and projecting movies at 12K+ then 70mm IMAX film will start becoming obsolete but until then there's no other way to see a film with this level of visual clarity. Also you're right, Interstellar is shot on 70mm IMAX (and partly 35mm). If it were shot digitally it would be pointless to convert it to film and project it this way.

We'll be able to do that someday but you need to project at around 12K to get to the same level of quality. Right now we're projecting at 4K and will probably be at 8K in a few years. Give it a decade and we'll probably be at the point where we can scan a 70mm IMAX print and project it digitally with minimal loss in quality.

The film starts where it is now, gets fed by the projectionist from the center through a small contraption called a 'head' or 'brain', onto some rollers which feed it through the projector, onto some more rollers that end up placing the film on another platter ready for the next show. It's like a giant cassette tape that flips itself, but someone still has to do the initial threading up manually for each show.		In the old days of dual projector, reel to reel systems, once 1 reel was finished it would be 'tail out' or the end of the reel would be on the outer layer of the reel. It wouldn't be able to be shown again until someone had run it back through another machine, onto a different reel, to get the start of the reel on the outside or 'head out'. With each reel being about 20 minutes long the projectionist would need to do this 6-10 times for every show, which obviously would be quite time consuming. The platter system shown in this picture means the projectionist only needs to splice the film together once, feed it onto the platter system once, thread it up and show it for the entirety of its run in their theatre, then break it back down onto reels and ship it off to the next theatre.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"horsedream","name":"t1_cluah1h","parent_id":"t1_clu4sqb","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415239038,"created_utc":1415239038}

{"body":"When I was a kid in the late 90s the first I heard of IMAX was when a science center in my home town opened an IMAX dome with a massive 60 ft. screen and I got to watch "Everest" there on a class field trip. Considering the most amazing screening experience I'd had to that point was watching Volcano with Tommy Lee Jones (still a fucking great movie) on my aunt's 50" rear projection TV, it was incredible. Being in one of the largest auditoriums I've ever known with a 3 story tall screen that stretched from one end of the room to the other it didn't matter what they played, it would have been breathtaking, and so it was.		Since that moment I have lived for the day I would see a blockbuster film on one of those screens and have my mind melted through every orifice of my face by sheer awesome. When The Dark Knight Rises released to IMAX I had that chance. I'm not from here, but I live in Utah now and had only recently moved at the time. I drove 40 minutes to SLC to finally realize a nearly lifelong dream. Do you know what happened?		There was an even larger 70 ft. screen, I watched a fucking awesome movie, but was ultimately disappointed in the IMAX experience because as a kid everything seems incredible, as you get older great memories are exaggerated more and more, and as an adult nothing can live up to the wonder years. You become cynical, boring, always pissed off about something, and there's nothing you can do about it. All I kept thinking was "I paid $20 for this when the movie would have been more or less the same in a regular theater for less than half the price," and you know what? I hate myself for it. I hate that I couldn't enjoy it. That it didn't take me back to those childhood wonder years. Being an adult is fucking depressing.

{"body":"With film, image quality is a matter of several factors including the lens, the exact composition of the stock and the size of the frame. 70mm film has literally double the amount of space per frame on which to deposit images that 35mm has, which in turn means more fine detail, less distortion and less visible grain when blown up onto a large theater screen.		If the picture looked "blurry" when you saw it, I'd venture it was something the projectionist did wrong, very likely the lens that projects the image onto the screen was not set correctly. Modern 70mm film stock shot on a modern camera can and usually will far outshine the image quality of any digital cinema system.		That being said, digital cameras and many digital displays tend to "hyper sharpen" images, especially under certain circumstances, and it's led people to view film as being "soft", when in fact it's image is more realistic. Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version of Hamlet, P.T. Anderson's "The Master" and Ron Howard's 1992 film "Far and Away" are examples of some modern films shot on 70mm. If you ever have the chance to watch one or all of them on a large display (<60-inches) or (even better) via a high-end projector on a large projection screen, you may notice the insane level of fine background detail and the vivid colorspace provided by the film.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clu85r2","parent_id":"t1_clu7otu","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415234452,"created_utc":1415234452}

Some 70mm film IMAX projectors utilize two prints/projectors for a left and right eye effect which allow for 3D movies, I don't believe this to be one of those, but I could be mistaken.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ianitis","name":"t1_cluctob","parent_id":"t1_cluc9u3","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415243776,"created_utc":1415243776}
