That basically set the stage for a build up of hate towards the industry and was only exacerbated when multi millionaire artists started complaining about pirates taking food off their family's tables. I have no problem supporting an artist, what I DO have a problem doing is pandering to and supporting the RIAA which is already robbing and fucking artists left and right. My cousin has a band and sold 20,000 mp3 last month as well as 20 vinyl albums. You know how much the recording company paid him? $27.50. This is why a lot of artists have been giving away their albums for free.  They do it for the love of the art form. The same goes for indie directors.

{"body":"I have the same feeling about the movie. Having just finished the film about 10 minutes ago, losing the beard does symbolize a change in the story. He actually gets his revenge and now has to deal with the consequences. Which is an interesting idea that other highly praised revenge-folly films like Old Boy spend two acts building towards and finishes in the finale. Blue Ruin gets to that by the end of the first act.		But by the beginning of the second act, it becomes a movie about a guy having to deal with the fallout of his revenge. Which in an odd way, continues to be another revenge film entirely. It takes some of the same steps as other revenge films, where a guy that's out of his element has to go against the odds to protect his family. And I think this is where I became most uninterested in the movie.		Then by the third act, I felt like he became an almost villainous figure up until  [Spoiler] (/s "the Cleveland family really was trying to kill his sister"). So in the end, it really was a different approach to revenge-folly films, and the ending really changed or at least challenged my expectations- which was nice because the middle act felt a little pedestrian.

He also almost seemed to want to get fired, he could have just said it is a family medical emergency.		Anyways, that is kind of nitpicking I know. The story is about him being willing to destroy his career and possibly lose his family by embracing his bastard child, unlike his father who abandoned him. Like I said earlier I thought the movie neglected the whole visual side of the movie medium. I had another friend who watched most of it with us, but I can't even say watched, he was nearly passed out from exhaustion just listening along before he finally went to sleep.

{"body":"Now that you mention it, you're right. I do remember questioning why he never just told his bosses what was happening, or at least enough to give them the gist of why he was behaving so weirdly. The only argument I have against that is the fact that he continually proves himself to be an extremely honorable man, but who also has some vanity issues. He risks ruining his entire life just to be there for the birth of his child, but only does so because he's worried that not doing so will look worse. It would make sense that he wouldn't want the people he works for and who work under him to know anything about the shameful circumstances he's in. The cement pour itself I can attribute to simply bad luck/timing. Wasn't it all planned out anyway and the only thing that changed was the fact that he wouldn't be there and the order was wrong or something?		I can understand why people would find it boring and fall asleep, it's a very slow-moving film. But for me the character was engrossing and the way the storyline builds, especially as we discover more and more about what's happening with the baby, was perfectly excuted. That being said, one of my first thoughts as it finished was that it might have been as good, or even better, as a stage play, which is traditionally slower-paced than films. I could easily imagine it with a small, representative set and cool lighting where one man sits in a chair and talks on the phone for 80 minutes. But that might just be my tastes, and might also mean it's less suited for film.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"andres92","name":"t1_clj38lw","parent_id":"t1_clizefh","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1414207973,"created_utc":1414204373}
{"body":"It really just struck us as weird, because he had plans to be watching the soccer match that night with his kids anyways.

Yes I imagine the person in charge of a concrete pour should be there on the day the pour happens, but he had an emergency come up, companies can understand that. Like I said, his approach to the situation almost felt like he wanted to be fired.		Btw the other friend didn't fall asleep because it was boring, he was in the midst of triathlon training, but I just found it funny that the next morning he had just as much a grasp of the movie as someone who had been watching it. Other than the few moments where he is looking in the rearview mirror to talk to his dad, you don't need to see any of the movie.

{"body":"> Obvious Child		I had a really difficult time with this one.  I think I'm unforgiving.  It was hard to view Jenny Slate in the role of Donna, when I'm so used to her playing the outrageous skank on Parks & Recreation.  Hearing her with a sweet voice and demeanor was... I don't know... I didn't buy it.		Also, when someone does stand up comedy routines in a film, I have to actually enjoy it and laugh.  For example, the Louis CK TV show incorporates stand up routines that are so funny I've laughed a lot.  That helped me to buy the premise.  However, in Obvious Child, the routines are, well, I couldn't imagine anyone laughing at any of it.  Not a single joke was funny.   The audience was laughing (it seemed) because the film *wanted* them to laugh, rather than because it was actually funny.		It make it so difficult to appreciate.  It didn't help that when Jenny was laughing at the "fart in my face" and "poop on your shoes" moments, I didn't buy any of that either.  It seemed forced, like I was watching an actress *try* to be amused.		I'm glad the people in this topic enjoyed it.  I'm even jealous.  You guys got to have a good time.

{"body":"Dunno about KSKaleido, but if I had to guess, it's because it's indie. Indie movies have that tendency to be artsy, it's part of what makes them, well, indie. However a much preferable scifi indie movie that takes a low key approach like Under the Skin, at least to me, was that of Monsters.		Under the Skin didn't need action, but some more character interactions that give more substance to just what these beings were would have made it less artsy. Not like awkward, stilted conversation due to not understanding mannerisms as in some scifi, but not the dull, flat interactions that Under the Skin attempted. 		I understand where you're coming from, mind you, yet it felt more to me like a quiet, meandering pseudo-documentary at times than compelling atmospheric scifi. I think part of the problem for me was its slipping into this trite idea of distant, cold extraterrestrials. What's more, even if you didn't give the beings more depth through interactions with others, some internal narrative that loosely explained what was being done would have helped diminish perception of it as being artsy for the sake of it. 		Having watched this with someone else, we both came away from it disappointed (despite not having expectations one way or the other) and not having the faintest idea what all the seduction scenes were about, and since we knew she was an alien, the reveal fell rather flat. There didn't seem to be any interesting insight/idea, no clever new take on the idea (aside from the beings not trying to take over the world, maybe), nor much else to draw from the movie. Not that those are necessarily needed to make it good, but I'd consider those decent criteria for suggesting the film to others. 		At best all I can say is, do you want another indie movie that doesn't do much to explain itself? Or, do you want to see a famous actor naked?

{"body":"Artsy. What does that even mean? To me it's just a lazy term people use when something goes against expectations set by "normal", popular studio movies. It's as if there's conventional film making, and anything that strays from that should be justified. If I ask one of these people what does "artsy for the sake of it" mean, they probably don't even know. It's probably that a shot was held for longer than they expected without the camera moving, or that there weren't quick cuts between two character's faces when they were talking to each other, that kind of thing. So if a movie doesn't fit the expectations that has been set up as what an ordinary movie is supposed to be shot and edited, then it's being "artsy". And we can't have that. Not unless it's for another reason. He said "artsy for the sake of it" as if that in itself was something bad. As if it was worse than "being conventional for the sake of it".		>yet it felt more to me like a quiet, meandering pseudo-documentary at times than compelling atmospheric scifi.		A pseudo documentary is *exactly* what it was supposed to be. She's observing us the same way we'd watch giraffes feeding and walking about. In fact, and I don't know if you know this, but some of the interactions with men, were not scripted. It was literally Scarlett Johanson in a truck, with a camera, chatting to random, non actor dudes. So that is what the film was going for, that you disliked it is another thing, but the film accomplished what it set out to do in that regard.		If she had more interactions, or more active interactions, then the whole point about intimacy and her quest for it would be moot. In other words, she tried doing what you wanted to see in the movie, because it's what she wanted as well, but she couldn't.		>What's more, even if you didn't give the beings more depth through interactions with others, some internal narrative that loosely explained what was being done would have helped diminish perception of it as being artsy for the sake of it. 		It had loose explanations of what happened, alien-wise. They took bodies to feed themselves, or something like that. She lured men through sex. And instead of showing a literal and more "shocking" but totally predictable way, like "oh no, she's going to eat him, she's really just an alien monster! * cue horror music *". Instead of that, they portrayed it in the most beautiful and original way I can think of. I still remember the scenes of her walking back and the men forward, shedding off their clothes with that strange music accompanying them.

{"body":"Yeah, that may be right. I don't like the artsy jab either, honestly, but I figured that was a good springboard to explore my own thoughts on the movie (which is why I dug through the comments to find others' observations/insight). 		Regarding the pseudo-documentary vibe...I think I may not have been clear enough. By emphasizing the alien being as a disguised person wandering about, any alien feel was lost because it felt more like watching someone record a somewhat shy, disoriented person talking to random people. Not an alien, just a person. That's the key there. Not that I don't like the idea of an alien being similar to people in being shy (it's much better than the aforementioned stereotype of cold/distant), but it came across more as the stereotype than as an alien being with much personality. 		In a way, it becomes less a documentary perspective from the alien's view and more that of a documentary perspective from someone watching an alien watching people, and it turns out, if the alien does very little of interest or capable of being understood, it becomes uninteresting. 		Not that I'm unwilling to do the mental legwork to speculate, but as someone else's creative work, I *know* there must have been more to it, so instead I find myself asking, what did they leave out? Was it always somewhat vague and sort of symbolic? Was leaving stuff out and/or keeping it vague meant to achieve something? Did it achieve that something? 		In my mind, when I'm having to gauge those last few things, if I find that what conclusions I come to, as I've discussed in a few other comments here on the movie, are generally unsatisfying then I think whatever was set out to be achieved either simply doesn't resonate with me or fell on its face. 		Like the whole "consumption" scene, I don't need or want it to be overt, that undermines much of the uncomfortable vibe without a doubt and falls into standard horror setups as you describe. However something better indicating that it was *really* harvesting these people or whatever would have helped it. 		Because as-is? I could just as easily change the description a little and Under the Skin could be a movie about a strange, supernatural being instead, coming into the same experiences as the alien in Under the Skin and I feel little would be lost. Those dark chambers could just as easily be supernatural as alien, which maybe that's a testament to the old idea of advanced tech being indistinct from magic for you, but it doesn't do much for me. 		I dunno. The mixture of it feeling like a documentary of an uninteresting alien (rather than documentary from alien's perspective) to the few distinctions it does have to try to set it apart simply didn't feel like they came together all that well for me. Even without more explanation present, with some basic interpretation of it, what I derive then isn't enough to make what I'm viewing feel anymore interesting. 		What's worse is it guides me down some old, trodden paths like a more subdued Body Snatchers with a slightly less malevolent alien being.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gmr_Leon","name":"t1_cljfxo3","parent_id":"t1_cljdk3l","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1414257600,"created_utc":1414254000}

And I think it's somewhat of a flat exploration of the idea of interspecies contact to go the route that it did. If you're trying to become something that you're not, simply to integrate, that feels like an ugly idea to me, and I think that there's more to making human connections than what the movie seems to portray. Conversations can go a long way, but this movie seems to think there's something less in intellectual relationships instead favoring the romantic. 		Which is okay, but it doesn't appeal to me with everything else the movie built up. 		A different take on this, staying within scifi, would be Transcendence. It adopted somewhat similar flat interactions between the husband and his wife, but it strove for an, in my opinion, great mixture of intellectual *and* romantic relationship. The fantastic tragedy of that tale, which you could argue is present in Under the Skin too, was the deterioration of relationships when either the new form or the actual form had to be confronted. 		Transcendence didn't hold your hand either, a little more than Under the Skin I suppose, but it left enough there to be better captivated by, I thought.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gmr_Leon","name":"t1_cljgart","parent_id":"t1_clj7jbk","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1414258474,"created_utc":1414254874}

The movie is not saying anything about "every person". It's about this particular alien, it's *her* view through observations that sex is the culmination of intimacy that she could achieve with the people she interacted with (mostly males). That's it. It's not what the movie is saying, it's not what the director is saying, it's just what she, this character, observes, and believes. She might be completely wrong. Maybe some people irl share that view, perhaps unconsciously, and that's the type of people she's observed (because inevitably, that's the kind of people she lured in, and therefore, the majority of her interactions were with men who prioritized sex).

{"body":"Way to Godwin it...I'm saying a mixture of director meaning *and* audience meaning is better than an imbalance one way or another. To leave it to the audience alone would permit what you describe depending on the content of the film, as the director would have no defense for their actions and come across as foolish or ignorant. Now I do agree that conflating the beliefs expressed by the characters with the director's personal beliefs can be inappropriate, but that's not what I was trying to say, so I apologize for having come across that way. I was thinking in terms of overall meaning of the story, as that's part of what I viewed us as discussing in terms of the culmination of the film's events (whereas you're looking at it more from the character's experience, not relating it to a broader meaning).		However as to the focus on Scarlett's face and all...That's exactly *why* I have difficulty seeing it as anything other than a documentary following her, rather than her running a documentary. I'll not deny that may be a fault in my own viewing, and of the medium to a degree, but I don't think it's an unusual method of viewing. Movies, by their very design, are typically an observational act of others' stories, so even with the best of intentions, I think it's extremely easy to go away from the film as I did. 		So I really think it comes down to viewing it from different perspectives (mine from an observer of an observer, you from the observer), maybe slightly different expectations (some bigger story meaning, you maybe more of a character exploration of meaning/relationships), and that's why we disagree. I'd say your perspective is probably more appealing compared to mine, but I wouldn't say either is entirely unreasonable.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gmr_Leon","name":"t1_cljir2w","parent_id":"t1_cljhybp","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1414264184,"created_utc":1414260584}

{"body":"Sorry, poor way of putting that. At any rate, even if the film doesn't seem to attempt to, I think that's a fairly normal interpretive practice, and when the more minor events don't lend much in the way of exposition or interpretive depth, then you find yourself trying to draw more out of it. 		Which is why I've mentioned that elaborating in some ways, not necessarily overt ways mind you, could have improved what was drawn from interpretation. This is why from a raw documentary perspective it falls flat for some and why from an interpretive perspective, it may fall flat for some (as it was for me, in both cases). Not being an avid cinephile (at least in the sense of noting their more subtle composition), I can't draw tons of satisfaction from the cinematic techniques employed nor as not being an audiophile can I draw much from the soundtrack. 		So I go with what I can best interpret from the plot, as a somewhat more picky reader, and I don't find much appeal in it. As such, whatever vibe/style was intended is lost upon me and feels like it left the subject under-explored. We obviously disagree, but I hope that maybe that provides some better insight into a little more complex viewing of the film outside of some of the other criticisms its received (e.g. too artsy, too boring, etc.). 		I wouldn't say it was a terrible film, nor even bad, but it simply wasn't the type of story that I enjoy, if we go off of some of the common interpretations of it.

I did. You must not read very well, or need everything explained in painstaking detail in order for you to get it. They add perspective. Simple as that.

Summary: A Soviet tank crew loses its path after combat action in a small rebel village. Hunted by rebel survivors and scavengers they attempt to make their way back to friendly lines, while also  struggling with conflict within the confined space of a battle tank.		The tanks in the movie are real Soviet T-55 as used in the Afghan-Soviet war, so you get an unsual amount of realism! The film makers lent them from the Israeli, who conquered these tanks in battles with the Arabs.

{"body":"Cold In July is my favorite movie so far this year! I've been telling EVERYONE about it, but nobody I've talked with has seen it yet. Theatrically I think it's only made around 2 million globally, but it so deserves to makes 20 times that.		Such a great little genre movie: at least three giant plot twists, where the film not only majorly changes plots, but GENRES as well. Starts off as a thriller, then boom! Cape Fear-esque horror movie. Then Bam! Plot twist, and it's a conspiracy noir. Then Pow! It's an action revenge flick. 		And there's Sam Shepard being great, Michael C. Hall proving he is so much more than Dexter, and, as someone else has pointed out, Don mother-fucking Jonson. Plus a fantastic John Carpenter-like 80's synthesizer-throwback soundtrack.

{"body":"Why do even "independent" films (that gain any recognition whatsoever) often as not feature at least one brand-name actor these days? If not two or three?		I realize that "indie" technically refers to the financing and distribution, not the creative forces or actors, but if we're going to talk about "overshadowed" films it bugs me when 1/3 of the list aren't so much "overshadowed" as "A-list celebrities actually made a movie that wasn't blatant Oscar bait and/or a tailor-made blockbuster".		For every A-list actor there are 10+ equally talented and dedicated people who never get to work even a single film or stage project with excellent production values, much less a project with more than 1/10,000th as much press or advertising as the average major studio film.		With all this undiscovered talent out there - all these actors, producers, and directors who put in A-list performances with B-list production values, D-list budgets, and F-list marketing presence - why do we still acknowledge the "indie cred" of rich and recognized people who deign to participate in a project that won't likely get widespread national recognition? It's that noteworthy when a multi-millionaire does an interesting but ultimately unexceptional project that *won't* make them another million dollars? It's worth your limited time and attention over the legitimately excellent work of so many unknowns?		If you want to talk quality "indie" projects, perhaps Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Cage - widely considered downright execrable as acting talents in the overwhelming majority of their roles to date - shouldn't make the list simply for turning in a performance much, much better than "utter crap". At least ten thousand people in America can act better on any day than those two can act on their best day. Maybe films below 70% RT scores shouldn't make the list. You can only pay attention to so many films per year, and I think we should pay more attention to the excellent and less attention to the slightly better works of otherwise painfully average (but famous!) people.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clj6uwp","parent_id":"t3_2k7tj3","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1414218392,"created_utc":1414214792}
