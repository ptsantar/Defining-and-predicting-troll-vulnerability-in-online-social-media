EDIT: Also, it's a bit hard to believe that you didn't intend to sell any of them when your imgur post includes a link to your website saying "Thanks for checking these out!

{"body":"I'm really not pretending. I do not know what RES is. Does that say something different? Does the fact that I posted it at work mean anything? (seriously, fill me in, the one thing that has kept me from posting on reddit has been the learning curve) I literally had someone else post this for me, and he was walking me through for the first couple hours it was live explaining stuff to me. I guess I can see how it's hard to believe for people here. I really was just doing this whole thing for fun. I posted each pic to instagram as I did them and they got like 20 to 30 likes a piece. That's it. Had no idea this would happen. So then when people said they wanted to buy stuff, I thought I'd try to make that possible. Who wouldn't do the same? I got two kids in daycare man! 		As for the preorder link, this is how that went:	Me: "Holy crap, people want shirts of this?"	Coworker: "Yeah, you should make them before someone else does."	Me: "I...uhh...crap!" 	I then proceeded to scramble around on my laptop trying to make a print-worthy version of Pup Fiction in less than 10 minutes. It wasn't going well. Then my coworker chimed in.	"Just set up a preorder page or something and people can request one if they want one."	So I did that on the imgur post, because a couple other redditors informed me that too much self promotion would get me shadow banned. 		I guess that's all I'll say on this. I'm thrilled about the reaction to all this. I think these past two days will always hold a special place in my heart, no matter what happens from here. It kinda bums me out folks think I gamed it or I was trying to trick everyone. But oh well. It seems you still enjoyed looking at them, so whether you believe me or not or think I'm a self-promoting douchebag, I'm calling it a win :)","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"austindlight","name":"t1_cltdjhv","parent_id":"t1_clski9s","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415161206,"created_utc":1415161206}
{"body":"I'm glad that this went well for you and I'm pleased that you managed to get some promotion for your business. I've got no problem with that. I also don't think you're a douchebag at all. It's tough to get a leg up with online promotion and well done for being so successful and for being a talented artist.		The reason I think you are not a new user is that you posted a screenshot of the front page on your website. You blocked out the username, presumably to hide the details of your main account, but you left the little indicator that shows you use RES. If you are a new user then there is no way that you would have RES installed, especially as you claim you don't know what is! Also, you kept saying things like "I got gold and people tell me that's good!" and that always sounds fake as anything to me.		And having the preorder link set up on the imgur page, not to mention having a *store* on your website obviously shows that you planned to sell these. I mean, you already sell your art, why *wouldn't* you plan to sell these?		When I see people claiming that something is true and it obviously isn't then it puts my hackles up a little bit.

{"body":"Ohhhhhhhhh. I'm with you now.		Okay, so the screenshot came from my coworker's computer. He was messaging me all morning going "You're on page 6" and then "You got gold!" and then when I hit the top he sent me a screenshot. I was bogged down in replying and sorta just freaking out. So I threw his screenshot on my website. 		That same coworker was the guy who posted it for me, and who has been amazing at helping me figure out the rules of reddit. 		And yeah, I already had a store up to passively sell art. It didn't get much business, but my brother suggested I make one after he bought me some Spider-Man prints off Society6 for my birthday a few years ago. I made a tiny bit of money off some Bioshock Infinite posters I did last year, and that's it. Having the store already set up was a boon for me because it let me quickly add stuff to it. But yeah, I already had the store and website for years, that's just smart business.		I get the hackle raising stuff (really didn't know what gold is, still unsure on what it does for me, and if I'm supposed to give it away--my grandma emailed me telling me my mom told her I had gold because of the Internet, heh), I guess that's why I keep replying to you despite all the other responses who don't care whether it's fake. Because it raises MY hackles that you, Mr. Fuckusnowman, think I'm lying. I am in a great debt to this amazing community--there are all kinds of neat opportunities popping up because of this--the last thing I want to do is piss people off and make them think I'm something I'm not. 		But we're probably doomed to go in a circle, because if I was in your shoes I'd be all, "Of course he'd say it was his coworker's!"

{"body":"Beauty and the Beat could also be decent Oscar bait if they make her dance instructor Adam "The Beast" Prince, a disgraced professional dancer who, through Belle, finds love and redemption as he realizes he can use his skills to empower local peasants to pursue their true destiny. Towards the end of the movie he discovers he is dying of something really tragic, and becomes moody and depressed as he realizes he will die alone, since he failed to regain the respect of his former peers. Lo and behold that while his peers have indeed abandoned him, on his deathbed he is visited by every citizen of the nearby village, who all show him how the way he taught young peasants the power of hip-hop dance has touched all their lives in meaningful and powerful ways.			Finally, the last to come visit him is Belle, who professes her undying love to him. The two agree to get married, and a priest conducts their wedding service and the last rites simultaneously. When the priest reaches the Beast's vows, saying "Do you, Adam, take this woman Belle, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?" the Beast says "No. Until forever" then promptly dies.			Years later, we see that Belle has seemingly achieved her dream of being a famous dancer in Paris, but eventually we are show that she is not, in fact, a dancer, but is instead a dance instructor, having realized that she would rather continue the legacy of helping others. As she stands in her office looking out the window, she is visited by a young student who dreams of being a dancer but has grown increasingly discouraged - much like Belle herself at the beginning of the movie. She asks Belle - who now goes by Mrs. Prince - whether it's really worth going on. Belle asks her what she's dancing for. The girl seems confused. Belle says "If you dance for fame or fortune, you will only find broken dreams. But if you dance for love, you can change someone else's world." The camera pans up to a photo of Beast sitting above her desk before cutting to the credits.","depth":1,"score":68,"ups":68,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MilesBeyond250","name":"t1_clrx0wa","parent_id":"t1_clrtkuj","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1415041784,"created_utc":1415041784}
