{"body":"This is a **big deal**, and not just because it is adware.		It is installing a "certificate" which is what your computer uses to tell what websites, software and drivers to trust and what not to trust.		That would be bad just by itself, but they hid the private part of the encryption key inside the software and as of about an hour ago, anyone that knows what they are doing is able to find it.		What does that mean?		* Bad people can "sign" malware with this certificate, making the computer think that the virus you just downloaded is totally legitimate	* Bad people can forge SSL certificates for websites (already happening to [Bank of America](https://twitter.com/fugueish/status/568253665095450625)),  letting them to spy on your every move.

{"body":"Not to downplay how stupid this is, but you can't use the certificate for passive eavesdropping.   The bogus certificate is "only" being used to encrypt the traffic on your machine.  The actual SSL traffic is then broken, and reencrypted using the site session/certificate.  So between your PC and bank of america for example, your conversation is still just as secure (maybe, depending on the superfish cipher suites etc) over the wire on the internet.  		The problem is if someone also gets MiTM, through ARP poisoning, DNS poisoning, or just owning the network with a transparent icap proxy, he can terminate your TLS sessions and reencrypt them using the superfish cert, which your PC trusts.		The other risk is that superfish might not do the same certificate validation that your browser performs.  Pinning, chain validation, expiration, algorithms, etc	... You have no way of knowing if superfish will raise an alarm.  In fact since it is designed to be stealthy, it probably doesn't want to raise an alarm because doing so would out it.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"R-EDDIT","name":"t1_coqtoqu","parent_id":"t1_coqgisg","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1424384474,"created_utc":1424384474}

So when you remove it from that trust store, and Superfish is still installed and injecting certs into the sites you visit they no longer show trusted (you removed that trust). 		That's how it's supposed to work in practice. This way if rogue certificates are injected (man-in-the-middle attack) users get warnings.

{"body":"/u/neozuki pretty much nailed it on the head.  I felt like /u/Wild_Marker's explanation made it sound somewhat like you would be given an invalid certificate and Superfish causes your operating system to ignore the fact that the cert is invalid by corrupting your SSL libraries or some such.  If that were the case, this would be a much bigger issue than it already is because they could cause any invalid certificates to be accepted.  For instance they could reroute facebook.com on your computer to go to a copy of Facebook that they run, and then they could steal your Facebook credentials.  You'd never even know the difference if they actually corrupted your SSL stack, and they could use that to steal your Facebook credentials.		It's really not Superfish negating the security measures.  Everything still works exactly the way it's supposed to, you just have a certificate installed as trusted that you shouldn't.  For most people, our explanations are the same.

{"body":"Let???s see if I can explain :)		I???ll start with two definitions???		Encryption uses keys which come in two forms:		*Symmetric* - where the the key to encrypt is the same to decrypt, and:		*Asymmetric* - where one key encrypts (called a private key) and the other decrypts (called a public key, able to be given out to anyone). Since cryptography is all about really hard maths, it is super complex to work out the private key if you only have the public key - but super simple to decrypt something with the public key if it has been encrypted with a private key. 		*Certificates* are a combination of the asymmetric public key mentioned above and an identity (who you are, and what you want to do - e.g. Microsoft, who wants to secure your access to a website, or to secure the software you install) that have a mathematical ???signature??? created to prove they have not been tampered with. That signature is created using the private key (which is kept secret by Microsoft), and is able to be verified by the public key (which anyone can have, and is included on your computer). 		Without that private key it is near impossible to forge a certificate.		The way your browser/computer security works is by ???chaining??? these certificates together by getting one certificate to sign the next. The person that has the certificate at the top (a ???Trusted Root Authority??? like Microsoft) signs the certificate below it (e.g. a company like Verisign) using their private key, which everyone is able to prove is legitimate using the public key. This keeps happening all the way down to the certificate issued to the website you were browsing - like your bank's website. 		So when you go to access your bank???s website, your computer takes the certificate it is given and checks with the level above and makes sure that the signature is valid, then keeps repeating that all the way to the top. If it gets to the top without the chain breaking, it considers the connection ???trusted???.		What this Superfish software has done is install their own certificate right at the top (a ???Trusted Root Certificate Authority) - on the same level as Microsoft, but they gave everyone that owns a Lenovo laptop (including bad guys that don???t) the private part of the key in the process. This means anyone who has the key (basically everyone at this point) can trick your computer into thinking that the website you just visited (your email provider, your bank, your local gov???t site, etc) or the software you just installed (that virus pretending to be a fancy screensaver) is secure when really they can watch everything you do.		**tl;dr**: Computers rely on hard math to prove that websites are who they say they are and software is safe. Lenovo/Superfish did an end run around that safety by making Lenovo owners trust everything, but gave hackers the ability to do so at the same time","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elliotanderson","name":"t1_corgrb4","parent_id":"t1_corf9ee","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1424442424,"created_utc":1424442424}

Go to your laptop's support page to get a copy of all the drivers you'll need and put them on a USB drive for later.  There's a good chance all the drivers you'll need will be included in Windows or automatically installed by Windows Update, but be sure to **at least get at least a copy of the wifi driver** since without an internet connection obviously you won't be getting far.		If the laptop has a built-in recovery partition then you don't have anything to worry about but if it doesn't have one and didn't come with backup discs then you might be smart to create a set.  There should be a software tool pre-installed to do this, or else a process described in the laptop's manual.  If you use a USB drive for the recovery media, don't use the same one you copied your drivers to!		edit: for a bit of added insurance, you can use [this tool](http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-recover-windows-88-1-product-key-from-bios/) to see if you have a baked-in OEM serial number and see what it is.

{"body":"While I completely agree with you, it's not broken from Microsoft's standpoint. When they sell an OEM product, it is at a greatly reduced price point with the understanding that whatever entity buys it is "on the hook" for providing support. The deeply discounted price is then (ostensibly) passed on to the consumer in the form of a less expensive end product (like those $300 PCs Dell sells). 		Part of the support of a Microsoft product is making sure its end users can reinstall it (which includes providing a copy when necessary). Really, we should be upset that the OEMs have trended towards hard drive recovery partitions, back up disc creation software, and purchasable recovery disks. I should be able to go to an OEMs support portal and download the OS just like I download any of the other drivers. 		In the end, the only thing that really bothers me from Microsoft's end was their shutdown of the digital river download site. It's wasn't well-advertised, but it was a great way to get the software. 		As a support professional, I really really regret not downloading every flavor of Windows 7 & 8 before they closed DR.

Further the diverse ecosystem allows Linux users to make use of new technology and research years before it shows up on proprietary systems. For example Windows has been using NTFS as a file system since '93, on Linux I have the choice of file systems like btrfs and rieser4 that are packed full of incredible features like snapshotting and device pooling. NTFS on the other hand still has manual defragmenting.

Oh, well, if your monitor isn't compatible, your monitor isn't compatible, so that's that. What's uncommon is to find an incompatible monitor - these things are supposed to be standardized to the point that the computer generally doesn't even *know* what your monitor is, because it's just spitting out signal in the standard format.		As for Twitch, it must be using some very odd codec then, though a five-second Google search turns up plenty of pages that seem to say how to do it.		And as for games, whoever told you they would work was lying, and I apologize on behalf of the community.

{"body":"Everyone should let Lenovo know that you won't be purchasing a computer from them if this isn't fixed.  Go to their website and at the far bottom right there's a contact link.		Anyone with a Lenovo laptop should follow these steps:		- [Go to this web address](https://www.canibesuperphished.com/) and check to see if you get a security warning.  	 - if you DO get a security warning, you're probably not infected  	 - if you DON'T get a security warning, you're almost certainly infected *(exception being if you've disabled security warnings like an idiot)*		- If you're infected, or even if you're not and just want your computer to run faster and have less pre-installed poop, install a fresh copy of Windows.  	 - It's always a good idea to install a fresh copy of Windows on a new PC since virtually every OEM pre-installs all kinds of borderline-malware.  You should be at least a little computer savvy to do this.  If you're infected and don't feel comfortable reinstalling Windows, you don't have many options.  If it's in the return period, return it.  If not, you might have to find a friend or family member who's more computer-savvy.  If all else fails, if you at least have another PC, a smartphone, or a tablet with internet access, then you can certainly find a newbie-proof guide on YouTube and/or find solutions to any problems you might run into.  	 - Go to your manufacturer's support page, enter your laptop's model number, and download *at minimum* your laptop's wifi driver.  As long as you have internet access you can install any other required drivers later, and Windows Update will probably do most of them on its own.  Put the wifi driver on an empty thumb drive and set it aside.  Don't use the thumb drive for the next step.  	 - Go [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery) to legally download an official Windows disc image directly from Microsoft.  Get the same version of Windows as your computer came pre-installed with.	 - Your laptop likely came with a tool to create recovery media.  This will allow you to create a set of discs or a thumb drive which can reinstall Windows exactly as it came from the factory.  It's a **very good idea** to do this, always.	 - Your hard drive likely has multiple partitions, one that's very small (~100 MB), one that's very large (many gigabytes), and one that's relatively small (2-20 gigabytes).  The biggest and smallest ones are safe to delete while installing Windows.  The medium-sized one (if it exists) is a recovery partition and should be left intact in case you need it later.  *Always* leave it intact, it's not worth getting a tiny bit of extra hard drive space in exchange for an emergency backup.  	 - Starting with Windows 8, PCs come with a serial number that's permanently pre-installed into your computer and you shouldn't need to enter a serial number or jump through hoops to activate while installation.  	 - Windows takes *forever* to install and finish updating, Windows 8 in particular.  You won't be using the laptop during the day you reinstall.  Most of the setup is unattended, meaning you hit "okay" and leave it to do its thing, then come back and hit "okay" again... repeat.  One important thing though, always install ALL the available Windows updates before installing a service pack ("Windows 7 SP1") or starting the free Windows 8.1 upgrade.  The three times I've been unfortunate enough to bear witness to attempting to install a service pack or the 8.1 update prior to all the regular Windows updates being installed, it got half-way through the update process (hours) and then decided it couldn't update and needed to revert all the changes it'd made (more hours), then once I'd installed all the regular updates I had to install 8.1 again (hours)...","depth":0,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Broseph_McTatertots","name":"t1_coqikly","parent_id":"t3_2wezbk","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1424367901,"created_utc":1424367901}

{"body":"Alright, hear me out.		If you are truly worried about this, give Linux a shot. No, really. You might know Linux as that weird OS that only hackers use, that's really hard to install and learn. You might know Linux as that strange OS that has ridiculously bad hardware support, little software and close to no games.		That's not Linux anymore. Maybe it used to be, many years ago, but no longer. Linux is growing *rapidly* in every single area. There are many variations on Linux (called distributions, or "distros" for short) and while many of these distros *are* hard, there are also many distros that are very easy to use.		My personal favorite is [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/). To install it, you just download the image from the website, burn it to a DVD or a memory stick, and reboot your computer. You can't fail with the installer. If you wish to keep Windows installed as well, no problem. The installer will help you install Linux next to Windows, and each time you boot you will be able to chose if you want to start Linux och Windows.		Linux Mint is very kind to beginners, and it's desktop environment called "Cinnamon" kind of resembles Windows a bit, so experienced Windows users will soon feel at home. It will feel strange and alien at first, but soon all things will fall into place.		Now, I do not know who you are or how experienced you are with this kind of stuff, but if you (or anyone else reading this) have any questions, send me a PM or head over to /r/linux, /r/linux4noobs or /r/linuxquestions.","depth":1,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gycklarn","name":"t1_coqk920","parent_id":"t1_coqaojm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1424370488,"created_utc":1424370488}

{"body":"Not quite like this.		"When Palmer visited https://www.bankofamerica.com/, he found that the certificate presented to his browser wasn't signed by certificate authority VeriSign as one would expect, but rather by Superfish.		He saw the same Superfish-signed certificate misrepresenting itself when he visited other HTTPS-protected websites. In fact, there isn't a single TLS-protected website that wasn't affected.		Palmer was later able to confirm that the private key for the Superfish certificate installed on his Yoga 2 contained the same private key as a Superfish certificate installed on a different person's Lenovo PC. That means there's a good chance attackers could use the certificate to create fake HTTPS websites that wouldn't be detected by vulnerable Lenovo machines. At the time this report was being prepared, there were no reports of anyone testing and confirming the hypothesis, but several researchers agreed the scenario seemed highly likely.		The Superfish software hijacks encrypted Web sessions no matter which browser someone uses. Worse yet, certificate pinning in Google Chrome will do nothing to alert users that something is amiss. As Google points out in a post explaining certificate pinning, the mechanism isn't set up to validate certificates chained to a private anchor, such as a root certificate installed in the operating system of the connecting device. "A key result of this policy is that private trust anchors can be used to proxy (or MITM) connections, even to pinned sites," the Google page warned. "'Data loss prevention' appliances, firewalls, content filters, and malware can use this feature to defeat the protections of key pinning."		...		Superfish presumably installs the root certificates so it can inject ads into encrypted Web pages. By many people's standards, that's bad. But adware that breaks HTTPS connections and may make users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that are trivial to carry out is orders of magnitude worse.		http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"wharpudding","name":"t1_coqo78p","parent_id":"t1_coqipxn","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1424376299,"created_utc":1424376299}

There's no "would you also like X" checkboxes because that's not how you install things on iOS, and programs can't affect other programs' memory because that's not how iOS is works, and you can't install programs from anywhere other than the app store and they get checked for that sort of thing.  There is a rare program which sneaks through the process and has something malicious, and it gets pulled pretty quickly.  And it can't affect any other program's memory and has to ask for your explicit permission to access your contacts, location, microphone, etc. anyway.

{"body":"TL;DR: New Lenovo notebook, Avast free will fix the entirety of this problem.		Just a quick PSA: I just purchased a higher end Lenovo notebook last month.		A lot of sources have claimed that aside from running a clean install, there is no true way to fix your computer of this certificate breach. 		***THIS IS NOT TRUE***		I noticed this problem immediately when I received my laptop, but didn't have to take very many steps to rectify the issue, apparently including the certificate breach. 		I was looking to try new Anti-Virus software with this notebook, so I went with Avast. I can say with certainty at this point that the software completely removed my issues, and did so rather easily. 	It just important to note, that when you have first installed Avast or use any other anti-virus that lets you, you need to run a scan at start up to make sure it can hit every single thing on your computer. 		I haven't suffered any malware since, and after using a few test sites for the certificate breach, I seem to be in the clear, completely.  		I really hope this can help somebody else too if need be. 		I also don't think Lenovo did this on purpose. Almost every laptop manufacturer will install adware and bloatware, but I don't think they knew about this vulnerability. Apparently nobody else did either, until now, so I'm not sure you can blame them. I am definitely satisfied with their product and will continue to support them in the future.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Matthemus","name":"t1_coqopt7","parent_id":"t3_2wezbk","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1424377032,"created_utc":1424377032}
