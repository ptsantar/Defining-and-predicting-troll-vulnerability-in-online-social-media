{"body":"Fun story, in Puerto Rico a military base was abandoned. In only a few decades nature had done it's thing and built a tropical forest in it. It's now a preserve of sorts that gets quite a few tourists. 		In a awesome "f*ck you concrete" there's even a dirt/mulch of sorts over where the streets were that plants use to grow. From what I understood it was made out of falling leaves. Trees by roads grow, drop leaves on the road, leaves rot, they form a layer for other plants to grow, the plants drop more leaves deeper in the road, and so on. 		Many trees have roots that expand sideways instead of downward since they can't dig through concrete. 		It's spooky to see because it makes it so obvious how fast nature will get over us.","depth":0,"score":940,"ups":940,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Virreinatos","name":"t1_csb5l69","parent_id":"t3_3ab536","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434665073,"created_utc":1434661473}

{"body":"Lots and lots of reasons.  Tell me about where you're from and I'll give you a local example...like a part of a state or something in the US.  This is my favorite kind of science.  		Plants work together in various ways with animals and natural disturbance.  There are different ways to measure plant diversity.  These involve a lot of math.  Ecology is weird, and most people don't realize that.  I had to learn a few programming languages, lots of chemistry, numerous calc based physics classes past the basics, I'm really, really good at plant ID (never took a class on it ever), I can weld/tinker/fix anything like a maintenance man, etc.  I'm only explaining this so you get kind of how complicated it is to figure these things out and how there really isn't a right or wrong, yes or no answer to your question.  I like to joke that I farm nature.  I'm still happiest walking around somewhere I spent a lot of time fixing up with a hoe and a sprayer going ape shit on some non native plants.  		A good example that would be known fairly internationally (by image at least) would be turning a cornfield into a tallgrass prairie.  Think little house on the prairie style.    When it's replanted, the plant community is different and the plants grow differently.  If the seeds aren't what is known as local ecotype, they will grow differently.  The last I knew in the literature, no one knew why the common native grasses when replanted grow taller than they do in the natural areas.  I'm dorky and hope it's a micronutrient from the ag rotations, but nitrogen or something else is probably more likely.  		If you plant it and do nothing, it will turn into shit.  Weedy trees will grow up.  If you burn it every year, you will end up with nothing but grass.  It is best to graze it in different ways (I'm kind of dumbing this down here), and have fire.  		If that sounds simple, realize the native Americans used fire to their advantage when it came to survival.  So, is anthropogenic fire natural?  		That got way longer than you probably wanted, but I hope I inspired you to learn some cool things.  I actually told the lady friend (who does something ecology related and cool), about an ecosystem that was 40 miles from where she grew up that she didn't know about.  		In the forests across the US, worms from Europe and Asia have actually really messed up the understory.  Most of the trees have been selectively harvested and are now too little and too thick, and also full of invasive trees.  If you turn stuff into a park with no management it's almost as bad as doing things like clear cutting as far as a biodiversity standpoint goes.  Many of the native ecosystems around the world need fire.  Shit just doesn't grow back.  		If you're from Europe...I don't even know where to begin.  A lot of stuff over there is really messed up and will never be anything close to what it was (based on what I know and have seen with my own eyes).","depth":5,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nomadicbohunk","name":"t1_csbm6dd","parent_id":"t1_csbf04o","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434698207,"created_utc":1434694607}

{"body":"The piedmont!  That's pretty varied.  I actually almost took a project working in bottomland forests in the piedmont of north or south carolina (I don't remember for sure).  Once you get east of about Illinois, I don't know nearly as much ecology.  However, this is all a pretty educated guess and would be fairly accurate.  If you're curious, look up the EPA ecosystem maps for a good idea of what should be around in your specific area.  		Alright, I'm generalizing here, but you had areas of bottomland forest, upland forest, upland mesic (wet) prairies, etc.  That's a cool area.  Fire worked to drive that system.  Where fire could go, you'd have grasslands and savannas.  I really don't know the plants there, but I'm making a very educated guess there are plants there that need fire to reproduce.  It's also been changed so long, that if you just let an area go, it wouldn't grow back well because the seedbed isn't there.  I also believe there are bands of different soils that contain odd things where now very rare plants grew.  Sort of like the Serpentine belts of CA.  		With the bottomland forests, they'd be dependent on flooding.  I'm guessing many of the rivers, etc are dammed, so you no longer have that flooding providing habitat for certain species of trees to reproduce in, birds to nest in, etc.  		I hope that explains a little more.  You asked a really good question that you could take lots of classes on, work with a lot, and still not grasp well.  		Basically, if you turn it into a park and do nothing, it's shit.  You have to manage it.  		It's pretty wild how varied this stuff is.  I was actually at a state's historical society the other day.  One of the things I was doing was looking for historical photos taken in a specific area of a specific county.  I wanted an idea of what the area formerly looked like  You'd be very surprised how delicate a lot of these places are.  I worked with a project in an undisturbed area where I'd take photos taken around the turn of the century and find exactly where they were taken to look at the plants.  The photos looked the same because the plants had hardly grown.  Even some of the tallgrass prarie species most people would see as weeds will live over 50 years.  		One thing you've probably rheard about would be the longleaf pine forests.  If you haven't, read up on them.

In the late 60s, when the Soviets and Chinese clashed, the situation was even worse for the PLA. China may have been able to win some sort of victory through sheer weight of numbers, but it would be an incredibly costly one, and their chance of totally defeating the USSR would have been next to zero, unless they could also prompt a NATO invasion from the west, which is unlikely, as not only was NATO not on good terms with the Chinese at the time, but the Soviet nuclear arsenal would give them pause.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pronhaul2012","name":"t1_csbe0ct","parent_id":"t1_csb7xqp","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434680066,"created_utc":1434676466}

Military spending has gone up because inflation has forced the value of money to go down. This is easily the biggest misconception people have. We still spend a very large amount of money on the military, but it's proportionally far less than when we were actually at war. Besides that, the entire concept of a "permanent war economy," as stated from that article, was conceptualized over 70 years ago.

The fact that you take a political term (corporate welfare) as a real fact and actual process is what really sets this argument back. If you knew the actual context behind this term instead of reading the definition and deciding that it fit your world view, you'd see it for what it is: a political buzzword Ralph Nader himself created to criticize corporations, specifically agricultural ones, as they still receive some of the most subsidization. It has no basis in military spending. Defense subsidies go towards R&D and veterans funds, neither of which involve some cartoonishly evil CEO lining his pockets with cash.

Many of these companies are global, such as Glock or Herstal. They maintain factories in multiple countries, much of the time outside of the United States. The United States government still buys from these companies, but in doing so they don't promote growth of the US economy.

{"body":"Military spending by percent of GDP is relevant because it shows what portion of the total GDP was spent rather than a sheer cash figure. Figures in amount of money spent, even if adjusted for inflation, are misleading because they do not take into account the proportional change that has occurred. Normally this would not be relevant, but seeing as your argument was that the US is spending more or the same as they did during the Cold War, it is very much the case. Spending $526 billion on a $3.5 trillion budget as it was in [2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/budget.pdf) is extremely different from spending [~$550 billion](http://www.cfr.org/defense-budget/trends-us-military-spending/p28855) on a [$918](http://federal-budget.insidegov.com/l/46/1944) billion budget as it was in 1944. 		To your second point, all I can say is 'duh.' What I meant in saying that was that things cost more as time goes on, and as military spending rises [**so did everything else**](http://monevator.monevator.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/RealGDP.png). We went from spending roughly 50% of the yearly revenue on defense, to nearly 60% at the height of the Cold War, down to the current total of about 1/5 of the budget.		Concepts do grow *incorrect* with age when the person creating them has no way of knowing the world we would eventually live in.  His opinion is so unbelievably biased that I don't know how it merited a Wikipedia article. He literally created his theory in what was by far the time of the greatest US military expenditures, and then said that all future expenditures would follow suit. And he was *wrong*! It's a product of the times if there ever was one. 		"Corporate welfare" is a political term used to slam corporations without any real background. As I said, it has no place in the defense industry at all, as most military spending does not just go magically into the companies' hands. 		>And lots of huge, unnecessary procurment programs.		Ok, you understand. But they don't all go into procurement programs. Which is a nasty-sounding name for what is really "buying more military supplies." This could be anything from a tanker full of M-16s to a dozen radar dishes. And this may surprise you, but money given to countries in the Middle East such as Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, etc. are marked as military expenditures. While it can be argued that these expenses are unnecessary, they aren't just being used to buy weapons for the police forces in these countries. They're also being used to finance the new ~~puppet~~ governments in these countries so that groups like Al-Qaeda can't take them again. Besides that, much of the budget goes to the over 1,000 US military bases, usually for simple things like food, and salary/healthcare for the soldiers. Not every dollar goes into buying a new stealth fighter. If that was the case, we'd have the most of everything: tanks, boats, etc. But we don't. We have the most of *a lot* of things, believe me, but we don't have the most of everything, and we don't have much of a lead on the things we do have. As can be seen [here](http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=Russia) Russia has nearly double the amount of tanks as the United States, which is pretty shocking seeing as their budget is **a lot** lower than the US's. China also has more tanks than the US, and a larger Navy by amount of ships (but you can't measure the value of 10 aircraft carriers compared to the next highest 2).

Of course, the arsenal could be enlarged using French and British know-now (i.e. to 100 warheads in Britain, 100 in the UK and 200-300 stationed across the EU), France & the UK would still pay less while maintaining the same deterrent effect.		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union#Economies_of_member_states		> 	> I should clarify that for the UK at least, their nuclear missile based on their Vanguard[2] submarines are not to be used except in the case of a threat to the British Isles themselves.

Over 38% of **all** Nato personnel are US soldiers, which is extremely over-representative compared to the <1% of NATO troops contributed by Belgium. European countries are beginning to transfer military spending to social policies. Since the Cold War, the United States has been the main line of defense in Europe from any possible Russian threat. There are around [116,000 US military personnel in hundreds of military installations in Europe, some 75,000 of which are in Germany](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-worldwide-network-of-us-military-bases/5564) not to mention hundreds of US nuclear bombs in [Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_sharing). The 75,000 active [US troops in Germany alone is larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO) than the active armed forces of [18 NATO member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel) (not even their NATO contributions, this is their ***total*** active military).		Of the 26 (25 if you don't count Turkey) NATO member states in Europe, only a handful of them are even capable of defending themselves should war be declared on them (these being France, Germany, the UK, and Poland, likely a few more but these four stand the best chance). Most European nations simply don't have powerful armed forces anymore. The Baltic nations, for instance, spend less than $1.5 billion annually on defense and have a combined active military of less than 40,000 (info taken from the annual military budgets and active personnel of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). Seeing as these are likely some of the first targets that would be attacked in any event of military danger from Russia, they're an important first line of defense. But they're completely incapable of protecting themselves. 		And even countries such as Italy, Spain, or Poland, which have high amounts of manpower, the US military's contribution is far more valuable. [Donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2x8ol6/us_gifts_military_equipment_to_poland/) and sales of IFVs, weapons, and trucks pour into Eastern Europe every year.

Edit: I'm not trying to s*** all over European militaries. I'm saying that the US covers their defensive needs so that they can spend more money on social policies. And that's not a bad thing. Way I hear it, many countries, such as Belgium, have a really high standard of living. That wouldn't be possible without [10~20 US nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons) that tell any other country to leave them alone. Obviously Belgium isn't in any sort of immediate danger from any neighbors, but it allows them to spend less on military and more on other affairs, such as healthcare.

Depending on the cause of the ride, you have 1.2 to 1.5 passengers sitting in each car. So you constantly have to move around 1.4 tonnes of metal and plastic (on avg.) To move 70 to 120 kg.

I think the first step would be trying to change the mindset of the people to the concept of: "using instead of owning" translated to cars that means car sharing which existed a long time here in Germany but got a bit of traction because BMW and Daimler entered that field.		That said I think smaller, lighter and more efficient cars need to be incentivised, probably by heavy tax cuts.		Then we need to improve the public transportation system and make it preferribly free to use.		Adapt the Netherlands and Denmarks model of bicycle traffic.		Just a few things.

{"body":"If it helps you somehow, this solution wasn't exactly intended and you Bristish guys played a major role in it.		I actually was involved in the whole decission. Or to be exact, i consulted the people who had to make the decission. So my role wasn't nearly important enough to claim any influence on the outcome. I just investigated facts for the party which tried to make *"green solution"* possible.	The government would have prefered the *Industrial park solution* you mentioned any times. And they tried a long time to get it done. The problem is, that nobody really wants the land. Or to be exact, nobody wanted to pay enough money.	There is a government agency called BIMA, which is responsible for selling the land. The problem is, that they *A* aren't allowed to sell it cheaper than the actual value, *B* aren't allowed to pay for (often enormous) contamination; and *C* always have to prefer charitable plans, which are good for the public, nature etc.	It was nearly impossible to sell much of the land, especially training areas. They had multiple investors, but couldn't sell. The land was often a "no admission area" and sometimes secret, so an enormous amount of it was claimed back by the nature and protected species.	At the end, politicians didn't have much of a choice, than to say "Well, shit. We fucked that up. Let's just say we did it for the planet."	So of course the laws are pretty good to prevent missuse and there is a large amount of supporters of nature reserves. But at the end, we would have sold it in a heartbeat, if someone would have offered enough money.		As i mentioned, the impulse to the research work (and my project job) came, because of your *2020 British forces withdrawal*. Without it, we most likely wouldn't have discussed the case for some more years. You wouldn't believe how much land you guys *own* here. And by the way, the locals usually want your soldiers to stay.
