If you start limiting/restricting it, you will make a small class of elite corporations that have found illegal/cunning ways of influencing elections and they will be victorious.

They do favor the cunning murderers. Which is why we have whole divisions of FBI that hunt serial killers and offer millions of dollars for the most cunning offenders.		The thing is, murder is always bad. So any reduction in murder == positive. So banning murder makes sense.		However, lobbying isn't always bad. Any reduction of lobbying is not positive, it can be negative. It can help the competition: the more cunning corporations.

Where we disagree in principle is that any amount of lobbying is good. I disagree strongly. Voting should be a matter of votes, not money.

They are forced to restrict the right to free speech because that is essentially what all the money the "elite" are using their money on: multiplying their speech (creating marketing for their favorite candidates, or damaging reputations of their hated candidates).		Either way, it is unequivocally the worst idea to go more restrictive on campaign laws. It's much better to use all your energy/efforts on educating the public during elections so that they always make the right decisions in politics.		Imagine if there were governmental organizations that showed public service ads telling people the facts about candidates. That would have a much bigger effect than trying to suppress free speech of organizations running political commercials.		Voting is all that matters. All the money is used for is to convince more voters. Therefore, the only way to stop the money, is to start restricting free speech.

{"body":"Money is used to buy more advertisement. By creating campaign finance laws, you are in essence restricting free speech. It's the same thing. Use your logic here.		If you restrict money given to a candidate, what have you accomplished? They'll just give it to a superPAC instead. What will the superPAC do? It will run advertisements for the candidate or attack ads against another candidate..........		So what exactly has your campaign finance law of restricting donations done? Just about ZILCH. 		So then, you still BADLY want to restrict money's influence on elections, so the only thing you can do: regulate free speech. Start censoring ads. Start disallowing people to form organizations (right of assembly). Start disallowing people to put money in things they want to put it in. Start disallowing people to say certain words in TV commercials because they could influence elections.		Now do you see how this idiotic idea, thought of by people who can't think outside-the-box, called "campaign finance laws", is actually completely pointless? It just "feels like we did something!", but really you accomplished nothing. And once you start regulating advertisements, then it becomes a matter of: you oppressing peoples' right to free speech and assembly.		>If people, and groups, were not allowed to pay directly to candidates, they would still have the freedom to buy advertising space to express their views, and so their right to be heard would not be affected.		Right but then your definition of campaign finance is different from everyone else. You see, people on reddit, want laws to restrict free speech, to stop influence of money on elections.

Anyway, I don't know if my position is different from other people here on Reddit. I'm here to put forth and defend my ideas, not other people's ideas.		On a practical level, you are saying that if individuals aren't allowed to donate, they form "super pacs" to donate. This assumes a lot about how the system would work that I haven't proposed. What I believe to be a sensible system which would strictly only allow limited individual donations, so any grouping is prohibited. Also, it the politicians would be equally prohibited from *receiving* donations above a certain level from individuals, so they are equally motivated to not allow anyone to manipulate the system.		But the practicalities can always be nitpicked. The principle of the matter is that I don't see any problem with restricting what people spend money on. People are not allowed to buy tanks, nuclear weapons, make bribes, purchase shares in companies they have inside information on, hire hit men or mercenaries, purchase certain drugs for resale... purchasing things is not an expression of free speech it's simply reallocation of resources and there are already many restrictions. Buying political favour should be part of that.		Lastly, politicians do become beholden to those who donate, which is why there is a market for it, and why it's a problem. The whole point of campaign financing is to use money to leverage politicians into backing bills that the financier favours. It is a facet of lobbyism, which in my view, is simply institutionalized corruption.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"anonradditor","name":"t1_csj007i","parent_id":"t1_csihxbt","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1435289968,"created_utc":1435286368}

Why would anyone form a corporation? To build things like iPhones, to offer services like selling pizza, to create infrastructure like bridges, to pool resources for research into new ideas... individuals come together to make these things because it's either inefficient or impossible for any one individual to get together and make the products and services that make the world we live in as advanced and comfortable as it is.

Fundamentally, a corporation is not a sentient entity of it's own right, and so it should not have the rights that sentient beings have.

They can do that as a group of individuals hiring each other as business partners. 		>People form corporations for the purpose that corporations serve: profit.		You are mistaken. Individuals grouping together can do exactly what your definition of corporation does. Individuals grouping together can make profit and split the profit without having a corporation. They don't need to incorporate. They don't need a corporation to do what you defined. Your definition of corporation is wrong.		A corporation is a protected legal entity, that allows individuals acting under that legal entity, to have MORE rights than as individuals. They have the right to free speech, plus they have the privilege not to be sued for all their property except for those that are corporate owned. If you are sued as an individual for your business actions, then you can lose your house. If you are sued as a corporation for your business actions, your corporation loses its funds but that's it. You are protected. This is why people form corporations instead of doing business without incorporating.		As you can see, you have the rights of an individual + PLUS + the rights of a corporation.		Otherwise, why ever form a corporation? Just do it as individuals in a secret society.		So it's not a trade-off. A guy forming a corporation does not lose some of his rights when acting as a corporation vs acting as an individual. It is a net-positive to form a corporation, otherwise no one would form one.		Even if you magically forced corporations NOT to be able to donate to politicians. Then individuals within a corporation will do it anyway. It will have the same result. The second you say "no no... I will make sure they aren't working for a corporation then."

You say, and have said many times, that corporations do have the rights of an individual, plus the rights of a corporation. However, just because they currently do does not mean that they always should, or that this is especially necessary. My argument is not about what is, it's about what should be, which can change. A few years ago, gays could not marry, now they can. Progress happens, and I am talking about what can be, not what is. Constantly telling me how things are will not sway me in any way. I am only interested in a logical explanation as to why the current way is better than possible alternatives.		You answer your own questions about why people should form corporations and not simply hire each other as groupings of individuals, for example because corporations can be liable for wrong doing in a way that protects individuals from undue financial burdens. So we are agreed that corporations provide a lot of purpose and legal structure that help people get things done in a way they couldn't before, which is something I've said before, so your claim that my definition of a corporation is wrong is simply more of your consistent attempts to redirect the argument at me and away from the topic.		All we are arguing about here is just *one* facet of corporate power, we're not arguing about the entirety of everything corporations can and should not do. That one thing is whether or not corporations should have any ability to fund politicians in their name, separate from the individuals in it.		Corporations are just the extension of people who make decisions about them. A bakery does not make decisions, the person who owns that bakery does. So, if a bakery donates to a political party, that is the act of the person who runs the bakery. That person already has a vote, and, under what I would deem a sensible system, the ability to make political donations as an individual. If the bakery "donates" anything, then that is actually the person who owns the bakery making that decision, meaning they are exerting more influence than other people. That's anti-democratic. Further, the profits the bakery has is made by the aggregate of all the people working there, and most of those people will not be involved in the owner's decision to donate on behalf of the bakery. So a person who was hired to roll dough just so he or she can make a living is now unwittingly providing resource to parties he or she may not agree with. That's even less democratic.		When it comes down to it, I don't really care if we're talking about corporations, churches, unions, super pacs, secret cults, social clubs, or anything. I believe that only individuals should be allowed to donate, and to donate a maximum amount. The other problem with aggregate donations from groups is that it obscures where politicians are being funded from. In a sensible system, every donation would be linked to an individual, and that information would be transparent. However, bickering over details on exactly how political donations could be curbed is just bickering over hypotheticals.		The important point is, the less money in politics, the better, and the more we can do to get there, whatever shape it takes, the better.		Now, if you want to convince me of anything, tell me why donating money into politics, whether from corporations or anyone else, is better than keeping money out. Not just because that's "the way it is".

{"body":"Sorry, but you're wrong about the Nazis.

Also, Bill Gates had a million dollar trust fund from his grandfather, which is not unusual as most of the rich are the beneficiaries of situations that are advantageous. All the ones you list are white males born into middle class or higher regions of the US.

Also, celebrities, which you dismiss, are playing the game you exalt. You can't have it both ways, to claim that rich people are rich because they are examples of the meritocracy of the system, but simply dismiss everyone you think is rich and stupid as being exceptions. Kim Kardashian is a winner of the current system, and that says something about the system that you can't merely disregard because she adds no value to society.		This debate is getting expansive, and by extension, nitpicky and tedious. What we started out with is whether or not politics and money should mingle, and I still don't believe there is a compelling argument for it. You've tried to make the claim that people with money are better somehow, and that seems thoroughly unconvincing, as it is not clear that the people who are winning emerged from an even playing field in the first place, and of those who are winning, I could easily name as many stupid, obstructionis, or bigoted people for every positive example you might.		I believe every effort should be made to remove money from politics. I won't be convinced against that by claiming that's not possible because I don't think we can know how possible it is until we try.

{"body":">They are the elite class. They are the smarter ones. They are the more educated ones. There ARE many exceptions to this.		So many exceptions that they aren't "exceptions" anymore. I think we've hit the core of our disagreement. I see too much counter evidence to the claim that "smart" and "rich" correlate. Also, "smart" and "good for society" don't necessarily correlate, it is entirely possible to be smart and a terrible person. Similarly, other qualities, like "Rich" and "progressive" don't correlate. I just do not believe, as you do, that being rich is evidence of anything other than simply an ability to accrue resources in the current environment. It definitely does not correlate to political views that should have influence on our society.		Richness only correlates to the ability to accrue wealth in the current circumstances, nothing more, nothing less. Change the circumstances, and the people who succeed now will find their skills rendered irrelevant. I not only believe a change in circumstance is possible, I believe history is definitively a constant flow of changing circumstance. It could get worse or better, but it will almost certainly change.		I do agree with one statement of yours, that we're closer to meritocracy than we were 80 years ago, and arguably closer to true democracy than any other time in history. I just don't think we're anywhere near done yet.		Thanks for the debate, but it's time to recognize that we agree to disagree. I certainly don't want to get bogged down in tangential details like what constitutes a "majority" in Germany 80 years ago and that kind of thing. I'm just not convinced by anything you have presented, as you seem to be unconvinced by my side. If there's ever a vote to remove money from politics in any way, I will vote in favour of that, just as you may vote otherwise. Only time will tell which way prevails.

So, figure you're a married couple, and you make $50,000 between the two of you. You'll pay about $1,800 in income taxes, and if you spend $20,000 on sales items, you'll pay another $1,300 in sales taxes. Or, in total, you're paying roughly 6.25% taxation.		Edit: That's 6.25% taxation, and you're getting almost ZERO services in return for it. The states so fucking broke that we recently had a massive conflict with the judicial system over the school system. I.e. the schools were 100% broke, so much so they were going to have to shut down. The state judicial system stepped in and basically forced payments to the schools on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. This pissed off the Governor who in retaliation severely fucked the state supreme court by denying them the ability to appoint state judges anymore. And in order to stop the Supreme Court from fighting that, they added a legislative stipulation stating that if the Kansas Supreme Court ruled the Executives over reaching unconstitutional, that the state would cut 100% of all funding to the entire state Judicial system. 		Yes, that's right. If the Super Court fought back against the unconstitutional over reaching of powers, the over reachers of power would further over reach and cut all power entirely from the state Judicial branch.

{"body":"Hi I'm a Kansan, there are a lot of issues going on in the state right now. Kansas has traditionally been a republican state. The last time we had elected a democrat to a national position was during the depression and even that was just one election. The Republican party in the state has traditionally been a fairly moderate group, but like many places in U.S. over the last few decades the culture warriors began to take over the states republican party. This led to the election of one of our former senators Sam Brownback to the governorship.		 When he was elected he decided that Kansas needs an overhaul of the tax laws in the state. He did this by getting our state legislature to pass obscene tax cuts for the wealthiest (Koch Brothers) and Corporations and slashing social benefits in the state promising that this would bring jobs and make Kansas a model of how government should be run. While doing all of this he also decided to cut education spending in the state as well. Our state constitution requires that public schools be properly funded and since they weren't our state supreme court stepped in and told them they had to fund the schools. This caused an out roar across the state and those who didn't back the governor 100% (ie the moderates) were ousted in primaries across the state and replaced with far right candidates who would back the governor.		 While all of this was going on it quickly began to become clear that the tax cuts they had just passed weren't working in fact they caused a projected $648 million budget deficit for the state. This forced our state legislators to create a new budget, but there was a fight on how this should be done. So, as the legislator was fighting over the budget they passed a law that says if the supreme court rules in favor of properly funding the schools then the judiciary budget for the state will be eliminated. Governor Brownback then went on to bully the state legislature into passing a budget that will increase be the largest tax increase in the states history through the regressive sales tax instead of reinstating the taxes that had been cut for the wealthiest and corporations. This all was in the last month and to add to it all our jobless rates across the state continue to increase. 		TLDR; State elects right wing government, right wing government slashes taxes for the rich, state has budget problems, state elects even further right government, government bullies state courts to get way, government bullies state legislators to pass largest tax increase in state history but only on poor, You get $600 million budget deficit and high job loss. 	edit: My mistake the judiciary budget fight is over the fact that the governor wants our supreme court to be stripped of power to instill chief judges of lower state courts. 	edit: Interestingly I just came across [this](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/barbara-shelly/article24652759.html)","depth":6,"score":94,"ups":94,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gibbenskd","name":"t1_csglret","parent_id":"t1_csgj4pf","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1435113951,"created_utc":1435110351}

Unions can only function as they're supposed to when they grant political influence proportionate to their membership.

Unions aren't big money, though. Union funding is composed of many smaller contributions, and is indicative of their size - and it's telling that this produces significant amounts even though unions in the US are weaker than they've been in decades.		On the other hand, trying to remove money altogether from the system is certainly legit.

If you can do things, have skills and/or can learn...you have a job.  If you expect any business, left or right, to create busywork to keep you employed that's just silly. There is very little money for nothing opportunities.  		I got my hours massively whacked because our service department took a big hit when  the 2.3% increased medical device excise tax hit the big boys and they jacked up their prices by up to 5% to cover the costs.  Over half of these companies are non-us based.  Making $3000 repairs into $7-10k repairs meant hospitals are shelving defective equipment until service is required by law, rather than getting it up and running at that time.  Would be risky out of a job if I didn't know how to do website creation and maintenance.  		Edit- what I should have said instead of generic layoffs is that until recently Republicans primarily stick to seeking advantage *without* going as far as trying to hobble the opposition and cause layoffs.  This drastically changed and became very visible with the anti solar campaign.  Do you have any idea how many decades democrats have been trying to tax anything they don't like out of existence while simultaneously stating that the funds collected should be given to democrat agenda items?  Like petroleum and solar.  I actual like solar power and don't own a car personally.  Public transit.  But just because I like solar doesn't mean I condone theft by government to benefit one party and the things it is financially invested in.  Like carbon tax.  Setting environmental things aside, how does giving money to democrats help the environment?  Does Al Gore take the carbon in his hands and poof it away magically when you give him a dollar?  No.  It's an emotionally pandering shakedown designed to take from one ideology sectto give to another sect that's just as bad.  You can not like fracking and also not like the solution as well.

{"body":">There's a very distinct difference between voodoo economics and saying that corporations (which I don't particularly like. I worked for Wally world for a bit) being able to spend money to benefit the corporation won't benefit the employees.		I think you're missing the point. Corporations spend money to benefit the corporation, which often has the added bonus of not being bad for the employees. Sure, maybe they can hire more employees or enhance their services for the public good if their successful lobbying ensures they don't have to pay large fines for manipulative business practices. But chances are their increased profitability simply means that management is better paid, and/or they increase what they have in the coffers.		The fact is, if corporate lobbying put the interests of employees' before the interests of the investors/shareholders, we wouldn't even be having this discussion because there would be no problem. Unfortunately that isn't the case. The public would benefit more if our laws regarding lobbying favored corporations less.		>I don't think that eliminating one big spender and catering to another will have the Utopian effect people think		I'm not sure you've read much about how corporate and union lobbying differ, but I believe it is suffice to say that the amount spent by corporations for this purpose exceeds the amount spent by unions for the same purpose by several orders of magnitude. Plus, there is the fact that that the interests of unions don't favor a further increase of wealth inequality.		>One corrupt body is not preferable to two corrupt bodies who can cancel each other out.

So in that case it's pretty fair in my opinion for unions to be allowed to donate to their own party (or other parties if their members choose).

{"body":"Alberta has historically been the most conservative province in Canada, with the Conservative party holding a majority there for the last 40 years. The drop in oil really screwed them over though, a huge portion of the province's budget comes from taxes on oil revenue and with the oil companies making a lot less suddenly the province was several billion dollars in the red. Instead of banking some of the money for hard times in the past few decades, the Conservative government had been cutting taxes and had literally been mailing cheques to Albertans, so they had no really emergency fund to fall back on either.		All of this led the government to table a new, and extremely unpopular, budget. They did away with a lot of the tax cuts, cut government jobs, and increased taxes on a lot of products like gas, alcohol, and cigarettes. They cancelled spending on new hospitals and lowered education spending, however there were no corporate taxes added whatsoever, which a lot of people were extremely upset over. Jim Prentice, the Premier of Alberta at the time, was also criticized for his "deal with it" attitude when it came to answering questions about the budget and tax increases, and generated a fair amount of fury after telling Albertan's to "look in the mirror" to find who was responsible for the province's financial woes.		So with all of this leading up to a provincial election the Conservatives were already on shaky ground. Things were exacerbated by the fact that the right is split between the Wildrose Party and the Conservative Party in Alberta, with each party stealing voters from each other, so even the hardcore right will count for less because they are voting for two parties. The left is traditionally split between the NDP and the Liberals, but while I didn't follow the election particularly closely while it was going on, I understand that the Liberals didn't have a strong showing while the NDP did, which mostly eliminated the split in the left.  I also understand that Rachel Notley, the new Premier and leader of the NDP during the election, kicked everyone's asses during the debates. In the end the NDP won a majority of seats giving them total control over the government of Alberta, with no need to compromise with other parties, while the Wildrose Party came in second, the Conservative party in third with just ten seats (where they had over 70 in the last election), and the Liberals behind all of them with a single seat.","depth":5,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Wulfger","name":"t1_csgl3q6","parent_id":"t1_csgk05h","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1435112720,"created_utc":1435109120}

The best that people were hoping for in this last election was a minority government to kind of teach the powers that be to play nice.

{"body":"Universities have definitely got major issues with how they're spending their money. And I agree with you that the overall educational mission at Canadian universities has taken a beating.		But, the problem of outpaced growth and securing more funding is by and large a symptom of their problems, not necessarily a cause of it. 		For example, in Ontario, for every *new* dollar invested in education since 2004 (due to higher enrollment, provincial funding increases, and tuition increases), roughly half went to increasing salaries and pensions for *already existing* faculty members (and senior administrators, though there are still significantly fewer of them). Meanwhile, the average professor actually teaches *fewer* classes than ever before. Faculty unions for tenure-track faculty (not adjunct/sessionals) are slow-bleeding universities dry, thereby harming their own mission.		This, and other rising costs, have forced Canadian universities to enter into this rat-race of expanding enrollment while keeping costs (i.e. faculty members) low, and so quality for the average undergraduate student suffers. Another symptom: average undergrad class sizes have increased year after year.","depth":4,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spenceman91","name":"t1_csgqv1w","parent_id":"t1_csgkumm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1435124070,"created_utc":1435120470}

But the reality is, costs go up all the time, and when that happens they do the only reasonable thing and raise prices or suffer under lower profits. So the reasonable choice is to raise prices.		So of the businesses who pay minimum wage, they will have to raise prices.  Since non minimum wage people often shop at minimum wage businesses, that is how people who make more pay for the minimum wage. 		The net effect is that the entire population who earns above minimum wage is squeezed down a little bit, and the entire bottom of the workforce is risen up.

{"body":"> modern democracy		As a European, that's not how I would describe the democracy in the U.S, especially party financing.		Where I live, the amount a party is allowed to spend on a campaign is limited, as is the time-span they're allowed to campaign. The party financing system here is also far from perfect (where the Belgian government finances almost 88% of all political parties apparently) - but companies and rich people have far less influence over political issues. This is not only due to how the financing works, but also due to the fact that we have a democracy encouraging more than 2 parties, always resulting in coalitions, where compromises must me made to protect the interests of multiple parties. Sure that also has it's downsides, but the big money does not control the political system as much, and the interests of more people shape the decision-making.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"koffiezet","name":"t1_csgxn3g","parent_id":"t1_csgcguz","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1435148202,"created_utc":1435144602}

Look at Chicago....$14,000 in annual taxes on a 2800 sq. ft. house is the norm here, and it's mostly due to pensions and other benefits negotiated by government workers' unions.  With respect to corporate labor unions, negotiating higher-than-market wages can have a negative impact on the business so much that it strangles it (look at Detroit).  When corporations have too much power, the policies favor the owners, screwing the people directly.  When unions have too much power, the policies favor the employees, screwing the owners/shareholders, which eventually can cause the business to fail, hurting the employees and suffocating the surrounding economy.

{"body":"Although it sounds great in principle, it turns out pretty poorly in practice.		The Canadian federal government has banned corporate and union donations for almost 15 years.  The result was an almost entirely defunding of the Liberal Party (most dominant party in the country) and a very highly valued Conservative party.  This has given the current ruling party a massive advantage due to the grassroots nature of the party.		This has caused the corporations that once funded the Liberal Party to form Political Actions Committees (PACs).  The first one was PC Premier Danny Williams ABC (Anything But Conservative), Project Democracy, and the longstanding #StopHarper PAC.  Most recently they've added in [Engage Canada](http://www.notthereforyou.ca/) which is being run by former Liberal Party members of parliament and a new Conservative one [HarperPAC](http://harperpac.ca/) which is dedicated to illustrating a Pro-Harper message.		Regulations have tried to limit how much these sorts of organizations can advertise during an actual election, but the months leading up to the election before it is officially called (an election has to be called one month of the government dissolving) are all fair game.		The inevitable result is going to be seeing more and more PACs and Super PACs in Canada.

Or even visiting. You don't seem to have a clear idea of Alberta's social values nor history. 		The liberals were the ruling party from 1905 till 1917. Then they got turfed hard.

Also pretty lefty.		>The United Farmers government initiated several reforms, including improving medical care, labour rights and fairer taxes.

You are noting the names of these parties, right? The SC were not conservative in a modern sense, as they were not very capitalistic:		>Major C. H. Douglas (1879???1952) was an engineer by profession who created a new economic theory about the cause and solution to the problem of poverty. In Douglas???s ???A plus B theorem,??? ???A??? represented the total wages paid to the people who produced goods, while ???B??? represented the funding of production. For Douglas, ???A??? would always be less than ???B??? so that people would not be able to consume all the goods produced in their community without extra money being distributed to them ??? a system that he called ???**Social Credit**.???		Yes, that is right. Take money from the rich and give it to the poor.		This was also the party that was in power when Alberta gained its first subsidized healthcare for mothers and children. 		>In 1950, Alberta's Social Credit party also introduced a public health care plan.		That was Preston Manning's dad. Social Credit lasted 32 years total. Then they got booted by the Conservatives, who hung on for 44 or so. 		Compared to Canada as a whole...		>By January 1, 1961, when Quebec finally joined, all provinces had universal coverage for hospital care.		When the Alberta Conservatives became too stale and corrupt, we booted their asses. Again, hard.		The trend in Alberta is that you get one shot at power, and when you fuck up, you are relegated to the sidelines and the history bin. All the parties know this. 		It is the sort of fate you cannot stave off with bribes. 		The Liberals have held on since 1917, but they're not coming back. The last four elections they have fallen from 16, to 9, to 5, and now 1 seat. If they were going to make a comeback, this would have been the election, but 50% of regular conservative voters jumped all the way left to the NDP. 		They will have their four years in the sun, or maybe 40, but we'll be done with them too someday.		The conservatives fell from 61 to 10 seats. They are finished, and I expect to see a slow death, if they don't just keel over next election. They aren't used to living on breadcrumbs. 		The Wild Rose squeezed an additional 4 seats to reach 21. They might have a future. But it won't be forever either.		Political renewal via fatal axe wound to political party is a good thing.
