Obviously there must be some kind of function that for each position gives you the direction into which things get more South-y, the gradient of how far South a position is if you will.

You might want to look at how many people actually died from the measles in the USA before a measles vaccine was even available, and then get back to me.  Your statement is absurd.  You are completely out of touch with reality.  You can't look at death rates for minor diseases like measles in the third world and then infer that the USA would have similar death rates.		Measles is a very contagious disease that can cause complications. In rare cases, complications can be severe and include brain swelling which can cause death or permanent brain damage.  This is so rare that before a vaccine was available, 90% of the population got measles during their lifetime and nobody panicked when they got it.		Both of my parents had measles when they were kids.  So did everybody else they knew.  They never heard of anybody in their area dying from measles.

{"body":"I don't know of a 95% guideline, but I know a little about the smallpox campaign.  It was a huge unprecedented effort between many nations.  They didn't need to immunize every single person on the planet, they only needed to isolate those likely to contract the disease.  In extremely rural areas like Afghanistan for instance they just needed to make sure that no one in that village was a carrier.   The more people globally that were immunized, the smaller the potential pool got and they were able to keep closing in on it.  		I'm not explaining this as well as it was explained to me, but it was a truly remarkable feat.		If you could separate and treat every individual with a particular infection, you could ensure that it wasn't passed on further.  		Once you knew that one village was free from the disease, then only an outsider bringing it in could reintroduce the disease.  So if you had a lot of help, were spread out, and worked quickly you could go village to village and slowly stamp the disease out altogether.		The more rare and easier to treat, the easier this task would be.  		The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination is one of the big ones at the center of this antivax issue.  95% might be linked to the idea of 'herd immunity', which essentially is protecting an entire community by vaccinating a majority of it.  	The more that are vaccinated, the lower the chances of exposure, so there exists a tipping point where even those that are unvaccinated are still somewhat protected.  As these numbers drop, the community loses the herd immunity, and outbreaks occur (in some places for the first time in decades) and these outbreaks can be devastating.

If you send your kids to school with the children of morons, YOUR CHILDREN are at risk. The only thing preventing epidemic is that a high enough percentage are vaccinated to prevent propagation of the disease.  When the vaccination rate dips below that threshold, we get epidemics.  This is the concept of herd immunity - it's why you keep seeing these articles, and why it's still important to harp on the fucking morons choosing not to vaccinate, why it's important to consider changing the laws that coddle their stupidity.    If it were just morons and their kids getting sick, who would give a shit, right?

I fully and completely support the policy of forcing vaccinations, with the caveat that the government should give the option of the IPV instead of OPV to parents, with perhaps the cost of the injection being paid by the parents.

They appear in the journal Vaccine.			"We are trying to understand, to the maximum extent possible, how a person's individual genetic makeup affects response to vaccination," says Dr. Poland.

{"body":"Yeah see, the point is that "needs" are confused with "wants" e.g. cigarettes. They're manufactured and sold without any benefit to anyone.	The companies that you see out there, they exist to fill a need in a market - and that need is stupid. Products are not usually created to fill needs. Needs are manufactured to create products. Look at all the shit on infomercials, that's an example. A true capitalist economy would look at what are the most effective allocations of resources. For example, there is enough food to feed everyone, enough housing to house everyone, but these issues still exist. So the issue isn't "abundance" it's distribution. The problem with distribution is that some people like more than others. Even by having writing to you on this macbook in my living room on a sofa, I am living a life that is unattainable for everyone on the planet, because i use more resources than the majority of the world. I understand this. Fair and even with supplies is more important than just meeting needs of consumers because consumers aren't benevolent. The point of economics is meant to be about efficient resource allocation, but what is more efficient. Now, as to "why let a small group of people make everyone elses decisions for them", firstly, every society has required a form of organisation. If you look at societies that have no formal leadership structure, and where everyone has to enforce their own laws and fiefdoms you basically come to nations like Somalia. It may work in an enlightened society where resources are abundant and leaders and people are benevolent, but you add in complex systems, scarcity and competition for this stuff and you create the issue. 		"More and more I find myself thinking we are, as a race, constrained by the economic models we have. We have capitalism, of course, the proverbial worst model except for every other one that dominates much of our planet right now. It???s definitely a scarcity-based system. Then we have the centrally planned systems of Communism and Marxism, not particularly effective, as it turns out. We have European-style socialist capitalism, but that???s still capitalism, and scarcity-based, albeit with a much more robust safety net than we have here in the US. Some Americans seem to think that a robust safety net somehow nullifies the distributed planning of capitalism. I???ll listen to them when pan handlers are off the streets, school standards start to improve, violent crime over material goods is on the decrease."		I mean ask yourself right, why does the market reward teachers less than footballers, or wall street bankers (and people who work in them like me) more than the people who spend 6 hours a day with my daughter educating her.		What happens one day when everyone on the planet can be fed, clothed and housed by a working population of maybe 10,000,000 people and a bunch of robots?		You're going to have a lot of unemployed people, or you're going to have a lot of people who are bored, with nothing to do.		The alternative to a post scarcity economy is a pumped up version of our shitty world of unbridled consumerism with the Kardashians and Hiltons, idiocracy style. 	You see it - don't deny it.  Veblen???s conspicuous consumption goods, bling, benzes and 20 inch wheels.... When you go to the shops and you see them throwing food away while people pan handle and starve outside on the streets, the inevitable destiny of all our economies to eventually produce more than they need, and, thus, waste it.

Very true in the case of many viruses (I'm not sure about bacterial infections, I imagine it's not *too* different, though - I'm really no expert in the medical field, otherwise I'd get paid a helluva lot more), but I'm not sure if things like Polio and Measles do that or not, honestly. Or, have yet anyways. Of course there's the risk of diseases becoming stronger and more resilient to immunization and medications, but the argument has also been made that vaccines and medication actually contribute to that *more* than not vaccinating.		I can see where both sides are coming from there, but to me, it makes more sense to vaccinate anyways, because even if the disease gradually becomes immune to the vaccines, we can develop stronger doses of the immunization as is required.

Also, blatantly saying "you're an idiot, and you're wrong," often makes people even more adamant that they're right, unfortunately, even after seeing evidence to the contrary.

Absolutely, absolutely, **absolutely**, I completely agree. I'm actually for privatization of schools, but even in a Public setting, I believe schools should hold the right to reject potential students because ~~they~~ their parents refuse vaccination, *especially* now that we have online schooling across the nation as an alternative. I also believe business owners should, if it becomes an issue, check the medical/vaccination records of potential employees before hiring, if plausible. It'd be hard to just say "nobody that's unvaccinated allowed in our business" and such, as it'd be hard to prove, but it *could* shift liability issues to the customer, rather than the business, theoretically.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RenlyIsTheFury","name":"t1_cp1n0gp","parent_id":"t1_cp1mrcn","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425281128,"created_utc":1425281128}

But thankfully due to herd immunity they're still at a far lower risk than they otherwise would be.		So let's rephrase that question to reflect reality.... 		If someone comes to you and says "There's a 0.001% chance your child will suffer an advertise reaction (1/1000).

So let me break it down to you using the source you provide, now I will only use  hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/data.html  because news are fairly biased and quite frankly sensationalized, so lets go over hard facts as those presented in the pdf report from the site.		Using that list the vaccine with most concessions, that is one in which it was found that YES, the vaccine was culpable for injury or death was influenza with 73 cases in total admitted as such.		81 extra cases the court ruled in favor, but this is merely a legal ruling not a medical one. And 848 were settled, thus an agreement was reached and no medical investigation was done. For a total of 1002 cases compensated, A further 177 were thrown out and dismissed. For a grand total of 1179 cases in the span of 2006-2013. 		now during that same period of time a total of 944,000,000 were administered.		so look at the numbers this way:		73/944,000,000  so out of 944,000,000 administrations of the vaccine only 73 were found to have caused harm to patient. To put it in perspective: your chances are 1 in about 13 million.		But I decided to just do all the cases for that period of time:		170 conceded in total to having being the vaccine in question that did the damage. 164 ruled by the court, 1387 settlements and 1194 dismissed cases. For a grand total of 2915 cases in all of 2006-2013. With a grand total of 2,236,678,735 vaccines administered.		170/2,236,678,735 		Just look at that, that's insane. Even if you count all cases, all 2915 of them, 2,236,678,735 is still several orders of magnitude larger.		You'd have to be a little insane to not see it.

{"body":"> I have a background in biology.		Oh for pete's sakes. You've taken a few undergrad Bio courses, you have some friends who are studying bio, and you say you have a 'background in biology?' Sorry mate, that's got to be the most pathetic declaration I have read in months. Just had to say that - unless you've had years of real world experience actively working or researching in a field, don't bring up your undergrad 'background.'		So, you pull out some calculations, but you don't think about where the numbers actually come from. You are comparing one set of data which is necessarily incomplete, and getting a ratio by dividing by another set of numbers that is complete. This is just a measure of people who A) had a serious side effect B) could conclusively link the side effect to a specific vaccination shot and C) went to the trouble of pursuing it all the way through a burdensome and potentially expensive tribunal. It's completely erroneous to assume that this number includes every person who has had a negative effect after receiving a vaccine. The second number, however, the denominator, is a full and accurate count of total vaccines administered. So it's not very meaningful to compare the two. 		I posted that link to demonstrate that the idea that vaccines are necessarily safe is pure dogma that ignores the evidence, not as a comprehensive list of every harm that has ever occurred from a vaccination.

The United States is *waaaaaay* more bettererly equipped to handle education as well as formulate a solution that doesn't force its citizens to just blindly accept vaccinations.		I've actually had a conversation with a doctor that mentioned (this is anecdotally, of course) that parents are significantly more willing to accept a vaccination shot if they are given the choice.  If the Doctor simply says, "OK, next step: shots!"  Parents have shown to be hesitant.  It's natural that parents want to be the ones making decisions for their children, and I much more prefer that method.

{"body":"How have they "succeeded" at it? Diseases are constantly evolving and changing, and throw in the role genetics plays in it, it's impossible to measure if corporations have any role in keeping people sick and dependant. And also, if the corporations did want to keep the people sick and dependant, it would make much more sense for these companies to support the anti-vaccination movement, which causes more people to become sick and dependant (e.g. the current measles outbreak in California).		Vaccine manufacturers are protected from lawsuit because the vaccine business is already barely profitable. Based on this reasoning, corporations would rather have more people *not* take vaccinations, which would mean more people would get sick and thus buy the other drugs/medicine which the corporations sell. The vaccine business is not profitable at all for companies and the revenue generated by vaccines are small compared to the other portions of company revenue. http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/3/622.full		I know vaccines are a scary idea, having unknown chemicals injected into you.

{"body":"Humanity's population growth is largely the result of the eradication of many childhood diseases (ie. polio) as well as innovations that have decreased the infant mortality rate.  Most animals have a very high infant mortality rate due to disease and predation.  High infant/child mortality rate is extremely taxing on a species, especially on so-called k-selected species, such as ourselves. 		 K-selected species invest more time in the raising of their young, with special emphasis on learned rather than instinctual behaviors, the advantage being that protected and well-trained youths are more likely to survive to reproductive age, and thus pass on their parent's genes.  Such species tend to have few offspring. Additionally, their youths mature slowly and require substantial resource dedication from their parents.  However, if the offspring dies before it can reproduce, a great deal of resources have essentially been wasted, decreasing the odds that the parents genes will be passed on.  		The other strategy is that of r-selected species.  They have a very large number of offspring but give their offspring very little care.  Basically, survival is a numbers game for their young.  These species tend to rely on instinct rather than more dynamic learned behaviors.  We are biologically limited from taking such a strategy.		A k-selected species should take every possible action that will increase the survival rate of its offspring to reproductive age.  This includes defending their young from predation.  I am not aware of any k-selected species other than humans that can protect their young from a 'predator' like polio, but they certainly would if they had the capability.  As our massive population proves, the k-selective strategy is extremely effective.  Changing strategies would require we abandon a winning formula.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"greencheekconure","name":"t1_cp1r913","parent_id":"t1_cp1mef2","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425300406,"created_utc":1425300406}

{"body":"There is no substantial evidence that the average human's intelligence is declining.  In fact, it is strongly believed that superior nutrition, a decline in heavy metal environmental contaminants, improved prenatal care, and a drop in the rate of children born with fetal alcohol syndrome has actually resulted in a boost in the average IQ.  Though I understand your concern, I myself do not believe that the reproduction rate among the dull witted has accelerated in relation to reproduction rate among the gifted.  In any case, natural selection only insures that those who die before they can reproduce do not pass on their genes.  If a dumb person is unable to reproduce because they are dumb, then they won't pass on their genetics.  If, however, it does not prove to be an impediment to reproduction, and nothing else prevents them from reproducing, the genes will live on.  One cannot 'take control' of evolution.

{"body":"Most vaccines don't even bother claiming to be Toxic Preservative-Free. You can be sure these vaccines are loaded with known neurotoxins.		However, some clever companies are now marketing "Preservative-Free" vaccines. The scam is that a vaccine can legally be labeled "preservative free" if the company claims 		the additive is only a manufacturing byproduct and not an active ingredient for preservation or if it contains so-called "trace amounts" of Mercury, Aluminum, Formaldehyde, 		Sorbitol, etc. For Mercury,  the "trace amount" limit is less than 0.3 micrograms of mercury in the finished product.		Even a so-called "Mercury-free" vaccine can contain the "trace amount" 0.3 mcg mercury or 600 ppb mercury.		To put that in perspective, just .5 ppb mercury kills human neuroblastoma cells (Parran et al., Toxicol Sci 2005; 86: 132-140). 		20 ppb mercury destroys the neurite membrane structure (Leong et al., Neuroreport 2001; 12: 733-37).		200 ppb mercury is considered hazardous waste by the EPA.		Multi-dose Flu vaccine vials use mercury as a preservative, 25 mcg per dose or 50,000 ppb or 250 TIMES more mercury than Hazardous Waste level contamination.		So even Mercury-free vaccines still contain Mercury, they just found a legal way to label it Mercury-free.		All the above is for just ONE SHOT. Now multiply these numbers by the number of vaccines the government wants to FORCE you to inject into your poor kids and then 		multiply that number by how many shots are given per vaccine (usually 3-4 per vaccine).		Now remember that Mercury isn't the only toxin in vaccines and remember that Aluminum, Formaldehyde, Sorbitol injected into the blood stream are known to damage neural 		tissue.

This new vaccine worked, however, there were other concerns in the NIH which were silenced. The virus was cultivated on the kidneys of monkeys and there was evidence that other viruses (SV-40 I believe) were getting into the vaccine. There were some in NIH who suspected that SV-40 was going to infect the population and lead to a sharp increase in soft-tissue cancers. The rates of these types of cancers did increase substantially, but I am not aware of any [published] research linking it to SV-40 or the vaccine. 		I am a proponent of vaccinations.

{"body":"Well, In today standards I'd raise the fine a little, and then take legal action against the parents. Even consider taking custody of the children if it comes to that. If parents refuse to see the reasoning behind vaccinations, refuse the education of it, and refuse to pay for their burden on the state... at that point the parent has proven that they can't adequately take care of the child.		I think that Children deserve the same liberties as everyone else, however due to obvious reasons they aren't equipped with the right tools to make use of those liberties. Parents are Subjective, they are often blinded by their parental perspective to see the child as a whole, and as it's parts. They will always see the baby, not the individual not the piece of society.		I'd love a more societal focused America, the obsession with Individuality is great, but also damning. There needs to be an in between. Sometimes individuality is nothing but a waste in some situations, its just a drain on the state, on society. Human's are animals, and just like any other animal our fixation should be with the survival of our species, all the other greatness should fall in line behind it, not in front of it. If individuality threatens more than it's worth, it doesn't apply.		Freedom of speech, press, religion, etc. All of that is guaranteed, but the freedom to irresponsibly endanger those who aren't equipped to protect themselves is not. Should not be, The government shouldn't keep everyone safe but also shouldn't keep everyone "individual" it's all about compromise, and making a better nation, society and people.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Havok-Trance","name":"t1_cp1nq4i","parent_id":"t1_cp1nkfe","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425283783,"created_utc":1425283783}
