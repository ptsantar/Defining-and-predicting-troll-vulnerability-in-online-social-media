Rosetta, which in turn tried to land its lander Philae on the surface, but the gravity on the comet is soooo weak that Philae bounced for more than a kilometer and ended up on a shady spot of the comet. We just had to wait until the comet was nearer to the sun and more light would be available to Philae's solar panels, which happened today.		>  When the hell was that?		It landed on the 12 of November 2014, it was all over the newspapers and medias!		> And is said comet on a collision course for us?		Nope, don't worry!

Thanks for triggering my girlfriend shitlord!  Her trigger is stupid people...		Edit:  In all seriousness though, what this paints feminists as are vapid people who only care about fashion, hoisting a flag that perpetuates a stereotype that all women only care about clothes and things that are skin deep and can't look past that into the actual meat of the issue, the science.		I'm currently working on a research project with our local Uni's collecting such incidents in hopes to illustrate why this is negative behavior that sets back feminism.  It doesn't help, it just creates barriers and antagonizes people, and most of all it is always vapid and completely a waste of time.  It's not catching someone who won't hire women, or fighting for women to get better pay, or helping women get access to needed medical treatments, it's people's shirts and what people say, things that you can't fundamentally block in free society.  It just makes feminists out to be people who are fundamentally incompatible with a free society who want to be state censors, who are the enemy of free expression, who act like people's nannies.  These new breed of internet feminist is sexist, are bullies, are attached to non-issues, and are incapable of organizing for positive change.  They run the risk of setting women and gay rights backwards and shrinking popular support for real solutions by creating an echochamber filled with loud obnoxious people, and when they need support for a real issue they will have cried wolf too often for anyone to care.		Furthermore they actually victimize women. After tons of interviews most real world women are put off by nearly everything SJWs are claiming and feel marginalized, like these people are painting a target on their back and making their prospects of being equal in society smaller because people are worried that they will share these views and make day to day life harder by making everyone walk around on egg shells around them.","depth":8,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"ztfreeman","name":"t1_cs6lqyr","parent_id":"t1_cs6czue","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434327306,"created_utc":1434323706}

No, that is not what I am saying.		Let me break it down for you:		A.) A "boy's club" culture exists in STEM fields that is biased against women in a number of ways. This expresses itself in many ways, from the overt (like sexual harassment) to the more benign (like being patronizing or assuming a female colleague needs your help when she's been doing this for 10 years). Most male STEM people are not aware of this, because it's the culture they've been raised in; it's like a fish not being aware of water.		B.)

Most of their answers are that it takes a lot of confidence and hard work to pursue that education. People never tell them they can do it, or that it's a realistic goal for them. The ones who do make it are strong and intelligent women.		People in the STEM field truly do want more women to get involved. We do a lot of outreach to high schools to teach kids about how enjoyable a STEM career can be. We support competitions like FIRST robotics that give kids first hand experience. Kids need to know that you don't have to be a genius to go into STEM and you absolutely don't have to be a white man.		Businesses want more diverse personnel. They don't want it to be only a white male business. Everyone should be allowed to get involved and those that do make it are highly respected.		I've never seen people in this field treat women or any other minority with anything but respect. I have a lot of reason to believe that the European Space Agency is very similar.

Nor did I, or anyone else, ever claim he did? We are talking about a pervasive boys-club mentality in STEM. That is the underlying problem.

{"body":"Feminism, by historical definition at least, doesn't argue for treating women better than treating men and is not sexist as you figure. Modern feminism was born in the 50's and 60s, though their wear protofeminist groups and philosophy that can be traced back to the the sufferage movement around the turn of the century then as far back as, to my knowledge, to the late 1700's when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote her two works *The Vindication of Men* and *The Vindication of Women*. Where she argued two major points, first that patriarchal sexism harms women but also harms men by putting societal pressure on them to adhere to presumed masculine gender roles. Wollstonecraft's reasoning for this was that society assumed presumed feminine things are viewed as sub standard and thought of as either pitiable, superfluous, or logically incorrect. Whereas presumed masculine things where viewed as noble, valuable, and logically sound. Therefor should a man wish to engage in a feminine activity he would be viewed by society as choosing to act illogical and unethical and instead of logical and ethical. To Wollstonecraft this was bad.		Modern feminism, as stated above, began in the 50's and 60's. This is because of the emergence of the civil rights movement. This is called second wave feminism, the first being the protofeminists like Wollstonecraft. Second wave feminism agreed with the tenants laid down by the first wave feminists, that acts considered either feminine or masculine, should be enjoyed with out societal judgement by men or women. Second wave feminists figured the best way to employ those concepts in a capitalist society was to get equal opportunity in employment and education. They struck at colleges or employers who had traditionally eschewed teaching or hiring women. Interestingly enough it's in this period that the Men's Rights community first emerged. Unlike the antagonist to feminism by mostly heterosexual men the early men's rights community was the realm of homosexual and gender nonconforming men. 		Third wave feminism sprung up in the 1980s. Where the second wave feminists viewed gender as a dichotomy of masculine and feminine, third wave feminists took a more holistic view arguing that their is no inherit difference between masculine and feminine outside of cultural context. By now the first wave Men's Rights movement was pretty much dead and had helped form and been absorbed into the LGBT rights movement. This where the second wave Men's right's movement most people are familiar with, the one focused on sexual strategy, formed. 		Some people argue we are in the fourth wave of feminism now. Which combines the tenants of the third wave with a ideological tenants of expansive liberty. This is a VERY new wave. The idea only became known in the mid 2000s. Some argue that we aren't in the fourth wave do to either, that we just aren't their yet, or interestingly that the fourth wave cant exist and be called feminism as it is so intertwined with ethnic civil rights, sexual rights, economic rights, and so on. 		So historically feminism can't really be called sexist. It is possible that fourth wave feminism, if it exists and that we are in it, may have sexist ideology in it, what you described as "women are better than men". It is very possible that in 10 or show years we may look back and see sexism we can't as of now, being in the thick of either the birth of a new wave of feminism or a completely new ideological movement, and really study it well.		**TLDR;** Feminism can't be called sexist from a historical point of view, its possible that a new ideological tenant or branch of feminism recently showed up that can be categorized as sexist but as of yet their is really not enough study by professional sociologists and anthropologists to make that call. So, as of now, we as lay people can't really ethically say feminism is sexist.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thebeatsandreptaur","name":"t1_cs6g7re","parent_id":"t1_cs6dsbj","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434316491,"created_utc":1434312891}

Take for example, rubber.

Then synthetic rubber came out and the price of the stuff dropped, factories and farms slowly shut down and came to a standstill and a lot of people saw it as the evil and peril of technology.

{"body":"Speaking of long duration naps... 		I actually have a 4 year old cat (named Hercules) that has been on a steady, mostly nonstop nap since he was born 4 years ago, I kid you not!		He sleeps SOLIDLY and DEEPLY for 22 to 23 hours per day.		I guess with that level of sleepiness, for him the dream state is actually the REAL WORLD, and our real world is simply a short, temporary, 1 to 2 hour intrusion into his dream-world consciousness state!		--------------------------------		When he does manage to wake up just to grab a quick bite to eat, and use his litter box, he seems to have an intense hazy, lazy, dazed, and confused, ultra mellowed out quality. 		Each time he does manage to awaken, it's almost as if (if he could talk), he would say something like: 		"Dude... waz up man?" with a pretty strong pot-smoking-surfer type of accent! 		Interestingly, I actually suspect he might have the cat-equivalent of some type of autistic/asperger's spectrum disorder, simply judging from his other behavior. 		Whatever his condition, people seem to love him, and are drawn to him. Women tend to find him "extremely ultra cute", and "mellow"... and are often pretty taken by him.		--------------------------------		Interestingly, he does have 2 siblings, a boy and a girl cat, that we also rescued from this same litter, and the siblings are "normal" for cats. Sure they get sleepy, but they also have strong social interactive urges, and alertness, when they are awake. 		These siblings are also awake far more frequently than that crazy, eternal napping-brother of their's!","depth":2,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AllThatJazz","name":"t1_cs64s5v","parent_id":"t1_cs631s9","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434291904,"created_utc":1434288304}

Additionally, there are 26 transuranic elements (93-118) Some of which have been observed on the Sun and in other stars, and some of which are purely hypothetical.  On Earth, these can only be made with a particle accelerator, and most decay extremely rapidly - just enough time to prove it *can* exist.		There is also a hypothetical second "island of stability" beginning somewhere between element 140-165 which may contain several to dozens of super-heavy elements that are still unstable, but stable enough to exist for a tangible period of time.  To date, no one has come up with a reaction for synthesizing any of them.  Our best hypotheses are that they may be found fleetingly in trace amounts inside of stars, however, none of our studies of the sun or other stars has provided any evidence of this.		This is why I would find it extremely unlikely that we would find some stable, super-heavy element on a comet.

{"body":"I can't give you nitty gritty technical, but here's the general idea: below a certain temperature Philae can't work; once it got enough sunlight in the solar panels, it used the energy to warm up a bit. Once it got warm enough it started recharging the batteries. Once the batteries where above a certain level a boot sequence was trigger. Finally it started sending pings, waiting for a response from Rosetta before sending a basic status update. This is where we are now.		The next steps are probably going to be more checks on the lander to understand what's working and what is not. If power levels are good enough and the link to Rosetta is stable, they'll probably ask for a couple pictures to see if/how the environment has changed during the last 7 months around the lander (and please the media who wants visual stuff to show to the public).
