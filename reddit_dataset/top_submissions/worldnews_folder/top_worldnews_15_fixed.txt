I know they have since upgraded both of those things done 1996 but I'm unsure of Nikes involvement. If anything the CBF officials simply pocketed that money. 		Also, Marin, the Brazilian CBF president arrested has only been in charge since 2012. The issues with CBF go as far back as the 60's with our most famous president, who also led FIFA from 74-the mid 90's, Joao Havelange. He was the guy Blatter was VP under. Ricardo Teixeira, CBF president before Marin (current dude in jail) also learned under Havelange. 		Both Havelange and Teixeira are responsible for the way the CBF currently is more so than Marin. Doesnt excuse Marins actions, but they should be in jail as well. Havalenge is probably responsible for a lot of corrupt activities during his time as FIFA president.

{"body":"I had the same question in another thread. The answer is basically that FIFA misrepresented itself and created a racket and avoided taxes in the United States. For example, is there anything illegal about a thug waltzing down the street and politely asking shop owners for money? Not at all. Asking for money is, in and of itself, not illegal.		What makes it illegal is when that money is being used to solve a problem that the racket *creates* -- that problem, of course, being "Be a shame if someone were to burn down your shop". You might say "Well in the organized crime case, isn't it illegal to just make that threat in the first place?" Sure. But the penalties for just making a vanilla threat are pretty low, and they don't provide a way to connect the person making the threat to a higher authority; i.e. there is no "conspiracy to threaten". That is why RICO statutes were created; small-time threats were being used to gin up huge amounts of money, and in effect perpetrated massive crimes that the legal system was not equipped to deal with.		In FIFA's case, they told countries "Here's what we base our selections on", and then their representatives disadvantaged other countries by basically saying "Be a shame if we decided that you didn't meet this one criterion for hosting".		FIFA misrepresented itself by claiming that the tournament selection process was fair and based on certain factors. But in reality, it was based exclusively on bribery. If FIFA had just come out and said "Our votes are totally up for grabs, so open your wallets, everyone", then they wouldn't have been doing anything illegal. They're a private enterprise, and they can decide however they want where to host their tournaments. 		That's what makes this different from organized crime. Organized crime has reason to hide its activities (drug smuggling, prostitution, etc.) from the law. They're illegal. But there's nothing illegal about FIFA taking money in exchange for hosting a tournament in a country. It's the fact that they *covered it up* that's illegal. And they covered it up to maintain international credibility, not because it was inherently illegal. Furthermore, they laundered that money to avoid US taxes, and that's a great way to piss off the IRS.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"manuscelerdei","name":"t1_crnxwra","parent_id":"t1_crnuya3","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432842811,"created_utc":1432839211}

People lost their entire life's savings overnight, business collapsed, homes were foreclosed in mass, unemployment skyrocketed, capital became scarce and the economy as a whole suffered. Big Banks are considered too big to fail because they are so big that they take everything else down with them when they go. 		The term doesn't really apply to non-financial institutions, and there have been big companies hammered by the long arm of the law. I mean, remember Enron? Multi billion dollar company shut down, and prison sentences were served to many of their execs (some up to 45 years). And they didn't just stop there, they took down one of the 5 biggest accounting firms in the world, permanently turning the "Big 5" into the "Big 4". Hardly a slap on the wrist when two of the largest companies in the world are forcibly shut down.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MarsMJD","name":"t1_crobu6h","parent_id":"t1_crnr97c","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432865812,"created_utc":1432862212}

I think the way SerbLing phrased it by using fall, just led to thinking of the previous mentioned phrase.  Fall and fail are just that one letter different - but the connotations are huge between them.  I don't think he ever meant to say they'd hurt the US economy, etc.  What he was saying was more in line with the mentality of "They're a huge company, those never get in trouble" etc.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"toddjunk","name":"t1_cro4q3c","parent_id":"t1_crnox3c","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432853208,"created_utc":1432849608}

{"body":"Because it is hard as hell to do so.  Did you follow the Enron cases?  The Galleon Group?  SAC Capital?  These are not cases you enter into willy nilly.  These guys hire the absolute best and blow the whole budget. They have no objection to going after the wealthy, the wealthy just have enough power to make them cautious.  The wealthy can compete in the media, they often have long histories of philanthropy to trot out as to why they are good citizens, they hire PR firms, they hire the best attorneys, they come at you from all sides.  It is just a bigger fight that is not initiated unless they are VERY confident of victory. 		Now I understand you are likely getting at the common criticism of the lack of charges brought forward on institutional rigging of things like the housing market or exchange rates.  That is a valid criticism.  They do often appear reluctant to go after core companies, but their supposed logic is going after them causes more harm than good.  The theoretical response is to slowly weaken them until you can go after them.  The way to weaken them is to make them answer to regulations that split their power, lower their profits, weaken their market share etc.  		You cannot just take down a company that holds 2 trillion in housing loans.  It would destroy the economy.  The unfortunate fact is some people are so powerful they cant be treated like the rest of us. 		They have also gone after a Presidential Candidate, a sitting US Senator, several high profile very wealthy athletes, Martha Stewart, and more all in the last few years.

Has it protected Walmart from the rise of Amazon, which now does almost 20% of Walmart's sales? Nope.		So what exactly is lobbying buying these companies?

Your wording is messy and it doesn't make any sense, it sounds like you're for these agreements. If you think that corporations writing legislature in secret that affects people all over the planet is a good thing you're horribly misguided. Plus if you're trying to say that these trade agreements haven't historically been disastrous then you really have no idea to the scope of power these things have previously granted corporations.		The reason why mexican immigrants flood into the U.S. is because U.S. corporations like Cargill and ADM were allowed to trade freely (read no restrictions) with Mexico after the North American Free Trade Act. These companies shipped massive amounts of GMO grown commodity grain for cheap (they purposely operated at a loss since they knew Mexican farmers could not compete with GMO grains) to Mexico which ran the millions of farmers in their country out of business and left them destitute for work, and the country now without a system to produce its own grain, forcing them to buy from American corporations.		Trade agreements like the TPP have historically been the reason U.S. companies pack up their factories and rebuild them in countries where worker wages are abysmal, forcing Americans to compete with workers where human rights violations are a constant and everyone lives miserable lives in poverty. Trade agreements like this are why when you go to any market or store and try to find something made in the U.S. you will be hard-pressed to do so.		If you had done any amount of legitimate research into this you would not be saying the things you're saying right now.		You are unknowingly fighting for your oppression and worse living conditions for yourself and the vast majority of people around the planet, which will only result in the concentration of even more wealth into the hands of corporations and the global elite.

Do you remember the first time you learned about "conspiracy theories"? The first ones I came to know (this is anecdotal, it will probably vary for others) had to do with more outlandish, silly, entertaining stories: Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster and tin foil hats. It serves to discredit and more readily bring about criticism when the most known "conspiracies" are so fanciful and in a sense seen as easily rationalized; Loch Ness was a periscope / reflection, Big Foot was a dude in a hair suit wearing shoes to make tracks, tin foil hats are seen worn by the "mad scientists", paranoid loners in trailers with all sorts of signal monitoring and odd contraptions. When that's the most common perception, the basis for which other conspiracies are judged on lends itself towards reactions that reflect those found in the above examples. Those stories from my childhood were crazy, how is this any different? Oh it's easily explained, people see one thing when clearly it's just an overactive imagination.		The end effect? A successful effort to make conspiracy synonymous with fantastical tales. Notice that I'm not painting any particular person, entity, government, nor school of thought as the perpetrator of these ideas; simply I mean to show one possible thought process / motivation behind an effort to make conspiracy, the interest in uncovering / questioning whether or not the actions of individuals or powers are reflective of their respective true intentions, as ridiculous, whimsical, paranoid...

{"body":"I'm kind of confused by this whole bribery thing, can someone explain?		I mean I understand if a government official is taking money to do something that should be part of their job or giving preferential treatment is wrong, but it sounds like the corruption was mostly FIFA officials being paid by governments or companies in exchange for business? What's wrong with that? Isn't that what happens all the time? Whatever company pays the most gets advertising rights at the superbowl or whatever city offers the best tax incentives gets a new factory built in their town?		The only crime seems to be FIFA officials personally pocketing money that should have went to the FIFA organization for those rights and in that case it's really more embezzlement than bribery, right? It seems like they would be breaching their fiduciary duty to FIFA and the FIFA organization could sue them but that's about it.		All the focus seems to be on governments paying money or companies paying money, but isn't that completely allowable, they just did it in the wrong way? FIFA is going to deal with the country with the best incentives package to host the world cup or the highest paying advertiser right?

This story reallt didn't get much play... at least in american mass media.  But its amazing.  It is set during a time when Pablo Escobar was seen as some kind of Colombian savior.
