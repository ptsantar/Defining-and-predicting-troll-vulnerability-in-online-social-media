{"body":"It's a joke. It's meant to be humiliating. That's not even hard enough to get someone off (who would otherwise get off on whipping).		Islamic law forbids it from injuring or cutting the skin or leaving a mark.		I think only Southeast Asian nations break with Islamic tradition when it comes to whipping. They use fewer but harder strikes. Not sure why. I figure they must have had some pre-Islamic tradition of caning.		This doesn't make it any better I suppose, but that's the point here. To publicly shame this guy for doing what he did. It's used for things like public drunkenness or lewdness too, where shame is a powerful deterrent.		Edit: It's kind of weird how OP's news article is talking about the whipping like it's debilitating when there's a video of them doing it for a few seconds and it's the same weak version of whipping as in the link posted above. One "eyewitness" even said "He was silent, but you could tell from his face and his body that he was in real pain.???... But we can see it in the video. That's not painful.  "Badawi was lashed on his back and legs without any break for at least five minutes." Yes, it's horrible, but he could withstand hours of that without much more than having his skin turn red. It's just funny how you can see the news trying to make it seem more than it is. If he's injured, show the full video. The Saudis don't stop you, there's a video of a full session linked right above.		Edit: Okay, I'll stop being an idiot. This guy's got 10 years in jail and needs some kind of argument to get out of the country. 		Edit: I should correct myself, of course it stings and probably enough to cause you to jump, you can even hit yourself hard enough to do that. I was just comparing it to the stereotypical movie screen caning/whipping that the article seems to invoke. As for whether Saudis hit hard enough for it to really hurt, I bet this guy's hurt more than the other guy in the other video even though the strikes looked similarly weak.","depth":3,"score":467,"ups":467,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PT10","name":"t1_cnpnt3f","parent_id":"t1_cnpnfpx","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421317969,"created_utc":1421317969}

{"body":"Well I prefer to be an optimist and believe that this shift has already begun, that there is plenty of condemnation in the Muslim community over terrorism, militants, Islamic State, etc. That just isn't as exciting in the headlines.		When will the violence actually die out? It's hard to say, but I also believe the cause of violence, the reason young people find the ideology appealing, have more root than simple belief. I think unrest, unemployment, and social angst is also a factor. 		These communities will need to work together to simultaneously identify the source of anger, focus on more of the peaceful teachings, and help their youth with finding and relying on healthier outlets. And of course, more needs to be done in some places to find and shut down recruitment where it lies. So in a manner of speaking, the fire needs to be put out and the dry kindling needs to be hosed down. If the fire still burns, it may be able to spark kindling anyway -- and if the kindling remains dry, it will inevitably be sparked and burn again.		Inspiration may be found in how the West managed to reduce their hostilities and religious fighting, but ultimately I think they will find a unique approach best suited to Islam.","depth":12,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nightlily","name":"t1_cnqgxn1","parent_id":"t1_cnq6py5","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421374640,"created_utc":1421374640}

Grandma proceeded to whip the shit out of me. This time there was not the usual screaming in agony as the switch hit my bare legs. The switch broke apart each time she struck me.

I was just over joyed my plan had worked and spared me a severe beating with the oozing stripes up and down my legs. 		She tossed the stick in the trash and then told me to go get a real switch for my second beating that I really deserved. Dang. I knew better than to try that trick again.

I grabbed an important document she had laid on the table and held it for ransom. Then she got my older brother to attack me. The fight went on for about ten minutes with blood all over the kitchen.

My sister ran to a farmhouse and called police. I was taken to a jail for holding and after about a week Grandpa came again to "reason" with me. The Sheriff was real nice and arranged the meeting. It ended with me screaming I would never leave with him. The Sheriff was astounded. He was like, "You were white knuckled and holding onto that table and screaming at him" Ya. Abuse can make you that way. I stayed in that cell for about another month. No court, no social workers. My three meals a day and magazines. I was 15.

Carbon capture and sequestration are relatively new concepts in action compared to nuclear energy, considering that CCS is only about 2 decades old.

If you think that political lobbying is the sole non-technological reason behind why the world hasn't adopted nuclear/alternative energy, you are dead wrong. 		This is the most basic reason behind it. If you had the money, you could do PR campaigns that would allow people to see that today's technology allows for a good experience in an electric car. Model-S is nothing like these cars used to be 5, 10, 15 years ago.		When people see that, there's more interest, there's more consumer money, the tech goes forward.		The main reasoning your average consumer has is that "it takes too long to charge an electric car while on the road, it's too much of a fuss". If the government sent more money Tesla's way, they'd be able to install thousands more of their supercharges which allow you to charge your car in 16 minutes. For free.		So you could say that there are three reasons:		- availability,		- consumer attitude		- ability to make long-range trips/heavy-duty work without 20h pauses for charging the battery.		But all three of them boil down to one: companies like Tesla need more money to jumpstart the technology.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Alaknar","name":"t1_cnpqd1y","parent_id":"t1_cnppqn6","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421328647,"created_utc":1421328647}
{"body":">Why not acknowledge the fact stated by /u/Robustos[1] ? It is currently not possible.		I do acknowledge that somewhat (it is actually possible, just not yet on a small scale like a car) but that's like saying 20 (or go back even further if you want) years ago that we should give up on developing solar panel technology because the efficiency is so horrid that its not worth looking into, so we should abandon it and look for something else. That would obviously been a mistake. Just like not trying to improve/reduce the environmentally harmful emission output of the main source of energy production in the world currently because its not currently possible or its "far from reality" is a mistake. And you don't have to study "environment change" in college to see or not see that.		That is literally the only thing I have been saying this whole time, and plenty of other reputable and knowledgeable people agree with me, not that I need their validation. (The Kyota Protocol directed initiatives at developing CCS technology, they must be idiots like me too) I have been absolutely shit on (just like an advocate for solar technology 20 years ago would be) because like I said a couple posts ago, CCS technology is still in its relative infancy compared to how long we have been utilizing fossil fuels or nuclear technology, and that it is not prudent or wise to write it off simply by saying "its not efficient enough yet". That's all I have said, and I have been met with people who like I said have no perspective on the energy situation and are tunnel visioning nuclear tech/alternative energy to a point where they can't see anything else.		>companies like Tesla need more money to jumpstart the technology.		I understand what you are getting at, but that is subsidization, not lobbying, and lobbying does not always beget subsidization.		But that's reddit (maybe people in general) for you, severely lacking critical thinking skills, I haven't been surprised at the response to my posts one bit, nor do I particularly care there are so many dissenting. Actually it just cements further in my mind the need to look at CCS technology more because the majority of people are focused on something that may very well be beaten in the political arena (alternative energy) by corporate fossil fuel interests, and then you'll be left with the same terrible energy source that is slowly destroying the planet without anyway to mitigate or pre-emptively reduce its effects.

A kilowatt-hour is you using 1000 watts for one hour, or 500 watts for two hours, or 250 watts for 4 hours, etc.  Your power company probably charges you by the kilowatt hour and it is typically a few cents for each one.

A grid-tied system means no batteries, (which cost a bunch of money and have to be replaced occasionally) and I get to sell power back to the power company if I'm collecting more power than I'm using at any given moment.

{"body":"That whole thing was blown so far out of proportion its laughable. Facesitting could be grounds to refuse classification under other guidelines. The guidelines ban acts that could endanger life and facesitting could endanger life. It's not that facesitting is banned its that facesitting could be done in such a way to be banned.		Each film is reviewed by the board and if an instance of facesitting looked like it was endangering life it would be banned. Same goes for spanking. Spanking wasn't banned acts that leave permanent damage are banned (though the guidelines actually specifically have a clause making spanking legal) and spanking could leave damage.		It's like how a film could be banned anywhere for having someone beaten to a bloody pulp. That doesn't make punching banned it just that punching can be used to bring about a situation that causes a ban. Same for spanking, same for face sitting... same for squirting.	The entire thing was so badly misrepresented on Reddit and by places like the Independent it's a total joke... Oh well, just another lie about the UK reddit believes.		If you actually read the 2014 guidelines none of that list is explicitly mentioned. That independent "journalist" took the guidelines and extrapolated a list.		He saw the line about endangering life and assumed facesitting was banned. When it isn't. As they say, the proof is in the pudding and UK magazines have been using these exact guidelines since 1980 and spanking, facesitting... BDSM is all legal under these guidelines in print. It will be online.		EDIT: as for the surveillance snapchat encryption thing... yeah, Cameron is a dick and wants that but he cant do it because the UK Government is openly blocking him. He cannot legally enforce that "plan" as it stands because the Coalition are blocking it.

{"body":"It it isn't, that's my point. It's an interpretation of a separate rule. Like with everything they daisy chained from one rule, to another to arrive at a totally separate idea.		Under UK pornography laws urination is legal, but urinating onto someone *could* be banned as it falls under the terribly defined remit of humiliation. The 2014 guidelines state you can refuse classification of a porn film if it contains		["sexual threats, humiliation or abuse which do not	form part of a clearly consenting role-playing game.	Strong physical or verbal abuse, even if consensual, is	unlikely to be acceptable"](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/BBFC%20Classification%20Guidelines%202014_5.pdf)			Now a separate court decision has decided  and set precedent that female ejaculation is simply urine. Medical evidence is thin on the ground for this but short of another court decision that's the way the UK sees it.		Now *if* you were showing female ejactulation and *if* it was onto someone elses body and *if* that was deemed to not be part of a consensual role playing game and *if* you deemed the ejaculation to be urine you *could* ban female ejaculation.		But that is a lot of ifs.		EDIT: Minor point, it seems to be that urination falls foul more of the [Obscene Publications Act of 1959](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/66/contents) Rather than the BBFC guidelines. The point still stands because the Obscene Publications Act doesn't outright ban urine but tends to prohibit a film showing consumption or urine being rubbed into stuff. All BBFC rulings where they've invoked the obscene publications act are when the urine was swallowed or "smeared" and so on and so fourth.		Stupid rule, wholly unnecessary, but still doesn't ban female ejaculation.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kindern","name":"t1_cnppw5s","parent_id":"t1_cnppnp5","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421327161,"created_utc":1421327161}

This is a property dispute. It sucks that it???s happening, but due to the nature of the territory in question, it does make for a lot of property disputes.

So the house was built on land that belonged to someone else. This is not separate housing rights.

{"body":"It's not really about morality here. Which side is more moral? That's a highly subjective answer. If we go by western values, it appears that Israel is more in alignment with those. If we go by Islamic values, well..	If we go by the leftist dichotomous worldview, the one with more [perceived] power is always the bad guy. 		I'm saying that saying "stop the settlements" is overly simplistic. 	A lot of those settlements rightfully belong to Israel, it's nearly impossible to divide the area, many of those people have nowhere else to go, the list goes on and on. Not to mention the obvious; it won't lead to peace. 		This lie has only fooled westerners, every Arab knows that more land will never bring peace. 		 From 1949-67, when Jews were forbidden to live on the West Bank, the Palestinians refused to make peace with Israel. From 1967-77, the Labor Party established only a few strategic settlements in the territories, yet the Palestinians showed no interest in making peace with Israel. In 1977, months after a Likud government committed to greater settlement activity took power, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem. One year later, Israel froze settlements, hoping the gesture would entice other Arabs to join the Camp David peace process. But none would.		 In another Camp David summit in 2000, Ehud Barak offered to dismantle most settlements and create a Palestinian state in exchange for peace, and Yasser Arafat rejected the plan.		Israel also proved willing to dismantle settlements in the interest of peace. During the Camp David negotiations with Egypt, all of the issues had been resolved, but one remained, Sadat's insistence that all settlements in the Sinai be removed. Begin didn't want to remove them, but he called Ariel Sharon for advice. Sharon said that in the interest of peace, the settlements should be dismantled. Israel did just that in 1982, providing compensation to residents for the loss of their homes, farms and businesses that ranged from $100,000 to $500,000. 		Nevertheless, a small group of settlers in the town of Yamit refused to leave and Sharon had the army literally drag them out of their homes to comply with the terms of the agreement with Egypt. This also happened in Gaza, and we all know how that turned out for the Palestinians living under Hamas' tyranny.		In short, history shows that with the exception of Egypt, and Jordan, the Arab states and Palestinians have been uncompromising regardless of the scope of settlement activity.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"squeezebuttmagic","name":"t1_cnqo4aw","parent_id":"t1_cnqnfyt","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421389170,"created_utc":1421389170}

{"body":"You're still looking at it from a moral/populist perspective though - and from that perspective your points are certainly valid. But from a legal perspective it's pretty clear cut - the UN was founded to protect the stability of the system of nation states as they existed after WW2. Saudi Arabia is a sovereign nation, so while oppressing their people is still bad, it's still considered a domestic problem.		You could certainly argue that the west overstepped its bounds with how it dealt with Ukraine in the last decade - but they still kept it restricted to political maneuvering with a bit of (alleged) espionage and crowd-baiting and such. Not cool at all, but the actual decisions and protests that so angered Russia were entirely performed by Ukrainians. They might have been incited by America, some of them might even be direct American puppets - but they're still Ukrainians. 		Russia then turned around and physically invaded a sovereign nation with it's army, annexing party of it and then directly supporting the rebel side of a civil war in the rest. I don't deny that there was provocation, but I hope you can see the difference here. 		If I decided to rent a room to a Russian fellow, and admittedly treated him poorly, is his entire family then justified in moving into my house, taking over the entire basement without paying rent, and then attempting to violently force me out so they can just own the entire house? Seems like that probably wouldn't fly, at least where I come from - the fact that there was already someone "affiliated" with that family living there doesn't somehow give the family implied ownership of my house. 		Perhaps the real root of the problem is that international law says national sovereignty is sacrosanct in the first place. But that's a different argument altogether.

Saudi funded terrorists are NOT nations, they are individuals who happen to have ties back to Saudi Arabia.		I'm not saying the distinction is really meaningful, as far as human suffering and such goes, but it IS very much meaningful when it comes to actual international laws.		Besides which, even if you were 100% correct, all it would mean is that the UN should be investigating and sanctioning *both* countries.  There is no reason why we should only go after the single worst nation - we can look at both and say "that is bad".		Again, as far as whether either party committed atrocities against people, and causes human suffering?  They're both guilty.  Saudi Arabia, by all accounts, is far *more* guilty.  Nobody is disputing that.		And the whole "funding terrorism" angle certainly *could* be used as a justification to prosecute them via the UN - and you're completely right that the reason that won't happen is that they have such strong ties to the USA.		But, again, Putin invaded a sovereign nation with his own nation's *actual* military forces, even though Russia was in absolutely no immediate danger.  That is a massive and clear cut violation of international laws and norms, with established precedent for taking action against them for it.  And just to cut any whataboutism off at the knees - I 100% acknowledge and even *agree* that the same could easily (and is, and should be) said about the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.  The US doing something stupid and illegal doesn't magically make it OK for Russia to do it.		I don't disagree that the Saudi regime should be toppled, and that their actions both domestically and internationally are repugnant.

I think the US has done some illegal things as well, and supporting the Saudi regime is one of the more evil things this country engages in.

That's just it. Religion must be freely chosen and freely adhered to. If it is not, it's no longer a religion. The primary feature of a government is that it has a legal monopoly on the use of force.

This is the meaning of insight, its something you can't simply convey to someone, but in your heart you know that you have *understood* something profound, important and sad. 		There are many other things one can realize, they are quite subtle yet profound. Its like something clicked in your head, but no matter how many times you repeat it to someone, simply factually explaining it will not allow them to understand it like you do, because it comes from deep internal dialogue. This is why those dudes meditate in the mountains for years. Even if you may not have intentionally been doing it, you have been meditating and contemplating upon the impermanence, hollowness and seemingly pointless nature of reality.		People realize this truth in different ways, some people get it through culture shock when they visit a poor country. Some people simply observe an orphan, a dog, or an old person sick or in discomfort, soldiers realize it during war, or after they come home. For Buddha, the ancient story was that he left his palace as a Prince, shielded from his father by literally anything that could be of displeasure. Eventually, he made it out of his massive palace, and he came upon 3 things on the road immediately. First a man who was old, and he realized that men grow old. Second he came upon a sick person, and he realized that people are capable of becoming ill.

This can sound depressing, unless you frame it differently. The initial reaction to these realizations can be, "Fuck! The whole world is full of suffering and the only way to get rid of that suffering is to not want anything. I don't think I'm ready to stop wanting things."		You can instead think of it as "Hey, the whole world is full of suffering. For as long as I'm alive, I will suffer to some degree. However, I am the only cause of my suffering (my wants and desires are nobody else's but mine). Nobody else makes me suffer. Therefore, I don't need to rely on anyone else to end my suffering." Now it's in your hands to make the change, instead of depending on salvation from a third-party prophet, or whatever.		No, you can't end your suffering overnight. Yes, it will take years of practice and patience to see a big difference in your life. However, you can follow the Noble Eightfold Path (if that's too much, just be a decent human) to make small changes in your life for the better. Even if you don't attain Enlightenment and end all of your suffering, any positive change will be better than staying stagnant.		*Edit: There is an important distinction between attachment and love. You can love your dog (or girlfriend or dad or whatever) while they are alive. You can give selflessly to them, enjoy the time you have together, and let your heart be full. When they are gone, however, they are gone. Pure love is thankful for the time you had together, knowing that you both enriched each others lives. It's about the mutual joy you give each other. Attachment is more about ownership. E.g. "This dog is MINE and if he dies or runs away, my life will be ruined because I don't have MY dog anymore, so how can I be ME?" It's less focused on the other person (animal) and more focused on you getting what you want from them.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jkingme","name":"t1_cnpuuio","parent_id":"t1_cnpmcg2","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421338299,"created_utc":1421338299}

{"body":"Samsara translates into a 'sea of suffering', rebirth is one condition or kind of 'trap' of Samsara. Reincarnation is a tough subject, because on the surface it immediately seems crazy.		Buddhists don't believe that the self exists, so you cannot come back as a rabbit, however amusing that may be, because your personality, your little inner dialogue, your 'soul' doesn't really exist. Its just an illusion, its merely a collection of your thoughts, experiences and history. There is no self, its a machine that is always deconstructing in some places, and constructing in other places. Have you ever kind of wondered, what are you? Not your body, not your family, not your job, language, voice, not even your thoughts. When you are thinking about nothing, sitting there and its just kind of......you..what is that little dialogue in your head? The more you think about this, the more you ponder on this, the more you begin to realize that that 'self' the little thing in your mind, doesn't actually exist. Its like a flame, it permeates, but it is *always changing* and is completely impermanent. You may walk through the same river back and forth, but you will never walk through the same water. The same analogy can be made with a wave. Is the wave the water, or the energy that thus moves it? 		With this understanding, you can begin to understand that to be reborn is to wake up that day, it is to walk through a door, it is to smile, to take a step, to drink a cup of coffee. You are, at every waking moment, dying and being reborn because you are not a permanent thing, because you don't even exist.","depth":3,"score":209,"ups":209,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"why_the_love","name":"t1_cnplqb2","parent_id":"t1_cnple4w","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421308209,"created_utc":1421308209}

{"body":"Niels Bohr	>For a parallel to the lesson of atomic theory...[we must turn] to those kinds of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like the **Buddha** and Lao Tzu have been confronted, when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence.		Bertrand Russell	> **Buddhism** is a combination of both speculative and scientific philosophy. It advocates the scientific method and pursues that to a finality that may be called Rationalistic. In it are to be found answers to such questions of interest as: 'What is mind and matter? Of them, which is of greater importance? Is the universe moving towards a goal? What is man's position? Is there living that is noble?' It takes up where science cannot lead because of the limitations of the latter's instruments. Its conquests are those of the mind 		J. Robert Oppenheimer	>If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say 'no;' if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no;' if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say 'no;' if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no.' The **Buddha** has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth-century science. 		Albert Einstein 	>there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance. Indications of this cosmic religious sense can be found even on earlier levels of development???for example, in the Psalms of David and in the Prophets. The cosmic element is much stronger in **Buddhism**, as, in particular, Schopenhauer's magnificent essays have shown us. The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man's image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints.

{"body":"I'm glad you mentioned this (first comment ever on reddit here from a lurker because of you). This is completely related to how for the past 4 years I've become more cynical, skeptical, and numbed due to my true inability to prevent all these terrible things from happening.  And not just for events that happen abroad. In the US I'm demotivated by our governments inability to be more effective. I only have candidate red or blue to choose from and no measurable way to truly contribute to my country's legislation. 		Then a few weeks ago I was reading a blog (doesn't matter which) where the writer said 'you get the government you deserve'. And then, I thought maybe 'I get the world I deserve', too.  Here I was complaining about how shitty the world is, how shitty our government is, and realized I deserve it. I haven't been voting, haven't been donating, haven't even fucking commented on reddit so as to contribute to arguably the best community in the world. I am only consuming. That's all I've been.		So, now what? Now, I'm going to earn the right to be pissed. I don't get to complain about my local news until I start voting, volunteering, and becoming an active participant. I don't get to share my disgust for atrocities committed overseas or even contribute my ideas for how it needs to be fixed to my co-worker or friend who merely nods and forgets. I don't get this privilege until I am making my own specific contribution and positive impact, no matter the size. I may have a small or no effect, but at least I'll have every right to be pissed off next time I hear about something like this.

They fall into the blurry sea of suffering and then a new story sparks our outrage.  		>We can make things better, sure. But they'll never get rid of suffering, and that's just part of it. Just part of how the world works.		I think we can get rid of suffering.  The reason I do is because although there is no point in trying to stamp out all suffering, it is possible to eliminate a large percentage of suffering.  You're looking at it the wrong way by setting an impossible goal, and it encourages resignation and pessimism.  In real terms, ending suffering should mean reducing it by a reasonable amount because we have to deal with the world as it is and accept that although we can't stamp out all torture, we can at least end some forms of state torture.  I believe this is the only valid way to approach the issue if one truly cares about ending suffering.  It is pointless to look at the problem and decide to accept it because it can't be fully solved, or because there's just so much of it.  That point of view actually has a negative effect.  			At the very least, it's encouraging to know that a lot of us can relate to your sense of depression at reading this news, and we upvoted you for it.

{"body":"I spend time reading and arguing about politics; it is impossible in the US to engage in politics without touching on religion.  If the religious in this country stopped using their religious beliefs to inform their politics we wouldn't need to discuss the nature or legitimacy of these beliefs.  But of course the religious do, and rightly so; if you're going to believe something and you think it's important, of course it should influence your politics.  As it happens, unfortunately, religious belief is unfounded and it makes politics based on it equally so.		For example: While it is possible to be against gay marriage and be non-religious, look at this poll:		http://www.pewforum.org/2014/09/24/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/		And while it is possible to be against abortion and be non-religious, in the US mainly white evangelical protestants/catholics are strongly against.  Polls on this issue are a bit less clear, but basically the older you are and the more you go to church the more likely you are to be against gay marriage and abortion.		http://www.pewforum.org/2013/01/16/public-opinion-on-abortion-slideshow/		http://www.gallup.com/poll/22222/religion-politics-inform-americans-views-abortion.aspx		Views in South America on these questions are even more influenced by religious affiliation.

{"body":"> ..if you're going to believe something and you think it's important, of course it should influence your politics.		Yeah it should. I'm sure you realise just how vast this concept is. The laws of liberty were founded because of religious influence. Religious influence cannot therefore be the problem, it's when religious commands become law that problems come up. Your answers here seem to imply the religious majority being Christian are a problem when it comes to gay marriage. Yet Jesus taught separation of church and state. I don't find your Tinkerbell analogy harsh, because I see it for what it is, just ignorance. I really hope it's not willful ignorance. I have to hold you accountable for this mistake though, because faith doesn't just work unless you try, it's non-existent if you don't. That's the very concept of it. Imagine if the religious majority only took up 1% of the population, our conversation would be a different one. It's only because they're a large part that these significant numbers must be addressed with weight. I understand that. But that shouldn't stop us from seeing what is true here. 		If you see the people who profess to be Christians not displaying a Christian attitude, then I'm afraid I cannot count any accusation of faith against them, because if it's not faith, it's mere cherry picking and whim.

{"body":"That's not what I mean... In the context of the initial post (not USA), I believe what I'm getting at is that we see these news reports about these public beatings quite a bit. Also see honor killings, and other awful actions reinforced and encouraged by religious texts. Theocracies (religion = state law = national law) like these use their creator of flavor's laws as laws of the land. Even if the people realized that these laws are immoral, and many do because of more and more outside influence, these laws still won't and can't be changed else admitting their god is flawed. They are STATIC laws. Do you mean to tell me that you think static, religious laws are good? These theocracies certainly don't allow you to evolve their laws in any "sphere". And, certainly I don't mean that we should argue against good laws. But when we have something like these theocracies that practice this type of government, it's the full set of laws that we must look at not just the good ones. 		The only reason we don't practice crazy christian laws in the US is that our government was built at a time when we all were trying to flee that. Jesus doesn't encourage state/religion separation; he only gets close when he says we should obey authority and even then what's to say that this authority can't be a theocracy based on christian bible. Of course there are common sense laws in there that we do employ such as 'don't murder'. It should be obvious to you that in the 100k years humans have been around that we'd have that one on the books way before this bible came around. Otherwise, how did we survive?  		If we were to follow the static laws of the bible, we'd have so many bizarre laws. I did a 5 second search and found a few:	Don't let cattle graze with other kinds of Cattle (Leviticus 19:19)	Don't have a variety of crops on the same field. (Leviticus 19:19)	Don't wear clothes made of more than one fabric (Leviticus 19:19)	Don't cut your hair nor shave. (Leviticus 19:27)	Any person who curseth his mother or father, must be killed. (Leviticus 20:9)  Have you ever done that?	If a man cheats on his wife, or vise versa, both the man and the woman must die. (Leviticus 20:10).  I wonder if Dr. Laura would like that one to be enforced?	If a man sleeps with his father's wife... both him and his father's wife is to be put to death. (Leviticus 20:11)	If a man sleeps with his wife and her mother they are all to be burnt to death.  (Leviticus 20:14)	If a man or woman has sex with an animal, both human and animal must be killed. (Leviticus 20:15-16).  	If a man has sex with a woman on her period, they are both to be "cut off from their people" (Leviticus 20:18)	Psychics, wizards, and so on are to be stoned to death.  (Leviticus 20:27)	If a priest's daughter is a whore, she is to be burnt at the stake.  (Leviticus 21:9)	People who have flat noses, or is blind or lame, cannot go to an altar of God (Leviticus 21:17-18)	Anyone who curses or blasphemes God, should be stoned to death by the community.  (Leviticus 24:14-16)	Don't let cattle graze with other kinds of Cattle (Leviticus 19:19)		So, yeah, there is blaspheme laws in the OT. And don't go saying the OT doesn't apply. If you know enough about jesus then you'd know he was all about those 'static' laws being enforced. Alas, we ignore them by applying our superior morals sourced outside of the bible. To be clear, we don't practice these in the USA but the problems we are seeing in the world are because of large groups that have base their own laws on these static, outdated religious commandments that clash with evolving societies that have learned to evolve past them.","depth":15,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ultrahello","name":"t1_cnur8k5","parent_id":"t1_cnuevoj","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421740629,"created_utc":1421740629}
{"body":"Whatever kinds of laws there are, there will be good ones and bad ones. 		Jesus said specifically 'My kingdom is not of this world'. And when Peter was violent against His captors, Jesus healed the captor's ear and told Peter to stand down. If Jesus is the Son of God, and will tolerate violence against Himself according to the laws of the land, I don't think there is any room whatsoever to even suggest that Jesus thought enforcing religion was a good idea. 		Israel didn't force their laws on other nations, they were laws for God's people. It's only logical that they would be more strict and severe than other people's. Who are held more accountable? Those with more power and responsibility or those with less? What you're doing is looking at these laws and thinking 'hmm, they don't make sense to me', and therefore they must be bad, or wrong, right? But what if they work to accomplish certain things? If they are the most effective remedy or maintenance, it would be worse for them not to be used. And if God is behind them, then you'd trust an omniscient being to know exactly what is the best laws to have. If you don't believe in God, then you'd have to have a basis of reasoning for changing the laws. 		I get it that you think we have superior morals, but I'm not sure that's so easy to claim. Jesus changed things from the old testament laws. Jesus said that divorce was only an option because of the hard hearts of the people. And He didn't stone the adulteress where law said He could. The reason why people see Jesus's actions as more important than the old laws that are no longer kept, are because the spirit of the law aimed at something far higher, and when God's people had changed to the degree they had, it was time to aim for that higher level. Notice that God led the Israelites around in the wilderness for 40 years, to basically remove a stubborn generation of unbelievers. That old generation was not ready for the next phase of God's plan. The newer generation was much more fit to meet it, and despite the success, there was still plenty of failure too.

This is your straw man. I have no problem with the fact that Origin of Species doesn't have commands in it. In fact, that's probably why I never mentioned it!

{"body":"Here is a schematic showing the way effective governments are organized:	http://www.china-learn.info/AtlanComm/z_jpegs/governmenetHierarchy.jpg	Heads of state do not collect taxes or catch robbers by themselves. They have ministries, normally with several levels of depth, to do that. Commands have to go down the hierarchy and still end up expressing the intention of the head of state, and reports about what has been accomplished have to get summarized on each higher level and still end up giving the head of state an accurate representation of what has been accomplished. Saudi Arabia seems to have this part of the picture pretty well in hand. However, Saudi Arabia is lacking the curving arrows that represent feedback from the people telling officials on all levels whether the people feel government activities to be benefits or liabilities to them.		When feedback is not permitted or not responded to, pressure for change builds up among the people. Just imagine what it would be like to be a citizen of North Korea. Totalitarian governments respond to demands for change from the people by increasing their level of repression. At some point, like a steam boiler that builds up too much pressure, the restraints fail and there is an explosion. The explosion point has already been reached in several other Middle Eastern states. The results have been extremely painful for all concerned. 		Without some kind of reform, the future of Saudi Arabia would seem to be seen in the increasing use of punitive measures on the people and eventual explosive revolution.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pe0m","name":"t1_cnprvp5","parent_id":"t3_2shle7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421332517,"created_utc":1421332517}

There's absolutely nothing silly about that, and whoever told you so did you a massive disservice. What's silly is posing a question, and then saying "Because god". What's the point of posing a fundamental question about life when your answer is going to be something supernatural which you can't substantiate one way or another? It's lazy. 		People talk about questioning their faith, but what it really comes down to is looking at a sunset and making a choice to believe it's beautiful because god created it, instead of it just being beautiful because it's beautiful. It's an extra step that you don't need to take to enjoy life or treat people with dignity. It's trying to find a satisfying answer in something that would by definiton be completely and totally outside our realm of comprehension, and accepting that the philosophical aspect makes you feel good about yourself, instead of questioning it further.		To say god created the universe on the basis of ignorance (i.e the kind of profound ignorance we all have) is like attributing that creation to any other character who most people have only experienced in fiction or as an abstract concept. You have literally as much evidence, the only difference is the amount of reverence and time religion has had to make its case.		Ask all the questions in the world, question everything. There's absolutely nothing silly about raising questions. There's nothing wrong with that. Accepting an 'answer' whose only claim to fame is being old and established is what's silly.

But in a way, it's a necessity, because we are all, in our own way, trying to understand something that for most of us is a little bit beyond our grasp. Some people, some lucky few, have these powerful transcendent experiences. And they try to describe them to us. But you've heard the old adage, how do you describe a flower to someone who's never seen one, or a taste to someone who's never tasted a food?  It might give you some small sense, or hint as to what it's like, but you'll still always be surprised when you taste, or see that thing for real. Because words cannot capture that truth.		And religion is spawned from people who are trying to lay breadcrumbs for other people to follow - and are doing it out of the best intentions. But the people who follow will invariably not have that same understanding, and in attempting to turn those words into experiences they can understand, they twist them from the truths they once embodied. Or worse, people who are not spiritually enlightened twist those words for power, or in a search for identity. And again, what was once best intentioned gets turned against its own intentions.		But keep in mind, the flaw here is not in the spirituality, or even in the words of the person who experienced and spoke them. The flaw is in US.		So the answer is not to reject spiritual words, spiritual discourse. That just means that you're closing yourself off to a greater truth, a subtle, hidden world. It's like saying "Scientists are all assholes, so physics and science must be awful."		The answer is actually to look at what it is in us that twists truths. And then to follow those breadcrumbs.

{"body":"What is interesting is that I know several Saudis and it seems that when they leave the country (vacations, post-grad studies) they are the first to get completed wasted on alcohol and weed. I have no problem alcohol or weed, but the majority cannot simply stop ('till the last drop, till the last puff').	Furthermore it seems that the majority of the Saudis that I know try their best not to be seen by other Saudis - they may judge them or worse inform people in Saudi Arabia...		I was also curious to know why they tend to go completed wasted and then I realise that to be outside of Saudi Arabia is like 'Rumspringa' of the Amish, i.e. they are not or no longer "confined" by the pressure of their country/family/state and of course they need to drink and smoke as much as they can, party as hard as possible while they are still 'free'.		Again, I have several Saudi friends and I have nothing against different cultures but what pisses me off is the hypocrisy and the lies of some...		Edit: Let's not even mention the fact that many saudis drive to bahrain to drink... when they return there is no police with breathalyzers since there is NO alcohol in the country... funny hun?!","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LIS1050144","name":"t1_cnppz1w","parent_id":"t3_2shle7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1421327436,"created_utc":1421327436}

We have no idea what kind of website this guy actually created.		The only reference to it is literally a quote from his wife saying something along the lines of "He made that website as a free speech website".		For all we know, he made a website saying "Kill the leaders of Saudi Arabia" and then after being *caught*, turned around and said "it was a free speech website!".		And making a website like this would also get you into trouble in the US, China, Russia, or any superpower.		The only thing that is seemingly outrageous about this, is the fact that they have public canings is SA. But as many people have clarified by posting actual videos of these events, this isn't some "Indiana Jones", "Roots", Spielberg-version of caning that every Westerner has been exposed to on TV.		An *actual* public caning in SA looks more like a symbolic act meant more for the public shaming aspect than an act of inflicting pain.
