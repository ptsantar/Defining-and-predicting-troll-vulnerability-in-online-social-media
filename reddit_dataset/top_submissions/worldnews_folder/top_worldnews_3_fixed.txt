{"body":"**LEO** is Low Earth Orbit, where the ISS and Hubble are. Rockets are usually said to be able to lift a specific mass to LEO. This makes it easy to compare the capability of different rockets. For example, the Saturn V could lift 118 metric tons to LEO, and the Falcon 9 can lift approximately 13 tons to LEO.		The **minimum requirements** were decided by Congress, and are the minimum capabilities (again in payload to LEO) that they want SLS to have.		The specific wording is as follows:		>	MINIMUM CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS.???	(1) IN GENERAL.???The Space Launch System developed	pursuant to subsection (b) shall be designed to have, at a	minimum, the following:	(A) The initial capability of the core elements, without	an upper stage, of lifting payloads weighing between 70	tons and 100 tons into low-Earth orbit in preparation for	transit for missions beyond low-Earth orbit.	(B) The capability to carry an integrated upper Earth	departure stage bringing the total lift capability of the	Space Launch System to 130 tons or more.	(C) The capability to lift the multipurpose crew vehicle.	(D) The capability to serve as a backup system for	supplying and supporting ISS cargo requirements or crew	delivery requirements not otherwise met by available	commercial or partner-supplied vehicles.		**Blocks** are part of the SLS's stepwise development. Instead of developing and building the final rocket in one go (which would be too costly in the current budget environment)  NASA (and Congress) decided to start out with a 70t rocket and evolve it to 130t. That way NASA can fly missions with the initial configurations whilst developing the Advanced Boosters and Upper Stages needed to get to the 130t requirement.		The Blocks are:		* Block 1, consisting of an extended shuttle external tank and 5 segment solid rocket boosters and no upper stage. (The shuttle used 4 segment SRB's)		* Block 1A, the same as Block 1 except it has [advanced boosters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System#Advanced_boosters) (currently planned to be decided by a competition)		* Block 1B, the same extended core and SRB's as Block 1 but with and exploration upper stage.		* Block 2 has both the advanced boosters and the upper stage.		The original plan was to start with Block 1 and then evolve to Block 1A and finally get to Block 2 somewhere around 2030, but the current plan will have NASA go with Block 1B from the second mission. But from what I've read the guys at Marshall Spaceflight Center are hoping to get as close to the 130 ton requirement as possible without the advanced boosters in the hope that Congress will consider it good enough and invest the money that would have gone into the boosters into missions and payloads.

{"body":"Are you talking about liquid versus solid? Liquid boosters allows for throttling, which makes it much safer (eg, it can be shut down if something wrong happens). Solid boosters work like fireworks, in which it will continue to burn no matter what, so it's extremely dangerous if something goes wrong (like the Challenger disaster). The main advantage with solid boosters is that it provides a lot more thrust compared to any liquid booster. They also tend to be comparatively cheaper. Liquid boosters tend to be more efficient, which means they can burn for longer. This is advantageous in vacuum (ie space), where air resistance and gravitational effects are much lower, so you don't need high levels of thrust to counteract those effects. 		Personally, I'm hoping for the F-1B booster (shown in Ptolemy48's picture) for the SLS, which is a liquid booster that uses a modified Saturn V engine. That's projected to improve the LEO capability of the SLS to 150 tons, which would open up a tremendous deal of possibilities. Also, having heavy-lift liquid fuel engines once again won't hurt.","depth":5,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dtnoip30","name":"t1_cmkudat","parent_id":"t1_cmkspm0","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417689830,"created_utc":1417689830}

If there's one RF game that I *must* suggest to people, even if they don't have a lot of time to get invested in a game... it's Guerrilla. RF allowed some great out-of-the-box thinking when it came to how to get around locked doors, and I loved it for that. Guerrilla is all of the over-the-top rampage of GTA, but with space cars, and completely destructible communities. Hell, the *point* is that the cops are bad, and you're *supposed* to rampage around, wrecking everything. It's *fun* to wreck everything. You can be creative in how you wreck things. There are challenges scattered around that involve wrecking things faster, wrecking things using limited supplies, and wrecking things using *unlimited* supplies. When you wreck things, you get scrap (martian currency), and scrap lets you buy more stuff to wreck harder.

The problem is that money will be spent or not spent based on other purposes and it still doesn't come up with political support necessary for something like space exploration.  Shaving that 0.5% from the DOD is only going to get it dumped into some VA hospital, a new highway, or some flood control project instead.  There are a whole lot of other places that have much more political support.		You also have people like oceanographers, climate researchers, physicists, and others who are also clamoring for scientific funding and claiming space exploration is a waste of time where their pet science projects deserve better funding as well.  Projects like the Superconducting Supercollider were put up against the ISS and lost... with a whole lot of angry scientists ticked off at NASA over that hapening.  The politics here is pretty brutal and not so simple as those advocating "Penny for NASA" seem to be implying.		I also think the whole approach that they are taking is utterly naive and ineffective for several other reasons, particularly as it isn't really getting at the grassroots level of support and really only interested in supporting robotic missions to space too.

Most of the Russian first's in the space race were due to blatent disregard for safety and cheating.   For example, Gagarin was required to bail out of his ship at 20,000 feet and parachute the rest of the way; the Soyuz capsules were not designed to accommodate multiple cosmonauts in pressure suits, so they went up without, which resulted in the death of at least one crew.  The first satellite the Russians put up gave off a radio signal.  The first satellite the US put up proved the existence of the Van Allen belt.		Also, Soviet rocket design was sufficient to get humans at least into orbit around the Moon; their issue was that their production and quality control was so bad that none of their designs worked.

As for "cheating", give me a break. An American didn't achieve orbit until a year after Gagarin. As for the pressure suit, the case you're referencing was in 1971 and literally the last cosmonaut fatality. Want to compare that record to the US? I seem to recall at least 14 other fatalities after that. Regarding Sputniks, wikipedia states "Sputnik itself provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave information about the ionosphere." Moreover, Sputnik 2 (which also carried the first living thing to space), which was launched before Explorer 1, detected Van Allen belts first. But Russian physicists did not realize the significance of this until those analyzing Explorer 1 data did. Technologically Explorer 1 was not some kind of amazing machine, but those analyzing its data did realize its significance on the Van Allen belts before Soviet scientists. 		Your analysis of the failure of N1 is just wrong. The problem with N1 was that it required a billion engines because the chief engine engineer and Korolev had hated each other as the former sent the latter to the gulag in 1930s. When Korolev died he refused to build the larger engines Korolev told him were needed, and as a result the N1 needed 40-50 engines, all with their own points of failure.","depth":16,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tsk05","name":"t1_cmko9tm","parent_id":"t1_cmknpir","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417668125,"created_utc":1417668125}

Funding is our only issue and the government seems to think we can do it by 2035 which is most likely a conservative estimate. They probably based it on the real possibility of funds not increasing for NASA. I think some private companies will like to be involved too so some of the cost may be eaten by them.		   I also think funds could increase if we knew they were spent on mars. They decreased in the past decade because the public didn't think NASA was going to do anything with it. They probably assumed, "they are just going to use the money to put another satellite up there" which is not glamorous enough. Now that the public knows they are planning a Mars trip for real I think they would be more willing to support it. I am a conservative so this is based on my conservative ideals and if a conservative feels this way liberals are probably already in the bag.

We've had a 1 ton nuclear powered robotic science tank rolling around on that planet for years. That's ignoring all the previous missions. Our problem isn't the difficulty.

{"body":"That political will was a direct product of the Cold War, though. NASA, and especially their manned programs, were pretty much an extension of foreign policy for the first couple decades of their existence. 		If you translated the levels of funding the Apollo project got during its life to today's budgets, you'd have NASA getting in the neighborhood of $50+ billion a year compared to the ~$14-18 billion they normally receive. There's pretty much no way in today's domestic political climate that you can sell that amount of public investment in programs that don't provide a lot of direct, immediate benefit to the great majority of people on the ground. Interest in and funding for Apollo dropped quickly after the initial landings for similar reasons.		I say this as someone who loves space exploration and wants to see people land on Mars and hopefully start expanding our presence permanently beyond the Earth in my lifetime. I've devoted a significant amount of my time in recent years to supporting these things. You're right that we could probably overcome the technical challenges, but in the end it's the political and value-based ones that matter and not without reason. The reason the nuclear robotic science tank happens is because it's relatively cheap (much cheaper than a manned project would be) and doesn't involve a whole lot of sacrifice for other priorities public funds have to cover on Earth.		The American public via their politicians have pretty consistently shown that the level of money NASA gets is more or less what they think it should be. To change that, you either need A) more money flowing into the federal budget through taxes (we see how well that's been going); B) To find more money in another part of the budget (plenty of options, but each one involves moral tradeoffs and pissing some segment of society off); or C) Some kind of focusing event that makes people accept a sudden, sustained increase in space funding (Sputnik, Gagarin and the Bay of Pigs worked the first time).		Outside those three things, there's little chance of selling another Apollo-level investment in manned spaceflight in the US. Fortunately though, space agencies around the world and their political allies have gotten smarter lately and started to realize that international cooperation might be a viable way to spread costs on future deep space missions. If so, we'll probably still have to wait a little while for a Mars landing, but not as long as we probably would for NASA or another agency working on their own.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NateCadet","name":"t1_cmkpxsn","parent_id":"t1_cmkmkjy","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417672133,"created_utc":1417672133}

We'd need a huge rocket, like something almost the size of a Saturn V to carry the people and stuff all the way out here.  So what *we* need to do to go to Mars and back is put that rocket there.		In order to do that, we need a much bigger rocket.  In order to carry that much bigger rocket, we need a lot more fuel.  The fuel takes up weight that needs more fuel to carry the extra weight.  In the end we end up needing something the size of like 5 Saturn Vs to do this, with the energy density a Saturn V had.		This is obviously pretty damn impractical, so we need higher energy density in the fuel, which we have, but not enough yet.

{"body":"It is far deeper than mere pessimism though.  There is even a "giggle factor" where many people in government don't even think this stuff is possible.  You should have seen the debate merely to get the FAA-AST created, where even today there are folks that think commercial spaceflight operations is still science fiction... in spite of the fact that it is a multi-billion dollar annual industry.  When Newt Gingrich talked about trying to sponsor legislation that would enable a lunar equivalent of the Homestead Act, he was ridiculed on Saturday Night Live with all of the other presidential candidates simply calling him stupid and even a lunatic for talking about people actually going to the Moon.  They didn't even really debate the actual substance of the proposal in the first place.		That is what I'm talking about here, about trying to get people to realistically think about space as being a real place as opposed to something you read about in science fiction novels.  It is why there has been not just little progress, but negative progress where a whole generation of kids think that the Apollo Moon landings never even happened in the first place.... because the agency which sent Neil Armstrong and Gene Cernan to the Moon is incapable of even sending astronauts to the ISS except on Russian hardware.		I wish it was different.  I wish there was a real goal of doing something in space, and more importantly a goal of having ordinary people like you and me be given the opportunity to go into space with something other than a lottery.  Space at the moment is a project that fuels congressional pork and something to do for the government, not a group of destinations that can really benefit mankind and in particular America.  It can be better, but I've been making that fight for decades now and NASA is **not** the agency to get mankind to Mars.

Orion is impressive because it has survived two presidential administrations since it was originally conceived, and won't actually get used until yet another person becomes president... due to constitutional limits forcing them out of office no less.

{"body":"I wasn't even going to follow the discussion any further, but I just cannot hold the fallacies.		First of all, with all respects to Neil DeGreasse Tyson, he is nobody. I think you misunderstood what I wanted to mean with *you are a nobody*. It means that you are a person for the present, as anyone else, and thus you cannot make statements for the future, because you, and anyone else, do nothing about what is going to be discovered or what is going to be change because by definition NOBODY KNOWS IT AT THE MOMENT.	You are nobody, I am nobody, Tyson is nobody. 		------------------------------------ 		Second, what really infuriates me is the tendency of people to point OPINIONS of professionals as proofs. It is called fallacy of authority and it is a very bad argument. Can Tyson show me real data and studies that shows that in one thousands years nobody will come out with something new which allows the humankind to leave the Solar System? Protip: He can't. So as far as he cannot do it, he is giving his OPINION, not facts.		To show how stupid is the fallacy of authority let me put some examples:		Sir Isaac Newton. Comparing Newton with Tyson in *open minds* for their age is, with due respect for the last, almost insulting because Newton reinvented our approach to physics thinking completely out of the box for that time and postulated physics theories that have last centuries, while Tyson has done nothing comparable in magnitude. Isaac Newton was convinced that the light was composed of particles, and that the wave theories were wrong and stupid (and he made fun many times of the physicist who defended the wave theories). He died yelling that the light wasn't a wave and that nobody would proof the opposite ever.		If in the Reddit of the XVII century, anyone would have asked him: "Hello, Mr Newton, thank you for doing the AMA. When will we be able to speak almost instantly with people standing in the antipode of us?*, he would have answered in a heartbeat "**NEVER**". 			Let me introduce you now Albert Einstein, albeit you probably know who is he. In the world of this man, the physics was already *solved*. Literally, people thought that they could not learn anything new, because with the Newton laws and some of the latest discoveries, only a few questions remained unanswered. Almost all the experiments could be explained with their theories. They had the best grasp of the fundamental physics and a huge shift in the theory won't ever happen. Albert Einstein is the man who, literally, took down the most fixed, reliable, intuitive concepts in the physics, such as the universality of the time, and modify them in such a way that nobody before him would have never, ever imagined. 		This man refused during his whole life to believe the quantum theory. The man who revolutionized the physic of his time could not accept that his own mind was to narrow to understand the new world that the new experiments showed. And there were experiments! Real data! And he couldn't believe. He even worked in the photoelectric effect, which is one of the starting points of the quantum theory! Planck, the man who solved the black body radiation paradox and introduced the concept of quanta of light said "This is only a mathematical object, a trick to solve the problem, because it is not possible for something like this to exist in our world", but that is another story. Einstein could not believe that the reality was not deterministic no matter how many proofs they showed to him, he always tried to find the *unknown variables*.		If in the Reddit of the XX century, anyone would have asked him: "Hello, Mr Einstein, thank you for doing the AMA. When do you think we will be able to use the concept provided by the quantum theory to develop technology*, he would have answered in a heartbeat "**NEVER**". Nowadays, the concepts of the quantum theory are literally everywhere and our modern technology is based on it. Einstein would have said that the chips in a computer are completely impossible to ever occur, for example.			In summary, when somebody points me the opinion of a professional or expert who is giving his opinion (because there is no data there, no theory, nothing, just an opinion) and try to pass it as a fact, it is mildly infuriating. 			------------------------------------ 		Third, and finally, if you are going to quote someone, at least try to understand what that person is saying.		Dr. Tyson said that with out CURRENT understanding of the space-time we would never be able to do it (which is not even correct, unless you can discard that ideas such as the gen ships won't be feasible even in 1000 years, which I consider that it is narrow minded), BUT he does not say that it is impossible. He just say that we cannot build tomorrow a rocket to travel to Orion, not that it is impossible to happen because with our CURRENT understanding of the physics it is not possible.		For everything else, I will just relate to the first [Clarke's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws):		>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that ... something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.		People like you, the physicist of the end XIX/early XX and, in part, Dr Tyson think that you are living *at the end of the path*, that nothing new will ever revolutionize the world and that only new small details are there to be found but we understand already the important part.  Because there is no way to say "It is impossible" if you don't think so. People along the whole history have always though the same. They always though that they were the last possible step in the evolution and that nothing big would ever change after them. People always felt entitled to think that they were the *special generations* of our specie.		Do you know how the gravity is related with the other three fundamental forces? Do you know what is the dark matter or energy? Do we know if those even exist? Hawking even  said recently that the black holes don't even exist as we know think we understand them. You look at any field and there are some serious questions to answer. Even more there are more important question which are not even thought yet. If you know any of those answers, please, go directly to Sweden to grab your Nobel prize.		We are developing sources of energy such as fusion which will change dramatically everything we know at the moment. Have you ever checked the warp motor theorized by some physicist in the NASA once they found the correct, optimized curvature field? Probably it is completely wrong and probably it will be to the future concepts as the Jule Verne's canon-shot-space-train is to the actual design of a spaceship.  We do not even know how to derive our concept of gravity in harmony with our other concepts (twin particles and quantum teleportation are two examples of direct confrontation of two of our main actual theories) and people is already saying what we will be able to do and what we won't. Amazing. Just simply amazing. 		We cannot even know how much knowledge we lack and you go and say that something is impossible. What a bold statement for a Mr Nobody of the current time.","depth":9,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EonesDespero","name":"t1_cml6po0","parent_id":"t1_cml06ct","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417720033,"created_utc":1417720033}

POTUS will likely change every 8 years, and you need to be too far along for the new guy to say "why am I carrying water for the previous rival administration?"  The political commitment doesn't even need to be a large amount of money, since a Mars mission over 10 years could probably fit in 20% of NASA's budget, but Congress dictates how NASA spends money, and they have to allocate NASA funds to pursue that goal, whatever the goal is.)		Then you say "what is the critical technology we need to get there?"  You build that, and only that, and do the mission.		NASA is kind of building some interesting technology, and then finding ways to justify it[1], by saying "hey, if we do a Mars mission some day, maybe we will use this."

{"body":"> I disagree that a private company like SpaceX could ever muster the trillions of dollars required for a manned Mars mission.... :(		You have no idea what Elon is building.		His modular robotic manufacturing technology is the envy of the world. Tesla is dominating the electric market when everyone else is hemorrhaging money. His partnership (and part ownership) with Solar City and the Super Charger network combined with nation wide battery storage is a revolution in sustainable energy just waiting to happen. The Gigafactory is going up to double lithium battery production, by the time it's fully opperational we will probably be two more generations into advancing that field with either full lithium anodes and diodes or some carbon based solution. Either way we are talking about orders of magnitude more world wide storage capacity and density. And multiple factories are already in the works, seems like Elon can't get enough land.		SpaceX with Google are talking about creating a new standard platform for small form factor satellites deployed in mass in low earth orbit mesh networked constellations. Instead of big fat expensive sats in high orbit constant resupplies of upgrades could be provided by the soon to be partially reusable Falcon 9 stack. That means things like low latency satellite internet that can scale nearly infinitely for pennies per customer. Non-directional, planet wide. You can WoW with friends in Antarctica while you sip margaritas from the deck of your boat in the middle of the Caribbean, whatever.		SpaceX itself was created as a **Mars program**. You aren't reading that wrong the only reason SpaceX exists at all is because Elon want's to go to Mars personally. He is using is business and engineering acumen to make a profitable company to lower the price of orbit to achieve that goal, not to enrich himself. He has much better ways to enrich himself that I have already outlined, he is in **spend mode**. SpaceX is his greatest legacy. The gift of making us a multi-planet species, just because he can and nobody else is doing it. Not all capitalists only think of the bottom line, money is just the means to the end.		Elon barring any accidents or assassinations will be the most powerful man in the world. Within two decades, he able to move capital that only governments previously dreamed of, literally moving heaven and Earth where ever and however he damn well feels like.		Go ahead and use the remindme bot, mark my words, [Elon will be Elon](http://imgur.com/a/yhvDH).		Edit: Check out /r/spaceX if you are interested in learning more. In about a week SpaceX is returning the first stage of the Falcon 9 going to the International Space Station and landing it under power vertically on a barge or as Elon says ["Autonomous spaceport drone ship"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/536262624653365248).

{"body":"We don't have the technology to create a self-supporting closed system for habitation in space.  I'm fully familiar with the ISS and oxygen generation through electrolysis, carbon scrubbing blah blah.  ISS still needs oxygen and water from Earth.  There are no huge gardens on the ISS to provide food or create oxygen. There is a reason for that.  What you don't realize is how incredibly difficult if not impossible it would be for us to reach Mars and return given our current technology. And there is no way to test the effect of three years in space in small, cramped quarters other than to put someone on the ISS for three years straight and see if they don't go bananas.  But all of that pales in comparison to loss of bone density and muscle atrophy due to zero gravity. After a year in space the astronauts won't be in good shape to walk around the surface of Mars.  And all of that pales even more when compared to the problem of deep space radiation.  We simply don't know what to do about right now other than to build a some gigantic spacecraft with meters and meters of super dense shielding.  How much would it cost to get all that lead up there?  For us to go to Mars and have anyone come back alive we need revolutions in our technology. The first is a revolution in a propulsion system.  The trip is not feasible with chemical rockets. People have theories about ion drives and all that but nothing real and practical has been built.  Second we need to develop a self-sustaining, closed system that can support human life.  That's even harder than a faster propulsion system.  Third we need a way to protect humans from deep space radiation that doesn't involve us building a small moon.  Fourth, and hardest, is that we need a way to simulate gravity so that the astronauts are actually able to do their jobs and remain healthy.  Blind optimism won't get us to Mars.  Or anywhere else.

Rosetta is rad, but it's... not really any reason to assume that a gigantic space agency that receives a billion dollars a year more funding than the ESA (Europe), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japanese), DLR (Germany), and the CNSA (China) combined is somehow a has-been in space exploration. If NASA doesn't have the funding, experience, and brainpower to do it, *nobody* does.

This isn't even the soonest *currently* planned mission to Mars. The [Inspiration Mars Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars) has one planned for 2018.		IMO, chances are slim that the 2018 mission will fly.

{"body":"Yes, robots are amazing, and I love them. Please don't misunderstand me, I am not against the use of robots for space exploration.	However, your view that we shouldn't try to send people to Mars for cost and safety concerns is rather... not popular. I understand if you just want to save money, in which case we should have no Space exploration at all. On the other hand Mars landing would be the very first time humans have landed on an actual planet beyond Earth itself. To achieve it safely would mean another step forwards to our expansion outside Earth. Further we needed to develop new Space Suits anyway; the current suits are fine under Moon's gravity, but on Mars they would be too heavy.		And really, as far as safety is concerned, everyone involved know the risks. No one is being forced to go to Mars. More people kill themselves climbing Mt Everest every year.

The chances of a manned NASA mission to Mars are very small over a timeframe of at least 30 years.		It's not even certain that they'll be able to finish the Space Launch System at this rate. They only have enough money to test Orion **once every four years**. The [average NASA budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA) from 1965 through 1969 was $35 billion in 2014 dollars, compared to $17 billion in 2014.		The upfront cost of invading Iraq was enough to pay NASA's current budget for 100 years, and the extended costs, including all future costs for veterans, would pay for an Apollo era NASA budget for 170 years.		Elon Musk's total fortune is about 4 months worth of Apollo era NASA spending.		However, it is very possible that the asteroid mission will be accomplished, because there's money in that. Most likely Orion will see fairly good use as an asteroid rendezvous platform, and it might be used for helping set up a robotic asteroid mining operation.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mutatron","name":"t1_cmkkxgq","parent_id":"t3_2o76tv","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417661288,"created_utc":1417661288}

People don't get as excited over rovers as they do about real humans. This sounds cheesy, but history has shown it to be true. In the 60's the US had huge public excitement for the Apollo programs, and 15 years later we had a *massive* spikes in students graduating from the sciences with desires and dreams of technologies inspired in their youth by the Apollo missions. There's no coincidence that in the late 1970s and mid 1980s, the US transitioned from a standard manufacturing nation, into a nation known for innovations and technological revolutions. The emergence of the internet, personal computing, and the countless wireless technologies all happened in the US within a decade of this spike of motivated college graduates, and multiple surveys and studies down over the years have shown that in the 80s most science graduates stated the Apollo program was what sparked their desire to study the sciences in school. 		**Reason Two**, human spaceflight forces the development of human-centered technology, which translates into technologies that improve the lives of humans on Earth. Sending a robot probe to Mars, or sending a rover to Venus... honestly, that doesn't do shit for the humans back home. Even the science they gather, while nice to know, doesn't *really* change lives. No one's life was bettered by the fact that NASA knows the elemental make up of a rock on Mars that a robot drilled into. NASA building more probes means spending a billion dollars making a machine, and making instruments for machines, but it's dead end research. Researching better probes for Venus doesn't help anyone, and the science they get about Venus doesn't really do anything. It's nice to know the content of Venus's soil, but that science doesn't change a single thing or matter to any normal people on Earth. Meanwhile, send people to you moon and now you are building technologies that **humans** will be using. NASA is forced to develop water filtration systems, radiation shielding, new ways to recycle greenhouse materials, new clothing materials for humans, new ways of storing food...		You say human spaceflight costs more than robotic spaceflight, but you're ignoring what each of them get us in the end. 		You seem to think the "space data" is all that matters, when in reality regular people get nothing out of that. People want new advancements in technology that better their lives, and it's really only the human spaceflight that creates things and spurs developments that literally revolutionizes entire economies and improve cultural habits.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Namika","name":"t1_cmkl4nk","parent_id":"t1_cmkk521","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417661694,"created_utc":1417661694}
