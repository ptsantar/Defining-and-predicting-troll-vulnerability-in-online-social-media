{"body":"The fact that this study was done in mice is very important because the induction of the Alzheimer pathology in mice is different than that in humans. For example, we used to think that the accumulation of amyloid plaque resulted in Alzheimer's, but no amount of over-expression of amyloid plaque in the mice brain will lead to symptoms of Alzheimer's. Different transgenic mouse lines will have different aspects of Alzheimer's, but not the complete package. Such as the lack of neurofibrillary tangles or significant neuronal loss in APP or APP/PS1 mice (key elements of human Alzheimer's)- even though they have some behavioral defects. 		In addition, the concept of 'restoring' memory function depends largely on the extent/progression of the disease. Just removing the plaque won't fix or replace the damaged/missing neurons in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex.

If I find a better one, I will post it. http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/8/6/301.full		:edit 2: I've received some questions regarding the validity of mice research in general. I would like to point out that disease research with mice is still incredibly valuable and important for the vast majority of diseases. Mice share 95% of our genome, which combined with sophisticated genetic tools, makes them a powerful tool to figure out what is happening on the cellular and molecular level. No other organism allows us that degree of flexibility with the immediate physiological 'relevance' to humans. The human nervous system is simply orders of magnitude more complex than a mouse's; as such, it is natural that disease pathologies in the brain may not map one-to-one between mice and humans. Even if that is the case, there is still no better tool to discovering eventual cures than mice. 		:edit 3: Thank you for the reddit gold mysterious stranger!","depth":1,"score":1480,"ups":1480,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Totoro_101","name":"t1_cpjstd5","parent_id":"t1_cpjq46r","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426771793,"created_utc":1426768193}

There are plenty of individuals that live long, cognitively intact lives and at autopsy have their brains riddled with aB plaques. The reverse is also true. 		The solution for Alzheimer's will likely not be a cure for the pathology once it has set in, it will be a prevention (likely gene therapy) to stop it from ever beginning. Once those neurons are gone, they are gone. Period. Even though the hippocampus has the greatest potential for new neurogenesis, those new neurons will not just fit snuggly into those previous pathways. You'd be starting with a blank neuronal canvas.

Then there's the neuropsychologist that assess cognition, behavior, and affective very precisely to measure *severity* and patterns of impairment in conjunction with imaging and biomedical data.

However, the Late-Onset variant (99% of AD diagnoses) is not caused by a familial genetic variant; its caused by sporadic polymorphisms, chief among them APOE.

The answer to the question will turn explicitly on how similar or dissimilar an animal model is on perhaps a disease-specific basis, but you can see my point if you imagine an extreme value - mice studies are useful (made up number) 5% of the time, pig studies useful (another made up number) 70% of the time, as determined by follow-up studies in humans.

While your point stands in the case of drugs or research that make it to follow up studies in humans, the value of mouse (or fruitfly) studies is actually more concentrated in the drugs/research that *don't* make it to human studies, because the observed effects in mice are severely negative. Every time we rule out a drug because it kills $10,000 worth of lab mice, we've just saved ourselves $90,000 worth of pigs, or $490,000 worth of chimps. (numbers similarly made up)		What we're doing when we study mice isn't so much going, "okay, let's see if this treatment harms/helps mice, and then we can move up to chimps/humans" as going, "okay, let's see if this treatment *harms* ***mammals***," by using the cheapest mammal.		The reason this works is because, even though mice and humans are different in a whole lot of important ways, the ways that humans and mice are the same are *even more important*, because those are the basic systems that all mammalian life depends on in order to survive. If a drugs disrupts those shared systems in one mammal, chances are very good that it will disrupt them in all mammals.		tl;dr: Mice are much better for ruling out drugs based on toxicity/severe side-effects than they are for determining the actual therapeutic value of said drugs in humans.","depth":5,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MemeticParadigm","name":"t1_cpjyvom","parent_id":"t1_cpjw72x","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426783976,"created_utc":1426780376}

{"body":"tl;dr		The movie Her is a good example because a man felt real emotions but for something that never existed, his brain was just fooled into thinking that she was real and so it attached just as much meaning as if she had been real.  		What is so special about conciseness?		At the root of things we are all just atoms in a universe that will eventually be resolved to maximum enthalpy and cease to perform anything meaningful. (<--- Current accepted fate of the expanding universe)  		So with that in mind, we have to define moral worth.  Worth is only as valuable as it is perceived to be.  So from our point of view, humans are at the top of scale, we are morally worth the most.  Something like a mouse is very far down the scale and so we are willing to end their lives, [millions a year in the UK alone,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_mouse#Legislation_in_research) over only the hope that we can use them to further our well being.   		If some how we could give the mouse the ability to speak, and th cognitive ability to share its thoughts on the matter I'm sure the mouse would place his or her race far higher up on the moral totem pole of value.  Slavery is a prime example of even members of the same species disagreeing on what has moral value.  		Okay, getting very far off topic here. Bringing it back around.  			What makes conciseness so morally valuable? While hard to define, it is though of as being our ability to comprehend our own existence and a feeling of selfhood.  Comprehending your existence isn't a human exclusive. That [parrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_%28parrot%29) Alex asked about himself.  So the idea that humans are the only thing capable of understanding our own specific existence is just naive.  Selfhood is the understanding that you are the subject of a unique experience.  		None of these things should give something any special worth or value.  You could make a computer that experiences things just like you, but at the end of the day it's just a human creation.  Like a character in a book or a god in the sky, hurting it doesn't make it anymore palpable.  		If humans get to the point where a digital brain can exactly replicate, atom for atom, a biological human brain it will function as our brains do.  This is an exact replica, but that's all it is. 		A replica is a replica, it isn't real.  You can make a fake brain experience pain, but that doesn't mean the pain is actually causing any effect.  All it's doing is calling on some computer code to simulate nerve signals which release chemicals in the brain.  Some more computer code will be processed and then the brain will react as the programmer told it to.  		Just because something behaves as it does in the real world doesn't mean it should gain any moral significance. Since moral value is just a human construct A simulated brain will gain as much moral value as a real one if you think of it as a real brain.  		Some people cry after watching a sad movie or reading a sad book.  This doesn't make the events or characters real in any way.  If a character in a movie murders someone that moral significance doesn't translate onto the actor.  		What I'm trying to say is this.  A simulation will only ever be a representation of the real world, it will never become it.  A simulation can even trick you into thinking it's real but, like Santa Clause, that doesn't make things real.  		That movie Her is a really good example.

That's a very general overview and leaves a lot out, but it's the bare skeleton of the disease. Since the whole thing is a feedback loop, it's all but impossible to say what starts the disease off in non-familial AD.

Familial AD accounts for only 13% of Early Onset AD, before the age of 65, however, and so is not thought to be typical).		We really just don't know what causes AD at all.

{"body":"That's a really good question and it depends on the model of Alzheimer's disease you choose. Despite the time and money spent on AD research there are several theories out there (some more plausible than others). 		If you are looking at fixing AD per se, by removing the AB plaques, tau tangles, and memory impairment, it may not have an effect on "aging" on the whole body. It would allow those with AD reverse symptoms, and perhaps extend lifespan by several years.		 "Aging", however is different. From what I recall, aging is the term given to the process that occurs over time which decreases the body's ability to perform it's normal functions. Aging should contribute to AD and it's symptoms, but the mechanism of AD is still debated. Are AB plaques a consequence of inefficient protein folding, inefficient protein clearance, or overproduction of a specific protein (APP)? These pathways have been found to result in AB plaques in genetically engineered mice models and/or hypothesized from human studies, and if this experiment of clearing AB works and has downstream consequences of restoring memory function, it will help AD. 		However for the question of whether this would help aging depends on what else they find. Aging has been contributed to many things including DNA damaging mechanisms such as UV rays, oxidants which can damage proteins as well, or telomere shortening in DNA. If the clearance of protein using this study in the brain can affect the reasons just mentioned, it could have direct effects on the study of preventing aging. However, since this is a study focused on removing protein from the brain and not (conclusively) affecting protein misfolding, DNA damage, and other suspected causes of aging, this study might not work for aging on the whole.

{"body":"The US public is somewhat concerned, but doesn't *really* care because it is happening during the Super Bowl, they are told they will lose their jobs if they protest, and many new jobs are opening up during "the Transition".		Also, a month in a profitability study is concluded indicating that "curing" disease is not profitable. New testing, focused on creating and maintaining erections, weight loss, depression, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, suppressing manopause, and increasing libido are performed.		There are many casualties and at the one year mark, many of the subjects are suffering from their incarceration and testing. This makes many of the psychological test results useless. The subjects who are deemed unfit for psychology modifying drug testing are considered lower quality and more risky therapies are attempted on them.		After two years many of the initial crop are dead or insane. The myriad of tests have resulted in a significant mortality rate and ruined the potential for further testing on most subjects. The remainder are now undergoing radical forms of surgical alteration. The primary focus is on high end plastic surgery as it has the best return on investment.

I'm not sure if the history of our own timeline or intuition learned in this reality are a great guide for what might be possible in an alternative reality. That seems a bit circular. As for ethics, that's highly subjective. For example, a coldly logical society might wager that many more people will suffer and die prematurely from a certain disease than would need to be used as unwilling test subjects to cure it much sooner, and therefore conclude that it's unethical *not* to experiment on unwilling human subjects. I also never said they had to be unwilling. Citizens of the logical society might reason that they will be more likely to benefit from the cure than to be chosen as test subjects, and therefore consent to some sort of random selection process. As for selfishness, we are all ultimately selfish, it's just a matter of how direct it is. Whatever a society or a person chooses to do is because at some level they have reasoned it to be in their overall best interest, so this argument means nothing. Selfish reasoning could take you either way depending on how you see things. Also, wouldn't even a corrupt and by all accounts evil and blatantly selfish powerful elite *want* to cure diseases that could affect them or their family and friends, if all it meant was sacrificing some peasants?

{"body":"Tagging onto top comment because I think this is quite important.		I went to the Alzheimer's Research UK conference last week and (as usual) there was a lot of talk about AB removal from the brain.  In particular I watched a lecture by Prof Nick Fox of UCL who pioneered an MRI technique that allows direct overlay of MRI at different timepoints to watch a change in brain mass over time.  He found that the average person loses 0.4% of brain mass every year, while a person with AD loses 4% a year.		Of particular relevance to this study is that they monitored brain density change after administering an antibody that removes AB from the brain.  His team found that over several months this actually INCREASED the rate at which the brain tissue dies, and the study was halted.  It was suggested that this was part of an inflammatory response to the removal of AB.			The general consensus in discussion about this afterwards is that either:		a) AB is largely unrelated to brain atrophy (unpopular)	b) AB only has an effect early on in AD and doesn't cause neuronal death itself, rather it activates other pathways which once activated don't turn off (most popular).	c) AB is a sign of AD/atrophy, but not a cause.		Also, what /u/totoro_101 said is spot on - you can't restore something which has already died.  I'd like to expand on something that redditor touched on too, these transgenic mice have just been mutated to show just a single pathogenic pathway that is present in AD out of the hundreds of thousands of things going on.  Then researtchers are curing that one thing and claiming they have a cure for AD.  its absolutely trash research that speaks volumes about how funding for science works.  All the money is held by dinosaurs who still believe the theories proposed 50 years ago (they may have helped form them) and unless you mention the special key words (AB, or to a lesser extent Tau) you don't get the money.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tehforsh","name":"t1_cpkvg7t","parent_id":"t1_cpjq46r","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426852228,"created_utc":1426848628}

{"body":"Is this the same technique as HIFU? I'm in the process of submitting a journal article studying HIFU in treating atrial fibrillation and certain cancers right now, and it's a very non-specific technique. The way it works is that the very high intensity ultrasound beams deposit the vast majority of their mechanical energy (they're sound waves remember) at the focus of their beam, centimeters below the surface of the tissue. This energy deposition results in heating and increased temperature in the area immediately around the focus of the beam. Once the local temperature gets high enough, essential proteins for cellular life denature (unfold) and cells die.  		This process is called thermal ablation, and it destroys **all** the cells in the area around the focus. This makes it a very promising therapy for diseases like cancer (especially bone metastases and organs like the heart and liver) because you can destroy all **all** of the cells in a very small region without damaging the tissue between the focus and the surface of the body. But it's completely nonspecific. I.e. it wouldn't destroy just the amyloid plaques if applied in the brain, but **all** of the tissue at the beam focus.		A thermal ablation technique doesn't seem like a likely treatment to me, but I could understand a lower intensity treatment designed to deposit enough energy to disrupt the structure of the plaques without damaging functional tissue or inducing sufficient heating to cause ablation.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jpgray","name":"t1_cpjw2f1","parent_id":"t1_cpjszmi","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426779137,"created_utc":1426775537}

{"body":"I think it's interesting stuff, but a couple of points to consider before everyone gets too excited. The plaques referred to are made up of aymloid beta, a small peptide generated from the larger protein APP. This isn't the first research to clear amyloid plaques from the brain; AD patients were treated with an A-beta vaccine, which resulted in plaque clearance but no real effect on cognitive decline.		Second is that these are mouse models. We don't really have any spot-on models on AD in mice. Most of the models represent version of familial AD rather than the sporadic form and none completely give the full picture. For instance, some mouse models feature plaques but with no accompanying neurofibrillary tangles (problematic given how much of the damage may be due to tau). And of course the biggest risk factor for AD is age, which is something not simulated in the lab mice.		All in all, I'd say this research is promising. The memory improvement in the mice is certainly interesting, but it's important to bear in mind that the mice likely don't have the exact same condition as people. I should also mention I haven't read the paper, on the abstract and press release, but these are my first thoughts.

{"body":"IIRC, for AD to be diagnosed, two features have to be present: the amyloid plaques (which this study looked at, albeit in mice) and neurofibrillary tangles inside cells (made of the protein tau). If you don't have these two, it's another kind of dementia. Complicating the fact is that plaques can occur in cognitively intact individuals and some sorts of tangles can be seen in non-AD neurodegenerative conditions called tauopathies.			As of the moment, I believe the only way Alzheimer's can be properly diagnosed is post mortem, when you can see the plaques and tangles in brain tissue. Obviously this isn't helpful, and the search for biomarkers is ongoing.			Due to the prevalence of AD (it's the most common neurodegenerative disease), doctors can often assume they're seeing a case of AD when they're actually seeing someone with a slightly rarer form of dementia. This can result in misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment being prescribed (though for most dementias we can't really do anything).

{"body":"Just to clarify; it is very well established that the deficits in Alzheimer's are caused by protein plaques. What's not firmly established is why they begin misfolding in such high quantities (low levels of plaques are normal with age).		The reason removing the plaques after the establishment of the disease in a subject may not frequently cause remission, is that significant neurodegeneration may have already occurred.		One of the reasons that studies of amyloid vaccines do not succeed in humans is that amyloid proteins are not the only protein fragments associated with the pathophysiology of the disease. Tau proteins are also involved, and so it's likely that while preventing amyloid protein accumulation reduced the progression of the disease, tau misfolding would have continued unabated. We need something that can remove all of the plaques associated with the disease, not just a subset.		Clearing the amyloid plaques is most certainly the first step in curing Alzheimer's disease. The plaques are the cause of the actual damage to neurons. If you remove existing plaques and prevent further accumulation, the progression of the disease should stop. Going from there, the next step is increasing neuroregeneration.

{"body":"Just to clarify one aspect of this study; if this could be successfully applied to humans, it would theoretically halt the progression of the disease, but it will not erase the damage already done.		If the progression is halted and the existing plaques removed, there is a good chance that the brain may recover somewhat given that brains are amazingly good at recovering from damage (even recovering lost "data"), but this would be fairly hindered in elderly patients due to the fact that these neuroregenerative capabilities tend to decline significantly with age (due to reduced cell division, programmed downregulation of certain key genes with age, accumulated gene damage, etc).		After some thought, my best guess at a next step once the problematic plaques have been countered would be as following:		**A) Administer agents that increase the production of neurotrophic factors** (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Nerve Growth Factor, Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, etc). It will require further research, but if intentional age-related downregulation of their associated genes is the main reason for the reduced levels in elderly individuals (and not actual damage to their associated genes), there are already agents that could serve this purpose. Russian-developed *N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester* also known as "Noopept" is associated with increased production of BDNF and NGF in the rat brain (and has successfully been used to increase cognitive capabilities in a human pilot study using brain-trauma patients).		**B) Administer agents that increase neurovascular supply** (increase both blood flow and venous tissue penetration). Piracetam is a novel agent capable of increasing blood flow without impairing clotting (important for elderly individuals who are more vulnerable to developing bleeds), by increasing blood cell flexibility (essentially making it easier for blood cells to be squeezed past occlusions or into smaller spaces). It additionally exerts a direct neurochemical influence (albeit subtle) on the brain's signalling, which has been observed to be slightly beneficial for underperforming brains (though it does not exert an observable benefit in healthy brains).		Additionally, increasing angiogenesis (though carefully and with verification of an absence of cancerous tumours that may be fed by increased blood supply) is a goal to ensure that new neurons can be supported, as microcirculation may have been compromised by the plaque accumulation (or through normal age related means). Various active compounds derived from the plant Centella asiatica have been found to moderately promote increased microcirculation.		**C) Administer agents that increase the resilience of existing tissue to promote an ideal environment for regeneration to occur.** These would include the administration of acetylcysteine to ensure Glutathione (an important antioxidant, particularly for the brain and the liver) stores are optimal. Additionally, a combination of supplemental Coenzyme Q10 and Pyrroloquinoline quinone would provide increased mitochondrial support (with PQQ being particularly advantageous in that it increases mitochondrial proliferation; which may have been particularly impacted by the protein plaques characteristic of the disease).		Antioxidants are relevant (though not particularly useful for the untreated condition) to Alzheimers in that the cell death caused by the protein plaques causes the release of stored neurotransmitters, one of which called "Glutamate", serves to "excite" neurons. When released in significant quantities (such as when a cell "bursts") however they can cause the overexcitation of surrounding neurons. Aside from possibly damaging surrounding neurons, this causes increased metabolic demand as it occurs all over the brain. Increased metabolic activity increases production of "reactive oxygen species" which can cause secondary damage to tissue. This is what ensuring proper antioxidant support serves to protect against.		**D) Ensuring proper nutritional support for optimal neuroregeneration.** Neuroregeneration may be hindered by slight deficiencies in various important nutrients. Ensuring a proper diet would be crucial to success, and if required, the addition of supplementary forms of various nutrients (B-Vitamins and protein in particular).		I have followed both the current Alzheimer's research, and the various compounds I have described here. Do note that many have been tested in isolation and are very (or at all) effective at actually treating the cause of dementia, or reducing symptoms if it is still progressing. No amount of antioxidants or neurotrophic agents are going to override the extensive damage caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, so until that base cause is stopped, they can only provide little benefit.		However, based on what I've read of the literature, I highly suspect that a cocktail combination of these in concert would be extremely beneficial to a post-Alzheimer's patient should our ability to treat the root cause of the disease advance. Alone, each may only provide a small benefit, because there are several factors required for increased brain tissue damage recovery. Increasing antioxidants alone, or increasing neurovascular supply will exert only a small benefit, because each are only one part of the puzzle. But together, there very well could be a profound positive reaction.		I look forward to seeing where this new research takes us.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GetOutOfBox","name":"t1_cpk3css","parent_id":"t3_2zkgiv","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426791080,"created_utc":1426787480}

For example, we used to think that the accumulation of amyloid plaque resulted in Alzheimer's, but no amount of over-expression of amyloid plaque in the mice brain will lead to symptoms of Alzheimer's. Different transgenic mouse lines will have different aspects of Alzheimer's, but not the complete package. Such as the lack of neurofibrillary tangles or significant neuronal loss in APP or APP/PS1 mice (key elements of human Alzheimer's)- even though they have some behavioral defects.

This occurs in most aging adults but for 80% of people with dementia this is occurring rapidly. This is why some are stating that through proper diet we can slow down the progression.		The recent cure that I read about involved injecting air bubbles into the BBB (Brain Blood Barrier), using ultrasound to burst the bubbles, creating a micro opening to the brain and allowing proteins to enter and dissolve the beta-amyloid plaque.
