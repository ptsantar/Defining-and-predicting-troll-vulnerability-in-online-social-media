{"body":"Corruption is everywhere, frim third world countries to more stable ones.		My family and I lived in Colombia up until I was 13, I am now 29. We left because we were threatened by tye Guerrilla. My father was a radio/tv journalist and we were beginning to do well financially.		One day as my mither and father drove back from raking my grandmother ti the hospital they were intercepted by 4 vehicles. One man sat next to my father in the car and the other back with my mother.		They were taken to the outskirts of the city where they were separated; as my father was beat and tortured my mother was raped multiple times.		They were lined up for execution and one of the guerrilleros approached my father.	He said that because of his position, if they wanted to survive and keep on living, he was to alter any radio/tv scripts he did for his job so they would have code messages for other guerrilleros in the country.		My father agreed wanting to live, and they were allowed to leave... Soon after they arrived at the police station to file a report, only to be greeted by the very same gunmen who worked there as chief.		We left the country within a week. Lost a lot... Were forced to start over again in the U.S.A... then of course 911 happened and citizenship was denied tonus despies our crisis and once again, after living i  the states for 5 years we have to move someplace else.		We now live in Canada and thank God nothing bad has happened.			Corruption is everywhere. It forgives no one, and destroys lifes.		Many people go through life surviving it. I don't wish it to anyone. I have gone and lived through many more things enough to twist my mind. But have somehow managed to pull through.		If any of you have suffered as I have or worse. It never gets any easier. You only get better at it. We never know when life will come crashing through our doora.

That's where everything has to start. How many years did it take for the american civil rights movement to achieve equality? It's still in progress. You can say "well after one protest we're still not living in a world filled with rainbows so i guess  protest is useless" that's not how it works. It's a step by step process. I see people protesting, i want to know what it's about, I learn, I agree, I become an agent of change too, and so on.

You're saying they failed because they didn't have a heirarchial structure and a clear message. Yet I've already demonstated how, even lacking those, they did an excellent job of getting their message out on a *global scale*. That's incredibly impressive. I'd say another thing the occupy movement achieved is demonstrating that unstructured movements can also have a great impact.		do you really think the whole thing would've gone down differently if they'd had a leader and a clear set of policies? The mainstream attacked their lack of organisation because it was the only things they could attack. If they'd had a leader the attack would've instead been on their personal affiliations or biases. It's simply a way of trying to dismiss them. Do you think if they'd had a leader and a set of policies that wall street would've said "yep, you're right, we're closing down today and forever" and policians would've decided the same day to redistribute the wealth of the 1% to the 99%? No. So saying "it didn't work because they didn't have a leader to make demands" is stupid. Demands and leaders wouldn't have made a difference. Getting the message out is the first step.

{"body":"Just sticking it up onto the executive branch is at most a naivety. Our main problem is about the Congress and Senate where a bunch of rich assholes get their way through corruption as they like.		The current president of the Senate (Renan Calheiros) has been involved in MAJOR corruption schemes since the 90s, there's a scheme named after him (Renangate) that was about construction companies paying his personal expenses and of an out-of-marriage daughter.		The current president of the Congress (Eduardo Cunha) has been involved in schemes since the 90s, starting with the PC Farias case (which caused an impeachment of the then presidente Fernando Collor) his name has appeared on major corruption schemes which defrauded our health system, education, infrastructure works etc.		Then we have people battling against the fucking president, a president is not an imperator or king, he/she has no absolute power and major corruption scandals almost always will envolve people from the two houses, we got 500+ deputies that are mostly corrupt, 80+ senators that can be involved in corruption schemes without repercussions (because they are also responsible for judging themselves).		So yeah, you can love our country but it seems that you don't understand how politics works, try to educate yourself in that to fight something :/		P.S.: No, I didn't vote for Lula or Dilma and if the first thing you thought to reply me was something along those lines it just show how our current political polarization has caused major gaps in communication, we should be striving to make this country better not create in-fights between who voted in who to lead our executive branch.","depth":2,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"piva00","name":"t1_crg7ic8","parent_id":"t1_crg3dgl","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432208513,"created_utc":1432204913}
{"body":"IMO more than the PT, the problem is the PMDB. Think about it. They are a monolith of a party, that has no ideological coherence- Movement for Democratic Brazil? That was a leftover from the MDB during the Military regime, that they succeeded. They get by on that name that is recognized at that time. But after Democracry, the MDB should have disbanded- there are a bunch of different ideas inside it, and not a of it is coherent. It's why all the regional state PMDB leaderships conflict, as to policy and alliances. Don't get me wrong, there are honest people in it, but the PMDB is the worst symptom of our democracy- candidates in a party for the name of the brand and electoral capacity, as opposed to ideological coherency. It's why Temer always gets to act like he doesn't control any of the party (which is why Renan and Cunha are now attacking the president, despite being in the same party and both also being part of the corruption scheme according to the reports). They effectively hold the congress hostage as they have the majority- the PT had to ally with them and compromise during the mensalao to get anything done. And that's what the mensalao was- getting money to get support. The PT's corruption is a symptom of the ails of our democracy- but the PMDB is one of the causes. How fucked up is it that they don't send out a presidential candidate despite being the biggest party in the country? It's because they don't stand for something so it's hard to have a coherent national campaign that will rally everyone. Instead they just back all the horses, because they know anyway that whoever gets into power will have to sleep with them (FHC did it too...). We need parties that actually stand for something, instead of like what, 6 (or 5?) different worker's parties (how many nuances can you have really?), a monolith of a party that doesn't stand for anything (PMDB), and parties of opportunists (PSD).

I've friends who both work (doctors/nurses) and use the system, and they have to defend it pretty often because of these kinds of misconceptions about the it. I also have some bad examples, like doctors being 2h late to work often and working less than what they should, but it shouldn't be a general rule.

So, is it gulty until proven innocent? "That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence." You can't just say there are ties when, so far, none of the whistleblowers even mentioned her name. This kind of behaviour only weakens the movement for change.

It's more like an executive order. In China, the situation is complicated, young people does not know/ does not want to know the subject, and older people don't talk about it either. The government censors everything about the subject, and as the way it turned out there is no doubt that the present government would have considered the action as mishandled. However, there is a dilemma, we knew very little in 1989. Now we can see how revolution in Russia turned out and we reflect on it (and how badly it went for them) and how we did under the communist party, the disparity is obvious. Clearly those people in the square had the good intent but are they capable of carrying them out and fixing and pushing a country forward to where it is now? 30 years ago we were bleak poor, today, we have the largest/second largest economy on the planet, and we're still producing progress every day. Would such a thing be possible with the lawlessness that's seen in Russia and the former soviets state after the dominant power has been toppled and a vacuum filled by opportunitists who later became oligarchs? The communists themselves changed too. They're now holding a flexible ideology and exclusively focusing on lifting the living condition of the people, and they have largely succeeded.

{"body":"Ok. If you really want to get into what is bias. During the Lula and Dilma regime, there were lots of clear signs of financial and economic stupidity. Lots of them. Lula handed the brazilian fed and economy to neo-liberalists, and they got of on extremely high interest rates and no investment on infrastructure whatsoever. One of the more annoying issues is how that has caused our public debt to skyrocket as a result- banks were raking in enormous amounts of money, and there was a while where you could make an easy 10% return on brazilian investments: interest rate was around 6-7% and with the currency appriciation, you'd make an easy 3-4% extra after when you sell the brazilian bonds. Warren Buffet was active in Brazil for a bit because of that (not saying he exploited us- it's really just a man seeing an investment opportunity and taking it, if it were not him it'd be some other guy, it's our fault for offering such a ridiculous deal). All the while, we use the bulk of the money we got and reinvested in american bonds at a return of 1-2%. There's been lots and lots of signs of how bad these governments were. They were pointed out by some elements of brazilian media. Yet all the pieces you saw between 2006-2012 in western media was either a piece to promote the brazilian government, or criticize brazil without actually talking about politics. So if I were to say there was a bias, it's also of not calling these governments out, in part at least because it serves interests to keep these countries in such a way (a country the size of brazil without corruption and with more social development would be alot more of an economic and political giant than it already is, and USA would lose influence in the region...), and also because there is equally some corruption there (most blatantly the fact that PwC was auditing Petrobras for fucking 12 years, and never "caught" the blatant corruption and syphoning of funds that was happening- this is actually less on Petrobras than on PwC because from what I've studied and the papers I've read about auditing companies, they are a fucking joke). 		Also about your point: except in this case there have been massive protests in Brazil against corruption. Would this not qualify as something newsworthy then, more so than the brazil blogger decapitated, especially since I would say most of the population supports the protests, and more than 50% say they adhere to them at least in spirit....

{"body":"Yeah, we are the continent that could be forgotten and no one would remember- not rich enough like the west, not developing fast like Asia, and not as miserable as Africa. Except I do think at least in Brazil there are signs that the corruption is changing- the recent movements have all been social grass-roots movements against the politicians, that werent driven by populist politicians (I would say populism is maybe one of the biggest issues in Brazilian government). Only private people. Like no offense, but this whole article is basically a knee jerk reaction and half these comments are borderline racist/offensive. Also I will always be proud of being Brazilian: and I do think that sometimes in bad news good news is hidden. I think the Brazilian experience has also shown something, that democracy does not end at the voting booth. Yes we know that already, but I mean it in the sense that when Brazilian people have been out on the streets (such as during the WC and now) the responsiveness of the congress increased dramatically. And the fact that we are standing up and protesting also is a result of this first generation (mine) born under democracy that does understand that corruption is unacceptable (many of the protest movements are being led by youth- one of them the "marcha da Vitoria" March of victory where a bunch of people are imitating the match from Selma, and marching to Brasilia (which is in the middle of the Cerrado, largest savannah in the world, so pretty impressive) to then call for the impeachment of the president.

Chile isn't without its problems of course, students are very unhappy with the education system, a lot of friends of mine go to protests for free education and are very opposed to the current president. 		Maybe it's something to do with the change in attitudes post Chile's dictatorship. From what I understand and have read, people's political attitudes really changed post-Pinochet, which is largely seen as a horrific period in Chile's history so the public are happy to continually try to keep the government in check rather than leaving it in a passive way as many other countries do. But like I said, thats just a thought.		But what I can say for definite is that it is a world away from some other South American countries.
