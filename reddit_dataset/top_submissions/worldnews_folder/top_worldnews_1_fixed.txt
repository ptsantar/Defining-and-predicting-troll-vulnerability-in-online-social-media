submission: { t3_3aitv7	KRISHNA53	A biotech startup has managed to 3-D print fake rhino horns that carry the same genetic fingerprint as the actual horn. The company plans to flood Chinese rhino horn market at one-eighth of the price of the original, undercutting the price poachers can get and forcing them out eventually.	1434818471.0	1434847271.0	0	13022	13022	0	t5_2qh13	worldnews	 }
{"body":"Good stuff in the article.  The lab claims:		>We can produce a rhinoceros horn product that is actually more pure than what you can get from a wild animal. There are so many contaminants, pesticides, fallout from Fukishima. Rhino horn in the lab is as pure as that of a rhino of 2,000 years ago.		The International Rhino Foundation says:		>Selling synthetic horn does not reduce the demand for rhino horn [and] could lead to more poaching because it increases the demand for ???the real thing.??? In addition, production of synthetic horn encourages its purported medicinal value, even though science does not support any medical benefits.","depth":0,"score":3944,"ups":3944,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jux_","name":"t1_csd0fnc","parent_id":"t3_3aitv7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434848437,"created_utc":1434819637}

{"body":"I think you very well might get somebody charging more for the real thing, and proving it somehow - maybe by buying it in a shop with other rhino body parts proudly displayed or a rhino tail hanging on the wall or something.		Hard to say with 'medicinal' products like this.  Flooding supply with a close analogue doesn't necessarily work like you'd think all the time.  Maybe you get some weird signaling.  Maybe you get projection bias.  Maybe you get some mental or ritualistic addiction.   Maybe the new price level gets it inserted into more products.  Maybe people start saying you need it three times a day.  Maybe the real thing becomes a popular luxury item promoted by a trusted brand where the larger user base for the fake stuff creates aspiring consumers.		Maybe it'd end up like New England and Dunkin' Donuts.  There's an analogous brewed cup of coffee at the gas station convenience store next door for less than half the price Dunkin' Donuts is charging.  And then, a couple years later, somebody opens up a Dunkin' Donuts in the gas station convenience store.  Now there's three spots next to each other.  But the new Dunkin' Donuts thrives, has lines, and sells more coffee than the store it's inside of.  Then, a few years later, they open a Starbucks across the street.  Their price per ounce of brewed coffee is even higher.  There's not an appreciable quality difference you can detect in a laboratory.   Just consumers using quality heuristics by brand perception.  You might think, "Nobody's going to go for this."  But it works.  And none of them go out of business.  		More people hang out in coffee shops now.  So a couple years later, some kid with a rich daddy graduates state university with a business degree, and buys some coffee roasting equipment.  He puts his independent shop in the strip mall right next to Starbucks.  He selects fair trade beans from his friends he met in Guatemala during a study abroad trip.  He has no real experience roasting and brewing coffee, other than instruction manuals and youtube videos, but daddy fronted the capital, and anyone can smell coffee roasting from a block or two away.  And the smell alone signals quality to some people, even though the kid actually sucks at selecting quality coffee beans and roasting and brewing.  This kid's kind of popular, so he gets the right people in town and college buddies to do open mic nights and create a cool little scene there.  Soon word spreads, and $5/cup coffee is flying off the shelf to regular morning customers.  Starbucks is still doing just fine.  As are the two Dunkin' Donuts.  And the gas station coffee.  		And then they open a new Dunkin' Donuts in the same plaza as the coffee roaster...		You'd think flooding one block with supply of brewed coffee like that would have dropped prices.  But it doesn't at all.  We know that the price elasticity of demand for coffee is way closer to 0 than 1.  Maybe 0.25.  It seems to just get more people to be 'coffee drinkers,' and get coffee drinkers to increase their consumption.  		If more people end up 'horn users' and they increase their consumption, say by selling more rhino horn tea or whatever, then there might be some jacked-up high-end market that forms around the real thing, and some brand that's trusted for doing it.

{"body":">Flooding supply with a close analogue doesn't necessarily work like you'd think all the time.		I'd written out a fairly long response to this (mostly on why your example wouldn't transfer well b/c of monopolistic competition with niche markets versus substitute introduction), but honestly the issue here is right at the beginning.  The goal isn't to eradicate demand, it's to introduce a substitute in a way that will disrupt the original supply dynamics and force a transition to the substitute.  This undermines most of your examples:		>Maybe you get some weird signaling. Maybe you get projection bias.		Possibly, but that's about as nebulous as it gets.		>Maybe you get some mental or ritualistic addiction.		That's the main stumbling block for getting people to move to a substitute, but according to the company they've done some research indicating that a large chunk would consider a manufactured alternative.		>Maybe the new price level gets it inserted into more products.		Sure, but that would still have the intended effect on poaching by diminishing its profitability.  Moreover, we're mostly talking about China, land of the knock-off everything - there's no real way to prove authenticity on that scale without running foul of the authorities, which means any producer that can get away with it is going to quietly insert the cheaper substitute.		>Maybe people start saying you need it three times a day.		And now you have consumption pushed back out of the means of the middle class.  Right now, it's *already* a fairly high-end luxury item - tripling the recommended dose also triples the cost, which would most likely create a *reduction* in demand by shifting it back into the firm domain of the "actually pretty rich."		>Maybe the real thing becomes a popular luxury item promoted by a trusted brand where the larger user base for the fake stuff creates aspiring consumers.		Perhaps, but at the prices involved now it'd more likely result in the opposite: an expensive luxury item where many people who *could* afford it if they stretched their budget a little instead settle for a vastly cheaper knock-off that's basically as good as the real thing anyways.		>Who knows?		That's what it really comes down to: we don't 100% know what this will do, but the odds are in favor of it improving the situation.

I doubt there will be any high demand problems. Sure there's higher demand, but also higher quality because they're 3D printing rhino horns.		I'll give an example.		There is the poacher, the middle man, the customer and the biotech rhino horn guys; p, m, c and b		Now: p has to go out hunting for the rhino, kill it and take its horns without being shot at by rhino protection guys. For his large efforts, he sells it to m for $8000, m then sells it for a profit of $500, at a price of $8500, c is rich and buys it.		Then: p does his thing, but when he tries to sell the horn for $8000, m denies it because he already has a supplier b selling him the horns for $1000, m can then sell the horn for $7500 profit at the same price of $8500. M2 then gets supplied by b and decided he can make more money by lowering his price to $7500 only making $6500 profit per horn, but instead of having a 50:50 split between m1:m2, the lower price brings in more customers to m2 making it a 10:90 ratio. m1 is now making less money so he undercuts m2 to try and take his customers back. So the price goes down significantly, and poachers will not be able to sell their real but indistinguishable horns, even without a middleman without minimal returns for their large risk, so they'll get a different job that pays the same with less work. The larger number of horns in the market may lower demand in some ways as it is no longer a rare product so it is no longer a vanity item, but it could raise demand for general use of the horns. This higher demand makes no difference, because the price is the same and the poachers still can't afford to be poaching for such low profit with such high risk, so b just ends up being the sole provider of horns, eliminating poaching, and maybe making a little money to put into something like rhino repopulation or something.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jozzarozzer","name":"t1_csdke67","parent_id":"t1_csd3oe1","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434867344,"created_utc":1434863744}

{"body":"There's more to it than that. Traditionally, purchasing expensive betrothal items has served certain social signals. In certain cultures, jewelry is given as dowry and as adornment for the bride. The jewelry is effectively the purchase price for the woman, with the expectation that she will provide a return on this investment over time. It also serves as a safety net for the woman - if her husband dies or they get divorced, she can redeem it for cash flow purposes. Husbands can go into a huge amount of debt for this exercise, so it also serves as a social signal that both parties are serious about commitment. In cultures where life insurance and retirement policies aren't widely adopted, other mechanisms traditionally fulfill these roles - a fertile wife and abundant male offspring is typically a desirable outcome of marriage for extended families. 		I'd say that some of this logic persists in western unions too. Buying a diamond is a terrible investment, but if it weren't a diamond, it may be something else. The idea is that you spend a lot of money, because if you can't afford a diamond, you sure as hell can't afford a child. And if you can't afford a child, the in-laws may be pondering the husband's eligibility. If the concept of a trophy wife is true, then this logic can get applied there too. 		Well, that's my take on it. Marriage has changed a lot since the advent of the double income household, contraception, life insurance, retirement planning and the welfare state.

For a comparison of various natural and man-made sources of radiation in the world's oceans and the atmosphere, [consider the following infographic from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.](http://www.whoi.edu/cms/images/radioactivity_213855_218413.jpeg) Nuclear weapons testing during the Cold War accounts for the preponderance of man-made radiation (which in turn pales in comparison to the naturally   radioactive elements dissolved in the oceans). 		The speaker most certainly must have been referring to fallout from weapons testing, which was dispersed around the world by high-altitude winds. The material ended up there by virtue of the enormous forces propelling it high into the atmosphere. By contrast, there is no plausible motive force that could explain how cesium from Fukushima could travel to Africa and enter the food chain of a rhinoceros. [Ocean currents are sending it toward the west coast of North America](https://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/sage/oceanography/lesson3/images/ocean_currents2.jpg), not through the straits of Malacca/Sunda and across the Indian Ocean. Even if the tiniest amounts did make that incredible journey, it still has to contend with the challenge of exiting the ocean and reentering the atmosphere so as to travel over land. Cesium boils at 680 C, so you're going to have to rely on [sea spray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spray), which will carry it about as far in land as you can smell salt from the ocean.

{"body":"Do you know *why* poachers kill rhinos and sell the horns? I am very confident that it is for purely economic reasons. 		Keep in mind that these are desperate people. Infrastructure is anywhere from poor condition to nonexistent. Money is often more scarce than clean water. 		I'm trying to track down my source, but I'll give you a quick breakdown. The story covered the effects of Give Directly charities and how even $100 can change the lives of people in such extreme poverty. For many, the first thing they do is buy a metal roof for their house. Many of the houses have thatch roofs and the cost of upkeep is pretty steep purely in terms of labor. Thatch roofs also attract pests, which can be pretty hard on one's health. The simple act of installing a metal roof can improve someone's life in countless ways.		You will never hear someone say "A metal roof? No thanks. Grass works well enough for me." So, if someone wants a metal roof, what is stopping someone from getting one? Answer: the cost. 		Put yourself in the position of one of these poachers. You know the things you need to improve your life, and now you know how to get them. So, the next step is to get the money you need. How do you do that? Welfare? Don't be silly, that's not even a thing where you live. Sell your possessions? You have nothing to sell. Farm or hunt and sell the extras? Come on, man, you're just barely scraping by. You don't have the time to invest in farming or hunting for other people. Besides, the money you'd make doesn't even come close to what you need.		One day, your cousin come to you with an idea to make you the money you need  It's risky, but you can come away with $200 for a single day's hunt. You might die, but for you, starving to death is actually a possibility for you. It's illegal, but who cares? Your kids need a better house and the law has never done anything to help. Why respect them when they don't respect you?		Ultimately, you have to ask if the risk with it? Given your situation, yes.		So, you borrow your neighbor's Kalashnikov and head out to get a rhino horn.		Or not. A few years later, someone stops by and they've got a rhino horn they want to sell you for $25. 		"Why so cheap?" you ask. 		The merchant replies "because it was never part off a real rhino. We grew it in a lab, and we want you to sell it to your buyer. We'll even let you pay us after you've sold it." 		(Note, that last part is just how I would work to sell the fake horn. I cannot speak for the business model that is actually chosen.)		You take the synthetic horn to your buyer, who hands you $200 for the horn because, let's be honest, he's just there to sell it for $5,000 to those who will pay that much. 		You walk back home with $200 in your pocket and pick up a metal roof on the way.		I hope I've been able to shed some light on some things you may not have considered before.","depth":14,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Anjeer","name":"t1_csdpgi2","parent_id":"t1_csdhiuw","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434887696,"created_utc":1434884096}

{"body":"That depends on what you mean by "indistinguishable."  Unless they're specifically trying to (which they might, in some cases), you're probably right that someone could determine the difference through testing.  On the other hand, there's a decent chance that the final product would be sufficiently identical that, *short* of more specific tests, people wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  That's enough for many end-users (whether you're trying to fool them or not), because it shifts the product from "fake rhino horn" to "lab-grown rhino horn."  The reason they're talking about things like genetic similarity rather than look or feel is that their core message is "we figured out how to grow *real* rhino horn in a lab."		Remember, most of the people using rhino horn aren't doing so because they love killing off endangered species, they're doing it because they think there are benefits associated with it: if they can be convinced that scientists have figured out a way to get the same benefits for a fraction of the cost *and* without any of the ethical issues, it's likely they'll be willing to at least try it.  [According to the company](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pembient-purveyor-of-bioengineered-rhino-horn-is-admitted-to-indiebio-accelerator-300026480.html), that segment makes up something like half of current users - more than enough to severely disrupt the existing poaching trade - and that's with the product sight unseen.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"carasci","name":"t1_csdctp0","parent_id":"t1_csdb9kl","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434849366,"created_utc":1434845766}

There are two goals here: Stop poaching, and repopulate the rhinos. Farming would certainly help repopulate the rhinos, but I don't think it will stop poaching much. It's expensive to raise a Rhino, if farming is done privately the horns have to be worth at least the time and effort put into raising them. Whatever that price is, I have a feeling it's not low enough to discourage poachers.		Poaching will occur so long as it's profitable, measures against poaching must make it less profitable to discourage poaching. Increasing the risks of poaching is one way to go about this, but we know that's been failing for many reasons. Synthetic horns are another way to go about it, but they will only help as far as the quality that they can be synthesized at. Farming goes down a similar path, but as I explained I don't think it will be effective enough to stop poaching. 		Still, thinking this through I have to take back part of my previous comment.

{"body":"Not really. Other than size, they're actually more clear and pure for the price than mined diamonds unless the client is looking for a particular impurity for a specific application. They just don't bother to polish and cut things that are going to be used on a drill bit. In fact, if you're looking for something on the upper end of quality, synthetic gems are actually significantly cheaper in that area.		For example, after a few minutes of searching I found someone who can sell a 1ct F color VVS2 synthetic. Gems at that grade are considered nearly perfect. They have no discoloration that can be seen without a side by side comparison and any flaws are only visible with magnification and most of the population couldn't ID them even with it. The vast majority of rings sold are far lower quality than what you can produce synthetically. They can get you a 1.9ct diamond if you're willing to drop two grades on clarity and take a VS1, which has imperfections a trained appraiser could see without magnification from the bottom of the diamond but not the top. They can beat natural diamonds of the same quality by about a thousand dollars (although direct used diamond sales would be significantly cheaper than either).		Both of those could reasonably be called perfect gemstones as you'd have to drop 3 more grades to SI2 to have any flaws the average person could see with the naked eye even on close inspection. The best value in visibly perfect wedding rings if you set them in gold, is probably J color (very slightly yellow, because the gold setting causes a yellow tint anyway) and either VS2 or SI1.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brinebold","name":"t1_csd7jjm","parent_id":"t1_csd5toh","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434837952,"created_utc":1434834352}

Even a fancy gicl??e reproduction of a painting is different from the original - they're composed of different materials and there's not even a slight chance of confusing one for the other, because you can just walk up to it and see whether there are layers of paint. In contrast, a 3D printer could theoretically make a replica of a sculpture out of the same material, if it's a material that can be printed. In practice the technology is still in its infancy and there may be things a skilled scrimshander can do that a printer can't, but you could still split the difference and use the printer to start with an almost-complete piece that just needs finishing.		So if we're going to use your analogy, this is more like printing out a photo and then airbrushing it by hand, rather than use algorithms in Photoshop.		EDIT: And even if there's more craft in the hand-airbrushed prints and that's very meaningful to you, Photoshop is cheaper and faster, so the market/galleries/whatever may quickly be flooded with much more cheaply produced objects that are difficult to distinguish from ones made the old-fashioned way.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Epistaxis","name":"t1_csd5aia","parent_id":"t1_csd4ya2","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434833210,"created_utc":1434829610}

{"body":"Then just make it legal to hunt but make the price of the license more than the price of black market ivory. I guarantee the people that live in areas with rhinos will give a whole lot more of a shit if they had a couple million dollars walking around their backyard. Annual licenses will be limited to the number of rhinos in the area that are too old to breed. Put half a million dollar price tag on "rhinos fucking up the population" and they will go find them with the help of rhino experts. With the license, local authorities will assist in the hunt to make sure the right rhinos are killed. 		Legally hunting rhinos will decrease poaching because the big game hunting market pays way more than the illegal ivory market. Also, by hunting older rhinos past the breeding age, this will inevitably increase the rhino population because the breeding aged males are killed by the old boss rhinos. The increase in rhino conservation funds will be used to save the rhinos from poaching and further study the animal. Even in areas with notoriously corrupt governments can't steal the money or spend it elsewhere because investing the funds from the licenses in rhino conservation increases the population which will lead to more licenses available. 		This is exactly what Corey Knowlton did when he paid $350,000 to hunt an endangered rhino. If you are interested in animal conservation or the story of Corey Knowlton, I highly recommend this episode of the [Joe Rogan Experience Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A1D-f_meFY) where Corey explains the details of his experience in greater detail.","depth":3,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"will-reddit-for-food","name":"t1_csd73bb","parent_id":"t1_csd3odm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434836991,"created_utc":1434833391}

The UK is taking a different approach, instead of decriminalising/legalising they are banning everything in a really stupid blanket ban due to come into law (I hear) first quarter next year. Time will tell if this will create more problems, since if it's all just as illegal you might as well go for the previously illegal drug you wanted in the first place.

He did manage to show some of his findings to restaurant owners and get them to agree to stop serving it. Not great, but a good start in the right direction. Hopefully it catches on with more people. 		And for those curious the main reason people are against shark fin soup with that shark meat itself is worthless.

{"body":"The article linked does not do a good job explaining the product ("mixing DNA and keratin" or whatever it said is oversimplifying). There are actually multiple companies that have been working on synthetic rhino horns, all utilizing real rhino DNA. To give a bit more detail than the article, they're using DNA from real rhinos to grow cells in vitro. Each company is using a slightly different method, but one way that this is done - scientists take a sample of skin cells from a rhino, and with some genetic modification they differentiate them into keratinocytes. These cells produce keratin which is the structural protein in the horns. A bioprinter can be used to fill a horn-shaped mold with what becomes solid keratin. There's more to it than that and it can be done without 3d printing, but that's the general idea.		The synthetic horn created by what I just described began as just a skin sample.. that skin sample contains real rhino DNA, so the final product will also contain real rhino DNA. You are correct that DNA varies from rhino to rhino, as with every species, due to different alleles within their genome. You would need to do a DNA test (think paternity test for humans) to tell the difference between horns. For humans, that costs >$300-400, so DNA tests for rhino horns would not be cheap. If it were more practical, it would be a great way to spot fake ones.

A better course of action would be to flood the market with it as an actual rhino horn, even though it's a counterfeit, where people won't be able to know if they're getting the real thing, which would require adding in the impurities and weathering it so that it looks like the horn of a real rhino; they should go with subterfuge.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"argyle47","name":"t1_csd33so","parent_id":"t3_3aitv7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434828699,"created_utc":1434825099}

{"body":"Reading a lot of comments and it's sad that people don't realize what "flooding the market means".. It's not just selling a discounted rhino horn.. Example.		Jim has  10 specialty made spoons that cost $100 dollars each. Jim sells all 10 spoons and makes 1000 dollars , then next week 	Jim sells 10 more making another 1000 dollars Jim is the only one who sells that spoon.		The 3rd week Jane is selling the same spoon for 50 dollars and she has 50 spoons. Jane sells all her spoons making 5000 dollars.		So Jim cannot continue to sell his spoons for 100 dollars because the specialty spoon market has an excess of spoons that are selling at a lower price, thus driving the cost of  spoons down and readily available to everyone.		Jim will have to lower his price on spoons to 45 dollars to make money because no one will pay him $100 for his spoons.		On week 4 Jane will lower her price to 40 dollars per spoon to take his customers.

{"body":"In this case it kind of is just selling the discounted horn.  But it breaks down like this: the poachers have a cost to procure their horns and they have a price they sell them at ($100).  We can assume there's not much in the way of collusion here so that $100 is the free market price.  People who value the horns at more than $100 still get them for $100 and everyone who values them at less than $100 doesn't get any horns.  At that $100 price there will be poachers who are barely breaking even and ones that are making a healthy profit - depending on what their internal cost structure looks like.		Now this biotech comes along and they have a totally different cost structure.  Most likely that cost structure involves far higher fixed costs than any of the poachers but their variable costs are a lot lower.  So to maximize profits they need volume (ie they need to flood the market) and they can afford to give up a lot on unit price to get it.  So (assuming they're not a charity) they set their price at a level that maximizes profits.  Since this price is lower than the $100 it will put lots of poachers out of business.  Eventually though the patent on this new technology will run out and other companies will start producing these horns too.  At that point the biotech no longer gets to set a price point and they'll just have to take the new market price for the horns.  If enough suppliers enter the market with similar cost structures then price will approach marginal cost.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"B_P_G","name":"t1_csd6e7d","parent_id":"t1_csd3zus","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434835489,"created_utc":1434831889}

{"body":"I think the company just wants to get a cut of the cash cow that is the black market. They are doing it in a 'legal' way so to speak but that doesn't eliminate the problem; the demand for rhino horn. That's what we need to eliminate, they will be selling it to buyers and just because it's cheap to obtain doesn't mean it's going to make poachers stop poaching. Cocaine has become so cheap to obtain these days but have dealers and drug cartels stopped producing/selling it? Hell no. It will just make the problem an ongoing thing. Another thing to note, the Chinese will notice the fake rhino horn from the real product because of it's exclusive low price. Do you really think they will choose the synthetic over the natural? I don't see this beig a solution, more like addinng fuel to the fire. Rhino horn is alreasy illegal but the penalties for it should be really high up there. 20-25 years in jail and/or for you extremists out there even possibly death? If all the nations come together for a better tomorrow, a better future for the rhinoceros species then we can have real change. But if the law is strong here and weak somewhere over there? Nothing will change. Strict international policies could actually do something about this. Take for example Indonesia and Singapore, they have a death penalty for heroin smugglers. With the recent executions i'm curious to know how many fools will try smuggling heroin this week. But i know what you're thinkibg. I'm comparing. Rhino's life to anhiman life and you're thinking "dude it's just a fucking rhino." My two cents on that, I know its a fucking rhino with a damn right to live. They are beautiful species, those who hunt and kill for sport and greed with cruelty and inpunity deserve nothing more than the same treatment they give to the species they destroy. Deer hunters and such I understand because those are abundant species and they are hunted for the meat/hide/etc.. and not for waste. There is a difference between nonsence killing and sacrificing an animal for sustenance. Critically endangered species such as rhinos however are a different story. They are beautiful creatures, almost walking fossils. Amazing animals and their numbers are literally counted to the hundreds. This century might be their last if thebpoaching doesn't end.

Similar to how we can artificially make diamonds that, just like these horns, are actually better than their natural counterparts, the demand for the real thing has not gone away.

Of course, most of the sellers probably won't care because people are buying it and it's more cost effective (and less dangerous) to get cheap false rhino horns.		Then you have sellers who continue to sell actual rhino horn, but greatly increase the price. Those 40 people who bought rhino horn now dwindle to say, 15. Even with the prices jacked up for those 15, the money coming in is still much less than before, so they'll need to downscale their businesses (hiring less poachers and smugglers and what have you) and/or jack the price up more and lost another seven customers or something.		And the sellers selling fake rhino horn will prosper since there's less competition and they aren't splitting their profits with smugglers/poachers/etc. At least until they're arrested or something.

The material from which synthetic ones are made, as the article put it, is "genetically and spectrographically similar" to *actual* rhino horns, making the two practically indistinguishable and hence 100% real (or maybe 99.9999% real due to technological limitations, but real rhino horns will probably have minor impurities in them too, so 100% would be warranted).		Edit:	>Wouldn't the general strategy of flooding the market with fake horn would work just as well if you were distributing vials full of flour labelled 'rhino'?		If I were to take this question literally, no. The manufacturers of ivory-based products would probably be stringent enough in verifying the source and content of their shipments that they would find it to be flour (in the case of ivory-based beers, it would taste so obvious). But even if this question wasn't meant to be taken literally and I ignored my last sentence, the logic would still apply where people notice discrepancies in the taste or structural properties/integrity of products made from ivory and eventually find it wasn't actually ivory; so overall, vials of flour would not work.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Super_Swag_Hacker","name":"t1_csdh5a9","parent_id":"t1_csdf194","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1434859216,"created_utc":1434855616}

What really needs to happen is a sincere international push to get those governments to do something about it. Much tougher laws and educational focus to convince their people of the stupidity of their actions would be a far more effective approach.
