{"body":"Duffelblog wrote a funny piece of satire about this		http://www.duffelblog.com/2014/06/isis-iraq-humvees-captured/		> MOSUL, Iraq ??? Just days after the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized control of Iraq???s northern cities of Mosul and Tikrit, the group???s lightning offensive has reportedly ground to a halt after ISIS unsuccessfully attempted to use dozens of captured U.S. M1114 Humvees.	>	> ???We were considerably more mobile with Toyota Technicals,??? complained ISIS cell leader Ibrahim ibn Abdullah ibn Sabah Al-Rahman. ???But once we captured these unreliable monstrosities, our leadership started worrying about our safety.???	>	???Now we can???t even leave our base without at least four up-armored Humvees and an RPG team, plus we have to have three ground guides with reflective belts every time we are backing out of our parking spot,??? Al-Rahman said as he angrily gestured towards a dilapidated Humvee. ???And don???t get me started on all the protective gear we have to wear. Even the suicide bombers were told they wouldn???t be getting into paradise if they were caught in one without a helmet, flak, gloves, and flame retardant clothes!???	>	During the course of the interview, Al-Rahman was interrupted by at least one angry phone call from ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, demanding to know why none of the Humvees had their drip pans and chock blocks in place.	>	The M1114 HMMWV, known to the public as the ???Humvee??? and to the American soldier as ???the fucking Humvee,??? is the U.S. military???s all-purpose mobile field kitchen, capable of cooking up to six soldiers alive in as many minutes. During the Iraq War, the U.S. discovered that they were also extremely effective at uncovering IEDs, leading to the war-winning strategy of driving over them as frequently as possible.	>	At the end of the Iraq War ??? in a gesture of revenge ??? the U.S. abandoned thousands of Humvees in Iraq, an act compared to the Soviets seeding millions of land mines in Afghanistan, and with similar results once the Iraqis began to drive them.	>	The Humvees were captured by ISIS on Tuesday after being abandoned by Iraqi soldiers unable to locate the vehicles??? keys, which they claimed the U.S. advisers who alerted them to this feature had never provided. Although ISIS attempted to use the vehicles immediately, they were unable to properly employ them because of the Humvee???s incredibly poor fuel consumption, as well as unsuccessful attempts to obtain spare parts from manufacturer A.M. General in Indiana.	>	To make matters worse, in an almost-kharmic act of retribution, retreating Iraqi soldiers have begun emplacing landmines and other ordnance along the roads, easily blowing up the few ISIS Humvees that have ventured south of Mosul.	>	???In the name of the Blessed Prophet, these things are death traps!??? exclaimed one of Al-Rahman???s fighters. ???How the hell could anyone drive these things around a parking lot, let alone into a combat zone????	>	Al-Rahman then reminded him that you go to jihad with the mujahideen you have, not the mujahideen you wish you had.","depth":0,"score":1734,"ups":1734,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RabidRaccoon","name":"t1_crwxf6j","parent_id":"t3_38pi4r","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433544243,"created_utc":1433540643}

If you lose the gas tube, an AR pattern will need to be manually cycled. If you lose the buffer spring/assembly, the gun will hammer itself to death and not cycle properly.

Milled AK recievers of course are superior to stamped ones when it comes to durability, so not all will be as strong as others, but I think it is not incorrect to say that AK pattern rifles are better suited to less supplied and worse maintained conditions than ARs are.

{"body":"Sort of. Chances are you've heard of the whole trope that the AK hits harder, but is inaccurate and can take a ton of punishment, while the M4 is accurate and less powerful. This is at least partly true.		There are three main reasons for these discrepancies. Firstly, there is the round choice. Most AKs use the 7.62x39, while M4s use the 5.56x45. The first number reprisents the caliber, so a larger number means a larger round, while means a larger entry wound. Between the two, the 5.56 has a higher velocity, but a smaller bullet. The end result is that the 5.56 is naturally better at piercing light armor, but worse for doing actual damage. Regardless of the round you choose, chances are your target will only last 1 or 2 hits, so that is a moot point.		The second reason is the weapon design. At the core of both weapons, you have a bolt that you need to turn to unlock, then pull back (kind of like a bolt action rifle). However, in both gas is vented from the from of the barrel, leading to a mechanism that will turn and retract the bolt, allowing for automatic and semi-automatic fire. In the AK, the gas is released into a tube with a piston right above the barrel, and the piston leads back to the bolt. This adds weight to the weapon, but also makes it more reliable compared to most other systems. The M4 uses a direct impingement system, which in my opinion is the dumbest system in existence. Basically, instead of venting the gas onto something non-vital to unlock the bolt, the gas goes through a tube which vents it directly onto the bolt. The only possible advantages I've seen in this system are a slight (debatable) increase in accuracy, a lower weight, and a higher resistance to cold temperatures. The disadvantages are numerous: the weapon is harder to clean, the gas gets the bolt dirty which makes jams common, and the hot gasses will evaporate any oil put on the bolt making it even more prone to failure.		The last reason for the differences is manufacturing quality. The M4 is a precisely constructed weapon, and this greatly affects its accuracy. As a result, the weapon itself is accurate to a surprising distance, and it becomes rather expensive. This fits the American style of military, where quality is over quantity. The Russians (at the time) favored the quantity over quality approach. They realized most conscripts can't aim well, so there is no point in precisely machining their weapons, and focusing more on cost effectiveness over quality. The larger machining tolerances had another effect: the gun is really hard to break. You can use the thing like a fucking shovel, it will still work when you are done (probably, don't trust me on this). The overall end result was a cheaper, less accurate, more reliable weapon.		Now, as for the reason why the US doesn't use the AK: it is Russian. These weapon choices were made during the Cold War, no way in hell that the US was going to go with a Russian weapon. As for why the US chose the AR-15 series of rifles, ~~I theorize that the Armalite team offered to give free blowjobs for life to the entire weapons development board if they chose their weapon~~ the US didn't want to go with the NATO standardized rifle (I believe these would be the FAL and FAL Carbine), then when holding their own weapons trials chose the AR-15 system specifically for their light weight (the Armalite team specialized in new materials that were lighter than the traditional woods and steels). Oddly enough, the AR-15 system was distributed fairly widely before the 'official' adoption.","depth":5,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Aremnant","name":"t1_crxanqd","parent_id":"t1_crx1gfb","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433572757,"created_utc":1433569157}

THe humvee was never designed to be armoured, protection from small arms (ie. 7.62mm rounds at medium range) fire wasn't an original feature, the vehicles that were criticised for being too poorly armoured (and as a result up armoured more) were already uparmoured. You can normally modify military equipment a fair bit but the mission stretch of the humvee is fucking insane.

{"body":"George W Bush made his fortune the old-fashioned way: nepotism, family connections, and political corruption.		His first business venture (Arbusto) was funded by pals of his dad (who was a senator at the time). This failed, and was bought out by more of dad's pals (Spectrum 7), who put George W in charge of the merged company (since when are CEOs of failed companies put in charge after a buy-out?). That failed, and was bought out by Harken. The Harken execs have been very clear; they brought Bush on board because of the value of the family name.		Bush sold his shares in Harken for 800K profit, near the top of the market, during a time when insiders had been warned not to sell. Months later, the share price collapsed. This triggered an inquiry by the SEC; since dad was now president of the US, his pal running the SEC immediately closed the investigation.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbusto_Energy		The 800K was then used to buy a small share of the Texas Rangers, in a business deal arranged by more of dad's pals. The team was later sold at a massive profit, when Bush Jr was governor of Texas; the buyer in turn got appointed to manage the massive endowment of Texas AM. The value of the team was enhanced by a new stadium, which was built using land acquired through eminent domain.		http://www.publicintegrity.org/2000/01/18/3313/how-george-w-bush-scored-big-texas-rangers		So we can see that Bush "earned" his fortune *while he was governor of Texas*, not "before he entered politics"...","depth":4,"score":201,"ups":201,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KagakuNinja","name":"t1_crx23d0","parent_id":"t1_crx0uo9","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433552905,"created_utc":1433549305}

It's the relatability that gives it the veneer of intelligence. There may be extremely intelligent people who understand say economic or philosophical concepts better than a significant majority of others. The problem arises when they cannot relate their understanding to others, so they are perceived to be dumb, which is both right and wrong.		Right because they do not possess the requisite ability for the conveyance of their ideas in the manner that people can arrive at the same understanding that they do. Wrong because they actually do intrinsically understand the concepts.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iyja","name":"t1_crxb2uc","parent_id":"t1_crxav64","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433574061,"created_utc":1433570461}

In June 2011, diplomats and Iraqi officials said that President Obama had told Prime Minister Maliki that he was prepared to leave up to 10,000 soldiers to continue training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). Mr. Maliki agreed, but said he needed time to line up political allies. Eventually, he gained authorization to continue talks with the U.S. on keeping troops in Iraq.[69]		>In August 2011, after debates between the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House, the U.S. settled on the 3,000 to 5,000 troop number. An American official said intelligence assessments stated that Iraq was not at great risk of slipping into chaos in the absence of American forces, which was a factor in the decision.[70]		>In October 2011, American officials pressed Iraqi leadership to meet again at President Talabani???s compound to discuss the issue. This time the U.S. asked Iraq to take a stand on the question of immunity for troops, hoping to remove what had always been the biggest challenge. However, they misread Iraqi politics and the Iraqi public. Having watched the Arab Spring sweep across the region and still haunted by the traumas of this and previous wars, the Iraqis were unwilling to accept anything that infringed on their sovereignty.[71]		>Iraqi leadership picked up on that sentiment quickly. As a result, they publicly said they would not support legal immunity for any American troops. Some American officials have privately said that pushing for that meeting ??? in essence forcing the Iraqis to take a public stand on such a controversial matter before working out the politics of presenting it to their constituents and to Parliament ??? was a severe tactical mistake that ended any possibility of keeping American troops past December 2011.[72]		>After the pull out was announced, White House aides said the U.S. would keep its embassy in Baghdad and two consulates.

The more we use drones and bombings to supplement the absence of troops in the region the more people will be affected and the more will join isis. Remember how after we invaded Iraq and started training Iraqi troops to replace our ground forces eventually the terrorists just hid out while launching small attacks against us knowing full well when we left the Iraqi forces wouldn't be well enough trained to combat them as well as many being willing to join them. If we go in again with boots on the ground this will be the exact thing to happen again, but if we just keep bombing them we are just giving them more propaganda material for recruitment.

I'm not sure if you really understand how this whole irregular warfare thing works. You can't defeat an insurgency with military force. You need a competing political entity that can reliably gain more support from the population than what the insurgency can garner. The military's role in COIN is to separate the insurgents from the civilians in order to keep the civilians safe and reinforce the credibility of the political entity that is trying to end the insurgency.		Every time you whine about "muh ROEs are too restrictive!", you've just forgotten that when you use your weapon around population centers, the people remember why they resent those foreigners with guns shooting up their neighborhood.

In other words if ISIS didn't have them then US would and they'd only be sucking money or be sold to local police counties by the DoD, or whoever.
