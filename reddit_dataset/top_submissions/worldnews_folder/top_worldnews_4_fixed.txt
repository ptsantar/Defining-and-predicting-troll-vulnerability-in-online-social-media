{"body":"It sounds pretentious, but it's us. 		It's unrealistic to expect telling everyone "stop paying attention to it" but that's how news works: like a common internet troll that feeds off attention that others just can't ignore.		It's why clickbait is around. It's why CNN.com has a design that looks like HuffPo with a touch of "we want the Gawker audience" headlining. Dramatic large quotes that alone say nothing, or headlines in the form of a question or even telling you it's a list of # X's that you "won't believe". 		It's why Reuters, one of the last "bastions" of professional journalism in the west, now looks like how CNN did 3 years ago.		And the problem with fixing it beyond telling people to stop paying attention to it just risks more problems.		You could mandate stronger honesty regulations, but then you're telling the Government it has the authority to determine what is and isn't true. 		The only think I could think of that would have minimal backfire, if done correctly, is strengthening the tort of reckless negligence, where simply the act of doing something so potentially dangerous will, even if the harm didn't occur, result in lawsuits so massive that even the settlement costs would be great enough to more than offset the financial benefits of boosted ratings. 		But strangely enough, despite the American "pro-corporate" reputation, a lot of countries in Europe have lawsuit restrictions so massive that they make bank bailouts look like reprimands. Particularly, France. 		If this happened in the United States, simply the claim of distress by that woman upon discovery of what the news did, combined with the jury discretion of "wow, and the defendant is a *real* fucking asshole" in weighing punitive damages would probably be more of a settlement cost possibility than actually litigating the entire scope of problems under current French law.","depth":3,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lyrd","name":"t1_cq0fl34","parent_id":"t1_cq0074s","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428104426,"created_utc":1428100826}

{"body":"Every country has pros and cons.		I totally love many aspects of the US, but there are plenty that I loathe.		Either way, I think one of the fundamental awesome things about this country (and many others around the world) is we almost do have completely free speech (as much as is reasonably possible). So in the end we are at least able to discuss our problems and (hopefully) work them out.		It's sort of disheartening to think that there are countries where you actually don't have that right. I think some people either see the US as a hoard of people that are being overly patriotic, but in reality everyone truly does seem to have their own opinion on things.		I just wish we could build a more progressive society quicker. I see Scandinavia and some other smaller countries that seem to be way ahead of us in many respects, and I'd like to see the US trying to compete with that. I don't think it's super productive having arguments that should have ended 200 years ago (like gay marriage etc.). I still can't believe it's not federally legal.		I'm honestly not hyper aware of what's going on in French government and politics right now, but for the most part it seems like a very progressive country as well. Although I have heard some things about free speech limitations in France (I'm not sure of the veracity of those claims). I'm sure it has it's flaws, but what country doesn't?		At this point it seems like the world is becoming one large country, and that's probably the most uplifting and wonderful thing anyone could have ever hoped for.

{"body":"Took this from wikipedia		The Norwegian police do not have helicopters suitable for transporting groups of police for an airdrop. The one they have is useful only for surveillance and the helicopter crew was on vacation.[115] The only helicopters available to the Oslo-based unit were military ones parked 60 kilometres (37 mi) south of the capital at Moss Airport in Rygge, and thus the special unit had to reach the location by car.[116]		When the local police arrived at Ut??ykaia, less than 30 minutes after the first shot was fired, they could not find a suitable boat to reach the island. They were then ordered to observe and report.[117]		AUF's own ferry, MS Thorbj??rn, was used by Breivik to go to Ut??ya. Shortly after the first shot was fired, nine people were leaving the island on the ferry, among them the AUF leader Eskil Pedersen. They feared there might be more terrorists in the area and navigated the ferry 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi) to the north. Hence the ferry was not available to the police when they arrived at Ut??ykaia, the normal ferry landing on the mainland.		The police therefore had to use their own rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RIB). The day of the event, this boat was located in H??nefoss, and had to be transported to the lake and launched before it could be used. When the anti-terror police boarded the RIB it took on some water and after a few hundred meters, the engine stopped, probably due to water in the fuel. Two minutes later they took over a civilian boat that was sent to assist them. The episode was captured on video.[118] A minute or two after the video ends, a faster civilian boat arrived to help. Four police officers from the anti-terror police boarded the boat. Not to waste any more time the civilian couple took the police to Ut??ya.[119]		Some have criticized the police for not using a helicopter, for not immediately getting into small boats, and for endangering the couple who drove the civilian boat.[120]						Basically, the Norwegian police could have been way more prepared. They should have had some kind of way to actually reach the island; they were stalled because they did not have a boat to reach the island, and had to use a civilian's boat to reach the island. The police should have had access to boats or helicopters or something that would have allowed themselves to reach Utoya more quickly.","depth":6,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BetUrProcrastinating","name":"t1_cq0g69k","parent_id":"t1_cq0fdrr","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428105566,"created_utc":1428101966}

{"body":"Except in the US, your naked pictures aren't protected under law unless you're a minor. So there is that.		Most lawsuits that consider punitive damages happen between companies, between companies and the government, or between individuals and companies. Rarely do you see individuals seeking punitive damages on individuals because it does not make legal sense. Most individual disputes can be resolved through small claims court ($3,000 is the mode cap, but some states go up to $10,000) or through simple damages in court. Punitive damages exist to punish entities that can easily afford simple damages such as Coca Cola, Ford, GM, GE, etc.		The entire system is moderated by lawyers and judges in a process almost identical to yours in the UK. For punitive damages to even be allowed in most cases, you have to reach some legal requirement in excess of simple negligence. Normally, this requirement is willful negligence in common law, in copyright law, it is willful infringement, and patent law is just fucked up. Then, even if you are permitted to seek punitive damages, then the amount of the punitive damages must be conscionable (ordinarily regarded to be no more than 100 times actual damages with a few exceptions due to a couple Supreme Court cases). So even then there are caps.		It's not the Wild West out here. It makes sense. You just hear about over dramatized cases because businesses want to eliminate punitive damages because it is the only thing other than Attorney Generals and regulatory agencies that are actually checking their behavior.		It should be noted that in the McDonald's case of severe burns from coffee, the woman ultimately lost all punitive damages because she was found to be at fault for spill because she chose to get a hot beverage in a car with inaccessible cup holders and chose to hold it between her legs while taking the lid off. McDonalds still paid her medical bills and some of her legal fees and made their brewed coffee rest at a lower temperature, but they weren't hit with punitive damages because their behavior wasn't the reason she got third degree burns.","depth":10,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hardolaf","name":"t1_cpzwy5s","parent_id":"t1_cpzutag","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428071121,"created_utc":1428067521}

It is in our view offensive to public opinion, and rightly so, that a defamation plaintiff should recover damages for injury to reputation greater, perhaps by a significant factor, than if that same plaintiff had been rendered a helpless cripple or insensate vegetable.???		This was the position of the court in John v MGN, when Elton John sued a newspaper for alleging he had an eating disorder. The court basically decided that even in cases of libel, where the damage is only to reputation, the same scale as that used in personal injury should be used - i.e. compensating for the loss. So if you lost your arm your damages would include medical bills but also your expected loss of earnings. In the case of reputation, the court will attempt to give a value to reflect the possible losses that will stem from it.		???In assessing the appropriate damages for injury to reputation the most important factor is the gravity of the libel; the more closely it touches the plaintiff???s personal integrity, professional reputation, honour, courage, loyalty and the core attributes of his personality, the more serious it is likely to be.???		All these comments were aimed at being instructions for juries, but the Defamation Act 2013 has since abolished jury trials in defamation suits. There hasn't been any significant caselaw on the issue since the new laws were passed but I would imagine the trend of keeping damages for loss of reputation low will continue. You might well be right that the financial value of Taylor Swift's reputation is far higher than the earnings potential of your arm, but the courts here have seem more concerned with the moral aspect of the decision...

Liability for defective products is a slightly different beast. In that case liability is governed by the UK's Consumer Protection Act 1987 rather than negligence, so liability is strict rather than fault based. This means that it's much easier to prove liability for manufacturing a defective product - you don't have to prove that they foresaw the risk of the product being defective, only that the product was defective. The question of what "defective" means is quite complex, but you can read the case A v National Blood Authority if you're interested.		There have actually been very few cases of defective products going to court since then, some say it's because the shift to strict liability makes it much harder for corporations to win in court, so they are much more likely to settle out of court and also much more likely to be careful in production. The European commission has reviewed legislation of consumer protection a few times and they've always held that it affords sufficient protection for individuals.		All in all, the courts here frown upon using the threat of punitive damages to make manufacturers act carefully.

{"body":"It's not that straightforward.		I was an automotive design engineer. So after vehicle launch, everyone breathes a sigh of relief. We go reintroduce ourselves to our families because we've been working flat out for the last six months on the final push for launch. We take holidays that have been postponed and wind down the project.		Over the next few months engineers get redistributed to other projects so what you end up with is a small team of engineers who are sweeping up engineering changes and modifications for the next year or so.	More often than not these guys are in last year before retirement and there's no point setting them on another six year vehicle design. So, there's a lot of experience here.		After launch, information starts coming back from the dealerships almost straightaway. With the new mini, it was a nasty static/electrical shorting problem in the fuel filler pipe (potential boom!), in the Ford Focus it was shock absorber mounts breaking (cars crashing off the road). Every car has problems, usually nothing so dangerous. The point is that this team spend a year or so squeezing out issues and problems until you get a warranty score of zero, or close to it. Almost all these issues get highlighted by the dealerships who are only too keen to pass the problem up. 		If a car has an issue and crashes, or burns out, or goes off a cliff, its not usually a dealership issue so that info doesn't always get back to the OEM right away. The Ford Explorer issue was 5 years into the production run before info got back to base, so the first question was "what did we change?" Well, nothing. All over the country prople were having tyre (tire) blowouts and getting them replaced or complaining to Goodyear. Initially the OEM had no idea there was a problem and the car was fine in testing.		So, an experienced engineer investigates. He comes up with the solution, money is found to do the work, and the fix is implemented, usually at the next service (customer usually has no idea) and straightaway onto the production line. Warranty count then bounces back to nearly zero.		The problem is when the entire tireset is found to be faulty and new tires have to be sourced. Well, the suspension is designed around the tires and car. For example the Ford Explorer petrol engine variant has a different suspension set (and setup) from the diesel variant because the engine is heavier. Multiply that out for sports variants, multiply it out again for bodyshape variants, and again for overseas.	A single vehicle can have hundreds of different suspension sets and setups.	Each one has to be tested at length for handling, stopping distance, heat control, stability, longevity, and all this at govt controlled testing areas (not cheap)		So one small change of tire can have a huge impact. Land Rover did it to the defender back in the 90s. It had a huge disruptive effect across the company. Ford didn't.		I can tell you that the design engineers would have been willing. That car has to be right.		It's the bean-counters and the CEO's (who are more often than not ex-bean-counters) who should be going to jail, but they never do.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Snowy1234","name":"t1_cq0s3cf","parent_id":"t1_cpzuvo2","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428134786,"created_utc":1428131186}

Following investigation it was determined that the majority of incidents were caused by user error, the driver would panic and mistake the pedals, pressing the gas instead of the brake (as well as a possible correlation with the majority of the users being under average height). Even though this was proven, the backlash was immense, causing audi to recall almost all 5000 models from 72-87 and crippling their US sales which they did not recover from until 2000. While it is tragic that those individuals died, the media frenzy combined with the pressure for a recall almost destroyed Audi, and cases like the pinto are a result of the necessity to weigh these sort of problems to determine possible losses from their response.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheTREEEEESMan","name":"t1_cq0aukx","parent_id":"t1_cpzv96o","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428095802,"created_utc":1428092202}

What I said was, when there is a safety issue that isn't severe enough to merit a recall, the company just needs to tell people about it, and hopefully try to meet them halfway in trying to fix the risk if the customer finds it to be more risk than what was advertised and more risk than they would have been willing to accept when making the purchase. That seems fair to me, if you advertise a certain level of anything (in this case safety), and then fail to meet it, you should be required to take steps to meet those standards if a customer is unsatisfied. 		This in no way means tighten regulations on how safe cars have to be. It just means be fucking honest when there is a problem, and let the consumer make an informed decision. We're all willing to make trades in safety for affordability, but we should at least have all the information when deciding what level of risk we are willing to chance. I personally would sacrifice a good bit more safety than what is already in place for a more affordable car, but that doesn't mean a company should cover up safety defects and hope nobody notices, that's fucking evil and anyone defending it is simply retarded.

{"body":"From a practical and business standpoint, yes a human life's value can be and has been calculated, and that is useful for calculating what is owed when someone's negligence costs someone else their life. And this idea is why I say there needs to be some middle ground, rather than saying the company should be sued into bankruptcy over 27 deaths like so many others seem to believe. That doesn't make me incorrect. Value is subjective, it comes down to what you're willing to pay for it. Ask someone who is grieving what they would pay to get their loved one back, the answer will almost always be "everything". 		When you calculate the value of a human life you aren't calculating what a person is worth. You are calculating the value of the work and production their life will likely hold, and what you will have to pay to compensate for the loss of that. But this is not the value of the person themselves, just the value of the work they could have done. 			It's comparable to someone in the past buying a slave's freedom. The money paid is what the slave owner considers the slave to be worth, because they are running a business and that slave was expected to perform a certain amount of work for that business. But the person buying the slave's freedom wouldn't tell you that that is what that person is worth, they were willing to pay that price and receive nothing in return because they know that person has endless value and worth beyond what they were going to do as a worker.		If you really wanted to be pedantic, I'm certain that you could argue and probably prove that a human life is not only worthless, but has a negative value. Again it's all about perspective. If we change our perspective from that of humans, to an alien race looking only at consumption and production, and take into account an individual's carbon footprint, and everything tied to that like the excessive amount of food we tend to eat, and all the media we consume that produces nothing, but costs a lot of resources to create, then I'm sure we'd find the average human life to be at best a neutral value, and more likely a net loss. From that perspective, it might be decided that ending a human life and turning their body to food and fertilizer is actually something deserving of a reward (I feel like there is a good idea for a story or video game here, that has possibly been used, but if not DIBS! lol).","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"marty86morgan","name":"t1_cq0c04u","parent_id":"t1_cpzzy3v","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428097829,"created_utc":1428094229}

{"body":"OK here's the deal in French law. 		You have three kinds of court, "tribunal de police", "tribunal correctionnel", and "cour d'assise". The "cour d'assise" deals with major cases, so the question here is whether the case will be dealt with by the "tribunal de police" of the "tribunal correctionnel".		So, what happened is that the people who were in that fridge contacted a lawyer, who thought that there's a case to be made here, and convinced them to let him press charge ("plainte contre X", or "charges against person unknown") on their behalf.		AFAIK that's the first major difference with the US system, where they would have pressed charges against a specific journalist or editorial team. Here, through the "plainte contre X", they tell the "tribunal de police" that something was wrong, and ask the judge to determine whether a preliminary investigation is in order or not. Depending on the gravity (to simplify) of the investigation's conclusions, the judge will make a choice out of 3 possible outcomes:		1. A "tribunal de police" is qualified to deal with the case and proceed.	2. It's out of their juridiction, and needs to be brought to a "tribunal correctionnel".	3. "Classer sans suite", or charges dropped.		And through option 1 and 2, it will be determined who should be put on trial for that crime.		Edit: About the year in prison / 15.000??? fine. That's indeed, in theory, the maximum penalty for endangering another person's life. Now the charges may be requalified, but I can't think of any crime more fitting than this one.

{"body":"You can't directly prosecute someone criminally in France. I don't know for other countries but in France, the only one able to prosecute someone is the State. Criminally, it's "State vs Accused", not "Plaintiff vs Accused". You are not so much judged because you "hurt someone" than because you "hurt society".		As a victim, you can join the prosecution by becoming "partie civile", that's to say : you're joining your civil case against the person to the criminal prosecution. You can have 10, 20, even 200 "parties civiles" but there's still only one criminal prosecution, and the max criminal sentence (jail time, fine...) is still the same whether there's one "partie civile", 200, or none.		In other words, if you voluntarily kill some people and there's no aggravating circumstances, you can get up to 30 years. Whether you killed one person or 50, the max is still 30 years (although at 50 you would probably be prosecuted for terrorism so that would be different). Of course, the more people you killed, the more likely it is you will receive the maximum sentence (30 years), whereas if you killed only one, you may, depending on the circumstances, be sentenced to, like, 15 years.		If you come up to a court saying "hey, I was a victim too!" after that person has already been judged and sentenced, it's probably too late to add anything to his criminal sentence, unless it happened at a completely different time. Maybe you could try to get civil damages nonetheless but I'm not sure.","depth":6,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eurodditor","name":"t1_cq01rzm","parent_id":"t1_cq00w02","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428080560,"created_utc":1428076960}

{"body":"Actually, turns out I was probably wrong: apparently, it's possible, although uncommon, that someone will be charged a second time if you come up later as a victim. However, in that case, the cumulated sentences still can't be more than the maximum for one crime. Here is an example : someone rapes multiple people. Rape is punished by up to 15 years in jail (20 in some cases, but let's assume not in that one). If the rapist has already been sentenced 10 years of jail at the first trial, you press charge afterward, and he gets sentenced to 10 years again, he still will not do more than 15 years. He won't do 20 years : only 15. He will only do 20 if the new charges are linked to a crime that happened *after* his first trial.		Besides, he may be able to get both sentences "fused together" so to speak : that's to say that he may be allowed to serve only 10 Years in total. In a way, it's considered he is serving both 10 years sentences at the same time. This is not automatic though, the sentenced person has to ask for that fusion, and the judge may or may not accept.		&nbsp; 		Anyway, those cases are uncommon, as for important things, they try to find exactly how many victims, who they are, and if they can, they contact them so that they can add themselves to the first case as soon as possible.		&nbsp; 		One thing particular about the french court system is that before you are tried, there is a rather long time of investigation done by an independant judge (called the "investigation judge") who has to come up with as many informations as possible, **whether they are for or against the person** (so to speak, the judge does both the work of the lawyer and of the attorney in the US system). 		During this time, the judge will typically try to find every possible victim if he has any hint that there may be more than one, ask them to testify, and offer them to join the case if they want to. If the person is accused of a felony, such investigations usually take several years. And even in some dismeanor cases it can actually take up to 10 years (although this is a rather extreme and rare situation). So the victims have plenty of time to press charges.		&nbsp; 		But if they come afterward anyway, it may be possible to have a new criminal trial.

Aggravating circumstances are not something a judge can decide on his own : it has to be part of the law, with precise criterias to meet. In fact, you shouldn't even think of aggravating circumstances as such, it has more or less disappeared since the New Criminal Code (Nouveau Code P??nal) of 1994.		The law will be something like : 		- Anyone voluntarily endangering someone's life by his actions can be jailed up to 1 year and fined up to 15K???.	- If that person does that particular thing on top of it (for example it could be "use internet to endanger someone" or "do it together with a team of other people"), the max jail time is increased to up to X years and the fine to up to YK???.		It really has to be something that already exists in the law. An example of such is murder :		Article 221-1	Anyone who voluntarily kills someone can be jailed for up to 30 years.		Article 221-2 	Murder, when it is followed by, or is following, or is done together with another crime, can lead to lifetime jail.(...)		This is your aggravating circumstance : an actual article of the criminal code explains which circumstance exactly is aggravating and how it changes the max sentence.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eurodditor","name":"t1_cq0129c","parent_id":"t1_cpzxtld","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428079351,"created_utc":1428075751}

You need a set system in place to prevent this unfortunately.

{"body":"BFMTV will pay - but because they actually got so much off the broadcast will do it again if the opportunity presents itself. This is the current model that live TV news follows, In the US as well as France and many other countries. Get the story on the air right now no matter who it hurts. If the cameraman is not willing to risk his own life by running out in front of police lines, fire him and hire one who is dumb enough to risk his life for the scoop. So what if the live broadcast is responsible for getting people killed - it's NEWS!!! And doubly so if that dumb cameraman does get killed when he didn't obey the cop that told him not to go out there. The News will spin it to make it the cop's fault. There is absolutely NO reason the public needs to see things like a hostage situation or shoot out in real time. An hour's delay should be sufficient to tell the public what happened. And for the news to get the real information. There is just too much the news crew does not know during the actual crises and that leads to misinformation as well as stuff like putting innocent people, cops and themselves in danger by their actions.","depth":0,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Limonhed","name":"t1_cpzuu58","parent_id":"t3_31agq9","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1428064379,"created_utc":1428060779}

I believe the debt was issued in Euros and therefore when hundreds of billions are defaulted on by one EU member which is owed to another EU memeber, the overall liquidity dries up as other countries get scared.
