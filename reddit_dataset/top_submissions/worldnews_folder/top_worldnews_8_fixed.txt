Blind faith in the government is as bad as eliminating checks and balances, nor is it wise to give any government too much power. Until the human element is somehow eliminated(whether by some perfect moral AI or some post-scarcity minarchy), trusting any government is nonsensical, because there is no guarantee whatsoever that those checks and balances will be respected. 		Corporations themselves are just organized business. You can trust them to do what is in their best interest, that is all. Unless they're given the tools to do what they wish(as in bribe the government to maintain a monopoly), then their existence lies in the whims of its consumers. Corrupt inefficient corporations can't exist without something backing them, because who's going to pay money for garbage products?

By contrast, counting ballots (even given all of the inanities and mistakes voters make) is -- or at least ought to be (so long as the system isn't a fundamentally flawed "hanging chad" nonsense) comparatively trivial.		And ONE thing that ought to stand out -- like a sore thumb -- is those minor candidate vote counts: if they are "zero" it's an indicator that something "fishy" is *probably* going on (and/or at least the authorities are NOT conveying an *honest* count), because in all likelihood not only is the candidate him/herself likely to at least vote for themselves, but it's fairly reasonable to assume (given that ballot application/nomination papers invariably require a significant number of people to sign in favor of the person's candidacy) that every candidate is in fact *likely* to be getting at least a handful of votes (at least some of those who signed the application paperwork, and/or even just voters at random who go "eenie meenie miney moe").		---		BTW, I myself have often voted for some "odd" third party candidate just for this kind of reason, especially when it is a minor office, and/or when the difference between the main candidates is nil and it is a certainty that one or the other *will* be elected (or worse when there is just one incumbent candidate who has a virtual "lock" on re-election).","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Absinthe99","name":"t1_crbd5kv","parent_id":"t1_craybho","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1431815185,"created_utc":1431811585}

{"body":"Actually, assuming I interpret what you are saying correctly, that's backwards. If only a few votes for one of the *leaders* were dropped then it would largely be meaningless and not affect the outcome. That a few would be missing for somebody getting very few votes is a *huge* statistical problem and implies a massive number of miscounted votes for the leaders.		Essentially there are three possibilities:	1. The votes for this person were specifically targeted for exclusion. That implies intentional impropriety and attempt to control the outcome. Since he's an outlier and would make no difference if counted correctly, there seems to be little reason to do so, but if somebody is doing that intentionally to these outlier counts then what are they doing to the major counts to control the outcome?		2. This just occurred randomly. Now what are the odds of *just a few* counts being dropped being related to an outlier candidate. Suppose there are 3 candidates and a little more than a million votes divided as follows: Candidate A gets 600,000, Candidate B gets 400,000, and Candidate C gets 3 votes.		What are the odds of a random ballot being miscounted for each: Well, there are 1,000,003 votes total. The odds of 1 ballot being miscounted for A is 600,000/1,000,003 = ~60%. For B is ~40%. For C is ~0.0003%. 		In order to expect 1 ballot to be miscounted for C randomly, you'd need something on the order of 333,334 miscounted ballots.		3. The rarity of votes for C *causes* human error only for Candidate C. Essentially, it is the same cause as #1 but completely unintentional. For example, when counting people can get into grooves of saying A or B and then throw in a C and they may mark it in B simply because they're not paying close conscious attention and it is unexpected. This should not happen with electronic counting and there should be checks and balances for human counting.		Option 3 is really the only one that isn't a serious problem on the outcome, but does indicate a poorly designed counting system.		So I'm curious to what is the case here.

{"body":"We don't deal with 'cash'.  Everything we are paid is done through an invoice we send to our clients.  Everything we pay is done through either a check we print or a credit card we then pay (with a check we print).  And we don't just have one external auditing agency (that pretty much constantly audits us), but we have the occasional (multiple times per year) audits that occur from external auditing agencies sent by our clients.		Every penny that comes in, and every penny that goes out, goes through electronic ledgers that track and balance every single transaction, including the 'human transactions'.  Any product/service that has been around for any length of time has been fully automated to handle these balances, and they all get run through multiple processes that check for anything out of balance.  The few new products/services that we are just starting out are closely monitored, including people at the CO level and usually the owner of the company himself; there are a couple of reports named after him that he checks multiple times per week to watch the differences between outgoing and incoming finances, and to make sure they all get reconciled.		I've never sat in on any of those audit meetings, but I've worked on the IT side to track down and explain any discrepancies that have come up.  On more than one occasion we've had to track down discrepancies less than a dollar and prove how they were either resolving a discrepancy from the prior month, or were resolved the following month.		We would love to be able to write off many of the discrepancies that we find; in IT we've joked about having them take the $2.68 out of our paycheck instead of having to justify it, but we still end up spending hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars worth of man-hours to justify those $2.68 discrepancies.  At the end of the day, depending on which direction the discrepancy is, which client it is and whose fault it is for creating it, we may end up expensing it ourselves (or more specifically, the department that caused the problem), but we still have to justify the difference and prove why it happened.  If it's human error, even if we eat the cost, we have to track down where that error occurred, and look at how we can prevent it from occurring again.

{"body":"For the same reason that there are conventions in physics, like definining gravity as acting downward.  Physics describes completely real world phenomenon and if done correctly the result reflects reality very nicely.  But because of the way the math is performed, there are lots of ways to get there.  You can define gravity as a negative force acting upwards, or even define up as down, and if you're careful the math all works out and you get the same result.  But it adds needless complication, and if everyone defines gravity acting in different directions it makes comparing results and finding mistakes a neverending nightmare.

For example, if you have a system which automatically pulls transactions from the bank and you have a control which checks those transactions add up to agree to the bank balance, a 5c difference only tells you that you that the system has failed and you are probably missing *any number* of transactions.

If a driver bringing boxes from another polling station to the counting office (the major polling station in the constituency or ward) gets lost along the way, they just have to wait. There's a race every time for who can declare first - usually about 2-3am. This time round about half were declared by 7am and the last few came in about 3pm. There's actually nothing on the About My Vote website about when a postal vote must be recieved (the only dates given are when you can apply for them - between the last day for registering as a candidate and a date a few weeks before the election - 9th-21st April this time around) but I assume it must arrive by polling day (7th May this year).		Spoiled ballots are counted and recorded, but not really publicised unless there's a news story in it.

{"body":"I've had a bit of experience with the Iowa caucuses. There are 4 levels of caucusing: precinct, county, district, state. If you have 15% of the people in the room, you get a representative number of delegates to go to the next level. It's in the rules that at each level, if you are in a group that has less than 15% of the total number of delegates, you're asked to go with someone else.		But it's all about the deals at all levels after the precinct. When delegates as a group see that they'll never be able to win the state, even if they are in close third, they decide what kind of message they're going to send, even if they know they're not going to win. Some groups will decide they're going to take it as far as they can, but they'll join with the front runner at the state convention. Some will just fold earlier. So, it's not possible to "win all the delegates" and be in close third because being in close third means having whatever number of delegates would represent close third. And yes, if you see Ron Paul's group goes all the way from the precincts, to the county, to the district, to state, en masse, and then when they get to State they fold, that's kind of normal. They've made their point in Iowa, knowing all along they weren't going to win.		edit: As far as I can tell, after the precinct level, that's it for democracy. Actually, that's in the rules.

I don't believe it is. The climate change hysteria has been around since the 50s and 60s. Climate change models that predict devastating results in the near future consistently over hype what actually happens. Global warming may be an issue that humanity will have to deal with but I don't think the panic and fear around it is really warranted.		>You realize almost all of the rest of the developed world as a socialized health care system, right? Does deregulating the health care system even more honestly sound like a good idea to you? If you slapped this statement on any republican all of Reddit would be crucifying them but somehow when Ron Paul says it it makes sense?		You do realize that the US health care system more closely resembles the European model that the free market system RP would advocate. Socialism in general should be considered not preferable. The US has an FDA, patent laws, state licensing boards for doctors, medicare and medicaid, insurance regulations, and now the ACA. This isn't close to the uninhibited market libertarians would want.		Socialism doesn't change the cost of providing any good or service. It just forcibly distributes the cost across a group. In such a system, the lowest contributors always benefit by enslaving the highest contributors to their ends. It really doesn't make sense for a young, wealthy, and/or healthy person to want socialized medicine. You just end up being exploited for the old, poor, and unhealthy.		>It is ridiculous, it just isn't surprising. Every legislation he has pushed has actively tried to reverse Roe v Wade. That is ridiculous.		I don't know what world you live in but there is a large percentage of the population for religious reasons or other that do see Roe v. Wade as a mistake. Claiming that people who disagree with you are ridiculous just adds credit to my thought that you are possessed by some sort of megalomania and sense of superiority that allows you to believe that you know what's best for everyone.		Personally I'm pro-choice and a good number of people who supported RP probably were. Realistically is Roe v. Wade going to be overturned though even in the event of a RP presidency or even a Rick Santorum? No. Any chance of federal laws even encroaching on reproductive rights passing? Not really.		People who supported RP may or may not have been aware of his view on he topic but it really ends up being a nonissue anyway.		>So what exactly did I spout as a falsity? Let's recap. He does think global warming is a hoax.		Not really. See the link above. Hence the falsity #1. Falsity #2 is your assumption/generalization about what people who supported him knew about his views. In your mind if they had known then they wouldn't have supported him. How are you so conceited?		>All three of these things are topics where the vast majority on Reddit is in direct opposition to him but somehow everyone overlooks these things when Ron Paul says them.		You love generalizations. Building an argument on them isn't very smart. 		Your initial claim is essentially that RP supporters are idiotic and supported him without knowing his views.

Yes, however, water is neccessary for survival, and a convetional dosage of water is perfectly healthy.

I explained this in another post that you may not have seen, but fructose found in fruit accompanies fiber which smooths out insulin spikes.

So I suppose there could be a time-limit on how long a voter has to verify and potentially change his vote. Still there would be increased cost because I'm not sure how secure just changing a vote online would be so individuals might have to physically go somewhere and fill out a form or use a special voting machine to re-vote... We could just require all candidates to donate a percentage of their election campaign funds to offset the cost.

Belfast postal vote made up 46% of the total vote in that electorate. There are dozens of seats with postal votes making a huge percentage, far above the national average. These seats are rural and city, making the demographic argument pretty weak.		See I have been gathering evidence that western democracies, running primarily two party systems are deeply flawed, with huge fraud going on.		If no one complains there is no recount.		There is huge documented evidence prior to computerisation of the electoral roll that elections in Australia, US, Europe and the Uk had massive fraud going on. Go to any of the nations institutes of criminology and you can read case study after case study.		Fitzroy in Melbourne Australia was dominated by a almost tribal like labour party family. Even other labour ministers and seniors had to watch thrnselves when out in Fitzroy. The council, state and federal members of parliament were committing massive fraud, using the police as there own private force.		The idea that all this crime and corruption just disappeared when the roll got computerised is na??ve and silly. Its clear that "postal votes" and huge paid campaigns to "buy" ethnic individual groups votes is happening right now.		Once I've finished building the evidence I want to bust this open 		Edit 17/5: yes my numbers in the subsequent post are wrong.
