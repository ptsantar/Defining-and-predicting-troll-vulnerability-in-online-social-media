{"body":"> And it's faster, depending on your start and destination... And it runs entirely on your schedule		In a large, relatively high density city public transport will be faster and/or cheaper than the car, because of the extent of the congestion. You have bus lanes, and/or subways, which allow people to avoid it, and you tend to also have to limit congestion using charging schemes. In a city like that, there are simply too many people to even store the cars necessary to get them around, let alone space for them to get from point A to point B, from 6-9 in the morning.		Try comparing public transport to cars in London at rush hour, on Google Maps. Anywhere vaguely in the centre will be equivalent or faster, and that's not a particularly high density city. That's why 40% of households in London don't own a car.		Food/Hardware - people buy food regularly and within walking distance, and/or order in bulk over the internet. Internet or just store delivery for hardware (the sort of things that most people need - i.e. fridges, ovens etc. Obviously if you are a professional builder or very into DIY you'll need to have somewhere to store a van).		Music - just buy some good headphones or earbuds.		Also, I would point out, if you drive point to point all the time, it's really difficult to walk enough to be healthy. It's a hell of a lot easier if it's built into your routine. A lot of the places where people in Western countries live effectively have unhealthiness built into the infrastructure.","depth":7,"score":131,"ups":131,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JB_UK","name":"t1_cpmd1va","parent_id":"t1_cpmbh28","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426977786,"created_utc":1426974186}

You could tow a trailer and use the bed, but plenty of people who buy pickups because "they need to haul stuff" don't own a trailer and never haul and tow at the same time. The inconvenience I speak of is parking, turns, cost. Around here there are narrow streets with unmarked street parking and acute-angle turns. You can't park an 18-foot truck in a 17-foot gap no matter how competent you are, and I've accidentally ditched my friend in his truck by making a turn that he ended up needing to 3-point. Not really a first-time thing, either. My first car was an old "land yacht" Oldsmobile, and I've driven rented box trucks and an F800 at my first job. I'm no stranger to trucks; I just think a lot of people buy into all the marketing hype when some of the most common real-world use cases can be met with a car and a utility trailer. I can't tow a 30 foot powerboat, a car restoration project, or 10,000 lbs of logs but I can tow a jetski, a motorcycle, 1,800 lbs of timbers, or a lawnmower, which covers a lot of ground. I've twice needed a full-size truck and rented one, but the sum total of that was less than $100, which is about what I save in a month on gas and insurance by not owning one. Besides, I'm much more comfortable abusing a $400 trailer than a $20k truck. :P		EDIT: And, yes, if I were hauling stuff on a daily basis or several times a week, I would almost certainly buy a truck.

I'd hope he'd do the appropriate research required and look up the buses in the area. It's easy if you're used to public transportation. Of course compared to just driving somewhere it's going to be more complicated, but it's not so insane as to be impossible.		I lived outside the city of Paris and commuted in everyday for classes. Depending on where I was going, I used the metro mostly, but also the buses, and sometimes the RER. It wasn't the most convenient, since traveling by public transportation never is, but it was always fairly simple and an easy to use. As well as being extraordinarily dense.		Edit: [Here is a map of the bus lines in Montreuil](http://www.montreuil.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Files/La_ville/se_deplacer/Bus-en-2010.pdf) that works towards my point that it's fairly easy to get to most places there by bus.

{"body":"Athens Greece does that. On odd dates (1st, 3rd etc) it's cars with a license plate ending in odd numbers and on even dates (2nd, 4th etc) cars with plates ending in even numbers that are allowed in the city centre, with weekends being a free for all, a measure known as the Athens Ring. The idea was that only half the cars would actually end up driving around, so you'd cut pollution in half.		The reality is that people just bought a cheap second car with the complementary license plate. This was more so the case for families, where as soon as a child turned 18 they got that second card under their names, or each spouse had a car. Since the introduction of the ring in 1982, the number of cars in Athens has quadrupled, which is normal for an expanding city but shows the measure has had no effect in curbing the number of cars (http://livingingreece.gr/2010/09/06/athens-ring/)		Needless to say that this measure did very little for pollution, introduced more old bangers in the city, but the government is still supporting it as they worry what might actually happen if all the cars were to magically come into the centre.		In contrast to that, having a well-established, punctual and reliable metro system has convinced a lot more people to leave their cars at home for daily commuting (sauce: lived there).","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"o0orly","name":"t1_cpmkbdw","parent_id":"t1_cpm6xxf","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426992958,"created_utc":1426989358}

{"body":"The Beijing metropolitan area is generally the worst. Guangzhou may have a lot of factories, but various contributions to Beijing make it a hell for pollution. First off, its much further inland than Guangzhou so there is no sea breeze. Actually, there's very little wind at all. All pollution just hangs around. Second, Beijing is surrounded by industry as well. But all that industry is also surrounded by mountains, so the pollution has even less chance of dispersing. the Gobi dessert brings dust from the north into the air (the Chinese government blame bad air quality on this a lot too).		Another important factor is coal/wood heating. Many houses in Beijing don't have central heating and burn stuff for their heat, hence why record breaking pollution levels are often in winter. Guangzhou doesn't get as cold, and so this has less of an effect.","depth":5,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Simon-ARK","name":"t1_cpmd2mr","parent_id":"t1_cpm7y6l","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426977829,"created_utc":1426974229}

{"body":"Because the law gives you a starting point for several things: 		1. It promotes a trend in society of what is and is not acceptable through penalties. If 100 employees strike, it becomes much more difficult to fire all of them without getting caught. Then, they take them to court and it will be much worse for the company than rather just accepting the strike demands. The companies know that and just factor the possibility of a strike in their business plan. It is not only some fine or perhaps trade restrictions, but a big hit in their reputation both with the workforce (especially with high qualifications jobs that have plenty of choices and can choose a lower salary with better benefits over a more repressive company) and with consumers (brand name blemish). 		2. It allows trade unions to be formed which make it harder for an employer to go after the top-tier organizers of a strike. Trade unions are a big discussion, they can be good when they represent you but they can also be bad when they cut deals with the management that benefit only them. In any case, organizing a strike or even preventing all-together while still getting your demands is much easier when there is some structure in place. The union can also better organize and even pay for legal representation when there is a suspicious lay-off and such laws give them the tools to do so.		Also, in most countries, especially those that already have the right to unionize and strike, it is required that a specific reason must be given about contract termination in a legal document and the ex-employee can challenge this in court (in some cases, esp. public sector, he may manage to receive a monetary compensation for any damages, but also his job back).		The truth it is not only down to law but also the State (government, courts) to enforce these laws. It is mostly the trend that without strong representation, the lower the income and the more powerful the industry the more expendable you are. Just because it is written in law or the constitution it is not for granted, just a better guarantee than not being guaranteed at all. It is like stalks: a single one will definitely break with strong winds, but when grouped together they are much more resistant.		I can see what you mean, but I think you also see that this culture of fear and uncertainty, even when employees are objectively right, is the reason why having such laws and structures as trade unions is important. Your next pay check might be a concern, but what happens to you and your family if you have an accident? What if you are a woman and you get pregnant? What if you are forced to work unpaid overtime? Living in a country or working in an industry with no or few worker rights sucks, even if you make decent money. It took a lot of pain from people in the past so those rights are guaranteed and unfortunately if where you are these rights are not guaranteed, it will take a lot of effort and sacrifice to get them.		There's also the other side of the coin, with trade unions becoming so powerful they actually work against the good of the workforce they represent, or lazy people with connections gaming the system.The bright side is that nowadays there is technology available that can help alleviate such problems. We have the technology to guarantee every worker an online platform to voice their concerns anonymously, while on the same time decentralizing and making transparent union organization that is prone to corruption. I hope that such systems will be slowly adopted, so that everyone can enjoy a better work environment.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"flawless_flaw","name":"t1_cpmjsuj","parent_id":"t1_cpmiqh4","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426991891,"created_utc":1426988291}

{"body":"Good. Why should you bisect a city with another highway, when for the same amount of money you can make the existing highways less shitty to commute on by removing the people who don't really want to drive? As highway construction costs continue to skyrocket and tunnel boring continues to get cheaper and more efficient (assuming those trends continue), it might only be a few decades before that strategy is feasible in every semi-major city, not just NYC, LA, DC, and Chicago.		The thing about pretty much every kind of mass transit except bus is its way more expensive per mile but you have to build a lot less of it, especially with park and ride. And if you can get away with charging $20-$30 per spot per day, like Chicago and DC do, park and ride can partially pay for the transit system itself, assuming you don't build cheap crappy parking garages that need to be rebuilt every 15 years.		I don't see why London can't do something similar. I mean, its more built up than a lot of American cities, but you guys have your ghettos and empty brownfield sites, right?

You can't judge the performance of a possible future system by the performance of the current system. Buses could *reduce* your commute time.		Instead of the current 2 or 3 percent of people taking public transport to work, you need to push it up to 50 percent or better. To do so, make automotive commuting and parking about five times more expensive, especially in cities, but simultaneously add enough buses and bus routes to absorb a large increase in ridership. 		Compared to the current bus system, buses would be faster and would take you closer to your destinations because there would be less car traffic blocking buses (you could have bus lanes everywhere) and there would be a lot more buses running more frequently on more specific routes. 		And automatically driven buses could have conductors/guards instead of drivers. You get on the bus and there is a bouncer. You act like an asshole on the bus  and the bouncer bounces you off, maybe calls the cops to meet the bus at the next stop.

{"body":"I don't know where you are getting your information. Your link takes me to a general list of BTS publications.		The federal gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon was last increased in the early nineties. Total revenue from the gas tax as of 2009 is [less than $30 billion a year.](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/hf/pl11028/chapter6.cfm) Gasoline sales have been flat or declining since then so the figure is probably similar or less today. Total federal expenditures on the interstate [highway system for 2015(pdf)](http://www.artba.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Admin-Budget-Analysis.pdf) is budgeted more than $40 billion  and for 2016 more than $50 billion. (from http://artba.org/) 		So no, the federal gas tax does not cover the costs of the interstate highway system. 		The gasoline tax should be raised to cover alternative forms of transportation though, because of the hidden excess costs that car usage and gasoline usage inflicts on others in the forms of pollution and sprawl, among others. As it is car driving is  being subsidized here in the US, in many ways, and at great cost.		http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-17/gas-tax-cant-fill-up-federal-highway-trust-fund		http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/02/03/181506/us-keeps-building-new-highways.html","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iateone","name":"t1_cpmdq6k","parent_id":"t1_cpmcwtn","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426979188,"created_utc":1426975588}

Sorry about that; the report I had in mind [is this one](http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/federal_subsidies_to_passenger_transportation/index.html). From the [executive summary](http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/federal_subsidies_to_passenger_transportation/html/executive_summary.html):		>**Highways**		>* [Users of the highway passenger transportation system paid significantly greater amounts of money to the federal government than their allocated costs in 1994-2000.](http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/federal_subsidies_to_passenger_transportation/html/figure_01.html) This was a result of the increase in the deficit reduction motor fuel tax rates between October 1993 and September 1997, and the increase in Highway Trust Fund fuel tax rates starting in October 1997.	>* School and transit buses received positive net federal subsidies over the 1990-2002 period, but autos, motorcycles, pickups and vans, and intercity buses paid more than their allocated cost to the federal government.	>* On average, highway users paid $1.91 per thousand passenger-miles to the federal government over their highway allocated cost during 1990-2002.		Your figures are more recent than the above report, but I don't think you're reading the FHA report correctly. The federal gas tax isn't the only source of Highway Trust Fund revenue and the Fund isn't the only source of highway funding. For example, according to figure 6-3 in the FHA report, in 2008 there was about $195 billion in federal (almost all transferred to the states), state, and local funding, from not just the federal gas tax, but other taxes plus tolls. This compares to about $185 billion in federal, state, and local spending, so total funding still exceeds spending; thus, as I said, highways (still) more than pay for themselves.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TMWNN","name":"t1_cpomymz","parent_id":"t1_cpmdq6k","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1427164701,"created_utc":1427161101}

Had you looked up the stats on that, or are you just saying that because you heard it somewhere?		FYI - Lithium-ion batteries are non-toxic, and can even be landfilled.  This is *not* true, however, for the battery in a diesel car.  That battery is lead acid, and *is* toxic.  So the diesel car not only has a toxic battery but also spews toxic emissions.  The EV does neither.		Further, Lithium is actually extremely easy to mine.  It comes from salt flats.		A typical EV takes slightly more total energy to manufacture than a typical gas car, because of the battery, this is true.  However, cars use the *vast* majority of their lifecycle energy use during operation, not production.  And EVs have much lower operational energy costs.		So yeah, the EV is cleaner.

{"body":"Yeah, but unless you invest tens of billions all at once it's never "good enough" for enough people, and no one wants to pay that much. They don't want to rely on it for the majority of their transit unless it comes every 10 minutes or less to within 1 block of their house 20+ hours a day. But they don't want to spend more money on it, either, so fares stay too high or too subsidized, the service generally has terrible range and frequency (except for areas so population dense excellent public transit is logistically mandatory), etc. And the trip cost stays so high people look at it and say "Jesus, it would be cheaper if we just *gave* everyone a car. Fucking liberals laddling money onto pet projects and hopeless social engineering!" 		It's a catch-22, and it's made worse by the number of people who don't realize how much we're *under* paying for roads and bridges right now (we're trillions behind, and adding at least a hundred billion every year). They view what they pay now for their cars and their roads as barely acceptable, and don't realize they're not even meeting their share of direct costs. Much less any environmental costs. They don't realize, either, how much less they could pay for insurance, gas, maintenance, tolls, car taxes, and new vehicle purchases if they drove significantly less.		Few people see the point in spending hundreds of billions in tax money on *anything* except military or maybe education and medicine. Almost no one gets any traction whatsoever for spending hundreds of billions on projects with no sex appeal, like transportation.","depth":1,"score":36,"ups":36,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lolpubs","name":"t1_cpm8644","parent_id":"t1_cpm6ki1","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426968081,"created_utc":1426964481}

Once per hour is minimum service during "rush hour" for rural areas, here, with the odd bus in between rush hours.

{"body":">Oh please. Most people would be fine with something that showed up twice per hour, within 5 blocks of their house, during commuting hours (i.e. when you need to get to work, not 8-5 when you should already be at work), came on weekends to allow shopping and errands, went to with 5 blocks of their employer, grocery store, and bank, and did so reliably.		No, they wouldn't. I lived in a medium-sized town where most people had service *better* than this. Weekdays 6 am to 6 pm almost every bus ran every 30 minutes at worst. The main lines ran every 15. After 6 pm most buses were 30 minutes or 1 hour until 11:20. I could get anywhere I ever wanted to go within 1 hour; I could likely have gone anywhere in the *county* within two hours. This service was only used by maybe 5,000 business commuters per day in a metro of 500,000. It was clean, it was quick, and even after "massive" rate hikes I don't think it was ever more than $1 for two-hours of unlimited transfers before I moved in 2010.		This is not the least bit uncommon in America. I've heard it over and over again. If it increases their commute by even 25% the majority of people don't want it, and they absolutely don't want to pay for anyone else to have it.

{"body":"Banning heavy traffic means banning transport trucks, I guess it helps if you've got an industrial sector you want to only move their stuff through designated routes that lead directly to export areas as opposed to taking a more direct route that clogs up your main roads.  I'm not a good enough city planner to have taken advantage of it though.		You can design your city to limit bottlenecks through good planning, though this isn't my strong suit... but some of the keys I've found are:		- Limit your number of intersections; avoid having two 3-way stops right next to each other, instead drag one over and make it a 4-way stop, etc		- Add additional direct routes to distant locations; you can build roads at arbitrary heights so you can have a highway that links the four corners of your city for example and it'll take a ton of the pressure off the main grid.		- Build industry near export locations (ports, rail, air, etc) so they don't need to send their trucks as far.		- Have 6-line roads lead into occasional 4-lane roads, which split off into shorter 4-lane roads.  Looks kinda like a fractal.  Don't directly link to the main road except at major intersections because every additional intersection becomes a bottleneck.  If you want to get fancy or if you're desperate, make raised roads linking the primary 4-lane roads above the 6-lane roads so cars can still get around while avoiding the large intersections.  Might be good to make these one-way so they don't just put added load every single 4-lane intersection and make more bottlenecks.		- I can't find any reason you'd ever want to build 2-lane roads, they're a pain in the ass when upgrading later.		I just wish I could figure out how to increase my public transport ridership.  Got buses and depots out the ass, got routes that seem to link important locations (residential to commercial, residential to industrial), got an insane number of subway stations and tons of routes... but no matter how many extra depots or subway stations I build, my ridership tops out at around 10,000 total regardless of if my city's population.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nawoanor","name":"t1_cpmxwkm","parent_id":"t1_cpmqk6e","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1427038811,"created_utc":1427035211}

And of course that's just groceries but this works also for the other businesses and the public services too. Bank, mail, mayor hall, medicine, drugstores, insurances, real estate, home improvement, whatever: you have almost everything at walking distance.		I know several commercial streets hubs I never exploit for my shopping, that are yet quite close to me. I just don't have the mind space to think about them as I'm already focusing on 2 or 3 other hubs. It's an amazing richness of urban fabric. Murrikans have no idea what they're missing. Add to that the quality of the food and it's paradise for food nuts.		And yeah I can hop on a cheap train and shop in a prestigious Parisian open market less than an hour away from my place, although it's in the far side of Paris from where I stand.

I hate getting beer spilled on me while drunken assholes shout sexist remarks at all and sundry for instance).		Plus, the current cost of taking the bus is higher than the same cost in gas would be. I know I also paid for my car, insurance etc, but once those things are covered and I am looking at $1 for gas to go to a destination or $5 for the bus, its easy as a choice.		Free public transport would help of course, but then its going to become a sleeping place for all the homeless people whenever its cold outside.

Air pollution levels increased during the off hours, showing that people would rather work a 17-hour day than take the bus.		But those who wanted a more convenient way to get around the law simply bought a second car. The policy applied to cars, not people, and thus didn't restrict anyone from driving a different car with different plates on those "off" days. Not only did this increase the number of cars in Mexico City, but people usually opted to buy really cheap, hyper-polluting used cars as their backup, so they were polluting more on their off days than when they were allowed to drive their regular car."","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"urammar","name":"t1_cpmclny","parent_id":"t3_2zt6sc","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426976892,"created_utc":1426973292}

Diesel doesn't depend on the fuel being ignited by spark, basically any oil that combusts when under high pressure would suffice.

{"body":"Diesels are far dirtier than gasoline engines.  This is due to the fundamental physics of how they work.  In a gasoline engine, the fuel is thoroughly mixed with the air before being ignited; this allows it to burn completely and cleanly.  In a diesel, the fuel is injected into the cylinder directly, and it combusts as it is being injected.  This makes impossible to mix it perfectly, and so diesels emit a lot of particulates and other nasty unburnt compounds.  They are more efficient (in that it takes less fuel to produce the same amount of energy), but they produce much more pollution in the process.  If you are talking about smog-forming and particulate pollution, the efficiency doesn't really matter.  Gasoline engines simply don't emit particulates unless they are severely malfunctioning.		There are some new technologies that allow diesels to get close to gas engines in terms of emissions.  This involves filtering the exhaust with a very fine filter and a bunch of chemical neutralization.  But they are only found on very new cars, and they are very complex and expensive.  Most of the small cars that I've seen in Europe aren't new enough to have them.  You have a system like that if you have to periodically refill it with special exhaust chemicals.		It's not really a question of maintenance.  Older cars that don't have particulate filters simply aren't designed to meet many of the emissions specs that modern cars meet.  Also, usually emissions increase over time simply because the engine becomes more worn out and loses compression.  There isn't a whole lot that can be done to fix that, short of replacing the car.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"psycoee","name":"t1_cpm94wy","parent_id":"t1_cpm62hs","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426970025,"created_utc":1426966425}

It's "cheaper" for America to export all their manufacturing to China and Mexico. Optimizing purely on cost is very narrow-minded & short-sighted. It would probably be "cheaper" to not even put an exhaust on the bus whatsoever, or to have catalytic converters on cars.		An Acura is "cheaper" than a Tesla (up to some total number of miles driven, which may actually exceed the lifetime of the vehicle). But, for some reason, people still buy Teslas.		There are *a lot* of implicit costs. There is an environmental cost, as I mentioned. That had ripple effects into air quality, personal health, real estate prices, visitorship to the city, and so forth.

And if there is a limited budget for providing public transit, or a limited mandate for public transit not being cost-neutral to operate, then the cost of purchase and operate said transit needs to be a factor.		If you can change public opinion such that environmental impact is the #1 priority and thus the #1 expenditure, then I expect municipalities will respond by putting that in place.  Realistically to make this happen, most cities need to implement a combination of commuter rail, light rail, and then buses for the final widest coverage, in combination with making sure the city has high population density such that the majority of people are covered by the minimum infrastructure.		When the people are willing to spend trillions on this, it will happen.  Until then, we will need to make compromises based on cost.
