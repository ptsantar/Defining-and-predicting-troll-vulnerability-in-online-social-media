Got me. We had a boar that kicked the bucket around 7 years old, but it wasn't a passing away while you sleep kinda death. A wild boar probably has a better chance at a long life, just because he's so active, and thereby relatively fit. Stud life on a farm is pretty cushy.

There may also be the case that fallen243 is telling the truth but that there were other circumstances, such as them only donating if you bought X first (my local store recently had out of date cookies, if you bought for ~10 bucks you got a pack for free - I could see someone suing for getting sick from something like that, which is a "donation" but a very conditional one that they profit from).","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sajberhippien","name":"t1_crhbrkp","parent_id":"t1_crhb15w","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432297503,"created_utc":1432293903}

Civil Law or Statue Law is writen and made by legislators and politicians, common law takes a little longer to accuaratley describe... Usually common law opperates alondside civil law, areas left to common law included most criminal law and procedural law before the 20th century, and even today, most contract law and the law of torts, law suits etc.		Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals that decide individual cases, as opposed to statutes adopted through the political process.			If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "matter of first impression"), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent. Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts. 		The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding. The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves through a series of gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and almost always with unintended consequences).		Source - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law		So it evolves, it's a little like natural selection. Interestingly Dubai adobpted British common law precident for the Dubai International Financial Centre. Since it's well understood, 2.3 billion people live under mixed common law systems, and was seen as the amung most attractive to international buisness and effiecent systems and additionally operates without political intererence. 		My self I preffer UK common law, I see it as much less corrupt, inefficient, incompitant, and less petty, unfair and interfeering a system than the rule of the political system here. The way I see it political and lobbiest driven civil law is jarring and ruining the system. And would like to see the UK return to a more pure common law system, with referenda demanded by petition as oversight.

{"body":"Yes, law tend to be adapted, re-writen more so than stripped. However since judges though usually bound by precident if a law is outdated or unsuitable it will change since in exeptional circumstance it can be overruled. I mean we don't have many medival laws around, and this is why the cruft is removed.		Very much so the laws become more fleshed out as time moves on, new cases and new precident work out the details on a case by case basis.		- Justice Holmes cautioned that ???the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions.???[23] Justice Cardozo noted the ???common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively,??? but ???[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars.		I think it's a much better system, the problem is the more statute law that gets written the more it interferes with that process as I see it. Judges cannot overrule laws laid down by the legislature as they can with common law precident. So where ever it enters an area common law operates (once all areas) it ruins the process. And when those laws are unclear and work poorly, have unitended consequences judges can only beg politicians to fix them.					Negligence laws in the U.S and UK are quite interesting, they arose in separate systems, in cases years apart ultimatley arriving at similar concluions. And are both whole areas of law that have grown to cover a wide range of things, even child neglect in the UK, branching in scope to the concept of ["duty of care" in the 1990's.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care) These have evolved but thier liniage can be traced back through to specific judgments. This is why I want a system primarily of common law but with democratic oversights, and nulification by refferenda. Since I think that the public aught be able to repeal laws they dont apporve of.		So yeah you seem to understand it well here's a summary, of negligence laws evolving if you do find it interesting.		The law long held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract, could be held responsible for a wrong. Fearing "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved. A first exception to this rule arose in an 1852 case by New York's highest court, Thomas v. Winchester,[27] which held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling it through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger." 		In a case where a car malfunctioned the principle was extended in MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co by Judge Cardozo "We hold, then, that the principle of Thomas v. Winchester is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction."		So in the U.S the law evolved.		Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger." MacPherson takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that some boundary is necessary, MacPherson overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.			This illustrates two crucial principles that are often not well understood by non-lawyers. (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years. (b) The reasons given for a decision are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.","depth":11,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Citizen_Bongo","name":"t1_crhg31k","parent_id":"t1_crhdp9y","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432308002,"created_utc":1432304402}

{"body":"I'm no expert by all means.		Tort laws in the U.S has evolved differently than in the UK. In the UK you cannot sue for anything besides financial losses, incured costs and loss of income. In the U.S people can sue for much more than any costs incured and for losses even for negative consequences unrelated to finance.		So this means in the U.S law suits can be much costly, or rewarding from the other perspective. This means there is more incentive to sue, it also perhaps means law suits are less certain, since it can be pretty hard to disprove distress that isn't represented in financial figures. Which may encourage frivolous law suits?		There are argueable benifits to the U.S system, it's very arguable non financial grievences do warrent compensation. That it helps average people against big corporations etc, (Though naturally in cases this can be situation inversed).		One thing I do like class action suits in the U.S are very enviable in my opinion we don't have them here.			I don't know if common law helps develop such a culture, by itself I don't think so. Perhaps the U.S is exaggerated, and I think there are rediculous law suits in a lot of places.

{"body":"I used to work in a bakery at a large supermarket in England.		Christmas Eve one year was awful.  We time it so most of the goods will run out on shelf life that day (apart from the longer lasting stuff).  We do this because most stuff only has 2/3 day long shelf life, and losing a business day on the stuff isn't great.  We do obviously bake some goods that will last through to boxing day so it's not incredibly hectic when we get back, but for the most part we don't bake much on Christmas Eve.		One year however we just didn't sell much at all on Christmas Eve, and because it was Christmas eve, we had more stock than usual as people tend to buy fresh bread and rolls to use on Christmas day, it seems to be a thing a lot of people do.  However for whatever reason, we still had a lot of stock.

{"body":">So, I'm not going to further address then since I have twice. Is it still worth chuckling about?		Yes, because you're still missing the point. I'll be very clear: Libertarianism is an umbrella term that encompasses a number of different ideologies, including but not limited to: [right libertarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-libertarianism), [Anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism), [libertarian socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism), and [traditional anarchism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism). All of these can be described as a form of "Libertarian." Most Americans and (I suppose based on your testimony) Canadians use the word "Libertarian" to describe right-libertarianism. That was my point from the beginning. What you call "Libertarian" is not what others call "Libertarian." And, no, other people don't see the need to use the prefix in "Socialist Libertarian" in other parts of the world because it is assumed. Just as you don't need to use the prefix in "Right Libertarian" in the US and (presumably based upon your testimony) Canada because it is assumed.		**I cannot possibly overstate that this was my point from the beginning.**		The reason I found your post humorous is because of the way you hold up Right Libertarianism as the True Successor of the Libertarians of Yore??? and the other Leftist branches to be the redheaded step children of Libertarian ideologies.		>Regarding the brewery example, you focus so squarely on voting you miss an amazing thing of freedom		Well, it's a good thing you don't have a monopoly on the concept of "freedom"		>This is why people start their own businesses, often, because they are sick of being controlled by others and want the independence running their own business grants.		Good for them? They're free to do that. Good luck doing it without the help of other people, who are every bit as valuable to the process as the original person.		>Freedom was what made people leave their country and go to America with absolutely nothing promised outside "pursuing own interest."		Yep. That's why people came to America. Because of Freedom. Plain and simple.		>This allows business to actually create something versus holding vote after vote after vote after vote and coming up with something that tries to please everyone but ends up pleasing no one.		Uh, what? I think that you've got a pretty narrow view for how these things work. Not to mention that plenty of companies use the basic model I outlined and manage to be very successful.		>I ask a simple question: What color should we paint this shed? All the voters in Canada vote, some say red, some say green, we go with blue because that was the majority with 15%. 85% are now pissed off. Workers own the means of production, but, who actually got a say? Everyone, and everyone pretty much lost.		Why would all of Canada be voting on a shed? I'm really confused. Wouldn't the person who owns the shed decide what to paint it?		>Let's ask another question. What nuclear reactor should we go with? All the voters in Canada have no clue because they aren't experts so little to no valuable input is gained OR they just vote blindly. Ignorance doesn't lead to a functioning business (ignorance based on guessing what to go with).		What? This is absurd. Once again, why is everyone in Canada voting on this? If this Nuclear Plant is a private business (as I assume it is) then wouldn't only the people that work there vote on that? Not to mention, experts are usually the ones who assess that kind of data and present the options. Qualified experts and people with experience in those fields handle the specifics. This isn't that hard to imagine. Partially because such systems exist.		>My point with all this is that all you're doing when saying the workers own the means of production is limiting productivity.

{"body":"In general its not really villainy anyway. No one is under the impression (no one rational anyway) that corporations are the personification of evil, their actions may suggest it, but the problem is more deep rooted.		The problem is that money has no moral compass and the pursuit of making more of it is equally neutral on the moral scale. Sometimes doing the right thing makes money, sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes doing the cartoonishly bad thing makes money, sometimes it doesnt. Those decisions are made by groups of people looking at spreadsheets and the figures boil down the human impact to percentage points.		I agree with you, i worked at a supermarket and the main reason they dont give the food away is law suits, its just not worth the time and effort to employ the army of lawyers theyd need to field off people looking to earn a quick buck. I feel however this is a purely business decision where the bottom line was the deciding factor, if corporations truly had peoples interests in mind and recognised just how much giving this food away would change some peoples lives, theyd have done it already and it wouldnt take a government stepping in to get them to do it. Afterall, many have no problem pushing legal boundaries in order to maximise profits, why cant they do it to help people?		So, not pure evil, but certainly not blameless. But its understandable why some people think so, having lived on the poverty line, its very hard to excuse these kinds of actions by corporations.

Food has to be relatively fresh and put on shelf in a timely fashion or else the supermarket would be sued out of existence for endangering (or worse, actually killing) a customer because of spoiled food.		For something that has a lot of salt or sugar, it's understandable if it's possible to dumpster dive and get some of those. But for anything else like meats, produce and even some cooked/baked goods, supermarkets play with fire if they leave them on shelf for too long or for it to be distributed.		Even if they are to properly implement this distribution plan, there is going to be a limit. Also, supermarkets aren't supposed to be donation entities and they shouldn't be tasked with the additional worry that the food that is being distributed isn't risky and can result in health problems for those who receive the said food.		So chances are, foods that are heavily salty or sugary or properly canned can get that distribution treatment.

(Great volunteer opportunity for people with pickup trucks, btw.)	* Food needs to be stored. The food bank I work with distributes on Saturdays only; so if a store has excess perishable food on a Monday, we can't really take it. We also have limited space for storing perishables.	* Perishables are a huge pain because apart from storage, they need to be tracked to make sure they clear timely.	* It's preferable to avoid one-off items as they're hard to account for and distribute. That is, when we want to distribute rice, we'll procure thousands of pounds of rice - all at once. Getting something like a single cake clogs the sorting process up.

{"body":"I appreciate your effort to do some research on a topic that the majority have dismissed as me being some retarded kid. I also appreciate that you have pulled up some statistics that might seem important for this argument, unfortunately, they aren't.		Unfortunately, it's really hard to discuss a topic like this over the internet, but I will do my best to convince you that you are missing the point.		OBVIOUSLY, theft is a problem, and YES employees steal. But neither one of these is the real issue. It's sad that companies are allowed to treat every employee like a thief, and every customer like a saint.		You have to wonder, who would want to work for a company that assumes you are a thief? (Most, if not all, large retailers do). The answer? Nobody. Nobody wants to work for a billion dollar company, just to make barely enough money to eat, then have to come back to work each day. There's not a single person that WANTS to go to these shitty jobs. People HAVE to take these jobs, and these companies know it.		The problem gets further compounded with clouded laws, and seemingly shady agreements to fuck over the people that need jobs. How many companies in California reduced workers hours to 30 or less to avoid paying them 'benefits'? How many people in California are working 60-80 hours a week AND BARELY SURVIVING?		How can you survive when your rent is 75% of your income?		You can't, this is exactly what the large retailers want, and prey upon. They prey upon individuals who are uneducated or unable to break out of their trap. They promise you 'health care' where you lose another 5-20% of your paycheck, and still have to pay fee after fee for BASIC visits that consist of 5 minutes with an over-worked doctor. If you ask too many questions they mark a different code to your insurance and bill you $150-225 for the visit.		This might not seem like a lot of money to someone who was able to get a college degree and land a job at a company that pays $30,000+ a year, but it's literally your food budget when you're working at Kroger. Sorry, you now have to decide, do you want to see a doctor, or do you want to eat? Most people decide to eat. (which leads to a massively unhealthy population as a whole.)		BUT THIS IS WHAT KROGER WANTS.		They don't want employees who excel, they want employees who listen, and then abuse the person below them.		A normal person wouldn't look at his employee and think he's a thief, he'd be asking why he needs a free loaf of bread in the first place. The reason he needs a free loaf of bread which you are throwing away, is because you don't pay him enough.		You can show me all the numbers in the world, and I'm sure they are accurate. Employees DO steal, but they question is WHY?		Do you think the rate of theft at a company goes up or down as the rate of dignity received from the company goes up?		Show me that study and I would be SHOCKED to see theft rise as companies pay and treat their employees like they are actually people.		Also, for those of you insulting me, I encourage you to get off reddit and go get a job at any of your local supermarkets for a year.		Edit: I did a little googling and it's pretty interesting to read:	>A cost-benefit analysis proved that what companies saved in cash and inventory loss covered about 39 percent of the costs associated with wage increases. (So if a company increases wages by $1, it can expect to lose almost 40?? less in cash and inventory.)		>"Our study suggests that an increase in wages will decrease theft, but won't fully pay off," Sandino says. Therefore, an employer may find that it makes sense to raise employee wages if other benefits from wage increases???such as reduced employee turnover or higher employee productivity???translate into at least 61 percent of the cost of the wage increase.		Source: http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7092.html		My point stands, paying employees well and treating them with respect is a far better approach than treating them all like inmates.		Though, it's probably more work to recover the money lost to increased wages, and the families at the top of these companies have no ethics, so they compare two numbers $2 billion profit and $2 billion profit and choose the simpler one, regardless of human cost.","depth":5,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RealJimboPete","name":"t1_crhflwz","parent_id":"t1_crhahyf","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432307033,"created_utc":1432303433}

{"body":"I work in supply strategy for a major UK supermarket, so I might be able to give a little bit of context.		Waste is an incredible challenge in the industry, and one that is very hard to reduce. The main cause of waste is errors in forecasting. The question of "How many burgers do we order for this weekend" will depend on lots of factors, but a few major ones are:		* Historical sales performance	* The weather forecast	* If there are any events on (including local events)	* Is there promotional activity which will affect demand for this item		Let's say we predict a quadruple threat - we think it's going to be sunny, we sold lots this time last year, the manufacturer has paid us to run a promotion and there is a major sports event on. Maybe we predict we need 100,000 units of a particular burger. Orders go in and 24 hours later... it rains. BBQ's get cancelled and instead of wanting burgers people want root vegetables and brassicas. Unfortunately, we try our hardest, but some waste is just unavoidable.		Believe me - the industry is working on lots of ways to reduce waste. Most 'quick wins' have all been done, so most of the improvements in the future will actually be quite complex, but we are working on them. This is in our interest - it helps our bottom line.		Good news though - there are things that customers can do to help us reduce waste if this is an issue which is important to you:		* Don't reach to the back of the shelves to get the best life product unless you really need it. Lots of people do this, and all it means is that we get stuck with the products with less shelf life that are more likely to be wasted. Shelves need to be 'First in, First out' otherwise product goes out of date.	* When you are shopping for loose fruit / veg don't pick the ones that look the best - pick some nice ugly fruit. Customers will usually try to pick the best for themselves, and the uglier produce gets left by everyone to expire. They will still taste the same, so pick a few with visual imperfections on the outside and help those veggies get eaten.	* Be prepared to buy alternatives. 	* If the service is available, during major events (e.g. Christmas) pre-order your food (e.g. Turkeys) so we can order just the right amounts.	* Effectively plan your food usage at home - although supermarkets can appear to waste a lot, it's actually surprisingly little compared to the volume of food they sell. Most food waste happens in the customers home.","depth":0,"score":16,"ups":16,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Close","name":"t1_crhda3u","parent_id":"t3_36uiq7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432301997,"created_utc":1432298397}

{"body":"Not sure, I know there were regular "scandals" in France about food wasted by supermarkets. 		One (bad) reason given by supermarkets was that people who take things that are thrown away are not buying anything.		One of the regular issue was that some places were spilling bleach on the food they put in the trash bin. Officially, to avoid people getting sick with spoiled food. Unofficially (i.e the reason that most people believed) to avoid having homeless people around. I guess it's a mix of both, but the fact that supermarkets would actually be liable was apparently an actual issue.		Still feel a little weird since I often see some people (homeless, students, poor, etc.) taking unsold vegetables left by producers after the markets, and I never heard of anyone getting in trouble with that.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Wokati","name":"t1_crhlaqr","parent_id":"t1_crhhhsd","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432318511,"created_utc":1432314911}
{"body":"Two major reasons:		1. Lawsuits are really expensive. Even if it's a completely frivolous lawsuit that gets dismissed very quickly, it still costs a big company a large amount of money to fight. Seeing as how they don't make any money off of donating expired food, it's a no-brainer - they can do something that opens them up to liability, or they can save money by not doing it.		2. People will change their buying behavior if there's the possibility of free food. For example, let's say that you run a bakery. You have a whole bunch of day-old product that you would otherwise throw away, so you can make some more money by marking it as 50% off, right? Not necessarily. What if a large amount of your customers say, "Well, I was normally going to buy a regular loaf of bread, but I don't mind day-old bread. I'll buy that instead?" Now, your day-old bread is competing with what's actually making you money.		Having legislation to force this to happen is a good thing. There will be a framework set up that will immunize stores from lawsuits, and they don't have to worry about losing a competitive advantage because *everyone* is doing it.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"POGtastic","name":"t1_crhojga","parent_id":"t1_crhhhsd","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432323736,"created_utc":1432320136}

For some context: the original post I responded to was where someone said something like "when someone's right to their trash trumps someone's right to eat, things are fucked up." This poster was implying that because it is just trash, and the person is hungry, therefore the hungry person has a right to eat or take whatever the trash is. I responded by saying that property rights, regardless of whether they are trash or not, are important to maintaining order in society, regardless of whether or not they are deemed "trash," and because of that, it is still wrong to steal the food out of trash cans.

They are certainly not happy about destroying their inventory - they only do this because they think it's the cheapest way to operate.		The government is now forcing them to operate at in a non efficient manner. This means running the same grocery store will be more expensive, which means higher prices for all other consumers. That might be fine! The benefits to society may be well worth the additional cost to everyone else, but I just want to point out that there is a cost to government intervention like this.		It's policies like this that make me support basic incomes. Instead of this complex legal system that causes increased prices at the grocery stories that eventually benefits the underserved - (essentially a tax on the wealthy / middle class to redistribute wealth to the poor) - I would rather see a very simple system that just gives CASH to the poor.

A and B could peacefully trade, in which case both are happy with the result (A wanted the pen more than his $1, and B wanted the $1 more than his pen - if you asked them, *both* would say they are wealthier).

This can be accomplished by a community where 5 landowners have 3 cows, 5 others have 4 cows (total 35). The people with fewer cows are free to trade their excess capacity (allowing one extra cow to graze on their land half time) for the excess product (half their milk production) of their neighbors.  Or more likely one person will specialize in cow husbandry (owning the majority or all the cows), and barter for time on each person's land.  Each owner will seek to keep their grass as a sustainable resource that they can continue to sell later... and the cow owner will limit his herd to what he can reasonably manage (the 35 you mentioned). 		Specialization increases efficiency... we have the one owner that is really good at maintaining cows and buying feeding rights from his neighbors. Well then one neighbor might find he is really good at growing grass - a skill which allows him to attract slightly more business from the cow herder. The cow herder then sees that he can sustain one extra cow (going to 36).  In this case, the capacity of the field has now increased beyond the number it was at when everyone was treating it as a commons.		Edit: keep in mind that the Tragedy is that the commons becomes unsustainable as everyone races to get more of the resources ahead of others.

Makes sense, but it's hard in practice. In real life, fishers are unlikely to organize the way you mentioned (with a specialist who owns most of the fishing nets and pays the others to use their territory and other specialists who look after the fish colony and makes sure it thrives), perhaps because they don't trust each other enough to do so, they wouldn't trust consultants who tell them it's a good idea and their livelihood literally depends on it, or maybe they are just morons leaving money on the table.

What exactly are those hurdles? Where I'm from you can basically pack your stuff in a plastic bag and drop it off at a charity. Also that many more would do it by their own is pure speculation. 		> Imagine if the government mandated that you and everyone who works in your specific field had to accept increased liability  and were forced to work extra hours a week for charity, while complying with a government oversight structure.		I don't think there's a difference between having to comply with a regulation and having to comply with a regulation by working with a charity. If a regulation changes something for the better (environmental, work safety, etc.) it should be instated. Of course factoring in benefit vs. cost. This would be a seperate discussion per case.		Someone could also argue that oil companies should not be regulated when it comes to drilling oil (in the environmental sense) as this is too much of a burden and cost to stem. If you make money from selling oil you should be liable for the environmental impact.

{"body":"intuitively, businesses are in business to make as much money as possible. Part of that is minimizing waste, which is basically *throwing away* money. So the grocery stores do their best to have exactly the right amount of product on their shelves such that the last item is sold the day before it expires. But they also stock a little more than they think they will sell because, if a shelf is empty, a sale is lost. Stock levels are an inexact science so they feel that a little too much is better than a lost sale. And most customers will not buy a less-than-perfect looking apple or slightly stale loaf of bread.		Also, I would guess that the costs to maintain all that is involved in distributing expired food (additional storage space costs, additional personnel costs, logistics costs of getting the food to the needy before it is inedible) would be prohibitive. It would probably be much better (and safer) for everybody if they just sent their grocery trucks (filled with brand new, fresh produce, baked goods, and grocery items) directly to the local Food Pantries, Soup Kitchens, and Food Banks as part of the grocery store's charity programs.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"5thGraderLogic","name":"t1_crhdfl5","parent_id":"t3_36uiq7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432302380,"created_utc":1432298780}

{"body":"I watched the documentary Just Eat It the other day and it was about this very subject. I see a lot of people claiming that the reasons supermarkets don't do this is because they're worried about being sued but I think this is supposition rather than the supermarkets own argument. According to the documentary, only two people have ever tried to sue a supermarket for this and in the US a law exists to protect supermarkets from prosecution when they donate food. Most food is perfectly edible after it's best before date, the risky is with chilled food that may have been improperly stored but dry goods are usually okay.		What I'd like to see are laws that prevent supermarkets forcing suppliers to throw food away because it doesn't meet their standards. I'm sure there's a market for substandard food but supermarkets prevent this from being sold. According to the documentary, one fruit supplier has to dispose of up to 70% of fruit produced because it doesn't meet the standards. It also increases the cost of the product because the cost of the waste gets incorporated into the total cost","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IntellegentIdiot","name":"t1_crhdnrr","parent_id":"t3_36uiq7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432302941,"created_utc":1432299341}

"Objectivism" plays a role in the trailer linked above (as well as the film if you watch it) to Ayn Rand's philosophy (hence OP's comment about the author).		Rand wasn't necessarily the most appealing author to many at the time and she was always criticized for her work (sadly). The film, Tomorrowland with Clooney, exhibits Ayn's vision of a cohesive perfect collaborative world ALA John Galt.		My comment was simply put, the author was ridiculed and criticized for decades while her vision today is glorified in the big screen (with the help of fancy effects and Disney) without people realizing they could have read her book instead.		The director (Brad Bird) also did the the Incredibles (depicts how superheroes that saved the lives of people whom were eventually shunned by the public and punished, but there's more to it of course!).

{"body":"you should watch the documentary JUST EAT IT, i just did and it was very informative.. Under the good samaritan law you can not get sued for donating food:		Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated.[1] The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment.[2] By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance, and holds those who fail to do so liable.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law		Alot of the food wasted nowadays is perfectly ok but has a minor (non quality) defects. (i.e. writing on the package or the coloring of the label might be off.		Also alot of food is wasted due to esthetical defects but are perfectly ok (banana is stright, not curved, apple has spots etc). Many of this is dumped instead of donated just because the knowldge about the legal aspect (that you can not get sued) is not widely spread.. Many corporations think its saver to dump it then to risk anything bad.

{"body":"Legitimately happy to hear this. I shop at supermarkets sometimes such as Urban Fare, Whole Foods, occasionally loblaws if I'm in a certain area of town, etc. At the end of the day they have perfectly good food leftover in their buffets or in the deli. I asked the workers what happens to the food at the end of the day and I was shocked to learn that they throw it out. To add to that, they padlock the dumpster in the alley so even homeless people who refer to diving in dumpsters to survive can't get scraps. I was also amazed to find out that they don't even let the workers take home the food that they are going to throw out anyway. I mean, what the hell? It's an absolute waste of perfectly good food and a lot of people that work at these stores are students or people with families who would greatly appreciate free food that they are going to throw out anyway! We've become such a wasteful, entitled society and it disgusts me. I'm happy to see France taking a step in the right direction.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vancouveranon","name":"t1_crhboe4","parent_id":"t3_36uiq7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1432297201,"created_utc":1432293601}
