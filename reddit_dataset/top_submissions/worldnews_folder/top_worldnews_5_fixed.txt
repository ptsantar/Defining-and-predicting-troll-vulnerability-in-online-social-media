{"body":"This person has no idea what herd immunity is.  It sounds scientific though, so people just assume the guy knows what he's talking about and up vote it.		Herd immunity is a form of implicit immunity that happens to an entire population even if the entire population individually is not immune.  Basically after a certain percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, it grants a form of immunity to everyone within that population, even those unvaccinated or otherwise susceptible to the disease.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sakarri","name":"t1_cpdpuzt","parent_id":"t1_cpdmqzv","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426263931,"created_utc":1426260331}
{"body":"The person above me claimed that a person with measles will not infect others if they have been vaccinated or have not had the disease previously. This is not true, and that's not how herd immunity works.		Not everyone can be vaccinated for whatever reason, including allergies to ingredients of the vaccine or other adverse reactions, or people who are very young and very old. Children are not fully vaccinated against measles until they're 4-6 because it's a two step vaccine, and you can't get certain vaccinations until a certain age. There's a schedule. (Source: I have 2 kids under 4 who are fully vaccinated.)		Now that doesn't explicitly make him wrong, because he said "if they've been vaccinated" and so we'll give that the benefit of the doubt. However, I'm a well meaning parent with every intention of vaccinating my kids, and my oldest has half of the measles vaccine but cannot receive the other half. He's been vaccinated but is still vulnerable to measles. Also, people born before certain years were never given the second top-up dose of the vaccine because it was thought that measles was basically under control and so it was optional, but I'm lucky enough that my parents took the step of giving me the optional vaccine, which I'm really grateful for now that idiots have caused measles to come back.		So, you can still have had 1 measles vaccination shot and still be vulnerable to measles, but let's go even further and say he's only referring to people who've had both shots as being vaccinated.		There are still a certain percentage of people that the vaccine just does not work for. Vaccination is not perfect. One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective at stopping measles. The two dose vaccination is 97% effective. That's a lot of people who still get measles even if they've followed the vaccination program.		But the trick is that to get measles you have to be exposed to measles, which means you're around someone who has measles. If everyone in your community that you come in contact with on a daily basis has had two-step vaccination, every single one of them, it is highly unlikely that measles can penetrate your "herd." 1 person might get sick, and they're very easily contained.		Now imagine a world where 10% of people don't vaccinate their kids at all. 80 people in your peer group are 97% immune to measles, 10 people were maybe born between years where the only got one shot OR they're young children who have only had 1 shot, and so they're only 93% immune. The other 10 are 0% immune to measles.		In the first scenario, maybe 3-5 people get sick. They're easy to isolate, and the protection afforded by the other members of your herd being healthy protects you. In the second scenario 10 people immediately get sick, and the same 3-5 people from scenario A still get sick, but now the remaining 80 people are exposed to 15 people with measles instead of 5. How many more chances do those people have to be exposed to measles?		Now imagine those kids in public schools, riding school buses with kids who may not have had the second vaccine, because you can wait until as late as 6 to get it. Now imagine some of those adults are working around immunocompromised people...		Herd immunity breaks down because of people who don't vaccinate, and can cause fully vaccinated people to still get measles.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"animus_hacker","name":"t1_cpdr44z","parent_id":"t1_cpdmqzv","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426266024,"created_utc":1426262424}

{"body":"If you're sure it's not you, then continue on with Occam's razor. What is next?		The simple idea that although you CAN identify competence because you ARE competent, **you are not identifying the incompetence** or **you are unaware of those who are incompetent**.		I find it very strange that you think you know all 60 peers so well that you *know* they all are fully competent and deserve to pass. I think that is the least assumption. Rather than assuming 60+ people are all fully competent despite that being very abnormal or assuming that the teacher is simply amazing beyond normalcy- it's simply the assumption that among many many people (60) you don't know all of them, and the amount you know of each will diminish based on how much you know about them directly. More than likely, it's a simple explanation of "You don't know them, so you don't identify their incompetence." Since a single person cannot know 60 people extremely well in a very brief time, and it is unlikely anyone except the teacher (and even then) knows all 60 well enough- it takes very little to assume this is the correct answer. (There is research to back up the amount of people one may know very well is limited, and applying this research and basic logic makes it pretty easy to conclude you don't know 60 people this well. Unless you personally grade all their work and talk to each of them for a significant amount of time about this very subject.)		More than likely you do not know those 60. In fact, you more than likely know very little about the majority of them. For all you know, some of them are cheaters, some of them only appear intelligent because they are quiet.		Also, how do you know they can all write lab papers? How do you know they can all read articles?		Also, how do you know they can comprehend what they read in those articles? Do they deserve to pass simply because they CAN read? Does it not matter their ability to understand what they read?		The **reason** they're passing, is because they **can** do the work. That is all that is required. School work does not identify competence. It identifies someone's ability to do the work.		Although I'm skeptical that all you think are passing, are actually passing. I will set aside the fact people will not typically announce they are failing. So unless everyone's final grades are posted publicly, it sounds like a very arrogant think to assume you know all 0 people inside & out. 		Intelligence is not required to graduate. Completing work is required to graduate. Grades are also not an identifier of competence. Someone could have straight D's and far surpass a straight A student.		This is the point of why everyone discusses this "Everyone knows...". Schools do NOT grade competence. Most of the time tests are testing your *memory*, not your competence. It's all a very poor system unless the intention is to churn out more students and make more money / appear like you're educating well.		In a class of 60 or 300+, you cannot know everyone well enough. Even if you did, that doesn't mean you have the skills to identify incompetence. Hell, competence doesn't even guarantee you are competent enough to identify incompetence.		Ever hear of "The Blind Leading the Blind"? A student judging the incompetence of their peers is not the same as an expert judging the competence of a classroom.		It is also certainly possible that your area of study (whatever course you're taking) is one which more often than not has the appearance of a more equal competence among students. By this, I mean something like Programming is very easy to determine one's competence. You can look at their code or see them struggle- hear them ask elementary questions they should have known years ago. More abstract topics, like philosophy, will be more difficult to ascertain because it requires more expertise to identify competence.		Also remember the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Think about it in relation to your level of knowledge and others.		Think about all of this, and before you graduate you may be able to find out what you're missing, what you're not seeing, or humble your arrogance enough (if that is the factor blinding you; I'm not saying it is) or become more pragmatic in your generosity of praise (if that is the factor), and thus identify it. No longer becoming the butt of the joke, "Its you!"		Also a big thing that I don't really want to mention, is that it is certainly possibly "Its You!" High grades or top-of-the-class in no way signifies competence. Getting high marks only identifies your competence at getting high marks. Maybe some other things, like a higher chance of having better study habits, higher chance of being less distractable, and a plethora of other implications which research may support.		I know I threw out tons of different concepts and explained very few of them. My point was to show that just because you don't *notice* them doesn't mean they don't exist. Even if you are the more competent in the class. Also that your top-level competence among students may still not be a high enough amount of competence to identify competence. Remember you're a student, just like everyone else...which may be the problem!","depth":7,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RJAG","name":"t1_cpdxlz7","parent_id":"t1_cpdwe8x","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426276681,"created_utc":1426273081}
{"body":"My competence goes beyond my grades. You only have my word for it, but I am a competent physicist. A good physicist even. I know this comes off as arrogant, I am usually pretty modest but in this situation modesty isnt conducive to the discussion.  But lets ignore me for now.		Its third year. About 70% of my class are leaving in June and will graduate with BSc. I know they can all write reports because we have to write reports and they are graded and the grades are posted to the board. Its not as simple as grading an exam, report grading is different. But its also unusual, so lets discard that too, for the sake of simplifying a physics course down to the same metric as other courses (purely based on exams in regards to who passes, which I agree has a disconnect to real world competence).		Lets start with what I know. There were people on our course unfit to use their physics knowledge in the real world. The didnt understand the material, or bummed off of other students, or didnt have a good work ethic. They are no longer with us. They either failed or quit.		So we are down to class work. With a max of 60 people in the class (the compulsory courses) and a usual number of 20 or so, the lecturers know us. The physics department of Exeter is small to begin with, and our year is smaller than most other years. Every one of our lecturers knows us by name and face, and has the time, and dedication, to constantly ask people to re-explain things, come down to the board to do the calculation, etc. We can all do that. We have understanding of our class work. We all DO do that. 		The tutor system is also very good at exeter. 4 or 5 people to a tutor, meeting once a week, covering general questions we may have and also work sheets designed to test our understanding rather than remembrance of the material. While I am not in every tutor group, you pick things up. All the tutor groups are performing well.		So then we have the exams. Well, heres the thing. This is make or break. If the exams can be gamed, then you are correct. I may not be aware of how bad someone is. I know I understand the material, and I know that understanding is reflected in the exam scores, but if the guy next to me, who also gets good scores, got them just because he memorised the derivations, then the exam is flawed.		Which is why our exams dont ask us to write out the derivations. It asks us to explain how the derivation works, or gives us a 3D version of the 1D problem we learned, or uses a made up dispersion that requires different, untaught maths to calculate the density of states. We also have General Problems, something that is unique to Exeter and is basically a more taxing, written (as opposed to multiple choice) Physics GRE. They can ask us anything, the exam is rewritten every year and you cant just learn it. 		With only 60 of us, we cant cheat. And frankly talking to people, none of us want to. I know that sounds crazy, I know the states has a lot of cheating in exams, but its just not a thing in my experience. Why cheat? With something like Phys, if you get your degree by cheating, you are screwed when working later. And again, memory isnt tested. We are given 90% of the equations. We have to transform them, apply them, pick the right ones to use in certain situations, there are often multiple ways to get the same answer etc. 		Im not saying everyone in my course is good. I will go on to toot my own horn briefly and say I have good understanding and test well and write reports well, and can do literature reviews well, etc. I want to go into Astro research, probably Cosmology though maybe Stellar Formation in Sub-mm wavelengths, and my tutors and lecturers thing I am more than capable of doing so (and seeing as they are Astro researchers themselves, I trust them). But some of my friends are not cut out for academia. But here is the thing, they still deserve their BScs. They would still be good as analysts or consultants. I can point to a few who would be great as finance modellers for inner city banks. 		But thats a wide selection of jobs. So I come back to a metric I previously rejected. A metric that basically defines a modern scientists or any field. Can you do good lab work and get published. We all know the criteria to get published, and we all can read the lab work that is required to write those reports. We also know that sometimes people who shouldnt be scientists get published anyway, peer review isnt perfect. But its a good rule of thumb. So how can we, as a student body, test our ability to get published, peer reviewed, and not be found lacking? Well we already have. Second year extended lab project. 6 weeks of labs on a single, individually chosen experiment, working in pairs but with different goals, supervised by professors but not helped by them, with 80% of the marks resting on a lab report marked by 3, independent professors, 1 in the field of the experiment, 2 outside that field, 20% on the quality of the lab book you keep, with results published internally. We all did exceptionally well. All of us. For a start, no one failed, so we all wrote, as far as our professors were concerned, professional quality reports. 70% got 2:1 level or higher, and 40% got firsts meaning work of exceptional quality (first is roughly a GPE of 4.0 or higher I think?)		My point is there may be someone hiding in the pack, somehow striking lucky every time. But I dont know who they are. No one in my class group does. Therefore I dont know anyone who will graduate this year who doesnt deserve their BSc in Physics. They arnt obvious. We dont have a student who doesnt believe in Maxwell's equations (the equivalent of a Bio student not believing in viruses). We may have a student who doesnt quite grasp the Lorentz gauge for Maxwell's equations, but its such a small thing we dont know them as a bad physicist. 		I hope I am making sense, its a little hard to put across. We may have a bad physics student, but they are good enough that I, someone who is highly enthusiastic about physics and talks to everyone at great length about it, cant spot them. Therefore I dont know someone who will get their degree that doesnt deserve it. I hope that puts it into context.","depth":8,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"albions-angel","name":"t1_cpdzc7w","parent_id":"t1_cpdxlz7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426279568,"created_utc":1426275968}

Your comment (in particular the bolded sentence) strongly implies you're talking about people who have completed a PhD program. You never indicated that you were switching from talking about PhD holders to undergrads.		I'm not sure why you're calling me a "reddit intellectual." I'm in a PhD program (though I have not yet advanced to candidacy), so I have first-hand experience with the application process. Acceptance standards vary by university and field, but in my case, my grades and GRE scores were only a small part of what was looked at. Far more important were my writing samples, statements of purpose, and letters of recommendation.		The idea that anyone would *complete* a PhD program solely for bragging rights is pretty silly. A dissertation is a multi-year, major research project. You're also expected to present at conferences, apply for grants, publish peer-reviewed papers (which is a fucking nightmare), and TA. All of this is emotionally draining, incredibly time-consuming, and requires a level of personal sacrifice that most people working regular jobs are not going to experience.		I could make more money and have way more free time doing something else. Instead, I'm torturing myself for 5-6 years so I can become one of hundreds of people competing for the a handful of jobs.

{"body":"I'm not knocking PhDs, and I know very very well the amount of work that goes into them and the processes involved and the 70 plus hours of research a week many of them demand. I'm not saying that people with PhDs are all imbeciles, but I also don't believe these people are more intelligent.		What I am saying is that having aPhD doesn't automatically make you more intelligent and that it is an ever growing problem that people use their level of education as evidence that they are right instead of backing it up. 		This is a complex issue and it's hard to articulate this from the device I'm on because it's not very efficient to type on. But the amount of conversations I've had with so called 'experts' with a PhD our masters degree in a given field that automatically think they are right about everything because the PhD makes them feel more intelligent than they actually are is becoming astounding. 		Then you get into the issue of compartmentalized and specialized areas of focus and their knowledge is much narrower than they perceive it to be in their heads. It's a psychological phenomenon that is common in elitist circles of all types, not just education.		It's an easy trap to fall into, especially with education. But students are often a reflection of their teachers and become hard set in thinking they can't be wrong if their teacher taught them something that says they are right... that's fine if they can back it up, but more and more often they don't, they use their degree... 'i studied this for years I have a PhD and masters in X field'... when debating something related but doesn't fall under their scope of focus so they don't know... But they weren't taught it, so they don't believe it's an issue and refuse to even debate it and just simply believe they can't be wrong unless the person they are talking to has an equal or greater education level than they do. Which falls into that elitist psychological trap which is a big problem we see the effects of playing out in politics and policy these days. 		I'm not trying to argue, my only real point is that a PhD is only a measure of intelligence to people who are not intelligent. Are they above the average curve, maybe, but I've seen more than a dozen cases of people I grew up with fall into that same mentality with no real achievements accept their education, which is a great achievement, but most of these people are not very bright, but they try really hard, and unfortunately are now overly confident with average intelligence and don't take anyone else without a PhD seriously in any kind of debate.		I'm definitely over generalizing to make my point, but I digress. I'm not knocking it, I have a lot of respect for people who go through PhD programs, I just don't inherently think they are suddenly more intelligent than any other well read people I know that stopped after a bachelor's. Most of the smartest people I know only have a bachelor's and read and research as much or more than anyone. 		But, I'm not trying to argue and I wish you well. I personally read text books for fun, in fact I commonly ask people for their course outlines and text book names for all their classes, and I've had 2 people that were actually welling to share with me what they were, because if that very thing I'm pointing out here.

There are two worlds for every living human; the physical world, where laws of physics exist and your belief means jack all. And then there is the mental world behind your eyeballs where each human lives, and where belief is everything. 		Now, we think we live in the physical world, but that's not quite true; we live in our brains, and we telecommute with the physical world through our senses. This means by default, what we believe in is more important than what is actually real. It takes training to actually realise our own brains lie to us frequently, and that we need to use the scientific method in order to discern what is or isn't real. That what we believe in isn't reliable.		Why do so many people consider their beliefs more important than facts? Because many people live in their brains, not in the world. And in their brains "belief" is above all, even above reality itself. This isn't because they are stupid, it is because that is the world they live in. They refuse to see outside their own brains.","depth":4,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"VallenValiant","name":"t1_cpdnlce","parent_id":"t1_cpdn8q7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426259803,"created_utc":1426256203}
{"body":"I think you are completely correct. I think that "mental world behind your eyeballs" is a double edged sword, but overall it works to our advantage. In your mind's eye, anything is possible. You can imagine anything working anyway you want and that's good because we don't have perfect knowledge. We need the ability to move forward with ideas without completely knowing if something will actually work. It's what let's us imagine a thin rope holding us up, but not knowing for sure if it actually will. To find out, we try out the thin rope in the real world. Hopefully, depending on the results, we adjust our mental model of the world to match the results we found in the physical world.		I think the mental world is basically a biological, physical-world simulation device. We create models of the world and then test those models to see how accurate they are. You might decide you want a drink of water. In your mental world, you might imagine yourself getting up, walking to the sink and pouring a glass of water. When you try to run the model in the physical world, though, you might discover there's a pile of laundry in your path that you didn't account for (your mental model wasn't a perfect representation of the physical world), so you adjust and walk around the pile of laundry and keep going with the intended goal.		The trouble is, because in the mental world you can imagine things well outside of the laws that govern the physical world, there's often a lot of disappointment. In the mental world, while you are sitting bored in the physical world, you can imagine winning the lottery and going on a grand adventure. It can be nice to sit there and have that dream. And it can be unpleasant to come back to the physical world where you are still behind in your rent.		It's great because it allows us to move without perfect knowledge and try out crazy things we've imagined. It leads to discovery. In other words, if the wing suit you made out of feathers doesn't work (and you live to tell about it), then you adjust your model and maybe one day we all learn to fly. Maybe we even make it to the moon someday. Having crazy ideas in your head and being able to imagine things unfettered by the laws of physics is good - so long as you realize the boundaries of that world and understand its purpose. But I'm in complete agreement with you that some people don't see that distinction and can choose to live most of their time wrapped up in their mental projections of things... maybe because it's just nicer there. In the mental world you can inherent millions and go on a romantic date with your favorite celebrity, all during your lunch break. It's easy to see how a person could get addicted to living there, or at least find it much more comforting.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aaronby3rly","name":"t1_cpdq9du","parent_id":"t1_cpdnlce","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426264617,"created_utc":1426261017}

It all comes down to the debate between highly specialized vs jack of all trades. Do you want to be a small fishing whole thousands of feet deep, or an entire Lake only 2 inches deep? 		You can argue that it's beneficial to you to be able to have 0 specialization and know  a bit about everything. But the fact is the way we humans work nowadays that's basically useless. Because your are kind of worthless in a work environment to a degree. 		If a company needs programmers, they'll take the specialized guy that's been coming for 10 years, instead of the guy that learned a couple years but also knows how to butcher and repair a car. Same way if they need a butcher, they'll take the guy specialized in butchering over the guy that knows a bit but also knows how to code! 		Now obviously you have cross discipline jobs where that is beneficial. I guess if you want to start a butcher shop that takes orders online and you deliver the products yourself you will be able to do all 3 things yourself. Problem is that time wise you won't have time for expansion, marketing, etc, so eventually as you grow, you'll be best by just hiring a mechanic, a butcher and a programmer.

My final stand on this, 		Vaccines are extremely important and should be utilized.  Although this should be a choice to individuals and should not be forced.  An educated decision should be made by the individual and this education needs to be given by the doctor.  No more "well hi I heard suzzie down the street say this."

{"body":"A Shot Never Worth Taking: The Flu Vaccine ~ by Kelly Brogan, MD		Deep into my 6th year of researching and investigating the damning science that condemns vaccine efficacy and safety ??? yes, all of them ??? I am beginning to turn my attention more to the societal memes and the individual belief systems that protect and perpetuate tragically flawed and unacceptably dangerous collective behaviors.		The information is OUT THERE, brilliant scientists, physicians, and researchers without financial ties and agendas have weighed in and presented their concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, however, the average citizen resists and clings to a hyper-simplified, seemingly ???safe??? stance.	???Well, I???m not against vaccines, I mean, they???ve done a lot. I???m sure there are some risks, but they???re extremely rare.???		I understand, now, that, my collection of PubMed articles substantiating concerns about inefficacy, neurological, autoimmune, and fatal risks of these poorly conceived and anachronistically relevant immune modulators is not meaningful to someone who is not interested. The questions raised by this information are not provocative to someone who needs, above all, to believe that the government, the CDC, and doctors mean well, are doing their due diligence, and that they are holding themselves to a basic standard of ethical delivery of healthcare. They are not meaningful to someone who needs to outsource their power.		Instead of debating the science, what it may take to change to bring awareness to this egregious misuse of medical authority is, one of two, non-scientific, anecdotal exposures:		1.They see it doesn???t work, and may even cause illness	I have several pediatricians as patients. Unprovoked, all of these women have confessed to me that they have observed increased virulence in their vaccinated populations. It is this clinical experience that has given them pause about the heavy-handed mandate coming down from the CDC.	???Oh!??? I say, ???Have you read the studies that suggest increased risk of infection in the vaccinated population? There???s THAT ONE where they actually used a saline placebo in 115 children and found that those vaccinated had a 4.4 times increased rate of non-flu infection? Or how about that CANADIAN ONE where they looked at 4 observational studies and found that 2008-2009 H1N1 vaccination was associated with a1.4 to 2.5 increased risk of actually contracting said virus????	Only after they have a personal template within which to fit the science affirming their observations, do they have room to hear it. But what of all of the children they have brought this ineffective and dangerous intervention to?		2.They know someone harmed	It is basic human psychology that what is out over there is irrelevant at best, and threatening at worst. What is near and familiar is what is true. Few of us seek to bridge gaps between what we are surrounded by and what may be out there to learn. The difficulty of appreciating the scale of harm brought to the population by vaccination practice is related to the insidious nature of immune and neurologic insult.	The CDC can report, as they do, that brain inflammation and death are known side effects of every vaccine, but most do not appreciate what brain inflammation looks like. That this can look like ADHD, autism, learning delay, and that autoimmune disorders can take years to manifest. Tracing the thread back to the vaccine exposure can only be done with studies that assess vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations. These have not been done.		Tragically, we all know, now, of someone who has died from the flu vaccine, just this past week. CHANDLER WEBB, a healthy 19 year old, was given a ???routine??? and ???recommended??? flu vaccine at his physical, one day before he became violently ill, and one month before he died. He died from vaccine-induced encephalitis, a known risk of this intervention. In addition to feeling remorse for the pain that this family is experiencing, I feel rage for what I believe to be manslaughter. This is a medical intervention, delivered without any regard for its objectively determined lack of efficacy, and its potential to maim and kill healthy adults.		The propaganda surrounding this CDC and government-endorsed practice is so thick that doctors treating this young man were blind to even the most obvious of causative insults. If doctors cannot appreciate a documented adverse event that occurs within 24 hours, you cannot expect the system to acknowledge more complex disturbances to the immune system and neuorologic development that will land you and your loved ones on medications and in therapies for life.	And, remember, that this family cannot sue the physician who pushed the needle or the pharmaceutical company who created the lethal product.	I think about the Cliff???s Notes version, a distillation of why the flu vaccine is evidence that our government and regulatory bodies have forgotten us, and are following an objective that may leave you lying dead on the side of the road. I know that few of you will read the papers that I have read, attend lectures, seminars, and dialogue with concerned experts. If nothing else, digest these important points, and then wait until this issue gets close enough to you to change your mind on it???hopefully before it???s too late.		???It???s not indicated: I???m sure you don???t know a single person who has died of the flu, and if you think you do, I can almost guarantee you that the diagnosis was not confirmed in a way that ruled out the 150-200 infectious pathogens that cause flu-like syndromes, none of which would be ???covered??? by the vaccine. Despite the astronomical figures the CDC flashes before us of ???flu deaths???, there were 18 (yes, 1-8) confirmed in 2001, for example. Access to these figures is suspiciously concealed, but in the end, forget the stats, and use some common sense to see the fear mongering and sales marketing for what it is.		???It doesn???t work: The Cochrane Database ??? an objective, gold-standard assessment of available evidence has plainly stated, in TWO STUDIES, that there is no data to support efficacy in children under two, and in adults. Even the former Chief Vaccine Officer at the FDA states: ???there is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza.??? Liking the idea of being protected from the flu does not equate to being protected from the flu. That???s essentially what your vaccine-promoting doctor (or pharmacist) is engaging in ??? promoting an idea.		???Should there ever be a medical intervention appropriate for everyone?	It???s being pushed on demographics where it is known to be ineffective, or is unstudied and likely unsafe including children, adults, elderly, and pregnant women as reviewed on THIS WEB SITE and GREENMEDINFO. I write about how this offends my sensibilities as a perinatal physician HERE.		???We just don???t know what we are doing: The grave possibility of undetectable viral proteins in the chick embryos used to culture vaccines is just an example of how the immune roulette of vaccine development and rampant implementation has resulted in death and lasting injury. C. jejeuni contamination, for example, IS THEORIZED TO PLAY A ROLE in documented risk of Guillain-Barre paralysis after flu vaccine. Producing antibody response to virus and associated toxic preservatives is not immunity. We know that now.		As those of us who shake our heads in pain and frustration watching the sheep get herded off the cliff, we refrain: these agents cannot be considered ???safe and effective??? and also ???unavoidably unsafe??? as the government agencies would have us accept. They are avoidably unsafe, in fact, when you don???t use them as part of your healthcare.		~Kelly Brogan, MD		kbroganAs an undergraduate at M.I.T, Dr. Brogan studied Cognitive Neuroscience and worked with Harvard undergraduates to create a public forum for the discussion of alternative medicine, directing conferences for the Hippocratic Society.

{"body":"Ah Herd Immunity....		From vaccinationcouncil.org:		Those who are observant have noticed a dangerous trend in the United States, as well as worldwide, and that is the resorting of various governments at different levels to mandating forced vaccination upon the public at large.		My State of Mississippi has one of the most-restrictive vaccine-exemption laws in the United States, where exemptions are allowed only upon medical recommendation.		Ironically, this is only on paper, as many have had as many as three physicians, some experts in neurological damage caused by vaccines, provide written calls for exemption, only to be turned down by the State???s public-health officer.		Worse are the States, such as Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland, where forced vaccinations have either been mandated by the courts, the state legislature, or have such legislation pending.	All of such policies strongly resemble those policies found in National Socialist empires, Stalinist countries, or Communist China.		When public-health officers are asked for the legal justification for such draconian measures as forcing people to accept vaccines that they deem either a clear and present danger to themselves and their loved ones or have had personal experience with serious adverse reactions to such vaccines, they usually resort to the need to protect the public.		One quickly concludes that if the vaccines are as effective as being touted by the public-health officials, then why should one fear the unvaccinated? Obviously the vaccinated would have at least 95% protection.		This question puts them in a very difficult position. Their usual response is that a ???small??? percentage of the vaccinated will not have sufficient protection and would still be at risk. Now, if they admit what the literature shows, that vaccine failure rates are much higher than the 5% they claim, they must face the next obvious question ??? then why should anyone take the vaccine if there is a significant chance it will not protect?		When pressed further, they then resort to their favorite justification, the Holy Grail of the vaccine proponents ??? herd immunity. This concept is based upon the idea that 95% (and some now say 100%) of the population must be vaccinated to prevent an epidemic.		The percentages needing vaccination grows progressively. I pondered this question for some time before the answer hit me. Herd immunity is mostly a myth and applies only to natural immunity ??? that is, contracting the infection itself.		Is Herd Immunity Real?		In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason for this is that naturally-acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime.		The vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But, there was one major problem ??? vaccine-induced immunity lasted for only a relatively short period, from 2 to 10 years at most, and then this applies only to humoral immunity.		This is why they began, silently, to suggest boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.		Then they discovered an even greater problem, the boosters were lasting for only 2 years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those which they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR.		The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.		That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years.		It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life.		In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.		If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95%. Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection.		That is, herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations.		When we examine the scientific literature, we find that for many of the vaccines protective immunity was 30 to 40%, meaning that 70% to 60% of the public has been without vaccine protection.		Again, this would mean that with a 30% to 40% vaccine-effectiveness rate combined with the fact that most people lost their immune protection within 2 to 10 year of being vaccinated, most of us were without the magical 95% number needed for herd immunity. This is why vaccine defenders insist the vaccines have 95% effectiveness rates.		Without the mantra of herd immunity, these public-health officials would not be able to justify forced mass vaccinations. I usually give the physicians who question my statement that herd immunity is a myth a simple example.		When I was a medical student almost 40 years ago, it was taught that the tetanus vaccine would last a lifetime. Then 30 years after it had been mandated, we discovered that its protection lasted no more than 10 years. Then, I ask my doubting physician if he or she has ever seen a case of tetanus? Most have not.	I then tell them to look at the yearly data on tetanus infections ??? one sees no rise in tetanus cases. The same can be said for measles, mumps, and other childhood infections. It was, and still is, all a myth.		The entire case for forced mass vaccination rest upon this myth and it is important that we demonstrate the falsity of this idea. Neil Z. Miller, in his latest book The Vaccine Information Manual, provides compelling evidence that herd immunity is a myth.		The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions		Those pushing mandatory vaccination for an ever-growing list of diseases are a mixed bag. Some are quite sincere and truly want to improve the health of the United States. They believe the vaccine-induced herd immunity myth and likewise believe that vaccines are basically effective and safe. These are not the evil people.	A growing number are made of those with a collectivist worldview and see themselves as a core of elite wise men and women who should tell the rest of us what we should do in all aspects of our lives.		They see us as ignorant cattle, who are unable to understand the virtues of their plan for America and the World. Like children, we must be made to take our medicine ??? since, in their view, we have no concept of the true benefit of the bad-tasting medicine we are to be fed.		I have also found that a small number of people in the regulatory agencies and public health departments would like to speak out but are so intimidated and threatened with dismissal or destruction of their careers, that they remain silent. As for the media, they are absolutely clueless.		I have found that ???reporters??? (we have few real journalists these days) rarely understand what they are reporting on and always trust and rely upon people in positions of official power, even if those people are unqualified to speak on the subject.		Most of the time they run to the Centers for Disease Control or medical university to seek answers. I cannot count the number of times I have seen university department heads interviewed when it was obvious they had no clue as to the subject being discussed. Few such professors will pass up an opportunity to appear on camera or be quoted in a newspaper.		One must also appreciate that such reporters and editors are under an enormous economic strain, as vaccine manufacturers are major advertisers in all media outlets and for an obvious reason ??? it controls content.		A number of excellent stories on such medical subjects are spiked every day. That means we will always be relegated to the ???fringe media??? as our media outlets are called. Despite the high quality of the journalism in many of the ???fringe??? outlets, they have a much smaller audience. And despite this we are having an enormous effect on the debate.		As the Public Awakens, the Collectivist Becomes Desperate		John Jewkes, in his book Ordeal by Planning, observed that as the British collectivists began to see opposition rise to their grandiose plans, they became more desperate and aggressive in their reaction.		They then initiated a campaign of smearing their opponents and blaming every failure on the unwillingness of the people to accept the planner???s dictates without question.		We certainly have seen this in this debate ???opponents to forced vaccinations are referred to as fringe scientists, kooks, uneducated, confused, and enemies of public safety ??? reminiscent of Stalin???s favorite phrase, ???enemy of the people.???		This desperation is based upon their fear that the public might soon catch on to the fact that the entire vaccine program is based upon nonsense, fear, and concocted fairy tales.		One special fear of theirs is that the public might discover the fact that most vaccines are contaminated with a number of known and yet-to-be discovered viruses, bacteria, viral fragments, and DNA/RNA fragments. And, further, that our science demonstrates that these contaminants could lead to a number of slowly-developing degenerative diseases, including degenerative diseases of the brain.		This is rarely discussed but is of major importance in this debate.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"timo1200","name":"t1_cpepvvn","parent_id":"t1_cpeooh6","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426352105,"created_utc":1426348505}
{"body":"> One quickly concludes that if the vaccines are as effective as being touted by the public-health officials, then why should one fear the unvaccinated? Obviously the vaccinated would have at least 95% protection.	> This question puts them in a very difficult position. Their usual response is that a ???small??? percentage of the vaccinated will not have sufficient protection and would still be at risk. Now, if they admit what the literature shows, that vaccine failure rates are much higher than the 5% they claim, they must face the next obvious question ??? then why should anyone take the vaccine if there is a significant chance it will not protect?	> When pressed further, they then resort to their favorite justification, the Holy Grail of the vaccine proponents ??? herd immunity. This concept is based upon the idea that 95% (and some now say 100%) of the population must be vaccinated to prevent an epidemic.	> The percentages needing vaccination grows progressively. I pondered this question for some time before the answer hit me. Herd immunity is mostly a myth and applies only to natural immunity ??? that is, contracting the infection itself.		Uh I am sorry I can't even read the rest - ~~**YOU ARE SO DUMB, YOU ARE MAKING YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS**~~		First, if you don't want to get vaccinated, okay, but refrain from interacting with the rest of society!		Herd immunity - do you even understand at a basic level how this works. Herd immunity does not give an individual person immunity against a disease - herd immunity is a concept that when so many people are vaccinated in a population, that if one person happens to contact the disese  didn't get vaccinated (or, maybe they actually couldn't, or it didn't take) - the vaccine has nowhere to spread to since the people that person interacts with are immunized. The body fights off the infection before it has time to spread to the next suseptible (unimunized) host.. 		**Is that really that hard of a concept? You should have a basic understanding on things you are going to so confidently speak about. This isn't wall street... There is no it exists or it doesn't exist - it just is a thing - if an infected person is not next suseptible host, it doesnt spread since it [the pathogen] cannot survive outside of a body**		So, basically you just make stuff up in your head and tout it as truth?			"Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection." - Um, in what world do you live in - where are you getting these number outside of just totally making them up. WHy do you insist on people believing you when you are just 100% lying		**You are a fraud no different than a televengalist fake pastor**			"When we examine the scientific literature, we find that for many of the vaccines protective immunity was 30 to 40%, meaning that 70% to 60% of the public has been without vaccine protection."		**Please, I beg you, show me any scientific literature you are referring to, we need quality sources, not shitty ones that fit your line of though**		"They believe the vaccine-induced herd immunity myth and likewise believe that vaccines are basically effective and safe. These are not the evil people. "		**They aren't, they understand concepts that are beyond your grasp. You are an evil person, you are making up LIES and touting them as truth, you have no actual basis for anytihng you are saying, you wrap it in certain language akin to a pastor and then tout it as praise / speech** 		"more dumb shit you post that has nothing to do wtih this conversation, but sounds good"	**ignore it**		**Sir, if vaccines don't work and herd immunity isn't a thing, please give me a good explanation about how over the last decade multiple disease (measles, whooping cough) pop up ONLY in populations that have not received vaccines**		According to you, vaccines don't work, cause problems, and herd immunity doens't exist. Well here you go, Measles was considered extinct int eh US until someone brought it back to an unvaccinated area in Cali. Why do you think it had no problem spreading in the unvaccinated population and never made it into general public? Thing is it spread to multiple disconnected population zones very easy, but never made it out of the unvaccinated population. Whooping cough has sprung up multiple times in california, and once in a hasidic jewish population in Brooklyn that doens't believe in vaccines - why are these teh only place that these disease are popping up? **WHy haven't they affected the vaccinated population if vaccines and herd immunity don't work?**			Seriously, stop replying like you are a pastor, this isnt' a religious argument, I don't want any devine arguments. I understand you probably have a lot of weak / lost people who follow you and believe anything you say, but just have a real discussion and leave the BS language out of it.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"akmalhot","name":"t1_cphlupj","parent_id":"t1_cpepvvn","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426601076,"created_utc":1426597476}

{"body":"The Great Divide: spanning the chasm between truth and egregious lies. ~by Shawn Siegel		There???s not a mother alive who, once having ALL the available information, would allow anyone to vaccinate her child. A primary function of the bulk of the immune system, virtually always bypassed by injecting vaccines, is precisely to preclude such intrusions into the bloodstream.		Every vaccine is dangerous. Look at any picture of a child ??? in his or her nose, mouth, throat, the entire digestive tract, the respiratory and urogenital tracts and on the surface of the skin, there is an elegant, highly evolved immune system, designed to greet virtually all toxins and potentially pathogenic organisms ??? to eliminate them directly (1), or biochemically alter or change them (2), before they gain access to the bloodstream. Food proteins are broken down by the digestive process into their short-chain amino acids before entering the bloodstream, or food allergies and progressively much worse, chronic disorders can result (3). In its wildest imagination, medical science couldn???t hope to duplicate that process, and intramuscular injection of vaccines, which contain all of the above ??? disease antigens, neurotoxins and food proteins (4), not to mention unknown contaminants ??? assaults it. To vaccine proponents, it???s as though the biological reality, all that biochemical, metabolic immune busywork that kicks into gear upon natural exposure, to extract everything beneficial and eliminate or mitigate toxic intrusion into the circulatory system, can simply be overlooked, with no consequence. It???s as though there would be no consequence if air were injected directly into the bloodstream, instead of going through the respiratory process, where the oxygen is biologically extracted and passed on to blood cells.		Ironically, the only reason the paradigm continues is because the insult is so egregious. If after a vaccination your arm immediately atrophied, folks would get the point. Instead, many of the most often realized immediate and, in reality, alarming adverse effects are temporary, thus relatively easy to pass off simply as commonplace, and not worrisome, while the bulk of vaccine injury is autoimmune or neurological in nature, and typically well delayed from the fact of the vaccination. That delay is a weapon in the hands of the vaccine industry. It???s difficult for a lay parent, uneducated in the nature of vaccine adversity, to relate a reaction that displays even a few days after a vaccination, let alone a few weeks, to the vaccine itself, especially when, despite reams of information in available medical literature to the contrary, doctors themselves discount the connection. Meanwhile, immunologists tell us that it can take months, and even years, for adjuvant-induced autoimmune diseases to display (5); lupus, epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, blood disorders, arthritis, Guillain-Barr??, encephalitis; autistic encephalitis (6).		That delay is the Great Divide, the temporal chasm separating the harsh reality of vaccination ??? the intentionally aberrant stimulation and defiance of such innate, embedded, essential capabilities as the natural mucosal immune system and the cauldron of digestive process ??? from widespread awareness of its consequences.		Look around, however, and the consequences are obvious, for what we have is herd autoimmunity. The incidence of autoimmune and neurological disorders in the U.S., many of them seriously debilitating, some of them ultimately fatal, dwarfs the incidence of mortality or injury from infectious disease. The aluminum salt adjuvants in vaccines, by the current vaccination schedule administered sixteen times to a child before the age of two (7), have been tied in various studies to both autoimmune and neurological disorders (8)(9). Toxicologist Dr. Victor Vaughn testified to the FTC that aluminum salts are poisonous when injected (10). Adjuvants are used by researchers to study autoimmunity, because when injected into lab animals they trigger rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (11).		Mercury is still present and accounted for in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine (4), in full, preservative concentration, and most of the shots administered are from those vials ??? they???re cheaper per shot, thus more likely to be stocked by doctors, and the majority of vaccine recipients simply aren???t aware of the tremendous difference in mercury concentration, single dose versus multi. In TV coverage of a flu shot clinic held at an elementary school last winter, every kid was given a shot from a multi-dose vial. No doubt, the parents were denied any notification or meaningful warning of the mercury content. Mercury is present in trace amounts in several other vaccines, but while the CDC characterizes a trace as a???biologically unpersuasive???amount, there truly are no known lower safety limits for injected toxins. Nor could there be, since every child is individual, with unique genetics, unique metabolism, unique exposure history and diet ??? there???s absolutely no way to accurately predict what any child???s reaction will be, so the precautionary principle alone precludes injecting it. Moreover, at one point some years ago, a public health advocate website sent four vaccine samples to a lab for analysis; two of the samples were labeled as containing a trace of thimerosal, two as containing none, but mercury was detected in all four samples (12). While there was a significantly lower concentration in the samples ostensibly containing no thimerosal, again: there are no known lower safety limits for injected toxins.		Aluminum and mercury work in synergy ??? their combined neurotoxicity is many times greater than the sum of their individual threats (13) ??? and at six months of age there are literally millions of babies given both in essence simultaneously, at a vaccination schedule compliance surveillance session, euphemistically labeled a wellness visit, which includes both the flu shot and several other vaccines. At eighteen months, it???s repeated (7).		In the U.S., mortality from infectious disease was down in the single digits per 100,000 in the general population well before the vaccines were introduced (14). Given good nutrition and healthy living condition, the vast majority of people who develop infectious diseases come out unscathed, recovered to normal health (15). Meanwhile, 1 in 6 kids has a learning disorder, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile diabetes, asthma, potentially life-threatening allergies, are all skyrocketing when compared with the incidence only a few decades ago. The recent official announcement of the autism rate was 1 in 68, but the database used to calculate that number was from several years ago, already outdated. There???s been no sign of a plateau, and if the current rate of annual increase continues unabated, in only three years 1 in 10 boys will be diagnosed on the autism spectrum(16). Five years later it???ll be 1 in 5 boys, and about 1 in 25 girls. The CDC is well aware of the apparently uncontrollable tide, yet each time the number is updated feigns surprise, or apparent lack of concern, or we see yet another spate of research, such as a recent study linking autism to environmental factors in the womb ??? but always with careful, deliberate avoidance of any mention of vaccines as even a possible causal factor.		When you consider the possible outcome only two generations down the line, the effect in every way imaginable of the inexorable degradation of the nation???s physical health and mental acuity is beyond description. Tsunami doesn???t even do it justice. If a nation???s very ability to achieve degrades, it ultimately cannot survive. There are undoubtedly many factors, from the psychotropics dripping from us into our water supply, to genetically modified foods that have then had the nutrients processed out of them. But there???s only one direct injury to the natural function of the immune system, and that???s vaccination ??? intramuscular injection ??? with its accompanying mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, cell cultures from human fetuses, polysorbate 80, neomycin, MSG, ethanol, food proteins and unknown contaminants. There???s an ingredient in three of the available flu vaccines (4), Triton X-100, the information for which on the manufacturer???s website (17) includes the following hazard statement (18):		H302: Harmful if swallowed / Acute toxicity, oral		This is madness, to routinely inject a substance acutely toxic when ingested, bypassing the very reactions designed to protect the bloodstream from such a threat. Were the toxin ingested, the most immediate immune reaction would likely be elimination, from the stomach or the bowels, possibly through rash, and the like. Other metabolic processes would continue, including at least partial detoxification by the liver, before the substance entered the circulatory system. Vaccination deposits vaccine ingredients directly into the capillary beds of the muscles, from which they???re quickly absorbed into the bloodstream.","depth":2,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"timo1200","name":"t1_cpdm6g8","parent_id":"t1_cpdkru1","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426256786,"created_utc":1426253186}
{"body":"> lupus, epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, blood disorders, arthritis, Guillain-Barr??, encephalitis; autistic encephalitis (6)		None of this has been directly tied to vaccinations - I could say going outside and breathing pollution is indirectly causing the spike, and would be just as correct as you.		Yes, there is risk in vaccination, but there is much more risk in non vaccination. How many children have died in the last year because they were not vaccinated? 		Listen, I'm all for the exchange of ideas, and you have attempted to bring light to some, but first things first, drop the bible thumper bs way of talking: "That delay is the Great Divide, the temporal chasm separating the harsh reality of vaccination " - save that ish for people who are lost and fascinated by your linguistic aptitude, I don't wan't to have to read 10 paragraphs to see you are making 1 point, in whic you make a fake reference (10) but there is not actual study/bibliography.		Your first claim: "Meanwhile, immunologists tell us that it can take months, and even years, for adjuvant-induced autoimmune diseases to display (5); lupus, epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, blood disorders, arthritis, Guillain-Barr??, encephalitis; autistic encephalitis (6)."		Answer - No, vaccines have not been attributed to any of these disease. In fact peer review (peer review means that other doctors, scientists etc have read it and decided the information was of high quality - as in there was little to no bias, the results are 'natural and true.'). If you have EVIDENCE please respond and reference		claim #2: Aluminum Cl is bad - sure that is true at high concentraions. I went to some of the anti vax sites and they just give false info. One site claims there was 125 mcg Al in each vaccine, when the truth is there is 0.125 mcg Al!!! 		"The aluminum contained in vaccines is similar to that found in a liter (about 1 quart or 32 fluid ounces) of infant formula. While infants receive about 4.4 milligrams* of aluminum in the first six months of life from vaccines, they receive more than that in their diet. Breast-fed infants ingest about 7 milligrams, formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams, and infants who are fed soy formula ingest almost 117 milligrams of aluminum during the same period."		Again with the Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not even linked to vaccines: "Because the immunisation programmes and epidemiological studies indicate that there is no or only a very slight association between hepatitis B vaccination and autoimmune or chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorders, the benefits of the vaccine probably outweigh the risks of possible side effects. Universal hepatitis B vaccination indeed significantly reduced the virus carrier and infection rates among children and adolescents in a hyperendemic area." - Also repeated in numerous studies that are legitimate - just google / pubmed.		claim 3: mercury - yes vaccines contain mercury, however the exposure from vaccination still exposes children to levels that are below hte reccomended limit of exposure. Mercury is everywhere, you are exposed all the time. Do you eat fish? Breath air? Just like you are exposed to radiation and you can't do anything about it, but htere is a safe level of exposure, and vaccination falls into it. Again, some anti vax websites have the levels contained within vaccines blatantly wrong - do they even know what a microgram is?			There is no statements, just very loose correlation in the entire paragraph - first of all introduction of vaccination wasn't the only thing that happend in this timeline - how can you attribute these cherry picked changes to that??? Guess what - average age of life has skyrocketed recently too, is that because of vaccines? [actually in my sarcasm this does have an affect on the ave age] : "In the U.S., mortality from infectious disease was down in the single digits per 100,000 in the general population well before the vaccines were introduced (14). Given good nutrition and healthy living condition, the vast majority of people who develop infectious diseases come out unscathed, recovered to normal health (15). Meanwhile, 1 in 6 kids has a learning disorder, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile diabetes, asthma, potentially life-threatening allergies, are all skyrocketing when compared with the incidence only a few decades ago. The recent official announcement of the autism rate was 1 in 68, but the database used to calculate that number was from several years ago, already outdated. There???s been no sign of a plateau, and if the current rate of annual increase continues unabated, in only three years 1 in 10 boys will be diagnosed on the autism spectrum(16). Five years later it???ll be 1 in 5 boys, and about 1 in 25 girls.

{"body":"Continued...		The now routine vaccination of pregnant women with both the flu and Tdap vaccines is a relatively recent but definitive muddying of the waters. As likely as not that those women are receiving flu shots from multidose vials, which contain 25 mcg of mercury per dose, and the Tdap carries its own toxic load; aluminum, formaldehyde and more. It???s well known that the fetus can be catastrophically affected by maternal toxins passed to the umbilical cord, through the placenta. This was demonstrated fifty years ago by Minamata disease; mercury poisoning from fish heavily contaminated by waste water from a chemical plant in Minamata, Japan. Some infants were born with it ??? and, in a bizarre twist of fate, the pregnant mothers were less affected, having passed the toxic mercury on to their babies. (19)(20). It???s obfuscatory enough when vaccines are administered within hours of birth, precluding a before and after picture; precluding a memory of the normal child when things go wrong. We are now fostering neurological damage in the unborn, as well.		The immune system functions on a molecular level, but I liken it to an automobile engine: vaccination???s like sifting a handful of detritus into the carburetor, on the wrong side of the fuel filter, and expecting the car to run better as a result ??? and when later that day or the next morning the engine sputters, or stalls, or dies, your mechanic, who not only advised but insisted on the procedure in the first place, tells you assuredly that there???s no connection; to bring the car back in, for additional repair ??? for this unexpected, new problem. As a realistic mechanical scenario, it???s obviously preposterous, but as it relates to vaccination, it???s an all too accurate analogy. Where there should be discernment and recognition of the possibility of causative relation between the procedure and its consequences, there is instead that divide, that chasm, that erosion, that space created by the delay in display of vaccine-induced autoimmune and neurological disorders, the constant mainstream of misinformation and the withholding of so much critical information, now littered, like some macabre landfill, with the unwarranted fear of disease, the ceaseless falsity of the myth of vaccine safety and efficacy, and the social coercion of the absurdity that is the idea of herd immunity through vaccination.

Further epidemiological and in vitro experiments can be used to determine method of transmission. 		In the case of measles specifically, Francis Home, a Scottish physician, demonstrated in 1757 that measles is caused by an infectious agent in the blood of patients. In 1954 Enders and Peebles determined it was a virus when they isolated it from the blood of patients during a measles outbreak and went on to create a vaccine for it.
