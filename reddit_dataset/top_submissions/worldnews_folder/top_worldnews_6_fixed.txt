{"body":"Not at all. I'll speak to baseball specifically here, since I'm unaware of NHL/NBA/NFL talent coming out of Cuba enough to warrant a process. 		There are four primary methods by which a player can be signed to a MLB team:		1. The [MLB First Year Player Draft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft#Eligibility), or Rule 4 Draft, is how American and Canadian players enter the league. After they complete high school, or if they go to college, after finishing their junior year, players can enter the draft. They can only sign with the team that selects them, unless they choose to attend (or return to) college, at which point the drafting team receives a compensatory pick the following year. The player can then re-enter the draft the next year he's eligible. 		2. "International" free agents from countries other than the U.S. and Canada (with exceptions, which I'll detail below) are subject to a different process, whereby they sign contracts with an MLB team of their choosing once they turn 16. The current rules provide a soft cap on what teams can spend each year on these contracts, with escalating penalties if a team exceeds that limit. Only if a player is at least 23 years of age and has played at least 5 years as a professional in a recognized league, or 3 years in a Cuban professional league, may he directly become a free agent.		3. Japan has its own professional baseball league, the NPB, and rules are in place to prevent top Japanese players from signing with MLB instead. For a Japanese player to come to MLB he must either complete his initial contract with his NPB club and become a free agent, or his team must agree to "post" him while he's still under contract. Under the posting system, his NPB team sets a posting fee which any MLB team signing him to a contract must pay to his former club.		4. Cuban free agents exist in a unique situation, because by the time they succeed in defecting (they must first establish residency in another country due to the U.S.-Cuba relationship) they are almost always eligible for direct free agency. 		MLB's policies won't change overnight, but it's likely that as the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba relaxes over the coming years, one of two things will happen: Either Cuban players will be allowed to sign as 16 year olds through the IFA process, or an agreement similar to the one between MLB and NPB will be put in place to prevent dilution of Cuba's professional leagues by MLB poaching top talent.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fornnwet","name":"t1_cmy43xz","parent_id":"t1_cmy1r4p","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418862973,"created_utc":1418862973}

Either way, absolutely, the Cuban league is not an elite world league. I'd guess somewhere on par with Korea's, but with less money/organization.

{"body":"That's a very good question. Social progress tends to be seen as "things that give citizens more rights," and that's very good but also has well-defined limits in many countries. If social progress is equal to citizens having more and well-defined personal rights and protections, then I believe it can be considered good.		On the other hand some people have considered obviously detrimental things to be social progress, for example the prohibition of alcohol. And in the present a large number of people in Europe are beginning to believe that unfettered immigration without a policy for assimilation or integration is detrimental to society, whereas the prevailing thought had been that cultural diversity was a benefit.		I do wonder what our next social zeitgeist will think. What will our children consider to be progressive? What did we do that they would think was irrational and regressive? My bet for the latter is the state of the prison population and the drug war, but there will likely be more besides that which most people consider normal.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kaghuros","name":"t1_cmy7ev3","parent_id":"t1_cmy4eu1","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418869778,"created_utc":1418869778}

{"body":"On a rather geeky note, there's an explanation for that. The barter system in Civ 5 is kind of wonky. There's no "negative value" placed on items, even when they become obsolete by technology. The CPU will still value open boarders and two horses in the atomic era more so than just open *borders*. Open *borders* is more or less a 0 value trade because it's supposed to be open *borders* for open *borders*. You can sell open *borders* but usually it's at 25 gold. The horses are valued, after the latest expansion, at +5 no matter what era you're in. 		Relations can effect what the CPU is willing to accept. If Pacal isn't friendly with you (his default emotions lean towards isolation and pro-war), he will demand more. There's a buffer of +/- 5 depending on relations. If the leader likes you, you can get away with offering say 20 gold, if it's neutral, 25, and if they're negative towards you, 30. Luxury resources are ranked at +5 per and luxuries at +10. 		Knowing the values can help you game the system, ripping off your allies. Here's one extra banana I don't need for two oil because you're willing to over look that extra +5, thanks friend!

The culture in France is fantastically not focused on economic efficiency (which is more or less the fanatically-supported religion in America)  and instead prioritises living well and promoting the human condition. I am perhaps a little blind to the arrogance of seeing yourselves as a super-power when you aren't really because we are afflicted with the same problem in the UK.		As far as I can tell, American belief that they are some kind of beacon of civilisation is entirely unjustified. The people are richer in money, and poorer in every other way - work much more, eat **much, much** worse, socialise almost exclusively at a very shallow level, and generally seem to live in fear most of the time. This creates a populous that doesn't seem very comfortable with itself. On the plus side, they are much more optimistic and positive about things, though from my perspective this makes them seem naive and credulous. Still, that's how they came second in the space race while France and Britain languished miles behind, so can't really take it against them too much.		>  The french also love talking politics and love to lecture everybody about it so I suppose you must have experienced some tiresome lectures about America while in France.

On the contrary, they were likely some pretty miserable bastards with very high levels of inequality and suffering.  The same goes for the British Empire.  The British Empire wasn't known because its citizens were well adjusted folks.		What makes empires think that they are the beacon of civilization is that when they push the world, the world moves.  By that measure, the US belief that it is the center of the world isn't entirely crazy.  When the US pushes, things move... downhill often times, but they move.  You really can't study any current conflict and not have the US creep into the story.  In the same way, you couldn't understand any region of the world before World War I without asking how the British are involved.		Honestly, if we were going for happy well adjusted citizens as being the beacons for civilization, we would all envy those damned Scandinavians more than we already do; those overly content bastard.		Not coincidentally, the reason why the US has a good rap in Vietnam despite having previously burned the entire nation to the ground is because Vietnam sees the US as not just an ally against China, but an ally able to bringing together all of southeast Asia into something capable of resisting the China... who also consider themselves at least a regional empire worthy of respect, if not a global one.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rindan","name":"t1_cmy5jn8","parent_id":"t1_cmxqnz0","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418865927,"created_utc":1418865927}

However, according to another source, Fidel Castro objected to the missiles deployment that would have made him look like a Soviet puppet, but was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis#Soviet_deployment_of_missiles_in_Cuba_.28Operation_Anadyr.29","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"esquilax","name":"t1_cmxs2ny","parent_id":"t1_cmxpmgp","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418841308,"created_utc":1418841308}

History classes almost never focused on science/tech stuff, and when they discussed periods of time where science/tech related stuff had a tremendous impact on civilization the focus was always on the impact and not the science or tech itself.

{"body":"Perhaps because history is not about "progress." History is not like a game of Civ. In addition, these issues happen to have been really fucking important to the issues you learned, or perhaps didn't learn about, rather. Without the cotton gin, slavery becomes cost ineffective for an industrializing South, and perhaps is phased out naturally. Without machines, you get no industrialization. Your jump from the American revolution to the printing press is not something that is taught, given that the printing press was invented two centuries prior. The Cold War was *all* about the tension created by two ideologically opposed superpowers having access to bombs which could *literally end civilization*. And the Greek states and Roman Empire are important because they are the most influential civilizations to western thought. You seem oddly dismissive of history. Without those people in history, your maths would be unknown to you.

{"body":"I understand all of those things and am pretty well educated about history (at least how it is taught in history departments).  What I don't have is a very good sense of how these things developed in times of peace and calm, the progression of science and technology in between the periods of turmoil that are taught as if they're events.  		Your critique of how I simplified certain topics in my post is the same of my critique of how they were presented during history classes.  It seems like we agree on those parts, you just missed the part where I was mocking how the education system simply mentions them as a footnote to the social issue subject that is being taught without really getting much into how the technology came to be, how it works, and things like that.		The reason I do not want to hear about back story and history in a math book is because it gets in the way of learning the math.  There are lots of young students who later find that they wish they were better at math because they find a use for it in their academic life or in their career.  The focus should be on equipping them with these tools as painlessly as possible.  If that meant stripping away the history and the back story then how many students would later find that it would be valuable to know that?  It's also much easier to "catch-up" on history and back story years later than it is to give up on math earlier in life and then try to catch up later after a few years off.		>And the Greek states and Roman Empire are important because they are the most influential civilizations to western thought.		Funny thing about that though is how little of that is taught in a history class.  People in those empires made important contributions in the fields of science and technology and were responsible for spreading it to distant locations, but we're mostly taught just about the turmoil involved in the rise and the fall of the empires.","depth":11,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hurkadurkh","name":"t1_cmxu4ev","parent_id":"t1_cmxt41w","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418844862,"created_utc":1418844862}

{"body":"Ok. I'm a white woman in my 20s. While I won't say "never vote democrat!" (Lieberman seemed sort of ok), I generally vote republican for several reasons.		Democrats are generally opposed to the ownership of firearms for self-defense. I've used my pistol for self-defense once (almost twice but it stopped just short of "If he takes two more steps closer I'm drawing"), and I hope I never have to again. There's no guarantee of that, however. There's also no way in the world I can come out on top of an altercation with a man who's even just mostly fit - I don't have the size or strength for it. Tasers and pepper spray are far from guaranteed to stop an attacker, and calling the police requires a couple minutes on my phone and then waiting for 5-30 minutes. So a pistol is the best possible defensive tool, and that means voting democrat isn't exactly beneficial to me.		Shooting is also something I do for recreation (sort of dual-purpose recreation/practice), and I shoot pistols rather than rifles, which many democrats generally oppose. To me, any rifle that's chambered for larger than 5.56mm NATO with a less-than-30-round magazine (that is, anything not a home defense rifle, which I don't have and can't afford, but maybe someday) is useless to me. "We won't take your hunting rifle" doesn't mean anything to me, because I don't have one and I don't plan to get one. So here too, voting democrat isn't exactly beneficial to me.		Democrats generally advocate raising taxes to pay for social programs which rarely benefit me. I have enough trouble getting by as is without that. They also like raising taxes on "companies." A company exists to make money, and it faces higher taxes; what will it do? Lower its profits, let go of employees/reduce their hours, or increase prices? Or perhaps the people running the companies will reduce their own salaries to cover it? Yeah, right. Higher taxes, less available work, and higher prices are not exactly beneficial to me.		Obamacare seems to've led to it being common for larger companies to prefer several part-time employees to one full-time employee, in order to dodge the requirements of that law. Once again, less available work is not exactly beneficial to me.		Speaking of, I haven't seen obamacare do me any good in and of itself, either. What idiot decided that perpetuating the health insurance system was a good idea in the first place? Have you seen the actual costs in a hospital? (On that note, I wouldn't automatically be opposed to an NHS-type system run by the states. I would be opposed to one run by an inept and nearly-unaccountable federal government. [How about some term limits for the federal congress? Why do we have people in the senate for 30 or 40 years at a time? I don't hear either side talking about this.])		The democrats have had two years of the executive and legislative branches under their control, followed by four more of controlling the executive and the senate. I haven't seen anything improve in my life due to that. I sure as hell haven't seen any easier time finding jobs. What happened to all that stimulus stuff? Jobs "created or saved," eh?		Democrats are all for making abortions easier to get. I give zero fucks. I'm interested in having employment and physical safety - aborting pregnancies I don't have isn't a primary issue for me. Oh, sure - in the abstract I think abortions should be legal and available. There are definitely valid reasons for having them. I also don't really think abortions should be happening,unless there's a dire outcome for the mother if it doesn't, after a fetus gains sentience, whenever that is - I haven't researched the topic thoroughly due to its low importance, so I don't know exactly when that is. Again, though, the topic is strictly tertiary to my concerns, so I'm not basing my votes on it. Especially since neither major party shares my views on the matter. They're both going for absolute opposites (no limits or fully illegal), and I think they're both wrong.		Anyways. There're some basics on why I don't vote democrat despite not being a rich white man. This isn't the full outline of all my political views, but I've honestly spent too much time on this as is, so I'll leave it at that.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MistShadow","name":"t1_cmybxvd","parent_id":"t1_cmxswr4","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418879361,"created_utc":1418879361}

She has also said that she asks herself three questions whenever she approaches an issue: "Is it affordable? Is it sustainable? Is it my job?"

That is the exact reverse sentiment of Marx. The idea is to remove the bourgeoisie, who are people who gain profit not by working, but by owning the means of production. The proletariat, who work for the bourgeoisie, are being exploited in the sense that they do not receive all the fruits of their labour.

Yes, and never have Marx's ideas been applied in a world where socialism hadn't already been tainted by Bolshevism, Maoism, and any number of real-world vagaries that prevented the development of a humane socialist state -- just as surely as world events have IMHO prevented a humane capitalist one. 		There is absolutely nothing in Marx that is incompatible with a humane and free state, and you have done nothing at all to prove the contrary -- certainly not by, you know, *actually making reference to anything Marx ever said*.

There were several promising starts during the Russian Revolution, if you can be bothered to do the research into something that will contradict a pre-existing belief of yours. (Nestor Makhno comes to mind. More of an anarchist than Marxist, but he was definitely a communalist. He was arguably a terrible person... but if you compare him to other heads of state, including "democratic" ones, he's no worse than the usual, especially for the area, and attending more closely to your point he was EXPLICITLY disinterested in dictatorship...) Of course, they all got crushed by the bigger, meaner full-fledged Leninist bullies. But they still existed, and IMHO failed to thrive in part because Western powers were just as glad to see them go.

{"body":"He also supports voter ID laws, even though the evidence shows that in-person voting fraud is almost non-existent. It does have a severe effect on the ability of poor minorities to vote, though. But they tend to vote Democrat, so he doesn't mind if he disenfranchises thousands/millions of them. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the right to vote is pretty fundamental to a democracy.		There is a semi-famous Republican from the Heritage Foundation (EDIT: John Fund I'm pretty sure) who acknowledges what I just said and that absentee ballots in the mail are much more subject to fraud (I can find the source if anyone wants). Guess what, though? Republicans aren't interested in making it more difficult for people to vote by mail because that's how most of the military votes, and most of the military votes Republican. And no, Democrats aren't disingenuous enough to try and hamper their voters for these flimsy reasons either.		And lest you think these are just lazy minorities who don't care all that much about voting anyway, there are plenty of cases where in Republican-controlled states that have required IDs, they have tried other underhanded tactics like closing DMV offices in poor/Democrat/underserved areas to increase wait times, forcing people to pay a fee to purchase an ID (a poll tax essentially), or else allowing people to get a free ID, but *ONLY* if they request one; in some areas the DMVs have been instructed not to reveal that IDs can be gotten for free if the person does not know about it. And in Texas, concealed carry permits count as IDs, but school IDs don't.		Republicans claim to love democracy but they have trouble accepting the results of any election where they don't win as legitimate. Hence conspiracy theories about Obama's reelection, voter ID laws, and Sharron Angle's famous quote about needing to resort to second-amendment remedies if she couldn't beat Harry Reid at the polls.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"empfindsamkeit","name":"t1_cmy3mmj","parent_id":"t1_cmxtgiq","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418861999,"created_utc":1418861999}

Staying at one of the main resorts is indistinguishable from any other resort in the Caribbean. 		Outside of the resorts, if you stick to the tourist friendly areas in towns and cities, you would be fine.  The police tend to take a pretty aggressive stance against against locals committing crimes against tourists.  Mostly watch out for pickpockets and scammers, as you would pretty much anywhere else in the world.		By that same token, they also take a pretty aggressive stance against tourists committing crimes, so be respectful of the law - should go without saying.		The people are friendly by and large, English is common but they appreciate when you speak Spanish.		Do not, under any circumstances, rent a car.  The roads can be pretty bad, and Cuban drivers can be somewhat insane.  The courts are pretty strict with foreigners who get into traffic accidents, particularly when there is an injury involved.

I suppose silencing the opposition is a valid and important tool for people of certain political persuasions. For example, in Venezuela freedom of speech is not protected. Amnesty International has referred to _"politically motivated attempts to silence dissent in the country."_ I suppose you might prefer we were having this conversation in Venezuela.		> You think Canada is a more developed country than Venezuela purely due to their political leanings?		Canada has a market economy, whereas Venezuela has openly eschewed free markets in favor of a socialist revolution.		Canada has better-secured property rights than Venezuela. Tell me, how much of your own money have you invested in Venezuela? Likely none, since your property rights would not be secure in Venezuela. You'd be more likely to have invested in Canada. Stores are often seized in Venezuela. How many stores have you personally invested to build in Venezuela? Likely none. You would be foolish to do so, since likely your businesses would end up being nationalized. That's what history shows will happen there.		Venezuela has price controls, which interfere with the market's natural price discovery mechanism. There are shortages of basic staples and people fight over chickens in the aisles.		Venezuela has capital controls and foreign exchange controls. Why use such violence to prop up their currency? Likely because the victims of inflation in Venezuela would otherwise flee the bolivar even faster than they already do. As they say, "cash rots faster than bananas."		Venezuela often uses armed troops to ensure "fair distribution" of basic goods such as toilet paper. Do you really believe armed troops are a more effective method of resource distribution, than a free market? (And if so, then why can't people get toilet paper in Venezuela?)		Bow before your false god if you wish. If you believe those in power in Venezuela, the problem is the "parasitic bourgeoisie."

The US and Saudi Arabia get to bring a world of economic hurt on their traditional adversaries (Russia and Iran, respectively) at little risk to themselves - the US because they've got a more diverse economy that actually benefits from a drop in energy costs in many ways, and Saudi Arabia because they've got a [ridiculously huge sovereign wealth fund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_fund#Largest_sovereign_wealth_funds) to tap into.		Since international diplomacy is part of the executive branch's domain, then yes, it's possible that Obama did indeed directly help drop gas prices.

People like to criticize their wealth but what they don't realize is most of that wealth is either historical artifacts or investments to raise money to build more churches, schools, and hospitals. It's not well covered by the media because it's not as intrigue worthy as molestation or embezzlement, but as someone coming back into the fold, who was raised catholic in catholic school, I'd say that a majority of the churches day to day operations (excluding mass and sacraments) is charity. And that doesn't even count individual Catholics who do good. Priests and nuns are expected but not required to donate their salaries, and the parishioners care for the priest. At least that's how my parish worked.  Most churches also will buy you food, a room, toiletries etc. and even a suit and a shave to help you get a job. 			Aside from that the level or spiritual care provide to people is astounding. One doesn't even need to be catholic to stroll in and talk to a priest about anything. They'll help what most consider to be the lowest of the low and the worst of worst.

While I'm sure Cuba is looking to normalize relations with the US so as not to rely on Russia as much, it's been a long time coming- with Fidel's *retirement*, Obama warming up relations over the past few years, and the older, rabidly anti-communist Cuban-American community dying out, it's really no surprise that the US and Cuba have been in talks.

Cuba still produces some of the world's highest rated, most sought after cigars (check out Behike for example). And their quality has actually gone up a bit in the past few years, most likely due to the increased competition they are getting from other producers.		The biggest problem Cuba faces right now is that their flagships brands, such as Cohiba, Montecristo, and Partagas for example, are produced by other companies like General Cigar Co. and Altadis. which were given permission to produce them outside of Cuba after the revolution and the nationalization of the plantations and factories in Cuba. Cuba continues to produce cigars under these labels along side the non-Cuban (and certainly inferior) labels.

{"body":"This is the full text of the speech by Cuban President Raul Castro in which he said, among other things, the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States. Compatriots:			Since my election as President of the Councils of State and Ministers, I have reiterated on many occasions, our willingness to support the government of the United States respectful dialogue, based on sovereign equality, to discuss different topics reciprocally without prejudice to national independence and self-determination of our people.		This is a position that was expressed to the Government of the United States, public and private, by comrade Fidel at different times in our long struggle, with the approach of discussing and resolving differences through negotiations without giving up one of our principles.		 	The heroic Cuban people have demonstrated against great dangers, attacks, hardships and sacrifices, is and will be true to our ideals of independence and social justice. Closely united in these 56 years of Revolution, we have kept deep loyalty to those who fell defending these principles since the beginning of our wars of independence in 1868.		Now we carry, despite the difficulties, updating our economic model to build a prosperous and sustainable socialism.		Result of a dialogue at the highest level, including a telephone conversation I had yesterday with President Barack Obama, has made progress in addressing some issues of interest to both nations.		As Fidel promised, in June 2001, when he said, will return !, arrived in our country today, Gerardo, Ram??n and Antonio.		The sheer joy of their families and all our people, who mobilized tirelessly to that end, extends between the hundreds of committees and groups of solidarity; governments, parliaments, organizations, institutions and personalities that during these 16 years and made strenuous efforts demanded for his release. All of them express our deepest gratitude and commitment.		This decision by President Obama deserves the respect and recognition of our people.		I want to thank and acknowledge the support of the Vatican, and especially, the Pope Francis, the improvement of relations between Cuba and the United States. Similarly, the Government of Canada for the facilities created for the realization of high-level dialogue between the two countries.		In turn, we decided to release and send to the United States to a Cuban spy who served in that nation.		Moreover, based on humanitarian grounds, today was also returned to his country US citizen Alan Gross.		Unilaterally, as is our practice and strict adherence to our legal system, have received benefits corresponding criminal inmates, including the release of persons for whom the Government of the United States had shown interest.		Likewise, we agree to the restoration of diplomatic relations.		This does not mean that the main thing is resolved. The economic, commercial and financial blockade caused enormous human and economic damage to our country must cease.		Although sanctions have been converted into law, the President of the United States can modify your application using its executive powers.		Propose to the Government of the United States take mutual steps to improve bilateral climate and move towards normalization of ties between our countries, based on the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter.		Cuba reiterates its willingness to sustain cooperation in multilateral bodies such as the United Nations.		Recognizing that we have deep differences, mainly on national sovereignty, democracy, human rights and foreign policy, I reaffirm our willingness to discuss all these issues.		I urge the Government of the United States to remove obstacles that prevent or restrict the links between our peoples, families and citizens of both countries, in particular those relating to travel, direct mail and telecommunications.		Progress in sustained exchanges show that it is possible to find solutions to many problems.		As we have said, we must learn the art of living, in a civilized manner, with our differences.		On these important issues we will speak later.		Thank you very much.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cubali","name":"t1_cmxwqu5","parent_id":"t3_2pkw0y","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418849405,"created_utc":1418849405}

{"body":"My father was born in Santiago de Cuba in '53. For the past hour, he's been sharing with me his story of his parents that he never shared before. His father was a successful lawyer and his mother a successful teacher. After trying to flee Cuba from Castro's power, it was too late for them. The government came knocking on their door with two options to choose from: be our slaves doing farm work for the government, or go to prison and be possibly killed. In the best interest of my father and his sister, my grandparents agreed to serve in the farms. They took everything away: their cars, careers, money and property. For two years my grandparents did slave work for the Cuban government in separate farms. Their family was separated and many of my father's cousins were killed.		My father would rather watch the Castro regime suffer than to see his country come back on its feet. The pain his country inflicted on him and many of the older Cuban generation (pain that he's hidden from me for 26 years) is a heavy load to carry filled with anger and resentment. Can you blame them for being so bitter? It's the principle of the matter, or so they believe, to root against ANY success the Castro's (and Cuba) achieves for the harm he and Che did decades ago. To spend his hard earned money in Cuba to support Castro's economy is unthinkable and would be seen as a slap in the face to his own parents for all they sacrificed.		While I understand my dad's point of view and story, I still think the news today is a good start to heal some of the wounds.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cmxwlzn","parent_id":"t3_2pkw0y","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418849177,"created_utc":1418849177}

{"body":"I'll admit that I'm somewhat uninformed on this topic, but even though i'm only a teen, I've had Cuban influence in my all my life given that my grandparents escaped Cuba in the 60s. This is what i've derived from my own personal knowledge and from a convo with my grandfather. He's actually in support of removing the embargo, and I can see where that comes from. The US put the embargo on Cuba in the 60s in the midst of the Cold War and our huge campaign against communism. That was when Cuba had an oppressive government and horrible human rights. 5 decades later, the embargo has done little to improve that. The government is a little less oppressive, but living conditions are still horrible. So to me, it makes sense to remove the embargo. Why not give Cuba American influence and support, and at the very least improve the lives of the Cuban people? This doesn't necessarily mean we're best buddies with the Cuban government, or that we're accepting of it, but we did the same thing with China in the 70s, and now, even though we still have our faults with their dictatorship, the Chinese have a better life than they did before. My grandfather says that eventually, this might lead to a revolution against the government, or some sort of change that brings a better government in, but at the very least, the US influence will improve the lives of the Cuban people. I guess i'm trying to say we don't necessarily have to like their government, because we've moved on from that "we're ignoring you because commies" stance we had in most places except for Cuba. Why not do the same there and give the Cuban people what they along with young and old Cuban-Americans have wanted above all else: a good life for the Cuban people.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"k5berry","name":"t1_cmxrhhl","parent_id":"t3_2pkw0y","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418840280,"created_utc":1418840280}

{"body":"The embargo was put in place also because Castro stole land and property that belonged to US companies and individuals, not just because of political ideologies.  Over time it has become more of a human rights thing, and the media has stopped mentioning, for the most part, the whole theft of property part.		One of my grandfathers was co-owner of a small mattress store.  He had immigrated to Cuba as a teenager after his parents died in Spain.  He worked hard, long nights, until two friends and him were able to buy the mattress store.  It was "taken" by the government years later.  That is called theft.  It was then that he, my grandmother and my dad came to the US.		My other grandfather worked at a sugar mill as a worker.  He left Cuba before my other grandfather after sensing the loss of freedom that was coming.  He came alone to the US, rented an apartment with two friends and worked at factory until he was able to save money to bring my mom and grandmother and rent their own apartment.		I can understand how people who weren't directly, or even indirectly, affected believe that this news is good news.  I can understand people wishing to travel there (I would love to).  But until those who caused pain, and the murder of thousands of innocent people, die or are arrested, and the government changes completely and stops violating human rights, I will not buy products from that country.  The money spent will not go to "the people", it will go to the Castros and the elite in the government and the party.		Castro currently is worth around $500 million dollars, that we know of, last I checked.  The US is currently, even with the "embargo" the 5th largest exporter to Cuba.  Every other country in the world can do business with Cuba (except Israel who also backs the embargo), and no significant changes have happened in Cuba in the government or in regards to basic human rights.  In fact, there have been more arrests of peaceful political dissidents in the past year that in the past few years.		So I understand people having different opinions, I understand tourists of other countries visiting Cuba, and I understand people, many of whom are either misinformed or deceived, who believe this will change things.  I do not, and wanted to express a counter-opinion to the general idea held throughout and expressed here.		I saw the pain some of my family members felt when they talked about family members lost, killed, or whose lives were destroyed.  No one in my family was rich, not one.  They were all middle class, if that, in some cases.  They are/were some of the nicest people I have met, extremely hard working, and very generous even in their situation.

{"body":"Actually...		The Cuban embargo was codified in law (through the Helms-Burton act) largely because Cuba shot down two US aircraft.		Clinton had been working to normalize relations with Cuba and was making progress on that front, but...		One man is responsible for sidetracking all of that.		Jos?? Basulto and his "Hermanos al Rescate" (Brothers to the Rescue) group in Miami.		Basulto had (until the FAA took away his license in the fallout) a penchant for illegal overflights of Cuba, dropping bumper stickers and literature denouncing Castro.		The Cubans had enough of it, the FAA's enforcement division wasn't moving fast enough to handle the issue, so they warned the US for the last time that the next time a plane unlawfully entered Cuban airspace, they'd shoot it down.		Basulto refused State Department requests that he not any more overflights of Cuba, and the next time he went, Cuba shot down two of the three Cessnas the group was using.

{"body":"That's really nice to hear. I actually have a lot of Canadian snowbird friends who've been staying for months on end at my family's hotel in Huatulco for the past two decades. Safe to say we're almost family at this point. 		I love Mexico too, but the situation is so scary for local business it's depressing. I live in the States now but my entire family is still in Cancun. If you do end up buying in Cancun - I could recommend using my Mom as your local Attorney. She's American/Mexican and represents foreigners doing business and/or retiring in Mexico and has been doing so since the late 70s.		I couldn't agree more as to the Cuba's state of disrepair. Last I was there, the government was relocating entire apartment buildings while they were repaired. I haven't been back in years but from family, I've heard they've made a lot of progress. One thing I'd have to disagree with is the friendliness. Personally, I felt they're levels more friendly than my fellow Mexicans, which says a lot since my paisanos are known for their good nature. Resources aside (tp) another noticeable difference is education. Virtually everyone I conversed with in Cuba was very well informed of local, National and International news, were skilled and/or educated. The majority I spoke to had some reservations to the Government but were mostly satisfied. They didn't have to worry about feeding themselves or their children. Nor what they were going to wear. And work was done happily. Some, the younger ones, did want better technology (iphones, ipads, cars, MTV - little do they know, it sucks) but did agree that life was easy and they didn't lack comfort and were happy. One more thing I'd like to add is safety. I never felt unsafe ANYWHERE and the local Police never harassed me for a bribe. In fact, I got pulled over once and after explaining where I was trying to get to, had them escort me there and wished me well during my stay. I'd like to think that that is because they don't need to but probably has some to do with very strict punishments for breaking laws. 		For everyone else reading. I'm not condoning, not anti not anything specific as towards systems of government. I simply wanted to verbalize my direct experience as a tourist in the country. I'd imagine most of the American redditors don't travel their and get their information only through US media.		On a parting note - and I can empathize - those Cubans that I've met who have been VERY anti-Cuba/Castros, tend to be those who had their family wealth stripped from them and distributed to the masses. Again, I'm not saying that they should or shouldn't be pissed, just expressing who are the discontent amongst the Cubans that I've met personally.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"phaedrusTHEghost","name":"t1_cmxqzzb","parent_id":"t1_cmxpdle","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418839414,"created_utc":1418839414}

{"body":"Not so much that Mexicans are LESS, more that Cubans are MORE. For instance, I was looking for an address in Havana with my Dad. We walked down a street, didn't see it, and were walking back. An older gentleman sitting on his porch, called for us and after explaining we were looking for an address he asked us if we had a phone number. He offered his phone which we politely declined saying that pointing us in the right direction would suffice. He insisted to which we obliged. He guided us to a rotary phone station on a small table in the hall of his home, and before we could say thank you, had disappeared and reappeared with coffee on a platter. My Dad got a hold of the person we were staying with, but the man offering his phone already knew who we were looking for and just wanted to make sure he was home. Once that was cleared up he called for some boys playing soccer in the street. They came up and addressed the man by "Sr. [lastname], what can we do for you?" He instructed them to take our luggage home street down to "Sr. [lastname]'s home". And off they went. We later found out none of the kids are even related to him, just neighborhood kids. After coffee and conversation, novels, medicine, music. We were escorted by the kids to where our luggage was waiting. We met our host and have been friends ever since. This was in 2001.		I know it's just a story, but that's what our sentiment was of everyone we met. Once we had a flat on our rental and couldn't figure out how to remove the lugs. A stranger stopped, explained that rentals have lug keys, which he found in the glove box, and changed our tire. We offered him compensation for helping but wouldn't take it. 		I have plenty more stories actually. 		As to your experience with the cartel. That's my point. When you have local law enforcement side by side with the cartels, it's bad. As a tourist, you have a sort of immunity to the violence - you're their consumer and it's probably some sort of arrangement "don't mess with the Tourists". The locals unfortunately get the other side. Family friends being visited by those same men in suits, requiring "protection money".

That is a huge change in and of itself but I believe it reflects the views of many of my Cuban brethren. I don't see this as changing America in the way your friend is probably suggesting. It sounds more like your friend has been brainwashed a bit into believing the idea that the embargo will work and has done tremendous harm and worked wonders over Cuba when that is really not the case. This will drastically change the lives of the Cuban peoples both here and in Cuba.  Just the lifting of support that we Cuban Americans can send to our own families will help. Throw in the ability of banks from the US able to open accounts with Cuban banks and companies to do business and sell goods and buy goods from Cuba and this is a real game changer in my honest opinion.

{"body":"The US already has an embassy in Havana, I personally visited it when my dad won the international visa lottery back in 1998. 		I really hope things do change in Cuba, many of the country's natural riches have been in grave, deplorative state for decades; as a result most of the people have lived in near absolute poverty. But they have become so resilient and resourceful that by now nothing can knock them down. They survive just about anyhing.		If this really improves the lives of the people, then all shall welcome it. However, do try to understand the old Cuban-American's concerns, they lived through Castro's bloody revolutionary agenda and many lost everything, including family. It is only natural for them to remind us of that old evil. (Which isn't that old, recently some cuban dissidents may have been murdered by Castro's lackeys, Oswaldo Paya and Laura Pollan were two of the possible victims of political assasinations)		Also a quick side note: I kinda believed that calling the cuban regime a communist system was not the correct denomination. To me it seems more akin to a feudal hierarchy than anything, where Castro and his revolutionary commanders are high royalty and the people are just dirty peasants. With plenty of propaganda (copy and paste from the soviet era) claiming the people are first; but all they get is food and energy shortages, while the top government guys enjoy luxurious living. The "communist card" is one Fidel Castro loved to play to the world, a sickening facade for poverty and oppression.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Aaroncls","name":"t1_cmxpxy6","parent_id":"t3_2pkw0y","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1418837514,"created_utc":1418837514}

{"body":"Your amusing-yet-irrelevant ad hominem aside...		... It can be argued that Clinton repealing Glass-Steagall at the end of his term stood out more as a legacy than pretty much anything else he did in office.  That lead directly to the economic debacle of the late 00s.  And that was entirely based off capitulation to his ideological opponents... buying into their hubristic take on economics and presuming that since everything is going well, of course we should then deregulate the finance sector further, and do away with depression era legislation specifically aimed at preventing economic disasters.		So yeah, you do have a point that Obama was not perhaps as bold as he should have been throughout his term... but he certainly did his best with the clusterfuck he was handed when he entered office.		He passed legislation supporting gender/sexual minority equality (one of those laws btw another repeal dating back to the Clinton Era)... passed financial regulation.  The stimulus, although not robust as it could have been did a lot to abruptly end the recession in 2009.		You can go on to foreign policy... Avoiding the trap of getting into nation-building with regards to Libya.  In fact the republicans attack him for the Benghazi controversy... reality is Obama's actions helped prevent the complete annihilation of that city under Gaddafi.  Then you go to the fact that he took out Bin Laden, not in a drone strike but a daring raid that he specifically ordered.		See both on the domestic and foreign front there are positives and negatives to take into account.  Even in spite of facing unprecedented obstruction throughout his entire presidency, he'll be leaving behind a pretty substantial legacy as a president... especially compared to the one that came before that essentially left nothing to speak of but a disaster.		I think it's also fair to compare Obama and Clinton and to say Obama had much more on his plate.  Much, much more.  Clinton's presidency was relatively peaceful with a good economy.  Obama basically jumped into a turbulent chaos.

{"body":"Iraq #2 was deeply flawed in so many ways from an operational aspect.  The Marines and Soldiers were sent in with insufficient armor, no real plan when they got there, sometimes contradictory ROE, almost no experience making relationships with local nationals and a douchebag  "War president" who ignored US military doctrine that the DoD was only setup to fight 2.5 wars at one time.  The same was true of Afghanistan which had no real goal besides going in and killing the "bad guys" ( who were trained by the CIA in advanced guerilla war tactics ).		Iraq #3 ( if it happens ) is going to be a similar trainwreck because the only people who have their shit together AND would willingly work with US forces are the Kurds.... which is problematic because the Kurds want to reclaim large swathes of land currently within parts of Iraq, Iran, and Turkey's borders.  They're great people ( Kurds ) and I wish them well but giving them enough arms to murder ISIS might create more problems than it fixes.		ALSO, almost forgot.  America's favorite military tactic right now is bombing the shit out of things.  While bombing seems amazing, it kills a lot of innocent people.  The survivors are motivated then to join insurgency/radical forces because what other option is there besides being bombed?

There are also many from the previous generations that support it. 		Really what it comes down to is some of us think that this move does nothing for the people over there. Don't get me wrong, it hurts to see the divide between those of us born here and those who were born over there, but realistically the Castro regime has no reason to make anything better for the Cuban people. The United States is the only country with an embargo on Cuba. What stopped Fidel from going to other countries for trade and support?

{"body":"One of the reasons I prefer to travel to Cuba over the Dominican Republic and Mexico , and have done so frequently over the last ten years, is the absence of the American populace. Now, before I get reamed for anti-American sentiment, bare with me. Part of the allure of Cuba is the more laid back tourist base and the resulting environment, and this in part comes from the minimal volume due to the restrictions on Americans traveling there. Not to say that Canadians can't be wild, uncontrollable and disgustingly confrontational; they can be. But because of the minimal tourist base, it doesn't hold the same reputation as "Party Central", and henceforth, all the "just turned 18 so let's get stewed and fuck shit up without fear of consequence because I'm outside my local jurisdiction" crowd tend to travel to other areas. Which makes traveling to Cuba more enjoyable. 		Also, the country is among the safest, if not the safest, for tourists. Every citizen in that country understands the importance of the tourist industry, and go out of their way to ensure your safety. I feel safer in the slums of Havana or Holguin, than I do in parts of Ottawa. 		The food, however, is sub-par. And this, of course, is a result of the embargo and the inability to get quality food from a neighbour that rests 80 KM to the north. 		TL;DR: Cuba has a certain culture and environment about it due to American travel restrictions.
