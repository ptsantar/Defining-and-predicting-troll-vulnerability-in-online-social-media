When you're a child, I'm talking say 8,9 etc , anybody 20+ is automatically formal. Why? Because they're so older than you and on a completely differerent leve tha tyou just auto formalize it. The REAL auto formalize though is like older established adults 		It starts off with like , with your parents you don't use, or atleast I didn't, any of the informal ways of the verbs. 		For example	"Bia eenja" means come here in farsi (unformal)	"Bia'y'd eenja" is the formal way of saying it. 		When you're a kid, if you , or atleast me, ever told my mom BIA EENJA, she'll be like beeya? 		Or the word		"Bokhor" -- means > eat (or telling someone to eat) (unformal)	vs	"Bokhoreed" -- formal eat		If I told my mom bokhor , that be rude. This also applies to grandparents, strangers, other adults, etc		It's not one of those things where they say "drop the formality" -- it's not a formality really , you just kind of do it. In America, the sir/mam is a formality. I get called sir at my job by people twice my age		it's just a way of doing things I guess, not really a "do it to this age group, and this not age group"		If I were to give you a tip, if you ever wanted to go to these countries, I'd just learn the formal way of saying things and skip the informal.		In English if you talk with formality, it's very obvious and in the receiver's mind, they're know you're talking in formality on purpose, because basic normal english it's non formal		But if you go to these countries, like mine, it's more like "he's respectful" vs "he's trying to be formal" 		I hope it helps a little xD	(thanks god fo rreddit, I hit cancel instead of save, but it saved my reply.

There can be a sincere "thank you" while looking at the person. "Thank you so much." for greater gratitude, or grabbing someone's hand, looking into their eyes and stating in a serious manner "Really, thank you so much, I really appreciate it (which would be quite inappropriate for when your waiter brings you your entree).

They use the special words for "older brother" (??? / ??????) and "older sister" (?????? / ??????) when talking to or about them. 		Most of my Korean friends like hanging out with foreigners because we don't care about their age. Years ago, I went to a festival with my best friend and her former co-workers and saw for the first time how she was treated for being younger. During our meal, she had to go fetch whatever we wanted (drinks, silverware, etc.). I was in awe!		Another friend of mine invited me to his grandmother's house for a very important holiday. His grandmother hit him and scolded him for calling me by my first name instead of saying ?????? ("noona"), the way boys say "older sister."

{"body":"Major loss of faith in the government. Previous issues had been sorted by Russia, which was spun internally as communist brothers working together etc etc. Early 90's Russia couldn't do this and a load of western NGO's and UN flooded the country. 		This was passed off in Pyongyang as reparations for the war mainly but the NGO's were largely denied access to the starving farming regions. Who obviously questioned the greatness and kindness of the government when everyone was dying. This bad news filtered back into the city and coupled with the increased flow of information from outside, SK really juggernauting away since the 70's and Kim jong il only just taking over the throne lead to a huge drop in "believers" of the propaganda that had until then kept a decent hold of the minds of the population. It's one of the reasons the NGO's got expelled again shortly after.			Tdlr of a few chapters of the book I mentioned and lacking a bit of context but hopefully makes sense. He attributes this famine as the main point of unravelling of the grip the government has had on the population. He doesn't argue it's going to fall anytime soon (and a third of the book is possible outcomes for NK) but definitely a shift that rather unsettled the country.		Apologises for formatting.

It included some interesting bits from old soviet notes about how NK treated russia exactly the same during the cold war. ridiculous one sided demands that were expected, instead of aid or even two way trade between equals. He makes some interesting points on how this is reflected in korean culture as a whole "little brother, big brother" dynamics which when mixed up with some good old soviet nationalism and then a personality cult creates this unique blend of arrogance. Which is probably why SK wants to make them admit to a "little brother" role before helping them.

{"body":"Back in the early nineties, the Korean peninsula was experiencing a severe drought. Both North and South Korea had been suffering. North Korea, in a stunt dreamt up by the propagandists, offered substantial food aid to South Korea, assuming that the government of South Korea would be far too proud to accept. The government of South Korea, however, unlike the government of North Korea, was actually more concerned about the lives and well-being of its citizens than about the potentially damaging effects to its international reputation of accepting food aid from its greatest enemy. They accepted. 		North Korea, true to form, did indeed send the food aid, because not to have done so would have been a far more damaging blow to their public image than it was to South Korea to accept in the first place. However, of course, North Korea, with even less viable farmland then the South, was already actually in a worse position with regard to agricultural output. 		The result of sending much needed rice to South Korea was an acute exacerbation of an already severe problem, and a significant factor contributing not only to the famine that killed around 10 percent of the population during those years, but also to the near-complete collapse of the economy.		**CORRECTIONS: It was flooding in 1995 that caused the food crisis (well, precipitated it, anyway. The loss of food aid from Russia, then China, as well as a number of other factors should also be considered important causes.)**		**I can't find any sources online. Googling 'Korea' and 'food aid' only brings up predictable results.

The plan backfired disastrously when the RoK accepted their offer, and they had to follow through to avoid the damage that a sudden refusal would have done to their reputation, the end result being a serious escalation of the already dire situation in the DPRK.

{"body":"No. Food and water aid isn't what sustains North Korea's government.		The bulk of the income that sustains North Korea comes from weapons contracts; in the present, China is their number one customer. In turn, North Korea is one of China's number one customers for things like oil, food, etc.. Another source of income for North Korean's government is foreign investment (ie, currency trading, etc..).		The rest of the economy is powered by smuggling, drug trafficking (crystal meth, opium), and supernotes. Supernotes are counterfeit US $100 bills. 		It's not clear to me if supernotes are from the North Korean government or the various black market systems in North Korea. It's also not clear to me if the North Korean government is participating in those black market systems directly. They probably are.		Whether food aid makes it to the poor people or not, those industries continue. Those systems are independent of the aid. The only possible moral justification for the supsension of aid is the idea that if people starve enough, eventually they'll fight back. This didn't work in Iraq. It never works.		If you want to end the North Korean regime, you either have to plan for a long war and occupation, or convince China to stop buying weapons and selling them things. You would also need an international effort focused on ending the black market activities noted above, specifically going after the customers of those products. This would remove all the power of the ruling elite in North Korea.
