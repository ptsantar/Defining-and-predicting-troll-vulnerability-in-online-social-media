I have shortcuts for the URL bar so when I type "en" and hit the space bar, anything I type after it will be searched on Wikipedia.

Did the same process but with "Marry Poppins" instead, had to click on the film entry in the disambiguation section to get the film version, which then cearly shows in the quick info box that it was released on August 27, 1964.		Hell, I could have just typed "Nutella" in the URL bar and clicked the Wikipedia entry link, which is second on the page for me (third if you count the ad link in the results), and then opening another tab and searching for "Marry Poppins" sees the first result as the IMDB entry, which has the release year next to it.		I spent more time typing up this explanation than it took to find that data, so I doubt /u/darkest_wraith took more time than I did finding the same data.

{"body":"Hmm, It does seem that farmers use the majority of the water in California because we have so many and farms require a massive amount of almost constant water. However, Many farmers grow multiple crops together, They would need to really segregate them from the salt water ones in order to keep them from dying, As well as the fact most crops cannot handle salt water most likely and we won't just stop eating those entirely.		Also, We would presumably need a separate system of pipes so we don't contaminate our fresh water, Which would most likely be really really expensive and difficult and take forever, Where as there is a desalination plant being constructed in San Diego which will be done in fall. So it seems desalination plants could be built much faster and use our existing water system, Also, The drought is no doubt bad for business and California has one of the largest and strongest economies in the world, It would be the eighth if it was it's own country. I'm sure we could afford a couple to reduce our reliance on rain.		However, Your plan could be more efficient if people didn't shit their pants every time someone mentions genetic engineering. We could potentially genetically engineer all plants that we farm to be able to handle salt water, And potentially even expel the salt so they aren't salty. I wonder if that could start a new business of collecting the salt they expel. Or if some kind of plant could be used in desalination plants to absorb only the salt from water, That could make desalination plants cheaper potentially, And possibly create a new food source.		Another option would be to make our system contained, Have all drains link back up to water treatment plants and be re-introduced into the tap water system and shower and toilet systems again. Then it wouldn't matter how much water we use, Unless of course we are farmers or we have a garden because that water wouldn't go back into the system. Although it would save a massive amount of water and make things way better, I have no idea how expensive this would be, But I expect very.		Also, We could try to improve our water capturing methods, I'm probably wrong, But it appears to me that all rain that doesn't happen to fall over a reservoir is just wasted. Just out house gutters into dirt, Down the street gutters and into the ocean to be contaminated. Another potentially expensive thing would be to connect all of the rain water street gutters and connect them to water treatment plants instead of just out into the ocean, Which would protect the ocean because no one listens to the little sign saying not to throw trash down there, And give us way more water per rain storm.		Another possible way would be to decentralise water capturing and purification a little bit, In the same way house hold solar panels decentralise energy production.		i.e all of the rain on a roof would go down into pipes on the sides of the houses, As they already do, But instead of just being dumped into the dirt, They would go into some kind of house water treatment system. This would probably be really expensive and might not really be worth it and most people probably wouldn't go for it anyway and health concerns are probably justified, But it could potentially help things.		Though all of those controversies and possible difficulties could be avoided if the gutters drained into the same street gutter system which goes into water treatment facilities, Or if it just went down the drain and our water was a closed, recycled system.		Dunno, There are a lot of possible solutions and I've never heard of what ever  evaporation thing you were talking about, Could you explain? But yeah, Hopefully some solution will be implemented, Because sitting around complaining and hoping for more rain, Which the entire state seems to be doing right now isn't going to work.		Also, If the NASA estimate that we only have a year's worth of water in storage is correct, Their suggestion for water rationing most likely would just put off the inevitable instead of actually resolving the issue. Though the storage doesn't take into account the rain and snow that will still come into our system, We may be in such a bad way that it won't fix itself on it's own or with water rationing, Which is why solutions such as desalination plants, Despite their cost, Are going to be really important.		I'm sure the federal government could help us out with some funding if it is really necessary, However, I don't think many people would be too upset about a relatively small, Temporary tax or tax increase in order to fund this, As long as temporary really means temporary.		It would be interesting if the State of California entered a legal contract to be certain that the tax would be removed when it was no longer necessary. Though necessary could be reinterpreted by assholes so that the tax never goes away, Dunno.

{"body":"The case imabouttoblowup mentioned falls into exactly the category that is carbon negative, though.		Let's say you have a lawn. The grass grows by combining water with CO2 in the atmosphere. It doesn't (mainly) build itself from carbon in the ground. That's why a big tree doesn't end up standing in a huge hole. If nobody mows the lawn then dead grass will end up rotting, but rotting it doesn't free up all its carbon. The result is humus which accumulates with each generation of grass. So over time, the lawn moves upwards, rising on a thicker and thicker layer of humus. A lot of that extra mass is carbon captured from the air.		If somebody starts a garden on their roof and leaves it to itself (and it doesn't die), then I would expect the same thing to happen there - a build-up of more and more organic material there.

Therefore you need to apply less heating. Hence it helps you keep the house warm. It's just as how wearing clothes helps keep your body warm in cold weather.		When the surroundings are hotter than the indoor temperature, the flow of heat would be the other way, from outdoors to indoors, raising the indoors temperature. Just as in the cold weather case, insulation slows the flow of heat between the inside and outside. In this case, it meas heat leaks more slowly into the house. Hence less work is needed to keep the house cool.		Insulation plays exactly the same role in both cases.

It is also a scientific fact that plant decay releases methane.		As Feyman reminds us plants get their carbon to grow from the air, not the ground.  In other words, CO2 is converted into Oxygen, plant matter and sugars.  Follow so far?  		Now your plant dies and begins to decay.  		If you're talking about a tree that's fine because trees rot slowly over the course of decades and the carbon is sequestered.  However, soft bodied plants decay quickly and the primary decay mechanism releases methane.

{"body":"> here is everything:		Thanks for that. 		> I think incentives like that to steer people into 'good' directions by a government are usually fine.		Well although I understand the sentiment, I think the problem here is who is to decide what "good" is. Clearly we have to have some regulations and we elect governments to decide. But generally, I believe in the old maxim of governing least is governing best. I also believe that large bureaucracies end up legislating nonsense that everyone has to follow but it often makes for absurd results with little or no flexibility.		So lets assume that we agree that government has some role. Then I believe that it is best for government to coerce the outcome without coercing the method. For instance, lets say that we both agree that it is important for government to encourage alternative fuel (I will agree with you on this only for the sake of argument). In this case then, I think it is best for government to make fossil fuels expensive and let the market determine the best alternative as opposed to the government deciding that solar panels are good and subsidizing rich people putting them on. Government subsidies are often stupid (see ethanol) and discourage innovation because people chase the safe easy money (subsidies) and ignore the risky path which may prove to be better in the long run.

Well, not quite, the real problem is that you're forcing energy retailers to buy electricity at a price much higher than marginal cost.		The retail rate you pay for electricity is higher than the cost to produce that electricity, because the price you pay also factors in the costs of transmission, as well as the fixed cost of the grid (all the power lines).

So let's say the market wholesale price for electricity generation is 6 cents kw/h at a given time, and retail price is 15 cents kw/h. Retailers are now required to pay customers 15 cents kw/h for a product that they should be paying 6 cents a kw/h for. At large scales, this doesn't work, because retailers need that extra profit margin to cover their fixed costs.		The way to solve this would be to allow electricity generators to buy electricity from rooftop panels at the market wholesale price, rather than the retail price, but that's not particularly politically feasible.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lamp37","name":"t1_cpl9afn","parent_id":"t1_cpkzg33","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426879985,"created_utc":1426876385}

{"body":"> Lets be honest, there are better ways to get a return on investment than installing solar panels		[Not many.](http://theenergycollective.com/nrdcswitchboard/2183031/single-family-solar-power-beats-sp-500-46-out-50-american-cities)  As of this year, consumer solar in the US is a better return on your money than the S&P 500 in all but four states-- *even if you finance the system with a 25-year loan*.		> buying Chinese solar plants that were made in factories powered by the dirtiest coal fired power plants in the world, not exactly eco friendly		Depending on panel type and installation location, manufacturing-energy payback takes between six months and two years.  Warranted life is typically 25 years.  Expected lifespan is well into multiple decades.  In a nutshell, even panels made with the dirtiest power on earth will offset that with savings twenty or thirty times over.		> This is why solar leasing is a good option, you can lease solar panels rather than buying them and incurring a heafty initial investment		Leasing is a good option if you can't get the capital up-front-- but if you can, buying them yourself will result in a better return on your investment.  		> you are leasing solar panels that are maintained and replaced when needed by the power company.		There isn't much in the way of maintenance.  About once every fifteen years, you'll need to replace the inverter.  The panels, on the other hand, are so maintenance-free that you will likely have to remove them from your roof to replace the roofing when it wears out after a few decades, and then put them all back again.  They will literally outlast your roof.		> until you get an unsustainable amount of people doing it, and then the power companies can't afford to maintain their grid.		This is exclusively the fault of the power companies.  They've been rolling grid-maintenance fees into their per-kWh power charges, which makes very little sense today.  There's no such thing as a grid-tied PV system that increases grid load-- the very worst they can be is "the same load as before the PV system," and in nearly all cases they will reduce both peak and average grid usage.  The one kernel of truth in your statement here, though, is that because the power companies have been dumb about their pricing model, users who consume almost no power may be paying almost nothing for grid maintenance.  Put in made-up terms, it's like they're responsible for 30% less grid load, but paying 80% less for grid maintenance.  This could be solved trivially with a modernized pricing model that separates the grid use charges from the power use charges.  In fact, my bill actually has a separate grid use fee-- the power company just decided at some point that instead of increasing that fee appropriately over the years, they would just roll those costs into their per-kWh power charges.  In any event, it's a simple problem that isn't a downside to solar-- it's a downside to having a billing system that doesn't actually charge for what it purports to.		> The problem is really you are selling power back into the grid when the grid doesn't need it that much, at non-peak hours.		And finally, this is only a problem with a poorly-optimized system.  Under most net-metering arrangments, your best financial return is obtained by *never* making excess power-- power up to your usage is exchanged watt-for-watt, making it effectively "selling for the retail price of power."  If you make extra, on the other hand, you are typically reimbursed at the wholesale rate, which is generally something like 1/4 or less of the retail price.  You don't want that, and a properly-designed system will avoid it.  In short, you shouldn't be selling lots of extra power because you shouldn't be making lots of extra power because it isn't nearly as good of an investment as making just what you use.

{"body":"Actually I think you are missing quite a few points here. I don't want to get into the exact nature of the climate change debate. It IS happening, but that is the kind if natural disaster that has a much better chance of survivability through societal changes than personal preparedness. You are buying into a media hype like most preppers. There will be extreme weather, and where it will hit us most is in food shortages, especially since the baby boomers are retiring etc, and we are turning our backs on growing methods with better yields out of a blind mistrust of chemistry. The biggest issue will be desperate people trying to attack you. Being known as someone who prepared will paint a target on your back, you will probably go before most of these kinds of people without a coalition who defend their stores together. But still you cannot survive other things like frequent hurricanes and ultimately gama radiation from lightening balls etc.		It's something that will keep getting worse. No amount of prepping short of compound with a bunker you are going to live out the rest of your extremely depressing life in is going to make that much of a difference. 		Hence the shot gun and cyanide capsules. I was referring to ending your life. Although the shotgun does serve a dual purpose. Honestly despite the bad rap, a .22 is almost better for stealing. The light weight of the ammo means you can carry more and it still gets the job done.		I actually have access to most of the things that would be seen as sustainable. I have a small orchard and vegetable garden capable of sustaining about 4 people if you are really careful. I have an Olympic sized pool filled with non-chlorinated water and a water filter to keep this running. That could last for a while. But honestly not a full year, I know without running water my garden even with help from the pool, will last me 2 months tops and that's only assuming stuff continues to grow here after the climate change.		I have 3 backpacks with 4 days food and water each, first aid kits, rope, lifestraws, and waterproof windup radio flashlights. I have hatchets, can be extended into axes, I have a compact shovel, I have utility knives and I have a machette. I have lightweight portable solar panels that can charge small devices. I have a waterproof phone with a massive battery pack on it allowing it to stay in "ultra power saving mode" allowing only a few features like calling and internet for up to 2 months. I have thermal tents and sleeping bags that allow for existence in rather extreme temperatures. I have mountain bikes I can put this stuff on.		I go camping regularly and have fairly extensive survival training. I was a boyscout I go camping in extreme weather frequently and can actually live off the land for quite some time. But as other wildlife will die as well most of my training will be rendered useless.		Short of Bear Grylls I am about as close to ready for these kinds of events as you can be.		All I am saying is most of that stuff gives you a false sense of preparedness while making you a bigger target. You simply cannot prepare for all this stuff. Especially if you try to pick one issue like climate change. The level of preparedness needed will drastically impact your current life and it's frankly kind of silly to treat it as anything but a hobby.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"makesyoudownvote","name":"t1_cpl9715","parent_id":"t1_cpl4g50","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426879841,"created_utc":1426876241}

The people on the show also build their preps around a very specific situation (dirty bomb attacks, zombie apocalypse, North Korean Invasion, etc), which makes their efforts just seem like the works of people with way too much money and time on their hands and little mental health support.		That said, its still a good idea to prepare for an emergency, and just having enough food stocked for an extended amount of time will go a long way.

My personal favorite episode is one where the leader of a Prepper group was testing out his homemade body armor and what not. More importantly, he was barred from owning guns due to being a felon (for communicating with a minor for immoral purposes and theft) before the show, and WENT ON TELEVISION SHOWING OFF ALL HIS GUNS.

They will/have only picked 10 establishments in the whole state that will be permitted to do it, though. 		crazy.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sanimalp","name":"t1_cpl5mwm","parent_id":"t1_cpl0e3m","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426874168,"created_utc":1426870568}

{"body":"wow i have to link the article from Wikipedia:	Water fluoridation has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories. During the "Red Scare" in the United States during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, activists on the far right of American politics routinely asserted that fluoridation was part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. These opponents believed it was "another aspect of President Truman's drive to socialize medicine."[43] They also opposed other public health programs, notably mass vaccination and mental health services.[44] Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the UN and its programs; the introduction of social welfare provisions, particularly the various programs established by the New Deal; and government efforts to reduce perceived inequalities in the social structure of the United States.[45]	Others asserted the existence of "a Communist plot to deplete the brainpower and sap the strength of a generation of American children".[43] Dr. Charles Bett, a prominent anti-fluoridationist, charged that fluoridation was "better than using the atom bomb because the atom bomb has to be made, has to be transported to the place it is to be set off while poisonous fluorine has been placed right beside the water supplies by the Americans themselves ready to be dumped into the water mains whenever a Communist desires!" Similarly, a right-wing newsletter, the American Capsule News, claimed that "the Soviet General Staff is very happy about it. Anytime they get ready to strike, and their 5th column takes over, there are tons and tons of this poison "standing by" municipal and military water systems ready to be poured in within 15 minutes."[9]","depth":5,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FuuuuuManChu","name":"t1_cpl0n4n","parent_id":"t1_cpl0fnz","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426865900,"created_utc":1426862300}

You don't feel the effects, but that environment and the people living around power plants that don't burn cleanly, is clearly being harmed. I'm Asian. I can see the tangible effects of this first hand. 		Poor regulatory standards, over reliance on coal, the dirtest fossil fuel, and other sources like oil, mining tearing up the landscape ....  The laundry list of negative environmental effects go on and on. 		If we continue to use fossil fuels to supply the demands of  a rapidly growing world population,the effect of each new power plant and each source of fuel being exploited will compouns more and more. 		On a local scale, the people living in a city powered by, say, coal, will be harmed by over-reliance on it. (I've observed the effect of over-reliance on coal in Andhra Pradesh as part of my job. The smog from the factories and coal plants, compounded by the overuse of low quality motor vehicles, cause a thick blanket of smoke that choke the region's inhabitants).		Also, mining for coal not only messes up the eco system of the source areas, its a very dangerous high risk industry in terms of safety. Many miners die from accidents or health problems each year, and many of these victims may be sole breadwinners of their families. Clean energy doesn't have as high of a safety risk as coal.		And that's just coal. Don't get me started on oil. 		Now, on a global scale, greenhouses gasses build up, warming the planet. So maybe on paper the ppm shows that it isn't much to worry about. Ok i get your point. What about the future? 		(and your point about the ppm of the "time period when life thrived" is even worse than now can be countered by the fact that whatever that time frame you picked, right now we have billions of humans living in Earth more than that time frame. I don't know how to explain my point clearly... Is just that now we have to factor in rapid population growth when talking about greenhouse gases impact on the atmosphere and earth) 		So let's say you're right, hypothetically, atmospheric impact from non renewable sources is nothing to worry about in our lifetime or even the next century. 		We have another thing to factor in: the non renewable sources are going to run out. We'll mine every source, squeeze out every drop of oil... When we finally run out, humanity will regret that they didn't invest enough time, money amd research into renewable energy. 		I'm only addressing the impact on non renewable sources on how they harm the planet Earth. There's so much more topics to cover, like the human impact. Ethical standards are low among non renewable energy industries. Armed conflict have arised from ownership over energy sources, especially oil. More and more ppl are dying due to either low safety standards, or health issues, or fighting...		This happens when the energy industry does not do enough regarding sustainability, protection of the environment, or ethics. When such industries only care about their bottom lines, the environment, as well as people, suffer. 		Simply, if we reduce our reliance on non renewable energy, and develop clean energy, we reduce short term and long term environmental impact. It just is clearly better for the environment, as well as people. 		I'm not even saying stop using fossil fuels altogether. I'm just saying, reduce our reliance on them, and develop green energy. The planet will thank us for it. 		Since you shared your profession, I'll share mine. I work in a non-renewable energy company. By promoting green energy, I'm putting my own livelihood on the line.

{"body":"Well, oddly enough to understand my stance you have to start on a foundation of nihilism. The idea that there is no objective point, purpose, morality, destiny, good, evil, right, wrong. The idea that the universe is just a swirling cacophony of mass and energy slowly approaching heat death.		That's the bedrock of my philosophy.		With that bedrock, you eliminate the concept of "supposed to" or "should" and you're left with "can I?" or "can we?". Do we have the ability? Is physics itself going to get in the way? If the answer is "yes" to "can I" you have to then ask yourself "Can I live with the consequences?" It is that question that prevents someone like me from most crimes. I do not believe any given act is inherently immoral, but I am unwilling to live with the consequences of breaking those rules. I don't kill people because I don't want their death on my mind and I don't want to deal with the social ramifications of murder, not necessarily because murder is "wrong".		So, that is the lens through which I view the universe.		And it is through that lens that I see Earth. I see life as a good first start. Natural selection (aka trial and error) lead to some pretty decent designs, but I only see them as designs that can be improved upon.		I see a tiger and think "We could improve that. We could expand its livable habitat, we could expand it's diet. We could make it more resilient to disease."		I see a bird and think "If we just attached those muscles to its back, it could fly so much easier."		I see a human and think "What if I cranked up the intellect a bit. What if I made you grow faster. What if I expanded your diet options. What if I gave you photosynthesis."		I see a tree and think "What if you could absorb CO2 even faster?"		I look at the climate and think "Why just stop damaging it, we could engineer it. We could control where it rains, how much it rains."		To me, being human isn't about living with nature, it's about merging nature, us, and technology into a single thing. A new form of life that is both biological and synthetic that is capable of so much more than either alone could do."		I see a universe begging to be filled with us and I don't want us to fill it only with plastic and steel, but with plants and animals engineered to live side by side with us.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OrbitalStrikeBadger","name":"t1_cpl6f4x","parent_id":"t1_cpl5vk3","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426875430,"created_utc":1426871830}

But honestly you don't need to be "that" rich to install solar panel. I'm from the middle class, and was able to afford some relatively easily with all the aids.

Solar panels do *not* require cleaning a few times a year in climates where, like France, it rains often enough. Similarly, batteries are a non-issue in France where PV interconnections are permitted.		> Raising the up-front cost of a new building cannot help but slow economic growth		I disagree. If they're economic, the short term liquidity drag can be more than offset from both (a) a shot in the employment arm, and (b) the downward pressure supporting a fledging industry can place on costs *for everyone in the economy*, thereby providing a stimulating effect.		> Although very durable, abandoned PV deployments offer a tempting target for thieves (much like air conditioners or exposed wiring)		Or anything else at a commercial site.

{"body":"Let's take a large complex for example.  The Tacoma Convention Center has a footprint of about 118,000 feet (11,000 meters squared).  While I highly doubt the rooftop covers that entire square footage, to keep the math simple, let's just say that the roof line is that large.		The french law states that the roofs must only be partially covered, not entirely covered.  While I cannot locate any definitive information stating the specific percentage of the roof that must be covered, let's go with a fair value of 60%, as some space must be left open on the roof for various machinery, vents and space to perform maintenance.  I would say that 60% is probably an aggressive number, but again I can't confirm that, so we'll go with a high estimate.		60% of 118,000 sq ft is 70,800 sq ft.  We'll use the figures you provided and we'll even go on the high end of $20 a square foot.  70,800 x 20 = $1,416,000.  And that's using the high end of all estimates.		Now any idea how much money it cost to build a complex such as the Tacoma Convention Center?		It cost about 89.7 million dollars.   In other words, adding a rooftop garden to the building would have added about 1.5% to the total cost of the project.  And again, that's using the high end estimates.		Now consider both the environmental impact and economic savings due to lower energy consumption.  The National Research Council of Canada states:  ???If widely adopted, rooftop gardens could reduce the urban heat island, which would decrease smog episodes, problems associated with heat stress and further lower energy consumption."  		They go on to cite further environmental and economic savings, ???As cities grow, permeable substrates are replaced by impervious structures such as buildings and paved roads. Storm water run-off and combined sewage overflow events are now major problems for many cities in North America. A key solution is to reduce peak flow by delaying (e.g., control flow drain on roofs) or retaining run-off (e.g., rain detention basins). Rooftop gardens can delay peak flow and retain the run-off for later use by the plants."  "The Green Roof also significantly moderated the heat flow through the roofing system and reduced the average daily energy demand for space conditioning due to the heat flow through the roof in the summer by more than 75%."  Hmm, daily savings of up to 75% in the summer, that's a very significant cost savings on the electric bill.		Consider too the social element of rooftop gardens, as they could be used as social areas on many buildings, helping to bring communities closer.

I agree with you on this, although I also think, with current technology, that we should prioritize as much as possible the most efficient expenditure.		As for a my example with wind turbines, for a quick and dumb comparison, look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#United_States). PV costs 130$/MWh while onshore wind power is at 80$/MWh. And keep in mind this is for PV power plants : domestic scale PV costs in the range of 3-4 times more than wind power.		And that's not considering the grey energy and environmental aspect of PV, which are to be honest quite atrocious (high energy production cost, rare, polluting and hard to recycle materials...). If you like the CO2 aspect of renewable energies, I did the maths for my country (Belgium), it takes 5-7 yrs for PV to spare as much CO2 as was emitted for its production ; it's ~1.5yrs for wind.		PV has its uses, really, it's a savior at times, but it's a bad choice for mass investment. If you really want it for a reason or another, at least go for plants and not domestic PV. 		The best aspect of incentives for domestic PV, in my opinion, is the psychological impact, to show the state is doing something toward renewables, mostly to spark interest from the people. And I respect that, I think it's important. Although, that must be a minor expenditure, and I believe the green rooftops are already a good enough step in that direction.

If you do not like the prices for modern vehicles, for instance, you can choose to not buy them. This is not the case being described.  The increase in demand seen for cars in the 20th century was not due to artificial market coercion. It was due to enormous natural/organic demand for fast means of transport. That's why a used car can cost as little as a grand.		When you artificially inflate demand prices rise. See college education. Students are paying much more for college than they were in previous years due to an increase in federal and state programs to not only get people into college, but to pay for it as well.

Nonsense. For a capital intensive industry, increased demand can bring costs down.

For an industry where the soft costs (permitting, inspecting, customer acquisition, etc) have room to fall, economies of scale can bring cost down.

It is definitely better than what we had before. Because people not only used to have the freedom to decide what was best. They also had the freedom to do nothing at all. Out of all those great, noble things they could do with money you've listed (wind turbines, helping homeless), they could just do none of that and keep money for themselves.

{"body":">Chinese economic reforms introducing market principles began in 1978 and were carried out in two stages. The first stage, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, involved the decollectivization of agriculture, the opening up of the country to foreign investment, and permission for entrepreneurs to start businesses. However, most industry remained state-owned. The second stage of reform, in the late 1980s and 1990s, involved the privatization and contracting out of much state-owned industry and the lifting of price controls, protectionist policies, and regulations, although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained. The private sector grew remarkably, accounting for as much as 70 percent of China gross domestic product by 2005.[4] From 1978 until 2013, unprecedented growth occurred, with the economy increasing by 9.5% a year.		China is a textbook case of a move from central control to private market solutions (greater individual freedom to allocate capital as each owner chooses) and the benefits that come as a result.

In my opinion the environment is such case. As much as we'd love to isolate local environmental issues to particular nations, they have more or less global consequences.		Let's take the Netherlands for example. They might have a perfect environmental track record and they might completely switch their energy production to renewables and nuclear. But they would still be in big troubles if the sea level raises due to melting ice from raised temperatures, because other nations didn't do their part.		Actually, the Netherlands is a bad example. They are a wealthy nation and they could probably throw some billions on developing, I don't know, artificial dams to keep them afloat. The EU would probably chip in too; Rotterdam is an important European seaport so it's in their best interest to keep it functional.		But what about less wealthy nations, say the ones in Oceania? Somebody would have to spend money to save them but it's not going to be them. They can't afford it. Even if we don't prevent those islands from disappearing under water, we still have to relocate and house their inhabitants somewhere else. It costs money and it's not a pocket change.		So maybe we can prevent big spendings in the future if we divert parts of our funds to tackle the environmental issues now.		Perhaps the execution could be better. Personally I'd prefer incentives (if you build a green roof, we will cover 50% of the costs; and if you add solar panels, you will get a tax break for next five years) instead of penalties (if you don't build a green roof within two years, we will fine you). I suspect you would prefer them too: you would still have freedom to divert your funds elsewhere, but with the knowledge that some options are more attractive than the others. Fines restrict such freedom as you're pretty much forced to do a certain thing.

{"body":"Some thoughts;		There are always unintended consequences. Let's say there are exceptions for smaller (less expensive new construction) then a builder might avoid this requirement by building four buildings under the size limit rather than one of the correct size. Now you have four buildings that are less efficient to cool and heat with a larger power use footprint. Sort of like what can happen with "low flow" toilets (people flush multiple times) or low flow showers (people shower for longer). Bringing about change by force will squeeze people to find loopholes and alternatives.			also - 		Cost-raising legislations like this always pushers small businesses out and big conglomerates in. This is part of why the big guys will be in favor of legislation that seems counter to their industry. As an example (made-up, not surge if it's true) - you might see the huge afro-industry farmers in favor of GMO labeling. Not because they care one way or the other, but because a small farmer cannot afford the government over site to validate whether their food is or is not GMO. This is a real problem in the dairy industry; where the testing requirements for milk are so onerous that small dairy farms cannot afford them and have been forced to sell to bigger enterprises.		also - 		My (perhaps flawed) understanding is that solar technology requires the use of rare earths and precious metals that are rare or even limited in world-wide availability. I will speculate that 15 years from now solar tech will be much much better than now, but if all new buildings already have the old systems, they will not buy the new, better, more efficient systems. Maybe a short term savings will result in a long-term negative - comparing the next 15 years of savings to the potential 45 years of savings if it is true that some materials are irreplaceable or will require extremely expensive and destructive/polluting efforts to get them after the "easy" sources are used up.)		also -		Forcing adoption of a still evolving technology will reduce the drive to enhance the technology-currently (in theory) businesses adopt solar because solar saves them money, the more efficient the solar the more likely they are to adopt. If businesses are forced to adopt solar - then the incentive for solar technology to earn that business goes away.

But the reason dumping is a financially sound strategy is that once the competition is eliminated (the influx of subsidized panels took many businesses out of business), the controlling businesses have the market cornered, and the price can be raised to the desired level.		For Western panel vendors, which don't receive subsidies, it's not just a matter of "we take a hit to our profit to keep our prices competitive, and everything's all fine again." To be competitive, they have to sell solar panels at a loss, cut jobs/hours for their workers, shrink as much as possible, and axe future expansion plans.

{"body":"It's a good first attempt but you might want to ... double(?) your estimate since you're currently linking to the cost of equipment and assuming installation, permits, etc is free.  Also the solar panels don't fail that often... so a 25 year warranty is really easy for the company to do. The inverters fail much more often (you're pretty much guaranteed 1-2 replacements in 25 years).  They're also the most expensive part of the system.  Coincidentally, they have a [5-10 year warranty](http://solarenergy.net/solar-power-resources/guide-to-understanding-solar-warranties/).  The inverter you're linking to has a [2-5 year warranty](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/products.folder/inverter-folder/magnum-ms-4448PAE.html) and costs 2k.  With such a vanishingly short warranty, expect to replace that one frequently.  The company is basically saying "we don't do a very good job on this product."  		So, guestimating, you're now back to the ROI that most solar folks estimate.  Using your numbers with [this calculator](http://solarsimplified.org/solar-resources/calculate-your-solar-savings) gave me a little over 30 years on a 39k (3.9KW equivalent to your link) system so your ~20k system (after labor but not including multiple new inverters plus paying someone to install them) should be ~15 years.  Add 2-4 years for every inverter replacement.  		Yes, solar makes sense but not for the average French family.  The average French family has [$29,322 in disposable income annually](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+family+income+in+france&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8).  They're likely going to take out a loan to afford solar.  In the US, there are a bunch of incentives to get loans (offered by the installers usually) so you can get a $0 down loan.  However, once you do that your monthly payment outstrips your energy savings.  You're probably STILL paying some to the electric company since many companies will give you credit towards future bills if you overgenerate but not actually give you cash.  Than means, most people install systems that provide most of their energy needs but they try not to overshoot because then they're paying for a system that gives the power company extra energy that they never pay you back for.  Anyway, say the unthinkable happens and you manage to break even on the power bill.  You still have a net increase in your monthly "power bill" due to the loan for the system.  For folks with money to throw around, sure solar makes a lot of sense.  For people who are concerned about making mortgage payments/car/food, the $100/month power bill with it's 0% ROI is just fine.  That money is being spent on staying alive.  That's where incentives come in (and all the bad stuff incentives bring).

{"body":"I've worked on design for a number of LEED-certified buildings and buildings that incorporated sustainable design features, but I worry about these sorts of legislated efforts to integrate these more complex systems into all buildings because they overlook two key facts. First, building users determine energy use just as much as building design - even moreso in some cases. Second, each building is a unique machine with unique abilities, needs, and characteristics. Good design can't just assume that what works well in one case will always work well.		Roof leaks, HVAC problems, and elevator problems are the most common building problems. Green roofs and roof-mounted PV are both going to multiply the potential for roof leaks over standard roof design. Green roofs will also create significant cost increases due to the structural requirements to support them. The extra structure will cost a lot more, sometimes a whole lot more, which will impact what owners can afford to build. It will also lead to deeper structure that requires taller buildings so you can still fit the other building systems. If you do photovoltaic instead, you need to have the structure for that - much less difficult than green roof support, but also a non-trivial waterproofing challenge.		Building codes exist to make sure that buildings are designed and built to protect their occupants. In that capacity, they are valuable tools. Energy codes take this an extra step, by mandating that designs are not just safe and functional but also efficient. The danger can arise when the demands for efficiency create systems that are too complex for typical building owners to maintain or incur onerous cost premiums that can't be justified by actual real-world benefits. Give a university or large corporation a water-cooled chiller plant, and they will handle it just fine. Give a church or small school that system, and they will struggle with the complexity - systems will get "tweaked" and "simplified" until the benefits are negated, and the preventative maintenance will get overlooked because it is too costly. Simpler systems require less and simpler maintenance, partly because the systems don't last as long, but they can be operated closer to the design intent for longer. Lots of building systems are like this - lighting controls, water heating, HVAC, etc. My best example was in the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code. They borrowed a requirement from ASHRAE Standard 90.1 that required an economizer for any system over a certain size (about 3.5 tons), with no exceptions in the code. A church that tried to comply with this would have to spend extra money for ductwork and controls to create the economizer, but because the building is only used infrequently and the economizer is only useful in certain weather conditions the energy cost savings is so slight that it would take as many as 250 years or more to recoup the first cost of the extra ductwork and controls. Thankfully we were able to get our local codes amended to borrow some exceptions from Standard 90.1, which allowed them to avoid this extra cost. Similarly, a green roof on a typical commercial building can incur significant structural costs and installation costs and may offer only modest energy savings over good roof insulation. The buffer against storm water discharge can be achieved in other ways (detention basins, bioswales, etc.). The extra green space is a plus that is hard to match in other ways, but you're not going to be able to support trees on it because most only have enough soil depth for grasses. The truth is that not every building is well suited for a green roof or photovoltaic system. Passing a law won't magically change that.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jgonk","name":"t1_cplpkwv","parent_id":"t3_2zp28m","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426911042,"created_utc":1426907442}

Not only will they have to deal with the first cost, which may require them to give up some aspect of the design that they really wanted or needed, but they will have to properly maintain this extra building system.		I would be curious to see all of the rules. A well-written requirement like this would offer some exceptions for cases that aren't compatible with either system.

In fact, when I'm not in my lab, I'm going around some Toronto suburbs with a portable pyranometer measuring solar irradiance, and I plan on doing some feasibility studies over the summer.

If it makes financial sense and you can afford them, definitely buy them...especially here in Ontario, we have an insanely lucrative microFIT program (feed in tariff) that lets you sell electricity back to the grid when you're not using it. 		But see, that only works when I (or a company) find it technically and financially feasible for a particular family. If the house's roof is facing north due to layout constraints, the amount of sunlight falling on the panels will be shit...so it will be stupid to install costly panels on them. But the homebuilder will plop a bunch of PV panels on the roof anyway because that's what the rules say.		And once you take ownership of the house, you'll realize that this thing isn't paying off and you'll stop servicing it. 		People say we can make rules to force them to service it, but come on...that's just too many regulations (that are very difficult to enforce). Batteries for PV systems last about 5-10 years and they are expensive as all fuck to replace. Inverters are expensive to fix (and very expensive to replace). 		I fear that what will happen here is that the Capacity Factor of those panels - the ratio of their actual output over a period of time, to their potential output if it were possible for it to operate them at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time - will be so low and till provide ammo for anti-clean tech politicians.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AQUA2","name":"t1_cpl9sjb","parent_id":"t1_cpl8vta","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426880790,"created_utc":1426877190}

A company is made up of and owned by humans, and thus will act acording to their interest at the time. Say the CEO gets a yearly bonus for the performance of the company, anything that benefits the company outside the time he is employed is of little interest to the CEO.		There is also many other situations where laws are necessary to ensure beneficial situation that would otherwise happen. Say the solar panels, a company that invest in it will be better of long term, but will suffer a short term hit in profits and thus be vulnerable to be out-competed by a company that does not invest in them and thus can temporarily provide cheaper products.		As such a law is necessary to ensure a even playing field.

{"body":"To be clear.	 There are many ways of implementing solar where it will not cause a collapse in the economy, kill people, ruin lives, whatever people are saying, as It exists in countries already, where they have high solar usage. They are a short term cost for a long term benefit, both environmentally and economically. This will provide CRAP tons of jobs in production, service, and repair, which may if not equal then be greater than the number of current jobs and businesses pertaining to the current power companies.		Pro's of Green roofs(plants on the roof) and solar panels:		. Green roofs help with heating/AC by acting as a natural insulator if done right, can cut down HUGE amounts of fossil fuel burning, if growing food with standard hydroponics systems can reduce trucks and planes that need to bring in the food, saving time, money, reducing gasoline burned, etc. Plus it also provides a more healthy, cheap food source that is freshly grown and tastes good!		Cons of Green roofs and solar panels:		There are negatives, too, but the positives outweigh them. You need to build a stronger support/structural system for the roofs for Green roofs depending on how much all the plants, dirt, etc will weigh, depending on various other factors, which might cost more money initially. Again, remember short vs. long term saving. Having solar panels and/or green roofs makes it harder to service/repair the roofs, depending on how they are set up or the solar panels are attached.		Problems specific to this situation would be that because it is mandated, it may spur lazy and cheap people to put up solar panels that are much cheaper, but aren't efficient and will break very quickly, thus actually being worse than not having any at all, because you keep having to produce solar panels, creating waste among other problems. If there is a requirement for their efficiency or something similar, this isn't a problem, so let me know if I just missed something about that that would solve this problem. The last point is service and repair of the solar panels or green roofs themselves. Solar panels can be expensive to repair, and if the hooks and attachment system used to attach the solar panels to the roof is cheap, then they might break often (the super super cheap ones can break once every couple years, times however many solar panels there are can be a lot of wasted plastic and money).			Over all it is a good decision by France that should help lead other nations to follow suit in being more aggressive in taking action against our current predicaments with the environment and economy.		-Zak","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zakriboss","name":"t1_cpld44c","parent_id":"t3_2zp28m","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426886212,"created_utc":1426882612}
{"body":"I would like to point out to all the people promoting this as a great step forward, that this disproportionately harms the middle class and small business. Europe is already prohibitively hard and expensive to build new structures in, depending on the location. Between the permits you have to buy/apply for, the hoops you have to jump through on the local and state level, the numerous other expensive regulations that you have to comply with, not to mention the actual cost of contractors, architects, and the materials themselves. The big companies that already have millions of dollars and resources don't care, because the added cost is a drop in the bucket.

Yes but we are not talking about making the wealthiest poor, just less rich. That's a huge difference. If you have 10 millions instead of 100 millions you are not poor.	Fleeing your country because you are starving is totaly different, it's a life or death choice not rich or richer.		> easy, stalin II. if taxes start to have an impact on your quality of your life more so than they already do, you're probably going to do something about it		Haha i love the stalin II nickname. For that part i can only tell you what i already told. I think the difference of the life quality between 10000000 and 100000000 will not be drastic  enough to make your life less pleasing. At this point it's more irrational, and loving to see all those zeros as a mark of your self worth.		> it sucks, but that's life. forcing things on people never works out in the long run		Yes we could say the same about too much inequalities, if there is too much for too long you end up having a revolution or oppressive dictatorship to maintain the rich in power.			I think we just have to find a balance. I'm personally not communist and think it's ok to have some inequalities in capital, but i think it should be smaller inequalities. And i think that to be free every human has to have enough food water and a roof upon his her head. Without that you can't properly think or be a citizen.

Structure for a green roof has one job: support a foot or more of wet dirt topped with plant life, in addition to the other roof loads that they've always had (rain, snow, equipment, etc.). Any new designs to support a green roof will involve stronger structures, which are achieved by heavier steel or concrete. The construction cost premium will not become cheap. The design fees will also need to go up, and they will need to stay that way because the design professionals are doing more and taking responsibility for more.

{"body":""Things getting cheaper" is a great sentiment for tomorrow, but you still have to pay for it today.  Budgetary restrictions are a very real thing.  I work in architecture.  You can say that the cost would be amortized over 20 years, and that's pretty nice.  But amortization still requires money up front, and buildings can't be paid for on promises.  I'm very pro-solar, pro-wind, and somewhat pro-green-roof, but advocacy needs to be coupled with tax breaks, dollar-matching, and an understanding that not everyone has access to the same capital.  Increases in roofing costs will directly correlate to either a reduction in scale of construction or reduction in number of projects per year.  The money doesn't just increase along with the demands.		I say this because in the US, the building codes have become more rigorous year-over-year in the energy savings and life safety requirements, and this has increased costs.  The shining bright spot in all of it is that companies find ways to decrease costs to compete to produce products that meet these codes.		So I'm very much in favor of increased standards, but not by blanket fiat, and not without parallel compensatory action.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SpadgeRebar","name":"t1_cpl90z9","parent_id":"t1_cpl4c6w","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426879573,"created_utc":1426875973}

{"body":"The problem, if more then 20% of the population has solar, and sells it back into the system, inefficiencies in the grid go up. Because at night you still need the grid, and during the day, if clouds start to form, you need extra grid power.		So it is great if 10-15% of the population uses solar, but beyond that, and it is not such a good idea anymore. 		The reason for this is that powerplants have very high fixed costs and low profit margins, and take a while before they are turned on (especially coal). So you still need a shitload of capacity at night, that will be turned off during the day. And also when suddenly the weather becomes bad, you need extra capacity, often within minutes. So unless you want a lot of powercuts, more energy will be wasted to keep powerplants running 'just in case', producing energy for no one. 		So a lot more energy will be wasted by powerplants, which is not so green after all. 		So for solar to be a real solution, we really need cheap batteries. A better idea is to wait untill solar goes down in price, and make people get batteries instead. 		This seems like a stupid policy, wait a few years, and solar panels will be so cheap, the people will buy them by themselves anyway. Soon you will get them for 2-3k$, and can save 5-600$ a year with them.

Environmentally, they take away from the heat generated by the sun beating on shingle, tar, or rubber roof (if you've ever been up on one, they get extremely hot) and then radiate that heat back into the air. The green roof will absorb that heat into the plants and soil. They reduce to footprint of man and keep more nature in places where we expand. 		Another benefit is that they insulate the home.

The risk of nuclear accidents can be minimized but never eliminated. The more plants that are built and operated, the more hours that are logged, then the longer that the very small odds of serious accident add up to a much more likely event.

Water but also the maintainance and constant upkeep of it all. 		- Oh boy.. its a mess.

{"body":"Leaks at best. You still have to deal with the weight of the soil and foliage, more so after precipitation.		In addition, it'll mean additional labor and resources to buy seed, tend to rooftop plants, etc. Best case scenario, imo, is the business takes "volunteers" (or forces its employees to tend to it), worst case is an outside contractor to do so is hired, resulting in a higher overhead for the business.		Solar panels bring additional maintenance (mounting points = possible failure points) and exacerbate the "heat island" effect (I'm no expert, but common sense dictates that dark reflective surfaces should radiate more thermal energy than normal).		Not to mention there's additional construction costs to build rooftop gardens or solar panel mounts. At minimum, I'd say 5% increase to construction costs per building, after labor, permits, certifications, etc are figured in. Don't know about France, but here in my region of the US, average commercial buildings start in the $7,000,000 area, for 1-story 10k sqft. For said building, the job increases $350,000 because of this law. 		Regardless, in order to fund compliance for his business, the owner will more than likely increase prices or cut wages/benefits closer to bare minimum - either way, the worker and customer suffer.

{"body":"OK since you started the ad hominem, you're dumb, smug, uneducated and you don't know a damn thing. You're relying on "solar doesn't work" arguments that quite frankly haven't been relevant since the 20th century.  Boy, that was fun.		Compare:  Massive solar desert arrays. Remember, the desert or other open land areas aren't just big empty natural parking lots. They are also habitats and environments that will be impacted by industrial scale solar arrays.		In comparison, there would be no impact from repurposing commercial rooftops, since the environmental impact of those buildings is already a sunk cost. And while any single building might be a drop in the bucket, in aggregate, the combined contribution of commercial rooftops could easily exceed the area of massive solar arrays that could be built--especially if you start adding in other potential areas (oh, to name one--parking lots. Double benefit--power generation, and shady parking spots.) And lastly--rooftop solar vs massive solar arrays is not either/or. There's no reason both strategies can't be pursued to maximize the benefit of both.		The amount of energy they could produce with rooftop solar is also not insignificant. Remember, the method of electricity is not an all or nothing proposition. Solar power would be supplementing, not replacing the grid. Furthermore, solar power generation would increase the more the sun shines--which would be perfect for addressing peak demand issues that impact current power generation grids during hot weather when air conditioning drives demand.		Additionally, you propose creating a massive, industrial scale installation that would by definition be some distance from where the electricity would be needed. So you're factoring in transmission lines, and central control of the power generation. And the massive solar array you're talking about would be no more immune to the "dirt and birdshit" that rooftop solar would be. If you own the massive solar array, you can still set the rates that you charge the end user.		By contrast, rooftop solar is being installed right on top of the entities that will be using the power generated. Commercial buildings already have maintenance staff; maintaining a solar array would be no different from maintaining the existing roof. The electricity would be wired into demands of the commericial building; furthermore, the power generated would be for the immediate benefit of the owners of the building. Generating your own electricity would protect the owners of their own solar panels from market price fluctuations.		Is rooftop solar a perfect solution? Of course not. Do massive solar arrays outperform rooftop solar in every way? No. But remember this -- France currently depends on nuclear energy for some 75% of their electricity generation. Many of those plants are approaching the end of their safe useful life. France (and in reality, the rest of us) needs to find ways to replace that electricity supply, and kudos to them for seeking out an "all of the above" approach.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mralex","name":"t1_cplrl02","parent_id":"t1_cplk0es","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426915945,"created_utc":1426912345}

However, "all of the above" energy policy may require that nuclear be a part of the strategy for a while, but I would not want to see decommissioned nuclear plants replaced one for one.		You can go find plenty of plenty of people telling that thorium salt reactors will provide all the benefits of nuclear power with none of the downside.

But the panels themselves are going to last 30-40 years and the rest of the technology should get better. Putting a windmill up would probably be better but meh.  The cost of an electric system that will power a small home (small mind you) for 15-20 years under warranty is under $4000 if you install it yourself.

Secondly, if somehow someone *did* build a house in a commercial zone, a $30k residential solar home system would be quite large (around 7-8kW) *not* the average. This cost is not at all due up front.  Many developed countries have very complex feed in tariff schemes allowing the homeowner to sell unused electricity at a premium.

If you do a quick and very easy model in [Homer](http://www.homerenergy.com/software.html), you will see that solar home systems can have a low time for return on investment. Of course this is dependent on a large number of factors so one cannot say yes all solar home systems in France would return an investment in 5 years, 10 years, etc.		Lastly, (if we again assume this is a mandate for *residential* areas such as Toronto, mentioned in the article) then do you think a very poor person would be looking to build a brand new house?

If the people of France want businesses located in their territory to be more environmentally conscious, then they are fully in their right to create this regulation. Who are you to tell a democracy that they can or cannot regulate their market as they see fit?		Moreover, you can't expect businesses to do this on their own because for businesses profit is first, as it must be, and very rarely does something that both increases costs and does not directly impact the product or service make a company more competitive.

Don't fool yourself into think that a free market is anything more than a rat race or dog-eat-dog, and while that has its advantages in figuring out what to produce, how much to produce it, who to hire, and how much to pay them, it is not the be all end all of morality.

{"body":"Very interesting, but the extension to residential hasn't been made yet, so I won't comment too much on that :)  		I would then still argue that your comparison could be improved, as it doesn't account for the enormous gap of purchasing power that exists between A and B. This is probably what trigger the "But different" comment ! 		On one hand, there is a supergroup made of families, single people, other arrangements of individuals who live together. For the sake of not being an idiot, I acknowledge your point, and extend this to small-to-medium business owners, who (in France ; most of the time) purchase existing walls to set up and are, by all means, people. 		For these, adding mandatory costs is very harsh, especially these last years of 'crisis', as it pushes the possibility of being a homeowner further away from the lowest incomes. While our government is a government, they appear to have been aware of that. As the article explains, activists were asking for this to be mandatory everywhere, for everyone, and the lawmakers calmed their tits and limited that to business owners.		On the other side, you have the target category for this law. In it, only organisations big enough to hire architects, construction businesses, etc, to build something new to put their office monkeys/factory workers/robots in. 		It's the second category that will have to install panels or plants. It's also a category that has money on it's hand, as it is expanding into new premises. 		Some of those commercial buildings are made to be rented. Those pop up like mushrooms in the closer Paris suburbs, the offer is actually higher than the demand. Talking out of my ass here, but I assume adding green maintenance costs to new buildings will interact in some hopefully favorable manner with this wasteful tendency. 		I understand how you don't like overreach, but I have a problem with your seatbelt example : these actually save lives, lots of them. Misplaced self-confidence and trust in other drivers was causing deaths as people wouldn't wear the readily available security item. Premature death is plain uncool. In the security vs liberty balance, I feel this is an acceptable law.		Spy agencies stocking and snooping your private data is unlikely to save lives though, and would probably provide a better light for the freedom you're defending :) 		TL;DR : businesses that build have money residential owners don't have.

{"body":"Thanks for keeping this civil, that's nice. I don't have to rage and call names :)		I always take issue with the 'but they can afford it' argument. Sure, maybe they can, but so what? People use this argument in the US saying "Tax the 1% to pay for this shit! Pay for me! Pay for the masses! The 1% can afford it!" essentially seeking to penalize success and leech off the successful. These business owners will more than likely seek to recuperate those costs, and will cut corners elsewhere, be it salary or safety or whatever. You can see this in all major corporations, no matter how large they are; McDonalds, Walmart, Target, etc. will ALWAYS find ways to cut costs, even if their profits are in the billions. Adding on more regulations from the government inevitably causes corners to be cut elsewhere, usually in places that are the least intrusive to the business owners, ie. salaries. 		The slippery slope argument is still valid, and I thank you for not simply dismissing it, but you must acknowledge this sets a dangerous precedent in mandating something that is not simply a trivial public safety issue. Mandating fire escapes for apartment buildings or lit stairwells serves many functions; it provides safety for occupants, protects landlords from legal actions, allows buildings to be insured etc. Mandating solar panels on roofs does not fit any of these issues and using the argument that this is somehow going to make a dent in the global pollution/carbon emissions is just absurd. One container ship will produce more carbon than the entire country will. This argument is just an excuse and hype made by lobbyists and companies that want their products mandated in order to make money or get tax breaks. Solar panels on commercial buildings in France affecting carbon emissions across the globe, especially considering the amount of nuclear power being used, is like saying a household sponge is going to affect rising sea levels. 		Not sure about the commercial buildings/rental issue. Maybe you can clarify? 		The seatbelt example does work, because it's a personal choice about personal safety. It's like smoking...sort of. Smoking of course pisses a lot of people off who are around you, and cigarette butts are a major littering issue. The seatbelt example is more like doing drugs or whatever. It's up to you how you want to protect yourself. Yes, SOMETIMES a person can be hurled out of their windshield and their body flies into someone else and harms them, but these cases are rare. The Government should have absolutely no role in mandating a person's behavior regarding their personal safety, unless the person is irrationally trying to kill themselves from some mental illness, at which point the medical community steps in, ie. psych wards for a period of time etc, but even those have huge issues and things to deal with in terms of just how that works. If I want to drive around without a seat belt and not endanger anyone else, I should be allowed to. It's not up to the government to fine me for behaving how I want. It's not like I'm fined for skiing, hang gliding, surfing, parachuting, bungee jumping, skydiving, skateboarding, or doing any of the other millions of far more hazardous things that I am perfectly able to partake in if I wish to.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Arakin","name":"t1_cplel49","parent_id":"t1_cple06w","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1426888718,"created_utc":1426885118}
