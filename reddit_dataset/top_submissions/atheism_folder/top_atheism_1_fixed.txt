{"body":"> He stated that homosexuality was worse than mass murder, because it was to blame for Noah???s flood.		Wat?		Edit: He "justifies" his ridiculous claim [here](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/lively-wedding-songs-homosexual-marriage-flood-end-times):		> We need to remember that in the time leading up to the Flood what the rabbis teach about the last straw for God before He brought the Flood was when they started **writing wedding songs to homosexual marriage** and Jesus said that you???ll know the End Times because it will be like the days of Noah. There???s never been a time in the history of the world since before the Flood when homosexual marriage has been open and celebrated, and that???s another sign that I believe that we???re close to the end.

It mentions the Earth being corrupt and full of violence, makes some vague references to everyone's thoughts being evil all the time, and mentions the "sons of God" mating with the "daughters of men" (so presumably something heterosexual) to produce Nephilim (a type of creature from ancient Hebrew mythology that we don't actually know very much about at all).  You get some references to homosexuality in regards to Sodom and Gomorrah later on in Genesis, but even the close connection between sexuality and the cities of the plain doesn't really come in until the New Testament Epistle of Jude.

{"body":">Hate is biologically expensive; it is counterproductive, doesn't work in a tribal sense, and expends large amounts of energy un economically.		But that is literally wrong. Hate IS very rational. Imagine you are in a tribe A and I'm in a tribe B, we have one food source avaliable only able to sustain one tribe. Would it not help the killing if you hated my self and my tribe? Of course it would, because if killing is going to happen thats how nature makes you do it, by hate. 		>The psychological presentation of Hitler has been well documented and includes child abuse, massive insecurity, helplessness, etc. Most racism (to use your example once again) can be traced to fear or xenophobia, massive insecurity, and on and on. I believe, and I'm not alone in this, that hate is almost always a symptom of something more profound and to say otherwise means one isn't looking deeply enough.		You see, you could say that and all is right with the world ! Because now no hate against you is legitimate!! You are safe! If you like to think about psychology, think about yours in this instance.	Hitler had a very good reason to hate jews, was he morally justified in doing what he did? Of course not, but there was a legitimate reason for his hate. You just need to know a bit of history about what the jews were doing at the time. They would simply take over a country, not because that's their secret plan or their shot to control the world or whatever, but simply because of nepotism. Extreme nepotism, so you would end up in Russia where in the time of the Hitler's rise there were 80% of the offices held by jews. Hitler would see that happening in his own country too. Now jews are a small small minority in the country yet hold so much power, they are not your tribe (germans) so if something has gone to shit terribly  of course you will see them as boogymen. There was a reason for his hate and for the hate of others I mentioned.","depth":7,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elsworth_toohey","name":"t1_cs0e0ut","parent_id":"t1_cs01wb7","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433841400,"created_utc":1433837800}

{"body":"The notion of 'good vs. Evil' gets more and more intrenched in how people view the world around them as their spirituality becomes increasingly charismatic. In Africa, and most of the developing world, charismatic Christian churches (mostly Pentecostal)  are popping up everywhere at a ridiculous rate. A big part of their understanding of the spiritual world is a constant battle between good and evil. The agents of evil are everywhere and this type of language comes up in discussions about the weather, economy and even as part of political campaigns. For the american context of this phenomenon see the documentary Jesus camp. Anyway, it's understandable that extreme hate for gays can develop in the context of this type of good vs. Evil mentality. As an aside, these are the same churches where the pastors pocket all the offerings openly. The wealthier they appear the more people will be willing to attend their sermons as they all promise spiritual 'gifts' to their followers... "This guy's rich.

{"body":"Scott Lively was born and raised in the village of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, the oldest of six children. He became an alcoholic aged 12 as a means of coping with an unhappy family situation. When Lively was 16, his father was committed to a mental institution, never to return. After graduating from high school in 1976, Lively spent the next 10 years "drifting around the United "States, often homeless, sometimes sleeping under bridges and begging for spare change on street-corners." Lively has stated in his autobiography: "I visited every one of the 48 continental states and logged over 25,000 miles by thumb, bus and train in my wandering. I didn???t learn to drive a car until I was 25"		I don't claim to know the facts, but I feel like there is a very high statistic probability that he was raped multiple times while he was homeless at any age. The church helped him get off the streets, they shared their view against it and the rest rolled onward. This dude probably experienced some horrific shit, but I don't think it excuses his actions at all and "Good" is the calmest way of saying "fuck that guy" as a group.","depth":2,"score":42,"ups":42,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"godofallcows","name":"t1_crzuysf","parent_id":"t1_crzu1r6","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433801376,"created_utc":1433797776}

We found no evidence that Chick-fil-A itself spent money (let alone millions) lobbying Congress to prevent that body from issuing a condemnation of a controversial Ugandan legislative bill which carried the death penalty for some homosexual acts. Some sources reported that the Family Research Council (FRC), one of the organizations to which Chick-fil-A donates through its WinShape corporate charity foundation, filed a report stating that it had spent $25,000 lobbying Congress against H.R. 1064, a resolution seeking to "express the sense of the House of Representatives" that Uganda's proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill "threatens the protection of fundamental human rights." However, the FRC said that although they did perform lobbying activities regarding H.R. 1064, they did not support the Uganda bill or the death penalty for homosexuality, and their lobbying efforts were not aimed at killing the Congressional resolution but rather at changing its language "to remove sweeping and inaccurate assertions that homosexual conduct is internationally recognized as a fundamental human right."

Him specifically calling for extermination of a sexuality only comes into play with final sentencing, not what punitive measures he's eligible for.

{"body":"My degree and vocation say otherwise, but who cares about actual knowledge, right?  If you're curious, there is a difference between actively causing a crime against humanity and advocating a position on a controversial religious issue that persuades other people to commit a crime against humanity.  The former is "unprotected speech or conduct," while the latter is "protected speech."  As the First Circuit said in denying the writ of mandamus, "it is debatable whether the district court has properly parsed the petitioner's  protected speech from any unprotected speech or conduct." http://www.scribd.com/doc/249195893/13-2503-Judgment  	But because the issue was before the appellate court on an extraordinary writ of mandamus rather than an appeal from a final judgment, the courts need a more developed factual record to make the decision.

Don't believe me?

Not necessarily that the suit should be dismissed; the judge makes a reasonable case for allowing it to proceed to the summary-judgment phase. But it probably shouldn???t get much further than that.

That theory seems very easy to abuse."		http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/03/the-painful-case-of-pastor-scott-lively-homophobe-to-the-world/		Learn something before you speak.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"poppop_n_theattic","name":"t1_cs3iv9q","parent_id":"t1_cs03th5","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1434061473,"created_utc":1434057873}
