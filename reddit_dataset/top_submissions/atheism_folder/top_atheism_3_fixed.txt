All governments have been placed in power by God. 2 So those who refuse to obey the laws of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow. 3 For the authorities do not frighten people who are doing right, but they frighten those who do wrong. So do what they say, and you will get along well. 4 The authorities are sent by God to help you. But if you are doing something wrong, of course you should be afraid, for you will be punished. The authorities are established by God for that very purpose, to punish those who do wrong. 5 So you must obey the government for two reasons: to keep from being punished and to keep a clear conscience. 6 Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons. For government workers need to be paid so they can keep on doing the work God intended them to do. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay your taxes and import duties, and give respect and honor to all to whom it is due."

A few kegs were on tap and a hose was hooked up to spray down women with white shirts. 		2) A fist fight where a guy pulled out a switch blade. I still can't believe it years later but it happened. 	Me and my brother had enough of the race and went to lay down at our tent toward the end of the race, heard someone arguing and didn't think much of it at first. Then one of the men started making fun of the other guy's very pregnant SO and it was on. The guy tried to defend her honor and makes some swings at the lone wolf, who doesn't hesitate to pull out a knife, but is promptly laid out with one monster right hook and they just left him there out cold and walked off.

{"body":"I'm an individual that is from Indiana and have lived in multiple parts of the state.  I very much hate this new bill and I hate our governor. (like many others) I also did vote and he is not who I voted for.		I love that people are really vocal about this and likely this law will have its wording changed or amended, but PLEASE do not continue to trash a state you hardly know anything about.  (And this is not directed at you, just in general).		Indiana is always heavily republican and not progressive what so ever.  This reflects the viewpoints of the individuals in the country, rural areas and small towns that are very closed minded.  When you visit Indiana's metro areas, these are not the people that you will interact with.		In the metro areas, EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE is completely disgusted at this law.  We all opposed it, we all fought it, but the governor ignored it and was hoping this would fly under the radar.  It didn't and we all know the backlash it's getting.		I'm born and raised from Northwest Indiana.  I currently live in Indianapolis and went to college at Ball State.  Big notable things I'm proud of in Indiana:  (Mostly Indy related items because if people visit, this is likely where they'll go)		* Microbrewing is arguably one of the best in the country.  Obviously you can argue endlessly about this, but with the big microbrew craze, Indiana is one of the best.  Yes I've traveled a lot and have tried most all state's best.  Once you try 3 Floyds, Sun King, Upland, Bier, and Triton, go ahead and try to convince me that it's not great.	* Turkey Run State Park is awesome.  If you're into camping, it's a great spot.	* The Indy 500 - Even if you're not a racing fan and yes EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A RACING FAN.  I say it twice because I would have never gone had it not been that I've lived in Indy.  If you love to tailgate, this is absolutely the BEST and most ridiculous tailgating experience that exists.  It is 4 days of camping, being drunk, high, partying, and being nuts...with 300,000 people.  It's such a huge area, there is hardly any police enforcement at all.  	* Indy is a good sports town as well.  The Colts are a solid franchise with a good fan base.

This isn't an isolated incident.  I've lived in Indianapolis.  Their urban poor are disenfranchised because their leaders refuse to invest in public transit, they refuse to invest in the police force in favor of sports stadiums, they crusade against abortion access and sex education, they cut funding for public services like libraries and workforce centers, half the northeast side floods on a summer sprinkle because only rich white neighborhoods deserve infrastructure, the government is continually trying to privatize more prisons, and it just goes on, and the people are in favor of it, even at the city level.  Indianapolis is NOT Austin.  It's not some progressive haven trapped in an otherwise conservative state.  It's a conservative city just as whacked out as the rest of the surrounding areas.  There just HAPPEN to be enough people living close together that moderates and liberals occasionally run into each other often enough to delude themselves into thinking that they have any political significance.

{"body":"There's a bunch of things here that I've not brushed up on a long time, but I think your presumption is that if there exists a theoretical global maxima that the market will find it. I don't think this is true. For two reasons:		1. As you stated, in a iterative manner, is that the cost of changing maxima is _built into_ the cost of the computation. This is an intractable calculation, but basically says that energy _is_ required to change. It's just that you're saying that it's so incrementally small that it can be ignored. That's the chain-reaction type assumption.		2. We can imagine that the global maxima, ie stable equilibrium, is theoretically possible, but the system itself would have to recognize it's existence _and_ have the resources to reach this maxima. Because of the computation and the associated overhead, resources, such as semi-conductors or other _hard_ commodities, must exist to make the movement possible. 		My statement is essentially still stands, as the existence of a theoretical global maximum doesn't negate that there's a bunch of equal local maxima that the market will _randomly_ choose from.		And this is the fun bit where we can discuss the precision and accuracy of models. You can tell me that at least one of the local maxima that can be reached within the system is _the best_ but I can tell you that _the best_ is based on your precision and accuracy. If we try to arrange the markets in a manner that maximizes GDP, are you going to argue with me over a couple of dollars? A hundred dollars? A thousand?		We're in an area where our we perceive/model the economics, and how people/systems behave are not at all congruent to the totality of the outcome. 		We can calculate how the market efficiency evolves with time, but there's no way to ever say whether or not it has reached a global maxima. The global maxima calculation requires _all_ the information in the universe about the state of the system, and we will never have that. Even knowing that there's a limit to this, and that we can find a global maximum within our scope, I'm saying that the precision of what we're discussing makes multiple _most efficient_ solutions.

I was arguing that you were saying that. Because the weak market efficiency hypothesis logically leads to that.		But then you also argue against it, *which is also what I was also doing*. I was saying that the *market cannot* ***efficiently*** (although it may get lucky every now and then) *find the global maxima*. And you seem to agree with me! Which is great, we agree there.		But the *market efficiency hypothesis* is the thing leading to the argument I was making that the market should be able to find that global maxima.

You seem to think both those propositions are false, which I am saying is illogical. That was my argument.

I am saying that in a theoretical timeline the market could choose any of the lower peaks (20% efficiency) and not find the much more efficient peak (100%).

The efficient market hypothesis says markets should be able to find that most efficient peak. That hypothesis is wrong, complexity theory shows that the problem space is too complex to gaurntee that the market will find that most efficient peak. Markets are, in the strictest sense, in a computational sense, not efficient.		However, markets are an embodiment of an (efficient) algorithm which is the most *effective* (but not an *efficient*) one computer scientists have to solving the problem above. However, it does not offer guarantees that it's results (a current configuration of the market, a point on the plane in the above picture) are globally efficient, merely locally efficient (and it also can't tell us if a solution is globally efficient or not). It does, at least, most likely, have among *the best chances* (of all possible classes of algorithms we know of) of finding the globally efficient solution.		So **the market** (as a whole) is *effectively efficient*, but not *strictly efficient*. But an arbitrary **current configuration of a market** or it's "state" can never be assumed to be efficient.

Certainly not. But a law against discrimination does not change people's minds about their bigotry. Such a law would only reinforce their thinking that they are being wronged by a subset of people, and by a govt institution that favors those people over themselves. What I think would change a bigot's mind is seeing how much business they lost from the people who don't agree with their racism and how much they stand to gain by serving everyone equally.		>I'm okay with this law, and how It gives business owners the rope to hang themselves with.

The basic point of the law is so businesses don't have to serve people based on religious views. 		I.E. a Christian bakery could deny service for a gay wedding. No cake for you gays!		Now, while this is shitty and *shouldn't* be allowed, people outside Indiana don't realize that this will **not affect anything**.		People are acting like this is the end of freedom for people with certain views, and on every corner there's going to be an anti-gay shop or an anti-Islamist restaurant. Or whatever. And it will be legal. 		What it REALLY means is that a few anti-gay stores will pop up around the state, and will promptly go out of business because normal people don't put up with that shit.		Everyone's acting like the government's views match that of the public. Since when the fuck is that true? That's like saying the American public approves of the governments warmongering and military spending.		Tl;dr business won't have to serve gays/people they disagree with based on religious factors.

{"body":"I will argue that the free market does not work. I have to admit i don't have the words/the knowledge to dispute why, at least not to a degree i feel is worthy of being a real argument... Only example which comes to mind is inequality in a total free market without regulations which will go bananas! 		Anyways i do see your point of view to some degree.. But two things bothers me. 		Firstly the most logical and straight forward issue with your idea (to me). From my understanding (Being from Denmark i don't have much experience with it) small cities of just a few hundred people may not have many opportunities for goods. As i understand it many of these cities only have one dealer (business) of very essential services. Having just one of these essential businesses deniying services will lead to the people being denied more than likely not moving to the small city. This will in turn increase the amount of people who share this opinion (for example: All jews are the devil, black persons are dirty, gays are unholy) and therefore are refusing services to a group of individuals based on their appearance, ideals or sexualities. So by allowing people to refuse services to others based on their own ideas and not the person who is being refused's actions you are allowing growth of hateful discrimination in closed communities all across the world. You can argue that some communities will simple not trade with the person who discriminate in the first place, and that is most likely true in some cases, while other cases they will back him up and the idea will grow to the rest of the community/city.		My second thing is - to me - hard to describe... What if "the free market" does not punish the baker? What if the free market is discriminating gays? Does that make it OK? Also if a group is refused services that group is worse off than the other groups not being refused services, because they will have less alternatives.		What i'm trying to get to is the free market is not always right. The idea that you can rely on the free market to regulate itself to become perfect is non-existing. Regulations are required (see for example free market without regulations effect on inequality). 		"The fact is, if you have enough votes to make something illegal, then you have enough popular support that market forces can take care of the discrimination without government involvement."		Does that mean that if (as is the current case), you have enough votes to discriminate, that it is ok?

{"body":"This law is very different from other states. This is just a false talking point. There are two major differences. First, gays and lesbians are not a protected class in Indiana like they are in other states. If they were, that protected class status would make discrimination against them based on religious grounds illegal still. The Indiana gov has said he has no plans to push to get them added. Secondly, most other religious freedom laws, including the often cited Clinton federal law, only apply if the government is one of the two parties in the dispute. This law applies even when the dispute is private citizens. What this allows is discrimination ala Jim Crow "no gays allowed" if one person can show its against their religious principles. Since that line is so vague, it effectively legalizes discrimination against gays at will. That is why there is a lot of disagreement to this law.

Indiana's RFRA law differs dramatically in that it addresses how citizens interact with *each other*, effectively allowing bigots to discriminate against people they don't like.  It's a major step backward, culturally speaking, and it's not even Biblically sound - Jesus never said "don't associate with sinners" or anything like that.  In fact, the people he surrounded himself with were the sinning outcasts of society - prostitutes, etc.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"analogkid01","name":"t1_cpx3ihq","parent_id":"t1_cpx2xby","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427839845,"created_utc":1427836245}

Giving a business the right to refuse business to homosexuals is not exercising religious rights, it's merely an excuse to treat a specific demographic like shit.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MrBoulder","name":"t1_cpx0clx","parent_id":"t1_cpwtnws","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427834989,"created_utc":1427831389}

It says that a "state or local government action may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion". Then is goes on to say that if a burden does occur, it may be used as a claim or defense in court. For example, think of the hobby lobby case. A very similar bill, passed in 1993 by congress, was used in defense because the company was "burdened". The issue today is timing. At a time today when gay rights are being pushed forward Indiana passed this bill. Many other states already have similar bill, and even more are currently pushing for one. (Well maybe not anymore.)

{"body":"You misunderstand the difference between the federal RFRA and the state level initiatives like those being proposed in Indiana. The federal RFRA requires that one party to litigation be the government or a government agency. In your example, the Native American Peyote ritual was repressed by the DEA, and the RFRA mediated between the affected tribes and that agency. 		The state level RFRA wants to expand the reach of the legislation so that it can mediate between private entities i.e. businesses and customers. Hence the reason the LGBTQ community is concerned it will be used to defend discriminatory business practices. Religious belief has never been legally justifiable for refusal of service before, and making it so would be a significant policy change with far-reaching implications. 		Also, you're entirely wrong in your belief that just because a business is "private" it can be run like "bigoted hell hole." Business is highly regulated enterprise, and there is no constitutional right to own or operate a business. None at all. All levels of government--federal, state, and municipal--can revoke a proprietor's business license for any number of reasons. Opening a business is a tacit agreement to abide by the relevant laws and regulations that govern commerce in the operating locale, and that includes public accommodations. 		Of course, a proprietor can claim that a particular ordinance violates their religious belief. But assertion is not enough. They have to satisfy a judge or jury that their claim has validity. A member of the white-supremacist World Church of the Creator can claim that serving black and Hispanic customers violates their religion, but their legal challenge will fail. Christians proprietors may assert that serving LGBTQ individuals compromises their religious belief, but if the courts decide otherwise their claims have no legal standing.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Allogenes","name":"t1_cpy1osx","parent_id":"t1_cpxefvm","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427916123,"created_utc":1427912523}

There will be extremists who will use religion as a form of discrimination. While that is taking place, it does not represent the religion as a whole, but please, take your business elsewhere. There are slippery slopes on both sides of the coin. If business can't discriminate against the basic of forms (dogs not allowed; no shoes no shirt no service), then they must open their business to everything including the unnecessary or else they will  get sued to hell.
