Religion is adequately protected to the extent that people are always allowed to decline any form of sex act they regard as sinful.		However, if you think sex is just like making a cake, you're obviously doing it wrong.  The argument against letting gay customers buy wedding cakes is precisely the same as the "religious objection" bigots of another era used to refuse sales that might wind up being consumed at a mixed-race wedding.  If you think a particular marriage is unholy, you have every right not to stand up on the altar and say "I do."  However, if you want to run a business open to the general public, you don't get to say "no cake for you" not matter how much a customer's gayness offends your pseudo-Christian sensibility.  		Anyone who had even a shred of relevant understanding would act on the "hate the sin, love the sinner" edict -- but either way anyone with even a shred of relevant Constitutional insight would also understand that you need to operate as a private club if you want to indulge your personal bigoted nonsense about who you will or won't permit access to whatever goods and services you have to offer.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Demonweed","name":"t1_cr1eeu3","parent_id":"t1_cr19pbl","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431012372,"created_utc":1431008772}

The problem arises when the kids are required to know and understand ALL of the methods, and are tested and graded on their ability to do all of them. If method "A" works really well for Johnny, but methods B, C, and D are arcane and confusing, it doesn't matter if he can consistently get questions right with A, because he doesn't understand the other approaches. 		Also, because there are rigid schedules determining when a teacher is supposed to address a particular topic, it doesn't give them a lot of freedom to be able to tailor a class schedule to fit that particular class's educational needs.

{"body":"Math teacher in TN here. 		I cannot stand Common Core, and it's exactly for the reasons some people have listed below. Its implementation (in TN at least) is TERRIBLE. Prior to CC, I did not allow my students to use calculators in my class (I teach Algebra II, the main focus of which is dealing with polynomial functions, specifically quadratic equations) for quizzes and exams. Since CC has been implemented, I am now required to allow calculators to be used on quizzes, tests, and exams because using a calculator is one of the CC methods for solving math problems. Prior to CC, I would show my students how to effectively use their calculators to check their work, but would remind them that they need to know how to solve problems by hand because they wouldn't be able to use a calculator come test day. Now, as soon as they learn the calculator method, that's all they care to learn. I'm passing kids in my class that can't rationalize a radical in the denominator of a fraction because when they plug an equation into their calculator, it just spits out an irrational decimal approximation of the answer, and that's good enough for them. It's very disheartening to push kids into a higher math class knowing they haven't gained what they should have from my class. On another note, they now require students to have four years of math courses that are Algebra I or higher, so I now have students that normally wouldn't have taken my class and would have instead opted for a technical math course because they knew they weren't going to pursue a college degree after high school. All in all, it's very frustrating, especially when I'm still expected to have a high success rate on standardized tests.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"peto0427","name":"t1_cr1bfrr","parent_id":"t1_cr122p2","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431006325,"created_utc":1431002725}
