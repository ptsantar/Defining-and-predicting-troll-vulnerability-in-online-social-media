Now, please note: just because both reflect a tribal impulse to defend a specific identified cultural group does not mean both sides are necessarily *equally right*.

Tribalism seems to be more or less inherent in the human condition, and hey, sometimes you do need to fight it out a bit, because one side is clearly right and the other wrong. Sometimes. My concern is when people --*especially* people I agree with-- start to lose their perspective and see every incident as part of an overarching culture war which needs to be fought and won.

The New Testament is very short on Jesus condemning people for their sins, and very long on his forgiving them, even for things society at that time would have found pretty heinous. From the available evidence, I don't think assuming Jesus would forgive a child molester (who had legitimately repented) is a very hard case to make. Whether you like that or not, whether it's right or wrong, whether the bible accurately portrays Jesus's intentions, whether any of that even existed in the first place... these are all questions somewhat beyond the scope of this comment. But my point is that it's logical for Christians to approach even heinous crimes from the perspective of forgiveness.

{"body":"For a few reasons. He won't *need* the Latino vote. Even after 16 years, a lot of people hate Bill Clinton, and Hillary by extension. Some even hate her more than Bill, for a variety of reasons. Republican turnout will be higher if Clinton is the nominee, because her husband and herself are both divisive political figures. At the same time, Democratic turnout (may) be suppressed because oh look, another Clinton. Maybe not, though. I'd say 60-40 on that. We have a national sense that the Clintons are shady-- true or not, it's something we have to consider.		And because Hillary's current image is that of someone who doesn't play by the rules, Rubio won't ever have to make a policy statement beyond the general and vague. He'll be gifted the *perfect* outsider campaign, by dint of who his opponent is. His record won't even matter. Hillary will be defending 30 years of columns, papers, speeches, and a voting record that leaves a lot to be desired. And it doesn't even have to come from Rubio's campaign! The independent expenditure organizations (thanks, *Citizens United*) will swiftboat her to hell and back, while Rubio bemoans the negativity with one hand behind his back. Whitewater, Vince Foster, pardons her husband made, her "radical feminism", Emailghazi... it'll all be back on the table.		Finally, Hillary is too easy to bait. She is passionate and articulate, and likes to debate policy points and correct the record. In this day and age of 24-7 recording, she's going to put her foot in it *somewhere* along the line, because she's not a people person. She's a wonk-- one of the best political minds of her generation-- but she's not Bill. She'll face a strong primary challenger-- my money's on Bernie Sanders to pull an upset in New Hampshire-- and it may be a photo finish. The longer she's in the trenches, the more likely it is she'll have a "Mitt Romney dinner" moment. And it'll be epic. 		So yeah. Because of who she is, and because of who he's not, Rubio would absolutely shellac Hillary in the general election. Barring the proverbial dead hooker skeleton in Rubio's closet, anyway. 	I'm holding out hope for Lindsay Graham. America is ready for its second gay Republican president.		Edit: with the disclaimer that I'm just some schmuck on the internet who loves politics.

Not to mention no access to porn, so his only experience with the female body is from his younger sisters. Duggar points to what should have been completely innocent things like bath-time and diaper changing as issues. It's hard to say for an outsider is it was a problem for him b/c he found little girls enticing or if it was a problem b/c at a time when he was extremely curious about the female body (aka 14yo) those little girls were the only females he could see. I don't see how we can know if he was/is an abusive pedophile or if he was a victim of an extreme and sexually warped upbringing - and also lacked either self-control, empathy, or understanding of the consequences of his actions, all things which *can* change as a teenager grows up.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kalg","name":"t1_crrthph","parent_id":"t1_crra0ob","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433170249,"created_utc":1433166649}

I'm not sure on the research, it seems likely to me that pornography and prostitution might prevent molestation and sexual assault/rape.....Because FOR ME imagining a world of sexual frustrated teenagers with no "healthy release" is just asking for problems....This is a cruel and I have no research....but it seems reasonable from experience.		The media has had field day casting Josh Duggar as a paedophile and terrible person while the parents as "victims" trying their best. One was 14 and received no real help from his parents. The other ignored: professional and available help for their child, mental health issues, support for the victims including THEIR OWN daughters, and the fact their "plan" didn't work because Jesus clearly didn't fix it and preventing it from happening again. But then again, nearly all psychologists would say the environment surrounding the child is harmful and damaging.... But that is avoided because "God told them it was best".		This is a real mental health issue and should be treated as such. It shouldn't be treated in a disgusting/ignorant manner or ignored.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BigCommieMachine","name":"t1_crrp3va","parent_id":"t1_crrm93a","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433156064,"created_utc":1433152464}

If Republicans sent a progressive Immigration bill, single-payer universal healthcare bill, end-the-drug-war/weed legalization bill, federal legalization of gay marriage bill, and a budget that slashed new military R&D contracts and created a New 'New Deal' that vastly expanded social welfare programs, are you *seriously* telling me Obama WOULDN'T sign any of those, because he governs to the right?		He would sign fucking all of them in heartbeat. He's the President, not his own Congress. There's only so much you gain from the bully pulpit, and the Republicans realize that morons like you have forgotten that Obama cannot actually pass laws himself. So they mudsling about how he never does anything while they, the lawmakers, sit there doing basically nothing.		I guess everyone in this country needs to retake their highschool American History and US Government classes.		Yeah, he's leaned right on military matters, but I don't blame the guy for trying to topple Bush's surveillance state while the world is going to hell in a handbasket, we're at war, in midst of gigantic recession, and are arguing over literally ever social and fiscal issue that there is. 		Like, yeah we all don't like the NSA recording our phone records in principle, but it's not actually a problem that's affecting most people. Immigration, gay marriage, drug laws, healthcare, etc, actually ARE affecting tons of people in real ways. 		tl;dr: When Obama vetos a progressive bill, THEN you can say he governs right. The only thing anyone can hammer him on is the surveillance/drones bullshit. If we hadn't been in two wars in the Middle East when he came in to office, it probably would have been easier to make headway on that. Lets not forget the context he came in to office with. The surveillance shit really isn't affecting ANYONE in the US in a tangible way. You should be complaining about every other important issue that Republicans are stonewalling.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TohkYuBong","name":"t1_crrg8gl","parent_id":"t1_crrb9zp","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433129508,"created_utc":1433125908}
{"body":"First,  you should not call people morons when they disagree with you. 		Though he can't write new laws, Obama does have a lot of power.  		- He could use executive orders to stop domestic spying		- He could order the military to close Guantanamo and give Congress the choice of jailing them in America or setting them free.		- He could put in place leaders of agencies that aren't simply setting up their cushy post public life lobbying job		- He could stop prosecutorial overcharging that lead to the deaths of Aaron Schwartz and most likely many others		- He could end the police seizure of people cash pretending any cash could be drug related and therefore seized.  		Lastly,  Obama rules by compromise.  Republicans move right, he moves right to meet them.  They never move towards him so the net effect is he comes up with right leaning policies.  Maybe he doesn't believe in them deep down, but then he should stand firm until the other side agrees to negotiate.  He doesn't. He picks the lowest drama solution.  		Also - I'm not American.

Obama was a "skinny state senator from Illinois" at the time. He gave a much-publicized speech about the Iraq invasion at an anti-war rally in Chicago. 		"Dr." Keith Ablow states, "Young Josh was a fervent supporter of Republican politics and he was outraged that this former community organizer would have the nerve to challenge the president. His Bush Boner was throbbing with rage. The only way he could relieve his anger was to molest his young sisters and other relatives.

{"body":"I think the idea is that just because someone does something wrong doesn't mean they stop being a person - people should still receive compassion, because even the absolute worst person is still a person, still capable of doing good things and having a positive impact on society, and still has a *soul* (which may or may not mean anything to you). And asking for forgiveness (assuming they actually mean it) implies that they recognize what they did was wrong and want to do better.		We can get pretty carried away by hatred and forget (or just never learn) that **everyone** has a hard time in life, and **everyone** messes up sometimes. We absolutely should take steps to try and keep people from messing up, and keep people who messed up once from doing so again, and ensure that people with a long history of messing up in very bad ways can't hurt others by continuing to do so. But being vindictive, or punishing someone to make ourselves feel better, that's too far - especially if they seem to be trying to make amends.		Also, holding grudges is really, really bad for your own health, and it generally takes forgiveness to stop holding a grudge - whether they asked for that forgiveness or not doesn't really matter.		You're absolutely right that some folks aren't genuine; that's part of why a big part of it is portrayed as being between the person and God, who can presumably tell whether they're genuine or not. That's also part of why forgiveness from other people doesn't relieve someone of the more mundane consequences of their actions (not to mention that someone can do something wrong, be genuinely sorry for it and never intend to do it again, but still do it over and over - domestic abuse is often like this, though it's also often false apologies).		In short: Forgiveness is almost always a good thing... but forgive. Don't forget.		(You're also absolutely right that there are some total nutjobs speaking very loudly about this case in particular.

In fact, I'm sure the first thing you'd be saying is, "he's 14 years old, he should know what he's doing is wrong." A 14-year-old is closer to 16 than s/he is to 10 years old.  It's not hard to imagine he knew what he was doing was wrong.  The fact that he did it to several children also shows that his behavior was pre-meditated.		Sexual predation is a crime, not a "misdeed."  To characterize it as such allows perpetrators to escape full punishment for their actions.  At best, the predator gets scared and stops.  Odds are, however, that they'll continue their behavior and only become better at hiding it, which usually includes threats of violence or public humiliation of his/her victims.

So many times, after someone was already caught, and we were working with the child through the court, then the family would be chomping at the bit for every member to come tell me about how this person was terrible, a junkie, a pervert, etc. How they deserve everything. Then we'd get to the question, "So, you suspected/knew that abuse/neglect/molestation was occurring? Did you ever make a report?" Then you'd get their sob story about not wanting to upset an aging grandparent by reporting their kid, not wanting to upset the family, what would the church think, not knowing 100%, blah, blah, blah. I'd never give them an ounce of relief from their own culpability. 		With the Duggars, it's just showing how large-scale this same effect is with all of these people who have somehow invested in this t.v. family always being shown in good light to prop up their own example of Christianity, and it's disgusting. I think it also highlights how girls are viewed. I can only imagine the terror/violation of realizing your own brother is touching you like that. Then telling your family and basically in no small way being shown that the eldest son is more important than four daughters. That, in general, the Christian public defending them views molesting girls as something I guess we just have to live with and forgive for the sake of the boys. No wonder today they'll say on t.v. that they forgive him, now that their complete lack of worth outside of a commodity to be used sexually and for breeding is fully ingrained. To point, I imagine that back when first discovered in his teen years, and today, he would have been judged far more harshly if he'd touched four brothers' and another boy's genitals instead of just molesting the girls.

{"body":"I can tell you that religious sexual repression definitely played a part in messing me up.  As a teenager and through most of my twenties I was so scared of the temptation of sex that I thought the only way to stay "pure" was to avoid any situation that might lead me astray.  To me that meant ignoring any girl that wasn't a "good Christian".  		My church's group of teenagers was a popularity contest and I was one of the few kids that didn't go to the same private school as everyone else.  Combined with being the awkward nerdy kid with anxiety issues, I was essentially locked out of that clique.  I passed on several girls that I thought were awesome but unfortunately were either not Christian, or not the level of Christian I thought I needed.  Fast forward to me at 27 becoming an atheist and never having been on a single date from my self-imposed isolation.		Now I'm 35 and loaded down with anxiety, insecurity, and depression at having never been in a relationship or on a date.  At this point I don't even know where, or how,  to start.  I can't even think about talking to a woman I'm attracted to without waves of anxiety and panic attacks.  It's kind of pathetic and extremely depressing for me.		So yeah, sexual repression can screw with your head.		tl;dr	I grew up so terrified of sex that I willingly passed on every opportunity to even just go out with a non-Christian.  Now I'm 35 and unable to form any kind of relationship because of extreme mental hang-ups.","depth":4,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AbsenceVSThinAir","name":"t1_crqzzm7","parent_id":"t1_crqyq6r","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433098698,"created_utc":1433095098}

{"body":"It is meant to force the state to file charges in a timely fashion. It prevents them from constantly harassing someone while they fish for more evidence to convict them. It's also works in practice because as time passes evidence can change. For example eye witness testimony becomes more questionable since human memory is a very pliable thing. 		Take for example the ever popular reddit topic of false rape charges. Say you date a girl and have consensual sex. Then after a messy break up she cries rape. There is a lack evidence so no charges are filed. Note since no charges were filed jeopardy wasn't attached so you could still be charged at any time. For the sake of argument let's assume you have some evidence of your own to prove your side, texts or something. After a couple years you think it's over and done and are happy living your life. But she is still out to get you. I new hard on rape DA gets hired and she goes to tell her story again. This time he thinks it's worth filling and you get hit with a rape charge. Since so much time has passed you no longer have your evidence. You get convicted and sent to jail. None of this could have happened with a statute of limitations. 		This could go for anything. Someone loaned you money and you paid them back. You made sure keep records of the payments. 10 years later they sue you for nonpayment. You long ago threw away the records thinking it was long done. Without a statute of limitations you could very well lose that case and end up paying the money back twice. 		All the rules of due process exist to protect the innocent.

{"body":"I've been looking for a clean copy of the original police report that InTouch received.  You can google it yourself - joshduggar+police+report.  It's difficult to find now with all the other news stories burying the original document.		What you can see in the original is that Josh molested 5 girls.  One was a friend of the family's.  The other 4 were his sisters.  The police in the report said that the sister closest in age to Josh was not abused.  That would be Jana who was 12 at the time.  The four other sisters would have been 11, 10, 9 and 5 at the time.  Those were the only sisters Josh could have abused, as the others weren't born yet.		It's not normal to be attracted to the siblings one grows up with at all.  It's called The Westermarck Effect - 		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect		That Josh would molest his own sisters speaks of how damaging his childhood environment was and how little his parents were truly involved with their children.  It takes an awful lot of repression and lack of alternatives to molest one's own sisters.  Since even looking at a girl in public was unpure in the Duggar home (the parents would yell "Nike!" to indicate their sons should look at their shoes if an immodest woman was in the area), and masturbation is considered an ultimate sin (plus it gives you cancer according to the Duggars) is it any wonder such an environment would produce abuse?  Especially when it is taught that men have dominion over all women and Josh's parents were constantly showing off their "healthy" married sexuality through sexual joking, touching and lots and lots of babies?  All the kids would attend Michelle's ultrasound appointments.  The parents would kiss and front hug (all other hugging were side hugs) to show their kids what great affection was in store for them from a perfect Christian marriage.		The household was completely centered around the mother's uterus and the birth of children.  Having a TV show whose major purpose was to show how many kids the mother could shoot out simply can't be healthy for the rest of the kids who were extremely neglected.  They either learned to focus on children themselves or they became sexless robots as a defense (Jana and JD.)  That there aren't more sibling shenanigans in that house is doubtful.

{"body":"Thank you again for your effort.		I'm very much inclined to agree that the way they were raised, in extreme sexual repression (at least as I would see it), was likely a strong contributing factor to this situation.		I was able to find two places that hosted the police report (I'm actually quite good at searching in-depth in Google since understanding Google's algorithm is part of my job).  However, both versions of the police report is redacted to take out the ages of the victims.  Here are the two that I found: http://cdn-media.extratv.com/2015/05/21/duggardocs.pdf and http://imgur.com/a/zqPMi#0.  The ages are certainly known by the police, but I'm not sure how the ages are known by the public.  This concerns me, as the ages could be speculation by the public and not confirmed.		As an example, here's an article that assumes the age of 5 (it's the InTouch article you mentioned): http://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/josh-duggar-s-youngest-molestation-victim-may-have-been-as-young-as-5-years-old-59145.  All it seems to say is that the victims were "most likely" his younger sisters, and therefore "may have been as young as 5 years old".  I'm concerned by this kind of language in a news publication, and I think it could be generally taken as assumed fact that his youngest victim *was* 5 years old.		I did read through the report, but it's hard to really comprehend it with the level of redaction in the report.  The conclusions seem to be drawn from additional information outside the report, combined with the heavily redacted police report.  Perhaps the ages were redacted to protect the victims?  But, if other evidence can be used to identify the victims (though this evidence isn't in the redacted report itself), what's the point of that?  Why can't the police report publicly state the ages, just not the birth dates?		As a quick note, the Westermarck Effect you linked to is, at least according to the link, a hypothetical effect.  I'm not sure that it is a real effect.  I think it may be more related to upbringing and societal expectations, which could account for the appearance of this effect.  It may even be a brain chemistry thing, or a combination of all of the above.  All of that is also a hypothesis, and some real evidence would need to be provided on one side or the other.  Then again, Josh Duggar's upbringing was... questionable at best...		One thing to note, though, is the statute of limitations at the time of the investigation (seen at the bottom of the page here: http://imgur.com/a/zqPMi#31).  3 years.  That is way too short for this kind of offense.		Last note: At a moderate look into it, I think you're right in terms of the age of the youngest victim, I just wish this kind of evidence was more clear and more clearly stated in the mass media.  The age of his victims are hugely important in this case, and they don't appear to be generally known.  They absolutely should be.		Sorry for the long post.  This whole situation just bothers me very deeply, in more ways than one.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kuromatsuri","name":"t1_crriwjy","parent_id":"t1_crrh6vm","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433134929,"created_utc":1433131329}
{"body":"The report is redacted poorly which is why people are able to surmise which sisters were abused.  Josh only had 5 sisters then.  The oldest wasn't abused (as it says in the report) so that leaves the younger 4.  Given that the sisters' birth dates are common knowledge (even posted by their parents), we can calculate their ages at the time of this reported abuse.  The news seems to be treating the girls very gently at this point and reporting as little personal information as possible.  That's unusually respectful.  There are many internet forums where you can find the information, Duggars Without Pity, Free Jinger, The Defamer, are a few.		Yes, it's a horrible situation		The evidence for the Westmarck Effect is pretty wide ranging.  The initial data was collated from Kibbutzes in Israel and Chinese traditional homes.  It showed that unrelated children who were raised together from early childhood resist marriage and sex.  In fact, in China it was the habit for baby girls to be sent to live with their intended's family and raised with their baby fiancee. This led to disastrous relationships where couples would prefer suicide to sex.  In the Kibbutzes, children were raised in communal peer groups and no children from the same Kibbutzes married except if they did not know each other as young children.  This flies in the face of the original intentions of the Kibbutzes which were to be self sustaining, long term, communities of individuals born and raised there.		From what I've read, there is lots of evidence for the Westermarck Effect.  Women are less attracted to men who resemble their brothers.  Some studies seem to prove that there are olfactory repulsions for bodily odors similar to one's siblings.  		There is an opposite effect called Genetic Attraction where immediate family members (brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers) who are not raised together but meet later in life develop sexual attractions.  I read an article by a woman who developed this for the son she gave up for adoption and later met.  It's a fascinating phenomenon.

{"body":"I mean, I agree that of course most Republicans, and most Christians, don't agree with people like Huckabee on this.  I think the opinion that Duggar needs to be in prison for this along with his parents for covering it up is probably a bipartisan view.		Having said that, I really don't think that liberals would view it differently if he was an atheist Democrat.  Sure, some would, but it'd be in the same numbers as what you're seeing on the Christian Republican side here.		Lena Dunham keeps getting brought up, and I agree that she shouldn't get a pass either.  But outside of a few of the people in this thread, I haven't seen that many people argue otherwise in her situation.		I think the problem is that, while "molestation is ok" isn't a Christian thing, it's hard not to argue that the Duggars' specific brand of Christianity helped lead to this, considering that they've basically taught their girls that things like this are their fault, the "quiverfull" movement, etc.		Also, the reason that statements like Huckabee's are problematic is because he basically also added into it the "He was a teenager then.  Kids, amirite?" angle, which I think downplays the severity of what happened.  Especially since if you read the whole statement it doesn't sound like he *does* want him punished.  Of course, it's also kind of an open secret in Arkansas that one of Huckabee's sons brutally killed a neighborhood dog, and nothing ever happened because of who his dad was.  So that's not surprising.		Though even that isn't because Huckabee is a Christian or a conservative, but rather because he's a huge asshole.		It's also to be noted that many of Huckabee's facebook followers also gave him some pretty strong backlash over his statements on this issue, with many saying he had lost their vote.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheDude415","name":"t1_crrmtfe","parent_id":"t1_crrkkmy","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433145953,"created_utc":1433142353}

Another thing to keep in mind is that the Duggars 'sexual education' is designed to stunt any sort of sexual maturity (mentally.)  Thinking sexual thoughts is considered 'impure' and 'sinful.'
