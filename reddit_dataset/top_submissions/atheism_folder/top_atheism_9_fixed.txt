Third of all, the passage you reference was in a time of war. In war it was pretty militarily expedient, especially back then, to wipe out all of your enemies so that their children won't come get revenge on you. In fact, that was pretty normal practice back then. Is it fucked up? Yes, but it was war in pre-roman times. In that context, it's pretty par for the course.

{"body":"> People assume that the church is going to be different--and most likely better--than a regular day care center.		I think different people assume different things. If you are member of a small, community oriented church with membership made of only a few families and they start offering daycare for members, you are going to consider that to be a different situation than would you consider a generic daycare business. It'd be more akin to having a family friend or relative watch your kids, than an employee. Hell, the fact that it's a church group is irrelevant, you could substitute in a humanist study group and it would be the same situation. It's not a case of people assuming churches are superior at watching kids, it's acknowledging that a close community group differs in substance from a commercial business ran by strangers. Historically, the community groups that people belonged to were churches. That's not a discriminatory statement, it's acknowledging that people may not want the same oversight for their church as they do for random businesses ran by strangers. 		If you are just looking for a cheap daycare and the big Lutheran church near your house happens to run a daycare, you're going to assume that it's basically the same situation as the generic daycare business across town. It's a business that happens to be owned by a church, not a close community that you are part of.  Legally, that's a situation where the church should be treated as any other business when it comes to inspections and what not. Most states have laws to acknowledge this and the commercial side of things is legally separate from the church side of things. So the church can still have VBS and religious day camps and what not for members without falling under the day care laws, but then their actual daycare is inspected and treated like a business. 		The fact that your mom worked for a daycare business owned by a church doesn't change the fact that historically church daycares were more like my earlier example. 		I'm not saying there shouldn't be laws, or that the existing laws didn't have flaws. If anything, from what I've seen, the state in general didn't have/enforce daycare regulations. The possible church exemptions weren't the root cause, the lack of any oversight in the whole daycare realm was the problem.","depth":5,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Suppafly","name":"t1_cmxyd6r","parent_id":"t1_cmxxfv9","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1418852159,"created_utc":1418852159}

That time would be spent teaching stuff about God and Jesus and whatnot -- I understand that you think all that stuff is "complete bullshit."  That's fine.  They also corralled us in to first Friday mass once a month.  Teachers might mention God sometimes in other contexts, but it was very rare.  Our school was named after a Saint, etc.		The other 5 hours were spent teaching, well, everything else.  Math, English, history, science (including evolution -- we're down with evolution with the caveat that God lit the spark which started the fire).  I'm obviously biased, but I truly believe I got a great education; my mom's principal reason for insisting that I go to private school was that you get a better education there than you do at the tragically underfunded public schools in my area.  I went to the state college, I went to law school, passed the bar, got a job, etc.  I turned out okay.		This loops us back to your point.  Yes, we penalize parents for not sending their kids to school.  You seem to be suggesting that sending kids to religious schools is essentially the same thing; if we penalize parents for not sending their kids to any school, then we ought to similarly penalize them for sending their kids to "schools which teach complete bullshit."  They may, for an hour.  But then they teach all the good stuff, and they often do a better job of it than the secular public schools (if for no other reason than they have more resources; the tuition ain't cheap).

Hate to say it, but this states practice of placing strip malls at random intersections in the middle of nowhere does not qualify as exponential urbanization. The only truly urbanized place in Virginia outside of Richmond and Alexandria is a 2 mile square section of downtown Newport News and downtown Chesapeake could qualify. Everywhere else is strip malls with houses behind them. Virginia is more appropriately described as suburbanized. There is not a city government in the state that is willing to take the steps to become true urban centers and Hampton Roads itself has been actively fighting it for more than 90 years. We're the military capitol of the world, and yet a good 3/4ths of our residents have to drive several miles or more to get to a grocery store. Even Virginia Beach, which could be a booming nice city, is nothing more than strip malls, crappy restaurants, and mediocre bars for the most part.

Can you take a 6 month vacation while you sit on a waiting list for that licensed daycare? Last I knew that was the average wait in Newport News, though I'll admit my information is a few years out of date.		Mostly people look for the one person they trust the most and that person becomes a daycare center whether she likes or not. Going street rate is about $10 a day per child and those who know how apply for the subsidy on top of that. Even subsidized no daycare center can beat that rate, and that is why this law will fail. Those who have obtained only a general business license will close because they'll be the first targeted (and being "in home" they cannot possibly pass an inspection), and the rest will just stop applying for the subsidy. Without a direct subsidy to the parent of the child who needs daycare this will hurt more children than save.
