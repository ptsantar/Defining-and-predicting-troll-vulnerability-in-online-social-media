{"body":"This can be taken further, though. This is funny actually. I'm thinking about this from my deterministic perspective, which doesn't entirely seem necessary, but it's a fitting though. Everyone knows Reddit is a very liberal site, in general, so the fact that you presumably come here often implies you probably appreciate that side of things. If you disagree, you would be less likely to see the site in a pleasant light, so you'd be less inclined to allow the hivemind to pummel you with its liberalism.		Now, with Facebook, I've heard a while back that the best way to see someone's interests on the internet isn't to just scan their searches or whatever, it's to scan their close friends. So your friends on Facebook probably have similar beliefs as you. More importantly, and I feel like this *has* to be obvious, Facebook has been extremely analytical about who you talk to. Sure, you'll see those huge "We bought a house," "I graduated," "We're getting married," "We're having a baby" posts. The ones where *any* friend who says it will end up with 80+ likes. Otherwise, it obviously restricts my visible posts to friends I actually interact with. So I've got tons of liberal pages liked, but I also see posts from thoughtful and liberal friends and acquaintances because I often respond to their posts. I saw a post from a guy a went to school with that led me to start up an argument. One of those ignorant anti-fast food employee posts. I argued on that one post a bit, then I ended up seeing a bunch more posts from him over the next couple weeks or so. So even though I don't purposely confine myself to different liberal locations a lot of the time, I have that enforced simply by the algorithms in place on the site.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AKnightAlone","name":"t1_crt69hc","parent_id":"t1_crt0w5x","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1433269028,"created_utc":1433265428}

When people take something as a part of their identity, they defend it to the death, because any attack on that idea is an attack on themselves.
