{"body":"Sorry for the late reply. I had work. 		"This is not the same thing as saying you aren't emotionally invested. You do have expectations otherwise you wouldn't be surprised by the way I was acting."		True this is not the same thing, but I can notice a comment and have something to add to the discussion. This has nothing to do with my expectations of your behavior. I can't have any expectations of your behavior when I have no idea who you are or how you are likely to act. Also, I never actually labeled anything as extreme...		"I'd like to see the studies you find pertain to this situation."	Yes I know about wikipedia and all that jazz but the article does provide a good overview. The following citation is from the relevant portion of the wiki article. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement		Harter, J. K. (2002). C. L. Keyes, ed. Well-Being in the Workplace and its Relationship to Business Outcomes: A Review of the Gallup Studies. Washington D.C.: American Psychological Association.		This study doesn't necessarily help my point but it's an interesting take on the differences with the procedural measurements between positive and negative reinforcement.		http://www.eahb.org/1/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Critchfield-Magoon.pdf		Skinners research on operant conditioning has been pretty famous as well so I figure I should post the citation for that as well. He did the experiments with rats. He's mostly famous for creating a set of principles to help explain operant conditioning. Which is what I believe the last source was essentially expanding on.		Skinner, B. F. (1938). The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis. New York: Appleton-Century.		Here is a simplistic overview describing many of the distinctions commonly misunderstood with operant behavior. Not a study, but the author has a Phd and does a pretty good job describing things in somewhat laymans terms.		http://sccpsy101.com/home/chapter-4/section-17/		Either way the problem with studying operant conditioning exists in the varied stimuli that we can't easily measure. However, the general consensus is that while negative reinforcement is beneficial in the short term, the effects are shortlived. Positive reinforcement has shown a much longer lasting effect, but the reinforcement has to be specific and timed correctly. Either way, most teachers subscribe to the belief that with shaping learning negative reinforcement is best administered in the short term with positive reinforcement throughout the learning of a behavior. Negative reinforcement over time can produce some adverse effects, like aggression. 		This was fun.

{"body":"Any stories that did go round which may have had a basis in historical fact would quickly have become compounded with theology.		Greek culture was an oral one as you say. Hence the *Iliad*, about the historic siege of Ilium in Troy, has all kinds of Gods on both sides who affect the war, and even engage in battle. The space between the historical event and when we think the *Iliad* was written down is over four hundred years. In that time, the oral culture added all kinds of entertaining details.		I would say these stories were to teach life lessons. They perpetuated good values - bravery, loyalty to one's city, loyalty to family, pity, hospitality. Often these went hand in hand with religion too. For example, Zeus demanded you be hospitable to your guests.		Christianity and the Abrahamic religions may have a more polarised and binary view of morality, but at their cores they are strong, entertaining stories.

{"body":"There are these Church of England schools in Britain, probably the schools he attended, that pride themselves on intelligent debate. They are the 'old boys club' style schools. I don't really know how to describe them but I was lucky enough to go to one of these, a mixed-sex school (which was all boys from ages 11-16 and had a mixed-sex upper sixth), as a teenage girl when I was studying towards my A-Levels. It was a grammar school that I attended from 16-18, it had the best philosophy classes that would arm you for life with great arguments and a wider view on the world. It was considered cool to be clever and although the school was Church of England you were shaped to make your own decisions in life without a god. I also feel that religious education classes in the UK (not sure if they are still offered?), give young people a solid way to develop critical thinking and understanding of all religions and ethical believes in the world. 		So basically get yourself enrolled in a philosophy class or even religious education classes (there are probably more examples I'm sure). You'll be forced to debate subjects and give your pros and cons. You'll also be forced to disagree with others and form your own arguments this would hopefully help you develop your vocabulary. Don't forget to ready many books, not Tom Clancy - but something old with lots of social undertones, possibly Chaucer. An advanced literature class may be a good investment, depending on the texts you study.

{"body":"One thing that I've found helps enormously is writing. When you write about something, you have to spend time condensing and refining your ideas so that they are simply expressed. When you write it allows you all the time you need to think of precisely the right words that you want to use to explain your ideas. You'll then find when you talk to someone about what you wrote about, you'll be a lot better at communicating what you want to say because you have already essentially 'rehearsed' it. I'm not a great speaker by any measure, but I do spend a lot of time writing about topics that interest me and sometimes I've been amazed at how well I've been able to communicate something because I've written about it.		In my opinion, a very worthwhile subject to look into on this point is classical rhetoric. Rhetoric is the art of persuasion. Two of my favourite speakers include Christopher Hitchens and Stephen Fry, and both of them share this quality of being amazingly persuasive. Every word you listen to you almost can't help think, well 'of course'. They are both extremely persuasive, and probably both studied rhetoric. Rhetoric gives you pretty much all the angles you can use in speaking that will make your argument *feel* persuasive. Obviously it needs to do more than just feel persuasive, it ought to be logically sound, but human beings often need more than just logic used against them in order to have their mind changed - something anyone in /r/atheism can understand.

Those people make it look bad, but if you actually take a step back and look at what the Bible says, it basically says that God loves you and is desperately trying to get you to choose door number 1... it's like he's sitting here extending his hand saying "please come on!" but if you turn around and choose door #2, he can't help you anymore because you didnt want him in the first place.

Just know that I'm not damning you, or judging you, I just believe what the Bible says and I think life is beautiful when I know that a loving God is constantly trying to get our attention and is always fighting for you, not against you, that goes for both Atheists and Christians.

{"body":"the separate Lilith/Eve creations are a myth if that's what you're arguing. it is nowhere in the Bible. read Genesis 5:2 if you're confused about 1:27.			I've heard the argument that the whole book of Genesis could be allegorical just based on the outrageous nature of the stories, but I still do believe it to be truth and the word that God wanted us to receive. The rest of the old testament books are also all accounts with historical and geographical accuracy so i believe them to be just as true as the new testament.			I believe God is ultimately Kind, but severe(Romans 11). I believe he sees things from a higher perspective and his ways are different than our ways (Isaiah 55). I dont think we can fully understand his nature or who/what/how he is what He is. But the atrocities that we see happened in Canaan, Jericho, Palestine, etc... I believe were justified by a God of love who was protecting his people and reacted the same way our governments did protecting us from Nazi germany during WWII, that they were not ethnically motivated killings but rather punishing evil people who were threatening good people. These were brutal, aggressive people who engaged in bestiality, incest, child sacrifice, rape, etc, and these were people who knew of the God of Israel and what laws He expected mankind to follow. The destruction of these places was directed towards their false religions and evil religious practices, and they had been warned and told to repent of their evil ways for more than 400 years! These people were aware of God's power and they were fearful of his judgement, but chose to ignore his warnings. I also believe he sent a messiah into the world to not only save the Israelites but also Israels enemies, proving that he is a loving God to all of mankind.			You definitely make some good points. I was where you are once asking the same questions, and it took me awhile to come to this conclusion. Where I am in life, it is hard for me to imagine why we are here, what our purpose is, and what life is, consciousness, time, other dimensions, etc, without pointing to something more, something greater than ourselves. I work my job, enjoy my family/friends, hobbies, yet I am human and am never satisfied. There are a few simple truths in life that a guy 2000 years ago taught about.... love, peace, forgiveness, joy.... and pursuing these truths have always lead to us finding them, that is God's promise, that the Bible holds these truths - that is how you can find them - and if we seek after these qualities that actually matter, we will receive them. These are the qualities that echo into eternity. How else can those be the only things that give us true happiness and satisfaction? For thousands of years, this has never ever changed. There is more substance in what Jesus taught, than in any amount of money, success, or power. So why do we spend all of our days chasing money, success, and power, instead of what is truly good for us? If he was a madman or a false prophet or a fake historical figure, how do his words continue to shake people and change the world for the better after 2k years? Because they must be truth! There is plenty of "religion" that has done the opposite (Crusades, WBC, etc..) but I dont really consider myself religious, I think religion is man-made, not God-influenced, and it is how evil people fucked up & twisted what Jesus actually taught.

When Cain is banished for killing Abel he says will be covered from God and the other people will kill him so God puts a mark on him to protect him, Cain leaves, goes to Nod and gets married.

God knew exactly where they were in the Garden, he was just calling out to them for whatever reason.

Satan used a real serpent to deceive Eve, he entered the serpent like the demons did to the swine in Mark 5. Revelation 19 & 20 refers to Satan as the  ???serpent of old??? or ???great dragon???.

{"body":"Thanks for discussing it with me, nice to see rational discussion.		Most scholars believe that Genesis is simply two books that were combined at some point point in history leading to confusion. As the bible is really the single source of Gods commands, it seems pretty poor work for a God.		As far as Adam's Children go, if he had all these offspring and descendants why are they not living in the Garden, Cain was the first banished from God's sight.		As far as the incest goes, Leviticus 18.6 is clear "No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD", God does not like incest apparently and if we are descendants of Adam and Eve we know that there are nasty birth defects associated with that. Unless God had the power to change that at some point, it was always be an issue,		In Job God makes it clear that a) he has no idea what Satan is doing and b) Satan has free access to Heaven, 		???One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. The LORD said to Satan, ???Where have you come from???? Satan answered the LORD, ???From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it?????? (Job 1:6-7)		It's pretty poor management to let an asshole like Satan just wander around where ever he wants (although he only killed 10 people with the permission of God, God murdered millions, it might be safer with Satan).		All up, the early part of the bible, the foundation for the entire Christian, Jewish and Islamic faith is very, very poor work.		If I was God and loved my creation I would have set very, very clear rules and expectations in 10 foot high burning letters on a mountain so everyone can understand them and follow the rules.		I am an agnostic (nobody has scientific evidence either way) but I believe firmly you should be well armed to confront both sides, I probably know the bible better than most Christians and have learned if you ever want to turn someone from the faith, get them to read the entire bible. It's a horror story of a murdering rampaging God who hangs his chosen people out to dry over and over and over again, he kills on a whim and punishes excessively. Judaism would have died out if they had not changed God into a loving peaceful one in the new testament,  the God of the old and new testaments are not even remotely the same, one is a maniac the other is peaceful.

{"body":"Of course man, always interesting hearing how other people see things.			The most recent scholars believe Genesis is either 8 or 11 different books. These accounts couldnt have been mixed or confused, because they are chronological, so they all tell completely different stories. You wont get confused about the creation account which was the first Genesis account vs. the story of Noah building the ark which was the 4th Genesis account. I think the Bible is an incredible work of God seeing how it has remained a historically and geographically accurate account for thousands of years (since the beginning of time if you take it literally).			Genesis 3:23 - "So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken." ...God kicked Adam & Eve out after they sinned. And then in verse 24 he set up an Angel to guard the entrance, so nobody could get in.			Incest was outlawed in Leviticus 18:6. Before that, Adam and Eve were the only 2 people God created, so it was necessary for their sons/daughters to marry and reproduce with each other to advance humanity. You're right that reproduction between closely related individuals has a much higher risk of causing genetic abnormalities, but In the early days of humanity, this was not a risk due to the fact that the human genetic code was relatively free of defects. Adam and Eve were created with a perfect genetic code, but the one that the people had by the time of Leviticus had been polluted enough that close intermarriage wasn't safe anymore. I dont think God makes rules just to set up rules, he makes rules to protect us. At that point in time, he was just setting up a boundary so they didnt keep going down that path and unknowingly fuck up their kids. 			God asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" just like he asked Adam, "Where are you?" in the garden, and just like he asked Cain "Where is your brother?" when he already knew the answer. He was calling him out, getting him to speak for himself, for whatever reason. If you read the rest of Job, God told Satan to go after Job, he gave Satan permission on everything he did to Job. Satan was in full submission to God during that whole story. God is obviously in charge the entire time and proves to have power over Satan. If that is the case, I dont see how an all powerful God needs to be worried about "poor management" when he is ultimately in control the entire time. He lets Satan roam around the earth, but he doesnt let him out of his sight, he is still in control.			God murdered people. Did he not also give them life? Is it technically his right to take it? You can blame God for "murder" of someone who died of cancer, or in a car wreck, or in their sleep, etc, because he allowed it to happen. What difference is it if God struck them down with lightning or sent in an army to kill them at night or if they died from the flu? We are not entitled to life, it is a gift. I think there is a bigger picture. John 18:36 - "Jesus said, ???My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.??? If we were created for this world, why cant we be satisfied by anything in it? We must be created for another world. Maybe this life is just a test. A test to see where our allegiance lies and we are given the choice to choose. I think the Bible is a completely rational collection of Books with accuracy and proof that lines up and points to truth for those that open their minds and seek it out.			"If I was God and loved my creation"... how do you know what it would like to be a God with an entire creation of things? Do you know why he set this up the way he did? Nobody knows, but there is obviously a purpose to the way he did things, that we cant fully comprehend, yet. He says in the end he will reveal everything to us, but there are simply things we cannot understand or things we are just not ready to know. I mean, what was the point in creating in the first place? Was God just bored, wanting some entertainment and company besides his angels? Or maybe Lucifer challenged God, maybe Lucifer claimed he was the one worthy of worship, so maybe God created earth and said "OK, here is mankind, a race with complete free will, so their decision to follow me or to follow you will decide who is worthy of worship, 50/50." Maybe he then set up His way of intervening with humanity (through Scripture) to point us towards Him. Maybe, on the other hand, to be fair he allows Satan to intervene with humanity (through physical power) to get people to worship himself instead. I'm not saying that this is definitely how things work, all I'm saying is we dont know how things work, but he has given us hints and he has made himself known to us and I am trusting that he has his shit figured out and I'm not going to wonder his motives, because I dont understand the big picture like He does.			Being agnostic, you say we do not have enough evidence, but are you willing to look at all the evidence? Are you willing to look at evidence for God's existence, instead of only seeking evidence against God's existence? 			Multiple times in the Old testament, God is described as a ???compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.??? Likewise, in the New Testament, it says, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth."				He treats his people in the Old testament like a loving father would treat his child. If your young kid thought it was fun to run away to buy a candy bar, and they ran all the way to a store in a dangerous part of town where he could be kidnapped or hurt, you would discipline him so they would know not to do that again. You are disciplining them to keep them out of harm's way. God disciplined his people when they were in the wrong, and forgave them when they repented and asked for forgiveness. Hebrews 12:6 says ???the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son." God is righteous, and he must judge sin, that is the rule of this game we are playing. I see a loving, compassionate, merciful God, who is desperately trying to get his people to turn back to him. Creation was NOT full of pain/disease/cruelty! When God created everything, he said "it was good" it was perfect. All that bad shit came about when we sinned, it wasnt what God wanted for us, it is what we chose! The entire Old Testament is about a God who for years works to set up a way for us to escape all this shit we got ourselves into, he has an agenda to SAVE US but Satan kept corrupting people and getting in the way and those people had to die in order for God to move forward with the plan of salvation. He was ultimately doing things so eventually we can all be saved & redeemed and death doesnt have to be the end of shit for us. When he sent his own son to die in our place, that is love. The theme of the Bible is love by sacrifice. Jesus died so that the curse Adam brought upon all of us doesnt have to apply to us anymore. That is compassion, that is love, and I think it is a beautiful thing.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"r3alc00l","name":"t1_cobrpnt","parent_id":"t1_cobf3ho","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1423114926,"created_utc":1423114926}

Revelation 20.			> most of which are ignored by Christians totally even though Jesus said the old rules were still in force			This is also not true. Jeremiah 31 prophesied: ???The days are coming,??? declares the Lord, ???when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors... this is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,??? declares the Lord.

I think you have mis-read or misunderstood most of the Bible and that is causing you to question the overall nature of God.

I dont think we can blame God for allowing it. He could have made us all robots, but He didnt. I guess that's where we differ, who we fundamentally blame. Last year I guess I was agnostic, like you, and seeking answers (I now dont believe it's possible to be agnostic, you can't believe in unbelief, if that makes sense.) So I read Richard Dawkin's famous atheist book called The God Delusion and I read Tim Keller's book called The Reason for God, which explains the God of the Bible. The 2nd book painted a beautiful picture of the world and put so much beauty in life. I guess I just came to a point where I didnt want to believe that all we are is just some evolved form of organic matter with no purpose. I didnt want to live my life believing that. I wanted to believe in something greater, that there is an answer out there, so I opened my mind to that possibility and now I really think this makes sense. I see the beauty and purpose in life and to me - it's an incredible thing to experience life that way.			As a former agnostic, I challenge you to seek out answers, because there are definitely answers out there. Answers to questions like What is consciousness and how is it possible? How is life possible? Who was Jesus? How do you explain what he said and did? etc, etc... PM me if you want and I'll send you the Tim Keller book, I think it's a fantastic view on the world we live in and really cleared things up big time for me. Otherwise, man, I'm praying for you to have joy & peace, I hope that doesnt offend you, but I think prayer is a powerful thing, it's what I do!			Luke 10 Jesus said ???Love the Lord your God... and your neighbor as yourself... do this, and you will live.???

So we captured all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city.

The Jews were God's chosen people to communicate his law to the rest of the world, they preserved His Word for mankind, and Jesus was sent as the messiah to fulfill their law and as the savior for the rest of humanity. That is why he first ministered to the Jews, so that they could see/hear/understand and go out and "make disciples of all nations" Matthew 28:19.

Jesus fulfilled the law.

Matthew 5:18 simply means that all prophecy will come to pass... read the whole chapter, dont just focus on a single verse and try to interpret what it means.

{"body":"Actually isn't the major flaw with the Satan argument that Satan himself is God's creation? If God is both omniscient and omnipotent, then you must consider that God created the angels. Lucifer the fallen angel rebelled against God. He saw God as a tyrant. Well God would have known exactly what creating him would do. He would know exactly what Lucifer would be like, how he would feel, and what he would do. And if he's omnipotent then he should be able to destroy Lucifer just as easily. But apparently he hasn't and is content to let him run free and be the source of all evil.		If he didn't know what Lucifer would be then he's not omniscient. If he can't stop Lucifer then he's not omniscient. If he's neither omniscient nor omnipotent then he is not Godly. If he's both then he's wicked.		This is why you have the cop out answer "God moves in mysterious ways." It's there because you can't reconcile these points logically.		Milton's 'Paradise Lost' has a beautiful portrayal of Lucifer. Lucifer as a character is much more inspiring, and human, and flawed, and understandable than God. God is completely unrelatable. 		Some of the gems attributable to Lucifer from Paradise Lost:		???Better to reign in Hell, than to serve in Heaven.???	-Basically one of Christopher Hitchen's main objections to monotheism. The idea that if it was true, it would mean the ruin of human dignity. It's total negation. That we are nothing more than slaves, despicable wretches that are created sick and commanded to be well, and in failing to do so we are condemned, hopelessly with no chance of retaliation or defense. We are doomed.		???Who overcomes	By force, hath overcome but half his foe.??? 	Again on that point, that God has only 'defeated' Lucifer to the extent of his banishment. His mind and spirit are indomitable and he'll never accept tyranny.		Questioning the circumstances of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden:	???Knowledge forbidden?	Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord	Envy them that? Can it be a sin to know?	Can it be death???? 	He detests the principle that we creatures (humans) should be mindless - the exact thing religion asks us to be. It insists we should surrender our minds, discard what we already know, give up the one thing that elevates us above animals, the best thing we have, in order to be unquestioning and faithful to God. 		The Paradise Lost Lucifer is an amazing literary figure and is so sympathetic. He gives epic speeches and will win you over. Definitely the most difficult book I've ever read.

{"body":"What are you talking about? If Ireland was like that, and it's not the 1950s, so it isn't, then that would absolutely not be the reason they're like that. 	The reason Ireland was ever like that in the  first place was BECAUSE of the UK. If you knew anything about why Ireland was so staunchly catholic in the first place then you'd know it was because nobody was going to let a bunch of murderous foreigners dictate Irish life at every single level. Said foreigners tried to destroy every aspect of Irish culture over centuries and as soon as the church of england was invented for a fat king's selfish reasons they tried to eradicate Catholicism too in Ireland as well as in the UK. It was made illegal to practice it at anytime or anywhere so people had to do it in secret. It was also illegal for Irish people to learn, believe it or not, and it also had to be done in secret. It was oppression on a huge scale because unlike other countries raped by the empire, Ireland was extremely hard to keep control of. So what they did, as was the "justification" of the first violent invasion by people from britian, was create lies and stereotypes which still survive today. This way they wouldn't have to feel so bad about the atrocities. Sound familiar? 		Now as soon as Ireland regained the freedom to live there was a huge resurgence of Irish language and culture and because religion was of the things people weren't allowed to express, the catholic church became an unfortunate powerhouse and then controlled virtually everything. But that was a very long time ago and the church doesn't control a thing anymore. The only people they still have any sway with are old people raised in that era and those few that genuinely believe. 		The people you think that are so anti religion because of Ireland know that Ireland isn't like that and are people who have formed their own independent, educated opinions, just like the people in Ireland do, But the stereotypes are apparently still alive and well and influencing those outsiders that are unable to do so themselves.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GiveUsAgooch","name":"t1_co5qcq9","parent_id":"t1_co5n3q8","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1422629234,"created_utc":1422629234}

{"body":"Non-Atheist Gnostic here. As in a follower of Gnosticism. I believe and my church teaches that the God who made this world was at best less than competent and at worst evil. It drives me nuts that when people discuss or debate god there is never deviation from the standard Abrahamic view. I am a theist who essentially believes that God can pretty much be all powerful, all good, or omnipresent BUT not all three. It might be one or none, but two at most.		It saddens me that in debates there is never really discussion of any God that differs greatly from that of well recognized faiths. I worry about anti-theism because I consider it directed partly at my church and I think its only because people have a specific conception of what God can be. 		We abhor faith and think the way to salvation is directed by a direct experience of God. There are some who understand it as pure metaphor and others who take it quite literally. We make no claim of exclusivity you will not be denied salvation for not joining us, and you are not guaranteed it by joining.  		We believe what was salvific about Christ was his message of love and the rituals he instructed his disciples in and his death on the cross was nothing more than a tragedy that occurred because of the chaotic nature of the world. 		I agree almost 100% with Fry yet am a strong theist. I get scared when God gets put in a box because it encourages antitheism. 		We are not a charity but we are a group of like minded individuals that have formed a formal group for weekly discussion. Our clergy are self-supporting ie not salaried. We struggle to pay our rent, taxing churches would tax us out of existence. Ironically we have an affiliated secular society of mostly the same members which is funny because it would be able to survive and pass on our teachings, but we couldn't actively practice them. 		Really the biggest problem I see atheists having with our faith is "Turtles All the Way Down". God above God where does it end? Its a bit of a cliche but I feel I can confidently say to a large number of atheists that I don't believe in the same God you don't believe in.

Well, what does that say about your ethics?		(Not that all atheist think of the world as this horrible place.

{"body":"I think there's a lot of differences, there. First of all, human beings experience a certain biological urge to procreate, generally speaking.		More important, though, to my mind, is that humans are just that: humans. We're mortal. We're flawed (in the "nobody's perfect" sense, not in the "original sin" sense). All we can do is play the hand we're dealt. God, however, is the exact opposite. He is supposed to be perfect, and omniscient, and omnipotent. So when we see a child with bone cancer, all we can do is look on in dismay and think about how terribly unfair it is. God, if he exists, sees that and apparently just says "yup, that was a solid idea of mine."		And I resent your claim that expecting more of a divine being means that one is necessarily seeing life from a "glass-half-empty" point-of-view. I think that they are two completely unrelated, separate issues. I am an atheist, and I like to believe (and have been told) that I have a fairly optimistic outlook on life. I recognize that terrible things happen, but they are generally the exceptions for the average person, as opposed to the rule.		I brought three children into this world. Part of that decision was because while there exists some truly horrible things in this world, my children are unlikely to encounter the worst of them. And if they do, well, there's nothing to be done about that. Meanwhile, there is so much about life to appreciate, that the risk/reward trade-off is well worth it, in my opinion.		The key difference, however, between my experiences with the evils of this world and God's.... is that God **created** those evils and does nothing about them. Plus, he doesn't really have to live with them, either, adding insult to injury.		**That** is why I, personally, see a vast difference God creating a world like this, and humans (atheists) bringing new human beings into a world like this.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LucentPhoenix","name":"t1_co5ydin","parent_id":"t1_co5tsjb","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1422642933,"created_utc":1422642933}

Of course, the God is also all powerful. The eyeball eating parasites would have had to have been deliberate. That seems ridiculous, and, it actually would be. But logically, you can't say so in this instance, because the premise is that the God is all knowing, and you're just some human being.

So, if there *was* an all knowing God, and Stephen Fry *did* go to the gates and say that, God would have answered with an explanation, that Stephen Fry would have seen an understood the reasoning, if he had the mental capacity to do so.		But there is no God, so that would never happen. IF there WAS a God though, it would be all knowing, and would have deliberately created that bug, for some reason unknown to us.

Of course, so then the suffering itself was deliberate, and served some purpose of greater good. 		When you introduce an all knowing God, none of your definitions, of good or evil are good anymore. You are still telling me that God could have made a better world. But if an all knowing God, and an all Just God, made this world, then no. 		When you submit that God exists, then you must submit that it is all knowing, all good etc... That's what you're proposing. 		Yes, God is omnipotent, and omniscient, so everything is exactly as he intended. He is also all good, so what he intended was all good. 		You are a tiny little human that knows nothing, and you want to tell the omniscient omnipotent all good being, that you know better what good is. That makes no sense. 		If such a God did exist, then since he is amniscient omnipotent, intended the world exactly as it is, and all good, then he would have to have a perfectly reasonable explanation why it was in fact all good to do it as he did. He did not *have* to for some end. He deliberately intended it that way. 		How can that be possible? idk. Do I think that there is a way I could figure out how that could make any sense? No.		But me not finding a solution, does not mean a solution does not exist. That's not how logic works. 		If you want to hold your position from a logically correct standpoint, then you need to build a logical argument why it is **impossible** for there to be any sort of circumstances where suffering of people can not be good.

A common example is to ask if this omnipotent being could create a stone so heavy that He could not lift it. The response to that yes/no question is irrelevant, since either answer proves omnipotence is logically impossible.		- Once we move past the trite rebuttal of "suffering is good if god causes it" the bottom falls out of the rest of your argument.

Is not an argument that proves that it cannot.		It is self-contradictory. An **omnipotent** being can - by definition remember - do anything. Creating a world without suffering is an action contained within the subset of all actions available to an omnipotent being. Therefore, if the omnipotent being intentionally causes suffering and pain and misery it is absolutely by intent. Whatever this being may think about good and evil, it will also know (because it is omniscient) that we, the victims of this behavior, will experience this pain and misery in great distress. Being told 'oh well, its for your own good' isn't going to solve anything **even if there is a perfectly reasonable explanation provided** because of the plain fact that god intended to cause these things that he **knew** we would experience negatively, when the option was open to him - because he is omnipotent - to achieve whatever end result was desired without these negatives.

The premise is that what's his name is talking to God, i.e. an all knowing all powerful, all good being, ergo, necessarily, the world is as such a being would intend, and you, being a simple man, with limited knowledge, cannot tell such a being that you know better. 		unless you build a argument that shows as much. I told you. You have one possible way to prove your point. Build an argument that shows that something that exists **cannot possibly** be rationalized **in any way** to be good. That's all you can do. Whatever else you write is bullshit. 		It's not that complicated. God, is by definition all good and all powerful and all knowing. So if that exists, then the world that exists must be as such a God would create it to be. 		It so happens that no god like that exists. Maybe it is impossible. But to show that, with this approach, you have to show that it is **impossible** for the present world to be rationalized as good. 		>if the omnipotent being intentionally causes suffering and pain and misery it is absolutely by intent. Whatever this being may think about good and evil, it will also know (because it is omniscient) that we, the victims of this behavior, will experience this pain and misery in great distress. Being told 'oh well, its for your own good' isn't going to solve anything.		Yes it is. I would gladly elect to be tortured to death if it meant the well being of the rest of mankind. You're being a fool. You are saying "I don't see any rastionalization" What you see, doesn't fucking matter. Is that such a difficult concept for you? what you think good is, is irrelevant. Good is logically derived. Morality is, God knows more than you. You are so stpuid. You want to tell an all knowing being all powerful, and all good, by definition remember, that you know better. You fucking arrogant idiot. He is ALL KNOWING. You know nothing. You can't even understand this fucking simple concept I am trying to explain to you. But you want to tell a GOD, that is BY DEFINITION all good and all knowing, that they are somehow not good. Like that God made a mistake and you didn't. And you're not even fucking building an argument to show it, like a moron. You are just saying "ya, but people will suffer" I don't give a shit. If that's your argument, then you have to show that it is impossible for anyone who is all powerful, to intend any hardship on anyone for any reason. Not that you can't think of any. You have to build the argument that PROVES it. But first you will have to define "good" using logic. And your definition will have to be better than Gods, an all knowing all powerful being. Maybe everyone that suffers is just simulated people as well? It's God, he can do fucking anything. You're such an idiot to argue against such a being. How fucking stupid do you have to be, to get into an argument with an all knowing being? But you're still convinced you're right. 		Holy shit. I am done with you. I'm not reading whatever fucking trash you write which will just be you, missing the whole fucking point. " but... but... you're moving the goal posts" No shit! Took you fucking long enough to figure that out. You HAVE to, because the premise that God, an all knowing all god being all powerful being, created this universe, and that premise is chosen to be accepted, for the sake of argument. Therefore, despite what your stupid mind thinks about what is right and wrong, being that there are wrong things in the world, we now know that a smarter being exists that knows better than stupid you, and it is not, it's just you're too dumb to see it. But God is not. 		Obviously, that would not happen, because God doesn't exist, that premise is NOT true. But if you accept the premise, then that's the case. You have to accept that, because it's an all knowing all powerful being that's all good, that exists and created the world. So, whatever you think isn't good, is all shit you're wrong about somehow, that's way too complicated for your dumb ass to figure out.		I fucking hate people like you. There's always at least one idiot like you that HAS to comment. And you're just fucking blind, so adamant about how right you are, but you're an idiot.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Akoustyk","name":"t1_co6zc2l","parent_id":"t1_co6z2v1","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1422732685,"created_utc":1422732685}
