{"body":"To add it's not necessarily just a square dance.  I've been to a few of these in Arizona when I was a teenager.  You gotta understand there is a pretty big western/rancher crowd in Arizona so sometimes someone decides to host one of these events on their property, so the way they make the dance floor usually is to line it out in a big rectangle with bales of hay lining it that also double as chairs.  You can get fairly creative with how you setup the bales of hay honestly.		Then, you play music, generally western.  I'd say square dancing is not nearly as popular as country swing, two-stepping, and good ol' fashioned line dancing on the fast music, but one thing that also tends to happen at these dances that is not nearly as typical elsewhere is the occasional slow-dance country song you can grab a partner and dance close with.		The reason there was praying is often these dances are either hosted by a church, so before the festivities begin they will have a prayer together to kick off the night, or often just in smaller towns it may not be a church hosted event per say, but most people are Christian and it is just tradition to kick off events like this in more rural areas with a prayer, regardless of your church.		This is definitely southern states though, as you can tell by the shrubbery and the architecture on the homes, so likely a Baptist youth church barn dance is my guess.

{"body":"These are great questions. Never been asked any of them!	Out of order answers, and background for context:		I was not raised Christian. I *did* attend a Christian school (parents like the academic program) when I was about 8-12 years old, but did not go to church on Sundays, and didn't consider myself a believer in any way. The "churchy traditions" I learned there became a matter of comfort later in life, but have nothing to do with the "belief" aspect. 		My college education was hard science / physics, much math and logic, computer hardware, and some psychology as well. I would have said that I was a firm non-believer in any kind of higher power other than the physical order of the universe.		I "became" a Christian sometime after my wife decided it would be good to go to church. I tried it and was going to bail, but (ok... this is the *crazy* part) right after I decided that I was going to just play along, and not really care, I had a bit of a minor "Revelation" (and, no, there didn't appear to be any head trauma, or other seizure-type event) that made me want to actually read and try to understand the "Jesus parts" of the new testament.  I've since read and heard many lectures from churchy types, as well as from respected non-church scholars like Bart Ehrman, and (perhaps ironically) I'm now a Christian.		So: Why do I visit /r/atheism:	Debate is more healthy than not. I've got a solid background in physical sciences, and investigation, questioning, debate, and proof are always areas of comfort for me. 		I don't "lurk" here all day, but I do subscribe, and so I habitually see many of the "hot" and "newest" topics every day, and I pop in when something seems interesting. For example, I saw this photo, and it *really* screamed to me about my own reality, even though OP's situation is probably very different than mine. It's a really great photo. 		Have I ever questioned my faith as a result of seeing something here:	Nope. I don't expect that it will happen either. (Guess it's a little pompous to feel that way) But I also never thought I'd question my "non-faith" so I'll try not to be too bent out of shape if it happens.		Have I ever been worried about questioning my faith:	There I times that I wish God would just go the hell away. So far that hasn't worked for me. I guess I'd say there are times that I'm pissed off that I have that faith. 		I don't know if that helps the debate at all, but they were great questions, and I hope you continue asking them to other Christians (and all of those *other* religions) that show up here.

{"body":"I'm assuming you are talking about this..		>Matthew 6:5New International Version (NIV)		>Prayer	>5 ???And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.		But if you read the full context of the verse certainly goes on to tell you to go into a prayer closet.. It's not that Christians didn't read it, it's that they don't believe coming together and praying is out of the question. Just don't make a big deal about it and make it out like you are holier than others who aren't praying with you. 		>Matthew 18:20 ESV		>For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.???		>Matthew 18:19 ESV 		>Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.		Basically, if you come together in the same place and pray, you are lifting each other up and encouraging each other. If you are out in the street praying in order to be seen by others, then you are a hypocrite and no reward comes from it. 		What this image demonstrates is a group of people coming together with a common belief. What bothers me is the cameraman who then makes it a public "Look at me" event. Images from that night will undoubtedly be used as a recruiting tool, either on a website, or pamphlet. 		A fellow Christian might ask "What's wrong with that.. whatever it takes to get the message heard and save souls" What's wrong with this is the fact that you aren't looking for new souls, you are looking for OTHER CHRISTIANS. Christianity has come down to one church marketing to another church's congregation.

{"body":"In Greek, the word "hypocrite" means "stage actor." What Jesus was talking about (what he was *always* talking about when he talked about "hypocrites") was prayer (or other religious activity) as a performance for others. The "look at me, look how devout I am" kind of thing. People engaging in prayer to call attention to themselves or make themselves look good, not for its own sake.		Whether a person is or is not engaging in a public prayer for appearances or from genuine, un-selfish sincerity can be pretty ambiguous, and I think for most people it's ambiguous even to themselves. I know for a fact that a lot of them feel pressured to *appear* emotive about it even if they aren't feeling it in the moment, and everybody in any church community knows there are always a few who overdo it and are totally doing it for show, but for most, it's usually a combination. It's not that the prayer has no sincerity, but it's hard to block out *all* self-consciousness about appearances or resist any desire to "perform" a little bit.		I see Matthew 6:5 as a Pharisaic type "hedge." If you don't join in public prayer at all, you won't run the risk of doing it for selfish reasons.		Matthew 18 (which is not part of the context of Matthew 6 twelve chapters earlier) is not about public prayer, but about church activities and really, in its broader context, about the need for church community.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brojangles","name":"t1_clwwqjf","parent_id":"t1_clwv93q","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1415482348,"created_utc":1415482348}
