{"body":">I completely understand if you guys are pro science and have a distaste for religion		No, you don't understand if you think words like distaste convey many of our emotions towards religion.  Personally I go to church once a week because I love my wife and am glad she is making her own choices.  I choose to support that, but I absolutely detest religion, it has torn apart my family, mislabeled inappropriate drug use as a life defining addiction, which in turn led to a suicide and it has a nasty habit of tearing people's self-worth to shreds.  I know it's hard being raised inside religion and understanding the emotional stress it puts on you, but I've been there.  I was a devout church of christ christian for 22 years and spent the latter 5ish years teaching classes, preaching behind the pulpit and taking on all sorts of other church leadership responsibilities.		Having seen both sides of the fence I now recognize how much harm religion does to young people when they suffer through lessons and are reminded at least a few times a month how incapable they are of being worthy of the love of the most important being in their lives.		So step back a second and pretend the most important person in your life was your dad.  Now put religion into that context and think about how you would feel if hundreds of people met up once a week and semi-regularly they all chanted amen as they reminded you of how unworthy you are to even be in the same room as your father.		Now for more subconscious fun let's pretend your father was unhappy with his last batch of children and drowned them all in the bathtub because they were not worthy of his perfection and the community chanted amen even harder and told that story as a lesson in how awesome your father is in sunday school to kindergarteners.		Maybe in that context you can begin to realize how entirely pissed off someone can be at religion, because I know without a doubt that had my family not been religious, many bad things would have happened, but those bad things wouldn't have had the entire support of the community and thus they wouldn't have been driven to extremes and ruined lives.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dangsos","name":"t1_cmeiyxe","parent_id":"t1_cmeibgz","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1417104443,"created_utc":1417104443}

That's not a claim you can support with evidence. For starters, harm vs. benefit over a lifetime isn't something that could be quantified in any meaningful way, even if we ignore the fact that said happiness is generally contingent on a reward that can't reasonably be said to exist. Second, the people in question almost never make a real effort to live without religion, so we don't know if their lives would be happier without it.

{"body":">(Sorry I don't understand what you mean here).		Atheism is the rejection or lack of belief in deities. Criticism of religious claims is generally necessary to explain why you don't find them convincing.

This is you adding emotional content that isn't in the post. You're projecting negative emotions onto other people, then complaining that they have negative emotions. Frankly what it looks like is that you don't understand the posts and you fill in the blanks with your biases. You do the same thing here:		>...you shouldn't just bunch together every single religious person and call them shameless liars and ignorant idiots by comparing their beliefs to ducks and rabbits.		This description shows that you have no understanding of this post, just like you failed to understand the posts you linked. I'm not even sure the problem is language related, because substituting your own meaning when you don't understand something isn't good practice in any language. 		>It can just be a way of living, a moral code of sorts. 		Sure, if we were deliberately trying to derail the conversation by adding confusion to a very simple situation. For our purposes, religion is worship of and belief in the supernatural, and if you've been following the conversation uo to this point, you could reasonably limit religion to the Abrahamic religions. 		>...can experience life with the absence of God or some divine being as being quite useless and depressing.		I already addressed this. Due to cognitive bias these people are very unlikely to even consider the possibility that God doesn't exist, meaning their statement that religion makes them happy is ultimately worthless. It's like someone saying that running is an extremely fast means of travel when they've never used a car, horse, or bicycle. If you have only ever known one state, you have no basis for comparison. 		>I believe that everyone is inherently good, there is no factual evidence to this claim and there never will be.		Then you have no business making that claim in a reasonable discussion, do you? You can say that everyone is inherently an earthworm and it has just as little value. 		>But you don't have to mock me in your group of people who think the same as you since I'm not harming anyone.		You don't have to come in here and criticize our behavior,  but here you are. What you're saying is that you want to criticize the way people act, and that's okay, but if we do it, that's bad. It's really very simple. If you make truth claims (religion does and you have) other people can and should critically examine those claims and comment on their merits.  If the claims you made were very poor and you demonstrate a resistance to logic, you should expect to be ridiculed. If you proclaim that everyone is an earthworm deep down, or that homosexuality is an abomination before the Lord and nobody calls you on it, that's not right. The only belief that's beyond criticism is the one you don't share.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Feinberg","name":"t1_cmg0h2m","parent_id":"t1_cmf854l","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1417251844,"created_utc":1417251844}

They're not the same thing.		If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.		So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.		Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.
