But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

Prophet Muhammad was forgiving, humble, kind, truthful, sincere, honest, trustworthy, reliable, patient... The list goes on. He is the human all Muslims strive to become.		Prophet Muhammad was exiled from his own city, his own uncle swore to kill him and was openly against him. He was treated extremely harshly, with countless attempts to murder him. What did he do? He didn't kill them, but forgave them.		Muslims are taught to forgive, and these acts of violence are condemned by Islam.		Posting more images will only anger extremists (whose actions are wrong and condemned by all Muslims) and may cause more deaths.

And yes, to achieve peace, we have to work collectivity and learn to accept different faiths and beliefs.

No, but the groups that use the "Islamisation of Europe" rhetoric *are* exactly those groups.

The definition of a religion may include the actions of its followers, but there are ALSO religious rules that you need to follow to be considered a part of the specific religion - in this case Islam. While it is a little conflicting, I do believe that the religious rules have to go before the outside view really, because if they aren't the ones to decide on who is a Muslim or not, then honestly, who is?		I do however admit that the Muslim COUNTRIES are a little special, some may say savage. I don't think this stems from the general practitioners of the religion though, but I won't go further into this due to my own wall of text confusing me since it's so hard to read.		Would you go outside and see a Muslim and think "Oh shit it's a Muslim, he must be savage!"? Most likely not. WHY not? Because the VAST majority of Muslims aren't. And I'll put it in an ugly way; the ones who are in fact savage, well, they're dumb as fuck cuntbags, and definitely do not represent the religion as a whole.

The case remains open.		**December 12, 2005:** Patricia Hughes and Jeremy Dunahoe threw a Molotov cocktail at a clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana. The device missed the building and no damage was caused. In August 2006, Hughes was sentenced to six years in prison, and Dunahoe to one year. Hughes claimed the bomb was a "memorial lamp" for an abortion she had had there.		**September 11, 2006:** David McMenemy of Rochester Hills, Michigan, crashed his car into the Edgerton Women's Care Center in Davenport, Iowa. He then doused the lobby in gasoline and started a fire. McMenemy committed these acts in the belief that the center was performing abortions; however, Edgerton is not an abortion clinic. Time magazine listed the incident in a "Top 10 Inept Terrorist Plots" list.		**April 25, 2007:** A package left at a women's health clinic in Austin, Texas, contained an explosive device capable of inflicting serious injury or death. A bomb squad detonated the device after evacuating the building. Paul Ross Evans (who had a criminal record for armed robbery and theft) was found guilty of the crime.		**May 9, 2007:** An unidentified person deliberately set fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Virginia Beach, Virginia.		**December 6, 2007:** Chad Altman and Sergio Baca were arrested for the arson of Dr. Curtis Boyd's clinic in Albuquerque. Baca's girlfriend had scheduled an appointment for an abortion at the clinic.		**January 22, 2009:** Matthew L. Derosia, 32, who was reported to have had a history of mental illness rammed an SUV into the front entrance of a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Paul, Minnesota.		**January 1, 2012:** Bobby Joe Rogers, 41, firebombed the American Family Planning Clinic in Pensacola, Florida, with a Molotov cocktail; the fire gutted the building. Rogers told investigators that he was motivated to commit the crime by his opposition to abortion, and that what more directly prompted the act was seeing a patient enter the clinic during one of the frequent anti-abortion protests there. The clinic had previously been bombed at Christmas in 1984 and was the site of the murder of Dr. John Britton and James Barrett in 1994.		**April 1, 2012:** A bomb exploded on the windowsill of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, resulting in a fire that damaged one of the clinic's examination rooms. No injuries were reported.		**April 11, 2013:** A Planned Parenthood clinic in Bloomington, Indiana, was vandalized with an axe.

But if you are saying that abortions should be illegal, that your opinion should be made into law, it is a hard point to argue without divine authority.		If you think that all human life is sacred you have the right to never have an abortion. If you believe that all animal life is sacred you have the right to live a vegan lifestyle. But if you want to make laws that say I have to do the same because you think it is wrong then you are sorely lacking in justification.		> You asked me why I though abortion was wrong and I answered it.		Your answer was "I just think human life has value." with the reasoning that a fetus is a human life. But you wont consider a situation similar to pregnancy where the human life is not a fetus. I am trying to say that even if a fetus is a human life that doesn't give it the right to drain nutrients from an unwilling host. I think that pregnancy should require consent.

Err... no. You simply build more schools than they can bomb. Never forget that terrorism isn't as common as our perception of it. Somewhat like airplane crashes, while flying is actually a very safe mode of travel.		Very few people are willing to kill themselves, and while you hear about the schools attacked in Pakistan and Nigeria, you don't hear about the hundreds of times more commonly *not attacked* schools in the same places.

I'd highly disagree with that statement. The only thing keeping Christian extremism from returning to crusade-era levels is the presence of education and free thinking. Islamic extremism is rampant because the parts of the world where Islam is the dominant religion are also places where free thinking, free speech, and education are absent or very hard to come by. You want to see Christian extremism make a quick comeback? Keep popularizing far-right ideas like the extermination of Islam from our culture. Then it's only a matter of time before we elect people with those same far-right ideas into power. Then guess what happens when you have far-right people in power? Suddenly education and free speech aren't so highly smiled upon and the people become the same fucked up brainwashed idiots you're trying to fight against.

Mind you, as I said elsewhere (http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2rmjnu/rip_charlie_hebdo_staff_you_are_heroes/cnhax9n), I agree that Islam is much more of a problem at this time (21st century) than any other major religion. The problem I have, is that most people proclaiming (the truth) about misguided, evil Islam ... follow this up by suggesting draconian policies that will not help at all, and will probably making the problem worse.		And there is a difference between polls and actual radicalisation. If all those people you are pointing to where actually radical terrorists... terrorism would be an actual thread and risk in western countries (and not just no. 868 on the list of things that kills us). If you went to Pakistan and picked a random person that said "yes, stone the gays/adulterers" and confronted him with a self-professed gay/adulterer/apostate, then gave him stone.... the vast majority would simply drop the stone, walk away bewildered and milk his goat.		People say a lot of stuff, but the majority everwhere is guided by the same emotions (incl. empathy) and the hesitation to kill is strong. To overcome it, you need to put in a lot of work, building up a persons resentments and misgivings or tearing down his life and sense of accomplishments/self-worth/whatever keeps him going.		That is the reason why most peoples suggestions are so misguided; if put into practice they'd increase the problem.		I'd like there to be less muslims and more of them to see reason and scepticism. I don't think most people's overreactions to such acts of terrorism will help though. How about some education initiatives for muslim-majority countries?

It's great that Christianity has managed to shed some of its more vicious strains by the present day, but as I said that clearly has a lot more to do with the fact that the Enlightenment happened in a Christian  area than it has to do with some fundamental difference between Christianity and Islam. 		The only way you can define all Islam as radical is if you define all religion as radical.

If you continue down this blind path, your people will be murdered, your countries lost. Islam, and peace are incompatible. This is not the future that I want to live in, and surely not that of which I want our children to be left with. 		This is what Muslims believe. These are facts.		* "**And kill them wherever you find them**, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief] is worse than killing...	but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful.   And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone.  But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)" 		Quran (2:191-193)			* "**Fighting is prescribed for you**, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not."		Quran (2:216)			* "They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, **seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."**		Quran (4:89) 			* "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that **they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off** on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement"		Quran (5:33)			* "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore **strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them**" 		Quran (8:12)			* "And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion should be only for Allah" 		Quran (8:39)			* "It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a **great slaughter in the land**..."		Quran (8:67)			* "Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people."		Quran (9:14)			* "So when the sacred months have passed away, then **slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush**, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them."		Quran (9:5) 			* "**Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed**, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew."		Quran (9:41)			* "O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness."		Quran (9:123)			* "And when **We wish to destroy a town**, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction."		Quran (17:16) 			* "We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) **from its outlying borders**? Is it then they who will win?"		Quran (21:44)			* "If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be your neighbors in it but a little while.  Accursed,** they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter**." 		Quran (33:60-62)			* "Those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord... So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah's Cause), those who disbelieve **smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them**, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives)... If it had been Allah's Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost."		Quran (47:3-4)			* "Be not weary and faint-hearted, **crying for peace**, when ye should be uppermost (Shakir: "have the upper hand") for Allah is with you," 		Quran (47:35)		"crying for peace", as we saw that Policeman was as he was brutally shot in the head.","depth":0,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"takebackyourcountry","name":"t1_cnhhvko","parent_id":"t3_2rmjnu","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420656393,"created_utc":1420656393}

Want to see a statistic people don't quote? The United States doesn't even fall into the top 100 list of countries with the highest homicides rates per capita.		Please, tell me more about how more guns leads to more violence. Please. I'm listening. Your opinion comes off similarly as those in the UK trying to pass knife laws. Then what next? Rope? Bare hands? People are going to kill. You aren't going to stop them from attempting to by taking away their weapons. The weapons are clearly not the problem. The problems themselves are primarily cultural and can only be addressed on that level.		Edit: While we're playing this game, please explain Switzerland. They have more handguns (it's not guns but handguns that are at the crux of the gun violence question as rifle and shotgun numbers are still very low) per person than even the United States but less gun deaths per capita than Great Britain. The issue with gun violence in this country is heavily due to the introduction of crack cocaine. All other homicide types in America went down in favor of gun homicides in the 1980s when this became a problem. This country existed for years with guns everywhere an no issues. The problem is not at all guns and attempting to get rid of guns in this country is essentially impossible when we border a country like Mexico with all of its drug and violence issues. Guns are going to make their way in. Criminals are going to get them. Criminals are going to use them against others. No amount of laws are going to stop that from happening. So, again, please explain Switzerland. The difference between us and them? Culture and drug problems. That is it and that is where the problem lies.

Satire is not a means to excuse bigotry. 		*Communication has two parts the message sent and the one received. Does anyone here think that these murder victims planned their demise? No. That paper provoked and taunted these Fundamental Muslims. If it was good, solid satire rather than playground provocation, then there would not be bodies. 		*If you are white, go to a black neighborhood and say the N word and talk like the guy from The Green Mile. Tell them it is satire. I'm sure they will agree with you. 		*Those were not political cartoons to those Muslims. It was a paper that kept saying, "fuck your God and faith", "we don't respect 'lesser' and 'unworthy' people", "here is some Family Circle looking shit because fuck you." 		*There is a significant Arab/Muslim population in France. 		*Salman Rushdie is measuring stick to gauge things. Rushdie nor his work is anything like Hebdo. 		*This is Don Imus calling a NCAA ladies basketball team "nappy headed hoes". A bigot like Imus cannot perceive the harm in those words... It's somehow comedy. 			*A RIP, and even a praise filled incantation to/for the dead in /r/atheism? WAT?		If you disagree with me, please give your argument. 		My heart goes out to all those affected by this tragedy including the families and community of the victims. 		My hope is that people can learn some respect, be tactful in the treatment of other human beings, respecting freewill, and shedding arrogance.","depth":0,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"effinmike12","name":"t1_cnhtuwg","parent_id":"t3_2rmjnu","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420675506,"created_utc":1420675506}
{"body":"I would be more than happy to give a response.		Do you see any civilized societies that deals with what bothers them by murdering people?  This is not how things are done in civilized societies.  It makes absolutely NO difference if it was satire or provocation, no difference at all. If you do not like what is being said by some publication, then what you need to do is go through legal channels to take care of it.  That is what civilized people do.  If the legal route does not work out for you, tough.  Try again. 		You said communications is a two way street, I agree.  If a person is offended they are more than welcome to start their own publication and complain about it, not murder people.  That's how civilized people communicate.  If you don't like it, complain, protest, write letters, vote, whatever you are legally allowed to do.  Once you pull the trigger you are a barbarian not worthy of the least bit of respect. Absolutely none.		You seem to be confused about the the western mindset.  Killing and blowing things up only makes westerners double down on their efforts.  It makes the murderers look like villains.  It does NOT create respect, not in the least bit.  It simply makes all Muslims (or ANY group that does something like this) look like a bunch of brainwashed freaks.  		A better parallel would be Don Imus calling them "nappy headed ho's" and then several black girls showing up at the place he works and murdering 12 people.  Is that how civilized people take care of problems?  NO.  Who would be the villain after the shooting?  The black girls would be, and Imus would end up looking like a hero, just like Charlie Hebdo looks now.  Instead, things were taken through channels and Imus ended up looking like the asshole.  Is that not what you want in the end?  		Here's the bottom line.  There is no religion that is above being made fun of.  They are simply pissed off that someone does not agree with their particular flavor of baloney and has another opinion.  Let me ask you a simple question.  I hear Muslims making depreciating remarks about atheist constantly.  Many atheist find this offensive.  Does this now give some group of atheist a right to kill them?  Of course not, not in a civilized society anyway.  Would people respect atheist more if they did?  Of course not, just the opposite.  It would make ALL of us look like a bunch of murdering thugs.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"flpflpflp","name":"t1_cnhwkbo","parent_id":"t1_cnhtuwg","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420680375,"created_utc":1420680375}
