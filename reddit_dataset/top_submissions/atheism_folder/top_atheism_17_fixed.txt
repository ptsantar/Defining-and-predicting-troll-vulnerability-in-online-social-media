{"body":"Basically, the core concept of Satanism is to *not* worship any deity, and to love oneself above all else. Satanism does not promote harming others, unless they have explicitly harmed you first. It is about individuality, self importance, and knowing one's own worth.		Everyone seems to think Satanism involves worshipping Satan, but it's actually the opposite. Satanism promotes the idea of following no one but yourself, and to look down on those who worship a deity. It's actually pretty anti-traditional-religion, and its only connection to the Christian Satan is that they use him as a role model. Satan did not promote hate or pain or killing or anything -- he promoted individuality and to question authority. Satanism as a religion is more like a set of tenets to live by -- there's no worship, prayer, etc.		Source: Wikipedia, which I had to look up when a friend tried saying Satanism was devil worshipping and evil.

You shall not make idols.--- you can worship a spork if you want.

Helping the poor?  Giving away your stuff?  Spreading the word of God?  The Constitution doesn't do any of that stuff.    		Saying our legal system is founded on Judeo-Christain principles is kind of weird, when half of it is about punishing criminals (instead of forgiving the wrongdoer), and the other is about suing people to get money for the wrongs done to you (instead of turning the other cheek).

Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford), 60 U.S. 393 (1857), was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court held that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, could not be American citizens and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court,[2][3] and that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in the federal territories acquired after the creation of the United States. Dred Scott, an enslaved African American man who had been taken by his owners to free states and territories, attempted to sue for his freedom. In a 7???2 decision written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the Court denied Scott's request. For only the second time in its history the Supreme Court ruled an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional.[4]		>Although Taney hoped that his ruling would finally settle the slavery question, the decision immediately spurred vehement dissent from anti-slavery elements in the North, especially Republicans. Many contemporary lawyers, and most modern legal scholars, consider the ruling regarding slavery in the territories to be dictum, not binding precedent. The decision proved to be an indirect catalyst for the American Civil War. It was functionally superseded by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave African Americans full citizenship.		>It is universally denounced by scholars. Bernard Schwartz says it, "stands first in any list of the worst Supreme Court decisions ??? Chief Justice C.E. Hughes called it the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound."[5] Junius P.

{"body":"What do you think about this post on http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x193667			> I ran across that old media-induced, ideological impossibility the other day from someone claiming to be a libertarian.	> 	> There is no possibility of someone being a social liberal and a fiscal conservative. The two are mutually exclusive, on both sides of the equation. It is impossible to want to change the social structure of this nation without wanting the government to get involved, and this requires money. And it is impossible to want the government to spend less money and still expect any form of liberal growth.	> 	> A social liberal wants society to change, usually to advance towards some more ideal goal. Wanting it to stay the way it is can not be liberal, by definition. If you want it to stay the same, or to reverse, you are conservative. If you want it to progress very slowly, through a "natural--" meaning "undirected," evolution, you are at best a moderate, unwilling to make a change even though you want one to happen. Change only comes about when people actively make a change, and that means liberalism. The way things get changed in this nation is through the people-- ie, the government. We are a government by, for and of the people (well, we are when things are going well), and government is (supposed to be) nothing more than the method the people use to get things done. Just because the current usurper of the government doesnot acknowledge this does not make it untrue.	> 	> Therefore, the people have to use the government to create changes. Even if the people change without the government, the government still has to change its own policies to catch up with the people. Otherwise you have segregated schools and workplaces, for instance, and laws which target certain groups more than others. Society won't become more equal when laws penalize lower income groups for theft yet let Ken Lay escape without penalty. Or when the punish crack use more than cocaine use. The laws must be changed, the procedures must be changed, and often people's awareness must be changed. That requires spending money. Thus, a social liberal, whether they realize it or not, wants a more active government, and that means one that spends money.	> 	> The other side of the equation, that one can be a fiscal conservative yet still want social change, thus fails. And the phrase "fiscal conservative" is an oxymoron anyway. One cannot be a conservative--meaning someone who doesn't want change-- and expect the fiscal state of the union to improve. History and logic both prove this. Historically, the economy suffers under conservatives, and although it does not always improve under liberals, when it makes significant improvements, it is under liberal policy. Reaganites don't see this, believing that the economy grew under Reagan, but the only increases were due to the fact that Reagan had crashed the economy so far down that the minor improvements under his reign of error seem impressive. By the end of the Reagan error, the economy had barely made it back to where it was when Reagan took over, and even then only after Reagan had abandoned his "trickle down" nonesense, raising taxes and growing the government to its largest size in history.	> 	> Logically, you can't decrease the amount of investment in a business and expect it to grow. The most you can hope for is that what you have invested in the past will yield enough dividends to keep you afloat. But as any business owner or investor can confirm, you don't make money without spending money. That doesn't mean spending it recklessly-- you can spend money and still fail. But you can't become conservative and expect your business to grow. Or your economy. Republicans who claim that Democrats need to understand economics 101 don't understand that Democrats have moved beyond economics 101 to 401 or even graduate level studies. Econ 101 is basic theory, which works only in a vacuum. In physics 101 we are told that a cannonball and a feather dropped from a tower fall at the same rate. By grad school, a physics student understands that they don't, due to real world factors such as air resistance, friction, etc. Republicans are dropping economic feathers and fudging the results when the cannonballs the liberals drop strike the ground first and hardest. A strong economy, in other words, requires government spending. A fiscal conservative is not possible.	> 	> To make social changes you need a strong government with money to spend. To make a strong economy, you need a government willing to invest wisely in economic growth. You also need natural resources, including people, and you need money from the beginning. A liberal social program educates and makes use of a nation's entire social base-- all of its people. It educates them, it keeps them at an economic level that maximizes health, happiness, and other productivity factors. It also gives them something to shoot for, so that they want to maximize their own potential-- this rules out the form of socialism that the Soviets practiced (though not all forms of socialism). And most of all, it ensures equal opportunity from conception (meaning prenatal care). Anything less fails to utilize all resources to their best, and thus it fails to maximize the economy. If the economy is not maximized, then the fiscal state of the union is weaker than it should be, and if only a portion of the populace have full access to the rewards of our society, then the fiscal state is not maximized. 	> 	> Liberals are best for the people. They are best for the economy. They are best for the fiscal health of the nation. And historically, government operates more efficiently under liberals, anyway. Government grew under Reagan, and shrunk under Clinton. So the next time you hear the media encouraging people to be social liberals and fiscal conservatives, just remember it is another attempt to get you to vote for Bush, and therefore just another advertising ploy for the Republican Party.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"baltimoretom","name":"t1_cso79g2","parent_id":"t1_cso3i2d","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1435716530,"created_utc":1435712930}

I understand your confusion, and will attempt to address it.  		>The Supreme Court already ruled on this same Monument in favor of Texas' constitutional right to display it on its grounds.		Incorrect and irrelevant.  First, the Oklahoma case is not an Establishment Clause case.  It is not a question of whether the placement of a religious monument on the Oklahoma capitol grounds runs afoul of federal law.  It is a question of whether a state's action violates its own constitution (specifically, [Article 2, Section 5](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=84812)).  In such cases, where state courts address state law that does not implicate federal law "[i]t is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions."  *Minnesota v. National Tea Co.*, 309 U.S. 551, 557 (1940).  		Second, in *Van Orden v. Perry*, 545 U.S. 677, 691-92 (2005) -- the case about the Texas monument to which I believe you are referring -- the Court did not address *this* monument.  It addressed a monument in Texas.  Then, a plurality of the Court agreed that "Texas has treated its Capitol grounds monuments as representing the several strands in the State's political and legal history. The inclusion of the Ten Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government. We cannot say that Texas' display of this monument violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment."  		The only thing a majority could agree on was that the Court of Appeals holding that the Texas monument did violate the Establishment Clause must be vacated.  You overstate the holding.		>So the OK ban is not a "greater protection", it is in fact at odds with established federal law.		Incorrect on both counts.  As to the latter, the Oklahoma decision is not at odds with established federal law because there is no established federal law on this state constitutional issue, and the federal case on this monument -- *American Atheists, Inc. v. Thompson*, No. CIV-14-42-C, 2015 WL 1061137 (W.D. Okla. March 10, 2015) -- was dismissed because the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue.  As to the former, while the federal Constitution only protects the people of the United States from a Congressional or state establishment of religion, the Oklahoma constitution protects the people of Oklahoma from the state appropriating, applying, donating, or using public money or property for the use, benefit, or support of any system of religion.  This is a greater protection for the people of Oklahoma than the federal right enshrined in the Establishment Clause.		>Which wins out between state and federal laws that are at odds?

{"body":"For crying out loud, even Christian idiots should grasp *this* one.		Those silly ancient rules aren't even applicable to the modern world, they violate the constitution, and most of them are not even fucking ILLEGAL. 		Only two of them are illegal, and they don't even start the list, and THOSE things are illegal everywhere in the world, and always have been since people were people, since the foundation of Ur. They're in the Code of Hammurabi, of Urukagina, of Urnammu and Tehit. Christianity can lay no claim to those, and the third one which is sometimes illegal, is only illegal when sworn to testify in a court of law. It is also ubiquitous, global, common sense, and the basis of any sort of judicial system.		What's left? The other seven aren't just perfectly legal, they're almost entirely *useless*, and certainly not inherently *moral*... 		Four, the first four, count 'em four, are just demands that you worship *this* God *this* way, and not *that* way, on *this* day and not *that* day. That's *forty percent* of what God saw fit to pass on to humanity, a bunch of vanity commandments which *clearly* violate the 1st Amendment to the Constitution, and aren't worth a shit anyway.		So that leaves honoring your parents. which sounds okay, but what if they're total assholes? What if they abused you and neglected you? Are you legally bound to "honor" them? How is this even enforcible? 		And adultery is more common than ever, among the religious and the non-religious with no difference in frequency, it's perfectly legal, and nothing more than the breaking of a promise, and one which is not even legally enforcible, anyway. And, once again,  what if your spouse is a loveless abusive asshole or assholette who won't sleep with you, treats you like hell, and won't go away? Are we to believe that trying to find a little happiness elsewhere is a worse transgression than slavery or genocide or usury or child abuse or rape? (None of which, incidentally, are even mentioned in God's perfect Law).		That leaves a commandment against being envious of your neighbors. Envy is against God's rules, for some reason. He might just as well have issued a commandment against being *human*. And envy, damn it, is the engine that drives this consumer economy. It's really the silliest of the bunch, and I suspect was placed there by forward-thinking clergy who planned on doing a lot less, and having a lot more, than their parishioners, if you see what I'm saying. I am just speculating, but I can't see any other reason wy that would be thrown in.		So even, as I said above, the STUPIDEST, most fundamentalist evangelical unlearned southern moron should be capable of seeing that this was a monument to everything this country never was and was never supposed to be, and trying to argue that it is appropriate or of any value displayed by the courthouses of this country are just brazenly trying to force their bullshit "Christian nation" lies on the rest of us. None of the founding principles of this country appear in the Bible, and in fact those principles are in intentional diametric opposition to principles and claims of the theocratic anti-freedom soul-destroying guilt-trip death cult that is Christianity.		The court was right, and the two justices who voted to *keep* that monolithic piece of bronze-Age bullshit on public land deserve a very close look, in my opinion.		**EDIT**: Didn't realize how long that got. TL;DR... Commandments are silly and useless and mostly legal; no person should in good conscience insist they stay up; I'm a hothead blabbermouth who should get something done this morning.

My opinion is that it should be allowed to stay, but I don't think we should add other monuments there for every other creed just to be representative. For me leaving this monument there wouldn't be about religious representation, it would be about preserving history.

Time is relative. The Roman Coliseum at the time it was built was manufactured using a "modern method" at the time. In fact, methods that aren't even too different than the ones we have today. Should we tear it down because of some of the awful things that happened there years ago?

I disagree with this way of thinking, but I do understand why you think that way, because I used to. I used to be spiteful and worry about "representation", but then I concluded that that's shallow and doesn't actually mean anything, and I was only doing so because I was bitter about somebody else getting to have something erected to show off something of theirs that I didn't personally subscribe to.		What matters to me is what action is actually taken in human society, not what monuments we have sitting where. Actions matter. Decorations don't. But maybe that's just me. I don't think putting up other religious monuments on the same property, or taking this one down, will change anything that happens in that building on a day-to-day basis. I don't think it's worth worrying about, so we might as well just leave it there and acknowledge something in our history that will never truly be erased just by removing it.

Because it being there doesn't mean that the politicians in the building beside it will take religion into account in their day-to-day decision-making. Whether or not you remove it, what goes on in there will be the same in the end anyways. So why even bother removing it? It's basically benign.		> And don't say "onus" it makes you sound like a ostentatious douche.		That's like asking me to stop reasoning. Sorry, no can do. Reason is something I value too much. Maybe you don't, but if that's the case, you shouldn't be here trying to debate anything with anyone. You made a claim, that 3 years isn't enough for something to be considered historical. When you do that, the onus is on you to back it up. So do it. Why is 3 years not enough? All you've said so far is "It just isn't". Give me something I can work with here. Maybe you can sway me. But you're off to bad start.		> There obviously isn't a "set" of years.		If there isn't a set number of years to be the threshold, then 3 years is up for grabs for the "historical" definition.		> The capital building in washington was built in 1935 and has christian themed art on it. Is that historical? Fuck yeah. Is a monument some right wing state rep donated to the capital (obviously for his own political gainz after seeing judge moore in alabama etc..) 2 and half years ago historical? Fuck no.		It's got religious art on it, therefore supports religion by your logic, so no matter what, it should be removed. Or are you now contradicting yourself?		> And you're wrong. It's not my "onus" to show how the monument isn't historical.		Yes it is.		> It's those who put it there to prove it is!		No it isn't. The fact is it's sitting there now, and a decision to be made is "should it be removed"? It's not up to them to defend why it shouldn't be, it's up to the people who brought up the question of removing it to show why, after 3 years of it being there, it should now be taken away. This decision involves costs to remove it, so the default is to leave it, unless a reason can be given to remove it which makes enough sense to justify it. My opinion is that it's harmless, and looks neat, so why bother spending all the case to move it just so sensitive flowers like you won't have to accidentally see it if you turn your head in the wrong direction? Remember, I'm an atheist. I hate religion generally speaking. But I appreciate beautiful art, religious or not.		> And since the person who donated it has attacked the constitution where no religion can be supported, obviously he feels it's a religious one.		Maybe so, but that's irrelevant. The monument itself isn't to blame for anything. Just as Michaelangelo's David statue isn't promoting pornography.		> And you should care if it's there. It belongs in a fucking church, not a capital building.		It's not hurting anyone, nor is it affecting any day-to-day decision-making in government, so I don't see a reason to remove it.		> I don't want ANY religious shit in my goverment.		But you said earlier:		> The capital building in washington was built in 1935 and has christian themed art on it.		That Christian art is in your government, and belongs in a church, no? Should they destroy that art beyond recognition to appease you? Your worldview is inconsistent and is in need or re-examining.		> Apathy isn't good for you		Have you ever heard of the phrase "pick your battles?" Some things aren't worth fighting for, and the effort could be better spent elsewhere. I picture an angry person (you) sitting behind his/her computer about to burst a vein in his/her forehead every time he sees any hint of religion in the world, no matter how benign. I think you need to learn some tolerance, and gain an appreciation for the beauty of this world. Maybe then you won't be so angry about every little thing.		Whether or not it gets removed, I have no stake in it nor should I care that much, but it would be a shame. You on the other hand, would probably have a stroke or something if it were to stay.

That's why even though I support the confederate flag being taken down from political buildings, and same with religious teachings, I think it's important to know that line. 		For example, yes it's important not to have these types of things in any political buildings, court houses, and schools.. but if we start banning these things more publicly just because we find them offensive or don't like them  that's when there would start to be problems and questions about rights.  Once you cross the line to far on one thing, you can cross the line with many things. That's what I think /u/duncakes was trying to say. 		And even though you say it's a bad example for him to comment on the rainbow flag vs the confederate flag (yes they clearly have their historical differences) it's actually not a bad comparison on what he was trying to say.
