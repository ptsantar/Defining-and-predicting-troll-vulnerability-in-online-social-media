{"body":"(christ, this turned out to be a rather longer and more rambling comment than I had first intended. I was just trying to show the somewhat ironic difference between one of the world's most atheist countries which was once deeply religious in its constitution (and still is, but to a much much smaller degree), and one of the world's most religious countries, which is deliberately non-religious in its constitution. Anyway, read it if you want; I cant very well just delete it now that Ive taken this long to write it :p )		It's... ironic, or something, that the founding fathers of the US went to great lengths to specifically keep religion and God out of the constitution and to keep church and state separate, while the US is now one of the most religious countries, with people just flat out denying that God isnt in the constitution.		Meanwhile, my country (Norway) is today one of the more [atheist countries in the world](http://www.parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/norway.jpg) but when the constitution was written and signed in 1814, there was one section in particular that was rather heavily pro-protestantism/anti everyone else. And it's not like this was buried in ??138 or something. No, this was ??2. Considering ??1 is just declaring Norway an independent monarchy, they obviously thought this shit quite important to put it in already at ??2:		> ??2. Den evangelisk-lutherske Religion forbliver Statens offentlige Religion. De Indvaanere, der bekjende seg til den, ere forpligtede til at opdrage sine B??rn i samme. Jesuitter og Munkeordener maae ikke taales. J??der ere fremdeles udelukkede fra Adgang til Riget.		Which translates as (sorry if my translation is a bit awkward sounding; I can write English just fine (I think?), but when it comes to translating to English from my own language, I somehow struggle a lot)		> ??2. Lutheranism shall remain the State's religion. The citizens who pledge to it (is this the right way to say it? probably not) are also obligated to raise their children the same. Jesuits and munk orders are not to be tolerated. Jews will still be denied access to the Kingdom.		(In case you are wondering about the "shall remain" and "still be denied" wording, Norway was until 1814 in a "union" with (owned by, really) Denmark, and judging by how it is worded, thats how the law was when we were part of Denmark as well). Not quite the open and free and tolerating Norway we have today. The "Jew section" was removed in 1851, on the fourth attempt (it was also voted on in 1842, 1845, and 1848; all three times it was voted to keep it). For munks it was changed in 1897.		The "Jesuit section" is even more depressing, as it wasnt changed until 1956. It was voted on in 1897, but didnt receive the required majority (2/3 majority to change anything in the constitution). It was voted on again in 1925, but didnt even manage to get a majority at all then. The only reason it was ditched in 1956, was because Norway was ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights, and kinda had to get rid of that blemish in order to do so. *Nineteen* fifty six... after WW2. *After* Quisling had reinstated the Jew section during the war, and for which he was convicted of "unlawful changing of the constitution" after the war. They *still* kept the very similar law active for Jesuits for another eleven years. That boggles the mind.		The first part of ??2 remained the same for another 8 years, when freedom of religion was introduced. We introduced religious freedom in *1964*, and we mock America?? Even after 1964 the requirement of parents to raise their children in the Lutheran faith, if they themselves were members of the state religion, remained.		In 2012 it was changed so that we no longer have an official State religion.		The so far last revision of ??2 was made in 2014, and it is now as follows:		> Verdigrunnlaget forblir v??r kristne og humanistiske arv. Denne grunnlov skal sikre demokratiet, rettsstaten og menneskerettighetene.		Which translates as		> Our value foundation will remain our christian and humanistic heritage. This constitution shall secure the democracy, (apparently there is no English translation for rettsstat: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat ), and the human rights.		(the part about religious freedom was moved to ??16). So, while it's come a long way from its 1814 origins, it still mentions Norway's values as being christian.","depth":0,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GroovingPict","name":"t1_cphtxun","parent_id":"t3_2zcvdi","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426615987,"created_utc":1426612387}

Also, the addition of the "under God," to the pledge was around the same time as well, I think. 		But, it is important, I feel, to look to the background behind these events, behind the red scare. That is why I mention the great awakenings, which were basically moments of religious revival. Your analogy is a good one, religion's progression is sort of cyclic, like a pendulum swinging. Which is kind of interesting to note, because if religion operates in cycles rather than linearly, then thinking about it that way makes it more clear why religion would have such a fundamental conflict with science/technology, which to the contrary, does appear to progress linearly.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rynowiz","name":"t1_cpilvci","parent_id":"t1_cpiihwq","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426672598,"created_utc":1426668998}

{"body":"To my dear American friends. I have been pondering on the seemingly irreconcilable divisions between Christian fundamentalists and normal human beings when it comes to discussions about the law, constitution and so forth. And I flatter myself that I have come up with a solution that could work to bring both sides together for the benefit of domestic harmony and eventually , international relations. International relations in the sense that America needs to be a guiding light for progress and enlightenment in a world shadowed by evils such as false religions, socialism and preverted naughtiness. What I propose is a minor tweak to the Constitution to bring God's will into play in a very real sense, and thus to satisfy those in your country who need to be convinced that God is working through them to make a better world. At the moment the President gets to read, suggest amendments, ratify bills and stuff before they become law. What I am suggesting is merely that a couple of days be added to this process to get God's opinion and assent/ amendments.  Once the President has done his bit, the proposed legal bill (let's say it's to allow bears to have bare arms or some such) should be exposed on the highest mountain in America with a good quality pen and some indelible ink (we wouldn't want any cheating) for as long as it takes for God in his infinite wisdom  to add any comments/strike out any bits he doesn't like (it might be that He has covered bears' arms with fur for a reason, for example). Only when He has had a chance to make any amendments he sees fit should the bill become law. 	I'm not even asking for any money for this suggestion: I'm just anxious to be of service.

{"body":"I'm no fan of this guy.  the world would be better off without him, and all that blah blah blah.		But as for the incident you are talking about...		In the old days, when a woman miscarried or had a still birth, they would hide the dead child away and tell the parents to just go home and pretend it never happened.  And while that child never had a minute of life or even coherent sentient thoughts, to their parents, they were a real person, someone they already loved.  Think of how that's all snatched away in an instant.  No closure, no respect.  Just forget that baby ever existed.		12 years ago some very good friends of mine went into the hospital on their due date as her contractions got close enough.  And 30 minutes after they were there, due to a very rare complication, they lost the baby.  My friend, in the worst moment of her life, was then told she still had to go through labor.  Can you imagine that?  The insanity of all your hopes and happiness destroyed and then being told you had to endure the worst pain imaginable for the next 6-12 hours- for nothing.		Their dead child was born early in the morning, and all they wanted to do was go home.  They refused to talk to the doctors, they refused to see their family who had been called for support.		The hospital brought in a nurse who is specifically trained and called in for this.  She convinced them (almost demanded) that they spend what few minutes they had with their daughter.  She told them to dress her, to hold her and to take a few pictures.  They eventually came around, and did all that.  Possibly the hardest thing they have ever done.  It was all awful, all painful.		But they spent the time they could with their daughter.  And when the dust settled, and they went on to have two more children, they are very thankful that the nurse had them do those things.  They planned for years to have that baby, spent 9 months loving the idea of her.  And when disaster struck, and though there was not much left for them to do, *they did everything they could for her*, which was to hold her, dress her and take pictures of her.  This was their daughter, and they owed her whatever they could do for her.  And now, years later, they feel better knowing that they did those things.  Not because it did anything for a life that didn't even have a chance to breathe even one breath of air, but for themselves.  They were her parents, even if it was for only a few minutes, and they can feel proud that they honored her even in the worst moment of their lives.		They have one of those pictures on their wall.  It's morbid, the baby is splotchy and clearly dead.  But it's all they have of her- and they are glad to have it.		For as much of a shit bag as Santorum is, he loves his family.  And when that child died prematurely, they did the same thing- they took her home and spent that short time they had with her as a family.  I would have said the same thing as you had I not known these friends of mine, but through my friends' tragedy I discovered that there's more to this than just some crazy embryo loving psychos.		TLDR:  there's a lot of reasons to hate Santorum, but their treatment of that lost child was really one of the most humane and beautiful things they have ever done.","depth":1,"score":79,"ups":79,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ultralame","name":"t1_cphvb6h","parent_id":"t1_cphqfne","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426618164,"created_utc":1426614564}

{"body":"> Hitler was elected by the same mentality.		Um, huh?  I rechecked my history of Germany to be sure, and this makes no sense.  I cannot find a single incident in Hitler's political history where he was nominated as a "spoiler" who was expected to lose an election.		Hitler gained unquestioned control of the NSDAP ("winning the primary") in 1925, the year after his release from prison.  This was because he was by far the best speaker and threatened to go start his own party if the NSDAP refused him; they needed him more than he needed them.		He spent the next several years building the party.		In the May 1928 election, the NSDAP was a minor party of no great note.		The big break came in the December 1929 referendum, which is when Hitler began to be taken seriously as a politician.  The great crash had happened, and Hitler rose to prominence on the popular unhappiness with the economy, the Treaty of Versailles, and mainstream German political parties in general.		This became clear in the September 1930 election when the NSDAP skyrocketed to the second-largest party in the Reichstag.		In particular, although they despised each other, the NSDAP plus the KPD (communist party) in third place made more than half of the Reichstag, so more moderate parties had to include them in coalition talks.		Are you referring to the KPD's statement that they'd rather see Hitler in power than help the Republic?		An important consequence of this division in was that Chancellor Br??ning, without a stable base in the Reichstag, had to use emergency powers and decrees a lot.  Hitler would later continue the pattern.		(Weimar Germany's structure has some similarities to a Westminster parliament, but with an elected President instead of a monarch calling elections and asking people to try to form governments.  The Chancellor was like a prime minister, who was supposed to have the confidence of the Reichstag.)		Anyway, while other parties were trying to court the Nazis into a colaition, they were unwilling to suppress their paramilitary arms, and there were steadily increasing levels of violence.		Hitler ran in the March 1932 presidential election, but his opposition persuaded the ailing incumbent Hindenberg to run again.  Hindenberg defeated Hitler handily.		(The KPD, worried about the rise of Hitler's right wing, turned more to violence, further destabilizing the situation.)		Br??ning immediately banned the KPD and NSDAP's paramilitaries (SA and SS), but not long after, Hindenberg stopped approving Br??ning's decrees, he had to resign, and Franz von Papen came in as Chancellor.  He had almost no support in the Reichstag and rescinded the ban to court Hitler into a coalition.  However, negotiations had not succeeded when, faced with an imminent no-confidence vote, Papen had to ask the President to call new elections to forestall it.		In those elections (July 1932), which were notably violent, the NSDAP gained first place, trading places with the SPD.  The KPD was still in third.		Hitler demanded the Chancellorship, but Hindenberg declined.  Papen offered the vice chancellorship, but Hitler declined.  With no majority able to form a new stable government, Papen stayed on as chancellor, but he again faced a no-confidence vote in September, so he had to repeat the same trick to forestall it, leading to new elections in November.		(One interlude: in August, the Reichstag passed harsh laws against political violence, which Hitler would later use to suppress his enemies.)		Although the NSDAP lost significantly, and the KPD gained somewhat, the relative rankings stayed the same.		Anyway, Papen was kicked out as Chancellor and replaced by Kurt von Schleicher.  Papen then made a deal to support Hitler as Chancellor if Papen could be vice-Chancellor.  This got Hindenberg's approval, and the "Hitler Cabinet" was formed in late January 1933.		Then came the Reichstag fire on February 27, which Hitler played into some emergency anti-communist decrees.  Trying to capitalize on it, new elections (with the communists banned, and lots of other violent suppression) were held March 5.  He didn't quite get the absolute majority he hoped for, but an alliance with the German National People's Party (DNVP) made 50%.		The first day the new Reichstag met (in an opera house), he persuaded them (i.e. surrounded the building by Sturmabteilung) to pass the Enabling Act, granting him dictatorial power for 4 years, subject only to the veto of the President.		Throughout 1933 he centralized power, and when Hindenburg died in August 1944, Hitler merged that office into his own (in direct violation of the Enabling Act, but nobody called him on it), becoming absolute dictator.			There are several places where he broke promises (most notably, not to abuse the Enabling Act!), but I fail to see any incident where someone thought they were setting Hitler up to fail.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cypherpunks","name":"t1_cpjpqld","parent_id":"t1_cpj7o36","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426758654,"created_utc":1426755054}

{"body":"I have noticed on these threads the "Reddit are Leftist Shills" comments are few and far between.		And it is not difficult to discern why.		Rick Santorum won a couple of primaries last go-round.  He got major media play--the very same media that supposedly shills for The Left.  But, as is to be expected, when you put cameras on him and let him talk he demonstrated himself to be an idiot and then: into the also-ran file.		Conservatives have this problem way more than Liberals do.  If there is a Progressive that says something radically stupid on the national stage they are cast in to the dust bin, and can't get face time in a photo booth.		But, because of "conservative media" their nuttiness actually garners them an audience,  And with that audience comes money.  Santorum knows he will never hold public office again,  But, he can get cash and exposure by being the idiot he is.  SO HE CAN'T LOSE.		So, the questions become (If you are a Conservative in the current definition):		Do you feel good about Santorum being a nationally viable candidate for President?  Do you feel that in the primary process the arguments he addresses help or hurt your cause?		I say this as someone whose political ideas have not changed significant;y since I learned what politics is.  I wrote Richard Nison when I was six, and he write me back.  I have his picture hanging in my living room as I write this.		I am wounded deeply by Watergate, but I do acknowledge the genius things Nixon did.  His ideas were sound, and he advanced our national dialogue in significant, positive ways.		The Southern Strategy is now biting the GOP ins the ass...		Anyway, my politics have not changed at all.  And yet, now I find myself a "Progressive Commie Liberal" or whatever.  Why?  Because I see the Randian Hellscape we are in, and is getting worse?","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Russell_Jimmy","name":"t1_cpifj4p","parent_id":"t3_2zcvdi","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426652592,"created_utc":1426648992}
