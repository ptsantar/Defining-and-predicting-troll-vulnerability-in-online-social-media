That's a rather cynical way of looking at it, but in a sense, yes.

A certain now retired but well respected Supreme Court justice [completely agrees](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-2074.ZC.html) with you:		> In my opinion, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act	of 1993 (RFRA) is a ???law respecting an establishment	of religion??? that violates the First Amendment to the	Constitution.		>If the historic landmark on the hill in Boerne happened to be a museum or an art gallery owned by an atheist, it would not be eligible for an exemption from the city ordinances that forbid an enlargement of the structure. Because the landmark is owned by the Catholic Church, it is claimed that RFRA gives its owner a federal statutory entitlement to an exemption from a generally applicable, neutral civil law. Whether the Church would actually prevail under the statute or not, the statute has provided the Church with a legal weapon that no atheist or agnostic can obtain. This governmental preference for religion, as opposed to irreligion, is forbidden by the First Amendment. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 52???55 (1985).		Makes perfect sense to me, but Stevens didn't convince any of the other 8 justices to join his concurrence.

The litmus test is about having not to rule based on the compelling interest.  Just say the religion isn't valid.		A compelling interest should be pretty solid for discrimination, but a bad judge can claim homosexuality doesn't count as something the state needs to worry about when it comes to discrimination.  A good judge could rightfully claim it is the states interest to prevent discrimination of anyone of any sexual orientation or gender. Any judge could write a case for either side.

But another judge could accept the same bogus meta reports based on that 1970s australian survey and claim there is evidence that marijuana is bad and thus decide the state does have a compelling interest to regulate it.  They could also ignore the health effects and state that because it is a recreational drug and that the state simply has a compelling interest to regulate recreational and non-recreational drugs.

What I am saying is that while the supreme court has tried to avoid creating any kind of definition of a religion, when laws like indiana passes meld religion and law, the supreme court is going to be forced to define it.

{"body":"From the majority opinion:		>The Court held that the First Amendment's protection of the "free exercise" of religion does not allow a person to use a religious motivation as a reason not to obey such generally applicable laws. "To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself." Thus, the Court had held that religious beliefs did not excuse people from complying with laws forbidding polygamy, child labor laws, Sunday closing laws, laws requiring citizens to register for Selective Service, and laws requiring the payment of Social Security taxes.		This is why the federal government needs to amend the Civil Rights Act and all relevant discrimination laws to include sexual orientation ASAP.  It would prevent religious justifications for discriminatory practices, since the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that religious motivation doesn't excuse compliance with "generally applicable laws that are valid" and not intended to suppress or stifle religious exercise.		The legal momentum and modern interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause would mean that practically any challenges would fall well short of validity, **if** all discrimination laws were amended so as to protect sexual orientation.  It would end this bullshit once and for all, and they could keep their now-toothless, ass-backwards, Bible-thumping laws.

{"body":"Cue the cynic.  I can't blame you, but I also can't agree.		The solution is amendment of state or federal statute.  Given the amount of discourse surrounding SB-101 in IN, it seems all but inevitable, honestly.  I can't imagine any other way it'd be settled, given national momentum.  		Twenty-one states have RFRA-based legislation on the books.		The way I see it, there are three options: 		1. The Supreme Court will hear an argument. This will lend itself to continuance of their argument that "otherwise valid propositions" that are generally neutral and generally applicable, i.e. discrimination law, will be exempt from RFRA-based legal defenses, 	just like all the other laws that are exempt (Social Security tax, child labor laws, polygamy, existing discrimination laws, etc.,  		2. States will realize the enormous impact, alongside said national momentum, and will seek to protect sexual orientation alongside race, ethnicity, gender, etc., in their discrimination laws.  As this becomes norm, federal discrimination laws will eventually follow this trend, and include sexual orientation in the majority, given the vast majority of states that now protect it. 		3. The federal government will directly address the issue; i.e. sexual orientation will be a "protected status" for anti-discrimination laws via Congressional action at the federal level.  This will lend itself to Option #1, a S.C. argument, that will challenge the constitutionality of a state RFRA-based law.  This will result in successive/immediate overturn of state-based discrimination of homsexuals/LGBT, depending on whether the process is based on Ciruit Court appeal rulings or S.C. rulings. 		Sexual orientation will eventually be included in discrimination law.  I firmly believe this.  Regardless of the path, it'll occur sooner rather than later.

{"body":"A large chamber, about the size of a hot tub, filled knee high with water. A large pipe runs down from the top of the chamber and extends about 2/3 of the way into the water. At the top of this pipe is a large basket constructed from a fine titanium mesh. Located on the sides of the chamber are a door and two air ventilation units. The units operate to suck air from above the chamber through the pipe as well as pump fresh air into the chamber. The ceremony requires the speaking aloud of the sacred text while the choir recites a hymn, " da da da da daa, it's the mothafuckin, D O Double G..."etc etc. When the un-bathed have been properly blessed, they are escorted to the ritual chamber and the door is closed behind them in order to contain the sacred smoke. Once inside the ritual chamber, the un-bathed will seat themselves in a circle along the outer edge. This is their first sacred smoking circle. Of all properly bathed members in attendance, the one to provide the holy herb for use in the service is designated as the flame bearer. The flame bearer is tasked with filling the titanium basket with the ground holy herb as well as utilizing a torch, specially crafted from the hemp plant, a distant relative the holy herb, to ensure the continued conversion of holy herb to sacred smoke. The air units both serve 2 distinct purposes. One unit pumps unconsecrated air into the chamber to provide a concentrated source of oxygen to those inside.

{"body":"An employer is not required to grant an employee's preferred accommodation; it is required only to make "reasonable" accommodations that do not result in "undue hardship" to its operations.  If they were the only person there, requiring them to do their job duties despite their religion would be fine, because there's no accommodation that can be made.  From the [EEOC Guidelines](http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/qanda_religion.html) on religious discrimination:		>**8 . Does an employer have to grant every request for accommodation of a religious belief or practice?**		>No. Title VII requires employers to accommodate only those religious beliefs that are religious and ???sincerely held,??? and that can be accommodated without an undue hardship. Although there is usually no reason to question whether the practice at issue is religious or sincerely held, if the employer has a bona fide doubt about the basis for the accommodation request, it is entitled to make a limited inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the employee???s claim that the belief or practice at issue is religious and sincerely held, and gives rise to the need for the accommodation.		>Factors that ??? either alone or in combination ??? might undermine an employee???s assertion that he sincerely holds the religious belief at issue include: whether the employee has behaved in a manner markedly inconsistent with the professed belief; whether the accommodation sought is a particularly desirable benefit that is likely to be sought for secular reasons; whether the timing of the request renders it suspect (e.g., it follows an earlier request by the employee for the same benefit for secular reasons); and whether the employer otherwise has reason to believe the accommodation is not sought for religious reasons.		>However, none of these factors is dispositive. For example, although prior inconsistent conduct is relevant to the question of sincerity, an individual???s beliefs ??? or degree of adherence ??? may change over time, and therefore an employee???s newly adopted or inconsistently observed religious practice may nevertheless be sincerely held. An employer also should not assume that an employee is insincere simply because some of his or her practices deviate from the commonly followed tenets of his or her religion.		>**9 . When does an accommodation pose an ???undue hardship????**		>An accommodation would pose an undue hardship if it would cause more than de minimis cost on the operation of the employer???s business. Factors relevant to undue hardship may include the type of workplace, the nature of the employee???s duties, the identifiable cost of the accommodation in relation to the size and operating costs of the employer, and the number of employees who will in fact need a particular accommodation.		>Costs to be considered include not only direct monetary costs but also the burden on the conduct of the employer???s business. For example, courts have found undue hardship where the accommodation diminishes efficiency in other jobs, infringes on other employees??? job rights or benefits, impairs workplace safety, or causes co-workers to carry the accommodated employee???s share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work. Whether the proposed accommodation conflicts with another law will also be considered.		>To prove undue hardship, the employer will need to demonstrate how much cost or disruption a proposed accommodation would involve. An employer cannot rely on potential or hypothetical hardship when faced with a religious obligation that conflicts with scheduled work, but rather should rely on objective information. A mere assumption that many more people with the same religious practices as the individual being accommodated may also seek accommodation is not evidence of undue hardship.		>If an employee???s proposed accommodation would pose an undue hardship, the employer should explore alternative accommodations.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"proselitigator","name":"t1_cpvpgme","parent_id":"t1_cpvng1m","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427740228,"created_utc":1427736628}

{"body":"The law as I understand it prevents enforcement of state laws which infringe upon the exercise of religious beliefs, *unless* there is a compelling government interest and the law uses the least restrictive means to forward that interest.		In the Hobby Lobby case (federal, not state) the requirement for employers to provide contraception was not the "least restrictive means", given that the Federal government was already considering implementing a federal program to provide contraception.  So if the feds can do it themselves, then there's no compelling state interest in forcing a religious organization to do it.		If there is a compelling state interest in banning marijuana, then a ban on marijuana is already the least restrictive means of forwarding that interest.  Even Indiana's expansive language ("any religious belief" instead of the "closely held belief" in the federal law) won't change the fact there isn't a "least restrictive ban" available.		Also note that since the federal RFRA was passed, none of the native american religions that have actual closely held beliefs regarding the use of peyote have succeeded in becoming exempt from the federal ban on peyote.  Banning peyote is a compelling state interest (whether it *should* be is a separate argument), and it was not enacted specifically to discriminate against native americans, so the ban remains and does not violate the federal RFRA.		Given that Indiana is a fairly conservative state, the interpretation of their RFRA is going to be left up to conservative state appellate judges and the IN supreme court.  Even as they may find that the state's own equal protection laws are not enough to trump the RFRA, they are still *unlikely* (owing to the same conservatism) to exempt an organization that is transparently and fatuously claiming a religious exemption to the marijuana ban.		The only good news behind the rise of state-level RFRA legislation is that it should form a solid basis of "historic discrimination" that would be necessary to recognizing sexual orientation as a protected class, which would in turn make all of the RFRAs (including the Federal) "unconstitutional as-applied" to discrimination against homosexuals.

{"body":"The law is a "negative space" in a sense -- meaning that a lot of questions don't have answers until they're asked.  Once they are, knowing who is asking and under what circumstances they're asking is often the key to finding an answer.		It seems like Indiana's RFRA establishes a defense -- meaning, if you were sued or criminally charged with some kind of crime, you would argue that the RFRA protects you.   That means that you'd have to argue *why* it should protect you.		You probably would argue that the state has no interest in limiting the religious belief at issue.  You'd also argue that *if the state did* have such an interest, then what you're charged with is not the least restrictive means of limiting the belief.  That's the language of the Federal and state RFRAs that are being discussed:  The government can't limit a religious belief unless it has a compelling interest in doing so, and seeks the least restrictive means to do it.		THEN you would also have to establish that what you're claiming as "limited" is in fact a religious belief.  So you have to convince them that a) it's a belief, and b) it arises from your religion.  It could be a *philosophical* or *political* belief and not be protected.  It could be a religious *opinion* and not be protected.  The Federal RFRA goes further in requiring that it be a "closely held" religious belief.		Since you are arguing that this claim protects you from the suit you're defending against, the burden is on you to convince the court that the law *should* protect you.  That means convincing them that you are actually a religion and that you actually do have that belief.		The court is not required to just take your word for it.  That's where the "you can't prove I don't believe this" argument fails.  It misstates the burden of proof.  		What you would probably do in support of your claim is demonstrate that a) your religion existed before this controversy arose, b) that it held this belief before this controversy arose, and therefore c) you didn't just make this up in order to skirt the law.		Whether or not there is a pre-existing rule the court is bound to follow in evaluating whether or not the requirements of the defense have been satisfied is going to require research into case law.  Where have RFRA-type laws been used as a defense in similar circumstances?  What arguments were raised, and what did the court do in response to those arguments?  Can a clear "black letter" rule be adopted from prior case law?		If not, then the court (probably an appellate court) has to decide whether or not they're convinced that the defense should apply.		GIVEN that the original hypothetical situation involved an exemption from a ban on a so-called vice (marijuana use), you can expect the courts to take a very conservative approach.  They will decide with full understanding that they're setting a precedent, and they will do whatever they can reasonably do in order to prevent the precedent they establish from completely undermining a statutory regime lawfully enacted by the legislature.		Now, once an appellate court does that, and reduces their reasoning to writing in a published opinion, you could then attempt to appeal the reasoning used.  You would probably argue that as a matter of good public policy, the reasoning of the appellate court should be set aside and a different result arrived at.		You'd have to have an argument that the method used to determine whether something was a religion was itself flawed -- not so much that this particular case was decided wrongly, but that it set a precedent that will lead to future harm and future litigation.		You'd be arguing that a court should be *less restrictive* on what it considers proof of a legitimate religious belief, at a time when RFRA opponents and separation of church/state advocates are arguing exactly the *opposite* -- that a claim of religious belief should not be taken at face value.		When the highest court has ruled (or refused to rule), such as the IN supreme court, then the matter is closed as to that argument.  You might get another chance in some other case to re-argue parts of it.  If it involved a federal law or a Constitutional issue, you might get to argue it to a federal district court or US Supreme Court, but probably this would simply be a matter of state law and the IN sup ct would be the end of it.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"taterbizkit","name":"t1_cpvr4gm","parent_id":"t1_cpvpktz","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427742866,"created_utc":1427739266}

That's the definition of discrimination as it applies to civil rights.

In a case where a caterer refuses to do business with a same-sex couple, the plaintiff would have to demonstrate that a CRIME was committed (robbery, theft, assault, etc.) and some loss or damages were suffered.  Those crimes are prosecutable under other laws. Turning away a client *for any reason* is NOT a CRIME.

{"body":">Sexual orientation is considered a protected class at the federal level, I cited the Supreme Court decisions that serve as precedent. Also, you just cited it in your next paragraph.		I said in Indiana, that sexual orientation is protected on a federal level in certain aspects was not relevant to Indiana.		>That's the definition of discrimination as it applies to civil rights. As it applies to legal action, the plaintiff would need to demonstrate loss or damage as a direct result of their membership in a protected class, and that the loss or damage was undue (non-reciprocal or remittant) and extraordinary (not just an inconvenience).		I think what you are trying to say here is not legal action but rather civil case as opposed to criminal case and you don't need to show extraordinary circumstances, just that you were denied a service/product/opportunity based solely on the fact of one of the protected classes. I think that you are confusing a civil case and a criminal case.		>In a case where a caterer refuses to do business with a same-sex couple, the plaintiff would have to demonstrate that a CRIME was committed (robbery, theft, assault, etc.) and some loss or damages were suffered. 		Now you are confusing civil and criminal cases again, in a criminal case there is no plaintiff, it is the government via the prosecutor that is proving that a crime was committed. In a civil case you don't have to prove that a crime was committed, only that you have the right to damages or reparations based on civil law. 		>Turning away a client for any reason is NOT a CRIME. For the state to find for the plaintiff would mean that the State is prosecuting someone for their religious beliefs (violation of the 1st Amendment) and NOT for a crime they've committed.		No, just... no...		Turning away a client based on their race for example is a criminal offence, in some states that have legislated sexual preference as a protected class, such as Washington, turning away a client because they are gay is a criminal offence. There are cases in New Mexico, Colorado and Washington that has judged this in courts. The case in Washington even discarded the 1st amendment defence as irrelevant as the amendment does not provide you the cover to discriminate against third parties, same as slander is not protected by that same amendment.		>"Lawsuits filed" vs. "judgments for" are two different things. U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell was a lawsuit that was filed.		Again conflating civil cases with criminal cases, business owners have been convicted in criminal courts for violating anti discrimination laws.		>Yes, it does. Section 6, article c, "ANY religious belief" includes the belief that there is no god.		No, first off, I can't find a section 6 article c in the federal RFRA and there is no such paragraph in the Indiana RFRA so you might have to provide a link to the full text. Most RFRA stipulates that no person should be restrained in religious exercise, being an atheist there is no religious exercise and ergo you are not covered. 		The Indiana RFRA states the following:		*Sec. 7. As used in this chapter, "person" includes the following: (1) An individual. (2) An organization, a religious society, a church, a body of communicants, or a group organized and operated primarily for religious purposes. (3) A partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association, or another entity that: (A) may sue and be sued; and (B) exercises practices that are compelled or limited by a system of religious belief held by: (i) an individual; or (ii) the individuals; who have control and substantial ownership of the entity, regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes.*		Quite clear that atheists are not covered by the RFRA.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goingdiving","name":"t1_cpw30ty","parent_id":"t1_cpw1q7v","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427762426,"created_utc":1427758826}

{"body":"Technically Atheists don't talk about a godless universe. In fact atheism has nothing to do with existence of deities. Athieisim is about the realisation that RELIGION has nothing to do with deities.		We talk about religion here, because we see the absence of god in religious behaviour. Some people gather in a building once every seven days because they need to see what they can't see. Some people spend spend dedicated times of the day prostrate towards a certain direction because if they don't, they would stop believing.		Religion is actually living proof of Atheisim. Holy books exist because gods don't speak and people want to hear what they can't hear. Temples exist because gods couldn't be seen but people want to see their alleged magnificent god, hence elaborate cathedrals as a substitute. Religiious leaders exist because there is no actual guidance offered by the deity and people need a substitute.		In short, we talk about religion because religion is proof by itself that Atheists are right.
