Actually, that somewhat goes for male genitals, too. I had no idea what a foreskin was until I saw an uncircumcised penis in a porno. All they told us was that foreskin was extra skin at the top of the penis that most people chose to have cut off because it was cleaner and healthier to do that. The diagrams were, to me at that age, a mess of lines and squiggles that didn't really resemble anything. I remember looking at images like [this](https://crunkfeministcollective.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/selfexam.jpg) (except more primitive than that image) without really any context, and not being able to figure out what direction view was facing. 		And our STD/birth control education wasn't much better than abstinence only education. They told us that birth control pills and condoms only had an 80% success rate, and that all others were worse. They then showed us a video that showed gruesome pictures and horror stories of STDs, and it kept assuring the viewers that it wasn't trying to promote abstinence, but that "abstinence was the only sure way of not getting pregnant or an STD."

Some studies are showing it could be 20 weeks, others ~32 weeks.

Nope, Earthworm brains are one of the simplest neural structure we've examined in a lab and is typically used as a starting point when modeling biological neural processes in computer simulations.

At the age of 14, I would have nightmares about getting pregnant with my father's seed due to sitting on the toilet after him. All I knew was that sperm came out of a penis and swam into the vagina. I didn't know about ejaculation, I thought sperm came out constantly. I didn't even know what a penis looked like, just that sperm came out of it and that it carried 30 STDs.		I never made any friends because I didn't understand people's dirty jokes, and nobody would sit me down to explain things. I was bullied all through middle and high school for being the loser and the ugly virgin.		I didn't lose my virginity until 18, which is the same time my first kiss happened. My parents' nonsense and the school's nonsense had created in me a reputation as the "ugly virgin loser," a reputation that I still hold years later in this town. The person I lost my virginity to came from thousands of miles away, as anyone else would refuse.		Incidentally, I'm the child of a 15-year-old mother. That's why I grew up with my guardians.

They can give a realistic view (with real statistics from real studies) on how many kids their age are and aren't sexually active (actually, not everyone is doing it already).  And they can teach them about the inner workings of their and their partners' bodies and how to protect themselves and their partners.

This is true and colloquially, the word 'atheist' is used in a variety of different ways. What I'm telling you though is the way the vast majority of atheists use it is simply to to describe themselves as someone who does not believe in any god. Who sees no good reasons to believe in any gods. In this sense, an atheist is just someone who has heard the claims made by the religious, considered them, and found them to be without merit. 		No belief or dogma is required to reach this conclusion. Nothing needs to be pre-supposed on insufficient evidence.

And I'm only agnostic to precisely the same extent that I am agnostic about Superman, or leprechauns. It's a technical point about the limits of knowledge and a recognition that any of us could be wrong about anything. But that fact alone does not make any the existence of a god the tiniest bit more plausible.
