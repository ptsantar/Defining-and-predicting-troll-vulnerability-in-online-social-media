I'll address this as I didn't before but annulment means to invalidate and erase in the past as well as present.

First of all it has been pointed out that the dmv are acting as agents of the state; which is secular and has laws preventing deiscrimination.		Secondly, and my main point, there is nothing in the Qur'an or Hadith that prohibit a woman from driving.		The only muslim country that prevents women from driving is the Wahabbi state of Saudi Arabia.		Every religious state also has cultural norms particular to them which although not commanded by the religion doesn't nexessarily go against it.		Burqas, chador, etc. are not demanded by Islam but rather are cultural norms in the areas that require them.		It seems pretty obvious that there is nothing in Islam that says women can't drive as Islam predates driving by around 1500 years or so.		Muhammad's first wife Khadijah was a business women who rode and herded camels on caravans of commerce, essentially riding the 'car' of her day.
