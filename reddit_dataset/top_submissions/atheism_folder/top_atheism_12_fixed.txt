{"body":"Your argument never passes the characterization of him as a hypocrite.  That's really all I'm trying to say.  Divorce has been proven time and time again to be a negative experience for children, and having one usually involves putting parents wants in front of the kids well-being.  		Mr Trump isn't trying to prove himself better than anyone else by saying this, and even Christians admit that they themselves "live in sin", so he is probably very aware of your accusation.
