{"body":"So you seem to have a bit more sense than the rest of this thread, so I'll try to answer.		The main point for me is that regardless of what happened these cartoons are offensive, regular news outlet would never publish these, the majority of the French population (Muslim or not) do not approve of them. This is about defending freedom of the press in general not about ostracising a specific part of the population.		And that's where it gets a bit tricky, you want to make a big 'fuck you' to terrorism but you don't want to disrespect 1.6billion people. Why is that because a lot of these people share our principles, I don't know if /r/islam is representative of the muslim world but the response there is what I want to see on the internet as a French person, not this comment thread.		One of the paramount principles of the French Republic is the concept of *la??cit??* (secularism), which means that no religion will get special treatment. That cuts both ways: no special rule will be made to accommodate a religion over another, but no religion will be singled out as the target of abuse. Charlie Hebdo perfectly embodied that, the foreign media has only covered their Islamic cartoons, but they actually attack everyone equally. So if you truly want to embody that ideal of freedom of expression you should not discriminate in your scorn of religion. Look at the cartoons on Christianity and tell me honestly: would they be aired in the US media? Do you think some people would be offended? Now imagine you plaster these cartoons everywhere around those offended Christians, what is the point you are making? Why are you being offensive? Have these individuals deserved your torment?  		Finally having the right to do something certainly doesn't mean that it is the right thing to do. I'm almost certain you don't go around insulting passer bys in the street?

{"body":"America has a larger fear of terrorists than many other countries due to some legitimate terrorist attacks and due to over exaggeration of terrorist threats by certain politicians. 		However, people were "paralyzed by fear" because the threat was literally in their neighborhoods. One of the bombers was caught in someone's backyard. Most people don't expect terrorists to be running through American suburbia.

The fact that the bomber was found in a residential home, in fact, does justify the search more than anything. If that guy hadn't found him, he would have been found by police search.

I'm talking about what an existing, and welcome, indigenous Western style society needs to do to deal with religious/tribal outrage among subcultures.

{"body":"Religion MUST be destroyed.		Edit: 	That was a joke, although religion really should be phased out over time and preferably it should be done as soon as possible. It causes way too much suffering, it's ridiculous how much money is invested into religious organizations, and most of all, it's ridiculous that people in the 21st century still believe in religion in the first place. With the knowledge easily accessible on the Internet only a severely delusional person could not be able to accept reality for what it really is.  Before you argue that not everyone has access to the internet, would it not then be our mission, as a wealthy first world nation, to spread this knowledge so that for once this world may be ruled by logic?		I'm not saying that by getting rid of religion the world will be perfect, but as a species we will be better off. The endless suffering that religion has caused will come to an end. A penny for NASA? How about a cut from the income of the Catholic Church, while the rest goes to charities? And finally, no fools like Ben Ham running around making us facepalm and no dumbfuck far-right religious goons messing with politics.		So go take a long, in-depth look at the image of the Andromeda galaxy that was released a few days ago. Take in reality for how beautiful it truly is and be greatful that by some unbelievable coincidence you, your family, and everything on this planet has come into existence. If you can't open your eyes and see reality for what it is then I'm sorry but your beliefs support something that must be disposed of. You should be forced to give them up or be minced, canned, and sent to Africa to feed the hungry. We are going to need our Epsilons to be strong and healthy.		In all seriousness though, how can you look at the grandeur of this Universe and believe a God came here to create you, and better yet that he did it only a few thousand years ago? And then to think these beliefs have Islamists cutting off heads and shooting fellow human beings over cartoons? Regardless of the fact the extremists represent only a small fraction of the total Islamic population, it doesn't go from an Extremist to the ideal believer - there's everything inbetween. Also, don't be mistaken and thing that religion isn't as messed up in the states, it's just fucked up in different ways.

To the extent that they're moderate they're not believers.		Islam needs to be stripped of its temporal power and then evolutionary pressure will cause it to adapt to modern realities (without state power to aid it) or die off like many religions before it.

{"body":"Sure it depends on how you practise it. A lot of Muslims reinterpret the nastier parts of the Koran and Hadith as allegory and metaphor, or in the context of it's time, though what I think you'll find most people here would object to, and resent being told is that they have to respect people's beliefs. No you don't. This is easily refuted. 		Sure respecting the right to believe is one thing, but there are all sorts of beliefs that I don't respect. Maybe people would rather me be dishonest, but talking honestly, I don't believe Muhammad spoke to an archangel, I don't believe he departed the earth and ascended to the heavens on a flying donkey, and I don't believe the Koran to be revealed truth. I actually think there are very good reasons to think that they are actually quite demonstrably false and stupid beliefs and I claim that right to say so. How many people in the wider Islamic world do you think respect *my* right to think that? Maybe some, but for those that don't. I'm happy for them to not respect my believe. But I demand that they respect the right to do so. 		I, and in my experience, most on this subreddit actually hold more or less the same view on this point, and in a subreddit for people who have rejected and seen through religion. Why would you expect one of these people to respect religious belief as if it is some kind of protected ideology that should never have to face criticism. As it happens many think and feel that religion is so out-dated, and so surpassed be superior newer intellectual thought and philosophy that it is trivially easy to make a joke of it. I'm happy for people to try to do the same of my belief, and if they can do it - good for them. Maybe they'll convince me.  But I'm fed up of being told that religion, particularly Islam should be a protected ideology. No I think it's contemptible . I won't shove that view down your throat because that's unnessary. But if I feel provoked to do so, or I'm asked what my opinion is then I'm not going to censor myself as to what I think. 		Atheism will always be tied to religion so long as religion exists. Those of us who consider ourselves atheists will always feel compelled to think and reflect and share our view about religions so long as they are a force in the world. If they didn't exists we wouldn't have a label and we wouldn't be here talking right now. So if people are demanding some respect for their beliefs how about I offer this counter that people start respecting my right to hold this opinion rather than saying that I'm being insensitive, or even accusing me of bigotry or racism for simply holding an opinion.

{"body":"As much as I agree with this, it has to be said that racism seems to nearly nullify this mutual subversion. I was born in a somewhat catholic family but I wasn't entirely white so I've been dealing with dumb people all my life. Most brown people would see me as an ally and many white people figured I was just tan coming from vacation so I got to see both sides.		Racism is pushing the new people (immigrants, refugees) away. They show up, grow up, hope people are nicer and see all this democracy and education and stuff, then on the street they get spit on, have a harder time getting jobs or education, some dude shows up telling them it's all a lie and xyz god has the answer, they go fight in Syria, die, if they live they come back even more disillusioned and the really messed up ones are the ones doing this shit, shooting people, blowing stuff up.		There are many points at which society/government can intervene. For example (in reverse order), not let Syrian warriors return. Don't let them go in the first place. Try to empower them, adjust for the racism, so they don't get disillusioned and easily captured by manipulating recruiters. Try to fix the racism somehow (not gonna happen). 		Or what I think is best, teach critical thinking skills early and often. Have it be part of the curriculum every year starting in kindergarten. Critical thinking, being able to actually reason, being able to think, to have a BS detector, to know how to think and where to find facts. 		Even if they're religious they'll call out the recruiter for talking BS. Even if they meet racists they'll learn how to better deal with it. Right now, none of them know how to deal with this shit and assholes single them out and promise them answers in the form of some dude who floats in the sky.		Those 3 gunmen were not critical thinkers. They were easily manipulated. They were conditioned to do what they did. They were/are dumbasses. 		So imo, the mutual subversion sounds good on paper and can and will work, if we can figure out a way to help people deal with shit. And not just immigrants, everyone.		**Sources**: personal experiences + knowing muslim kids (many of whom I tutored) who had been approached + kept an eye on newspaper and magazine articles about syrian fighter recruitment.		**PS**: those kids I tutored, some of them were thinking magically instead of critically. "*If Allah wants me to fail this test and make me do it over next year, so be it.*" and "*Those guys who pass every test are simply smarter than me.*"		became 		"*Ok I need to write a summary for myself and do repetition so I know my shit for the test. I need to go over all these notes and use the Feynman technique to see if I really understand it. Those people I thought were smart are really just studying more*." etc.		after I motivated and trained them in studying. So ffs, step in and get critical thinking going.

{"body":"There is certainly reason for concern.  It may be that radical Islam is winning, at least at the present time.  But there is a process that happens even in the most repressive cultures, by which thoughtful people come to question things that obviously do not make sense.  How did Europe emerge from the Dark Ages?  The spirit of human enquiry, the desire to know the truth, is not dead, and it is not going to be easy to kill it.  Even so, the world is in a time of very difficult crises which are developing simultaneously in the areas of politics, economics, religion, and the environment.  Environmental problems are going to get much, much worse, and will become a powerful incentive for the human race to put aside its meaningless squabbles so that more serious issues can be dealt with.  I cannot really say, and no one can really say where all of this is leading.  It would be quite easy to be deeply pessimistic and say that by the end of this century, human civilization as we know it will no longer exist.  But people are very resourceful and very determined when they need to be.  Maybe we will collectively rise to the occasion, as we have done in some past crises.
