{"body":"> no-one cares about it		This was my biggest surprise. I was raised in a very strict religion. When I left, I expected most people to be either curious or atheist. But no, most people (in Britain) have no reason to care. Religion is just irrelevant. 		The biggest surprise was talking to my devout mother in law just before she died. She attended church every week, but she told me that she didn't really think it was true. Wow! I suppose it was just a social thing for her. Or maybe her views changed toward the end?		Of course, America is different. You never had the massive wars of religion in the 1600s. We learned our lesson about fundamentalism. Since then many Anglican bishops have been functionally atheists (notably the bishop of Durham in the 1980s). But intellectual religion does not bring converts, so religion declined. 		America still has the fundamentalists: they still think it is possible to run a nation based on the Bible. We tried that experiment in Europe in the 1600s. We saw the results.

I check  every decision I make with morals inspired within by their examples for living for others.

There is no way you are going to pay for anything like that out of your own pocket unless you are wealthy, and I am asking in case if hospitals in US are doing this kind of thing on purpose as a racket to get as much money as they can out of state medical care and insurance. Our medical system is much worse than it should be.		If so, something should be done instead of simply slapping a universal healthcare bandaid onto it, we should get the hospitals to tear their exorbitant charges down and *then* enact universal healthcare. In this case, we collectively have healthcare affordably and collectively save money.		I think the overcharge of health fees has been overlooked and possibly even supported by the healthcare providers in America simply because it means more money for them in any case, whether from individuals or the taxpayers.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PlebbitFan","name":"t1_csiqq0k","parent_id":"t1_csimynf","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1435273196,"created_utc":1435269596}

We studied the geocentric model (however briefly) before studieng heliocentrism and how Copernicus and Galileo reached their conclusions.

The cost of healthcare in the U.S. is astronomical compared to almost anywhere else in the world. The reason for this is certainly something we disagree on. I'm sure you blame the private sector, I blame the tax code's preferential treatment of employer-provided full-coverage insurance. But let's not digress.		To prove your case, you have to name me a single example of the government providing a good or service that is better quality and costs less than what the private sector produces *in that same country*. I'm sure the government of India can produce an apple for cheaper than the same apple costs to produce in Switzerland. That doesn't mean the Indian government is more efficient than the Swiss private sector. It only means that apples are a lot cheaper to produce in India - and so is almost everything else.		The fact that healthcare costs more in the U.S. compared to Canada doesn't tell us anything about the efficiency of government vs. the private sector. The only way you can measure that is if you compare the cost of private healthcare in the U.S. vs. public healthcare in the U.S., or by comparing private healthcare in Canada vs. public healthcare in Canada. 		Also, the *quality* of healthcare in Canada and the UK (where government not only pays for but also administers it) doesn't come close to places where it is administered by private companies - such as in France, Switzerland, Germany and the U.S. (Look up cancer survival rates in the U.S. compared to Canada and the UK. Americans' survival rate is about 20% higher.)

I don't know what they projected, but they are still rising considerably.

To quote the article:		> Compared with the other 10 countries, the U.S. fares best on provision and receipt of preventive and patient-centered care.		The reason the U.S. ranks poorly overall is because 1. coverage is not universal, 2. healthcare is not equally enjoyed by the population, 3. it's not efficient (it's expensive - a point a readily agree with), and 4. because Americans are less healthy overall (which is due to a combination of poor eating and drinking habits, and genetic predisposition to obesity, diabetes, heart failure and cancer among certain minorities). While these are all urgent problems that need to be addressed, non of them have anything to due with the quality of the actual healthcare enjoyed by Americans with insurance.

If you are insinuating that these schools fare so poorly because they don't get enough funding, please look up how much they spend per pupil.

I'm not vilifying anything. I'm pointing out a problem and trying to solve it. If the problem is the bureaucratic structure of public schools - which breeds employees who lack innovation and drive, and who answer first to unions and second to students and parents - then perhaps a voucher system is a way to empower these students to get the education they deserve.		> Why not face up to the realities of decades of de facto segregation?		I live in a predominantly black neighborhood. Do you? I don't know you, but odds are you don't. The simple fact is that whites have historically chosen not to live in black neighborhoods.

{"body":"Exactly.  There is a difference between practicing religion and learning about religion.  I went to a Christian elementary school and we definitely had a christian focused curriculum in our religious classes and it bled over into the others, but we also learned about other religions and how they were different, what they believed, etc.  The only parts of religion that I remember being in science class was "god does amazing things", which is fair for a private christian school in my opinion.  They also kind of taught "How long is a day for god?" for the seven day story in the bible, but I never heard anything about a 6,000 year old earth from teachers, it was always fairly accurate in the billions.  Now, the school certainly didn't have the best science based curriculum, but creation wasn't taught after the second grade or so (I always just attributed it to it being easier way for children to understand).  Math was taken very seriously at the school though.  		And I generally don't blame religion for the negative things in todays day and age.  I blame humans.  I think Islam is a religion of peace, but you try growing up in a poor, war torn world from the cold war and other battles of tribes and western influence in trying to control your home.  You might get pissed and get together with others who all have the same religious beliefs, with a leader who is probably not right in their head but really charismatic (think Hitler as well) and things get bad.

{"body":">while perpetually shutting anything remotely religious out of educational discussion, based on nothing more than personal bias.		First, no one is saying religion should be shut out of "education discussion," we're simply noting that it does not belong in science class.		Second, how is it "personal bias" to demand that anything taught in science class be supported by evidence?  That is what science is--an evidence-based process.  Would it be personal bias to refuse to teach quantum electrodynamics in bible study, or would it simply be that the subject is not appropriate to the venue?  		One of the primary difficulties here is that you seem to be conflating abiogenesis and evolution.  The two have nothing to do with each other.  Evolution does not concern itself with the creation of the universe (or with the origin of life, for that matter).  Astrophysics does, and there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that the big bang may have been what happened.  It is not a perfect understanding by any means, and we can chase "but-what-came-before" questions down (black) rabbit holes until the cows come home, but the point is that there is in fact *evidence* for the idea.  There is none, not any, for creationism, ID, etc. 		And that is why it is not censorious to keep the creation story out of science class.  As soon as there is actual evidence for it--not even proof, just evidence--then the discussion would change.  		Until then, you may want to look more closely at the terms and arguments you are using.  You should try to understand that to make a case for teaching intelligent design in a science class, you need a better footing than "You can't prove it *didn't* happen that way."","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Negative_Gravitas","name":"t1_csikown","parent_id":"t1_csiin7j","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1435263924,"created_utc":1435260324}
