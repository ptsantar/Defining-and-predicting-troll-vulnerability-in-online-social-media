Think of it like this, major religions have managed to brainwash parents into brainwashing their own children to follow blindly.  THEIR OWN CHILDREN!!! What in the fucking fuck? It's your sole job to raise your child in the best way possible and yet you are so brainwashed that you are willing to place your own child in the same situation? Most children don't stand a chance to get out of this sort of situation as what they are told by their parents is the only thing they have to go by for such a long long time that this idea that it's true becomes so steadfast in their mind.			When it comes to scientology they are finding adults who have large uncertainties about life and their place within it, then exploiting that uncertainty heavily.

Who's definition requires that? I have seen people make this claim, and its absurd. [Here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/religion) is the dictionary.com definition. It does  not say anything about needing to have a deity to worship. And Scientology most certainly has a supernatural origin story for the universe. It has a spiritual belief about the nature of the univese. Why do they need to worship a deity for it to be a religion? 		What about the huge variety of [non-theistic religions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheistic_religions). Buddhism does sometimes include some Hindu gods, but can often be practiced/believed in without any deity of any kind. Raelism is a classic example of beliefs in which there is no deity but aliens are believed to have created humanity. Jainism, as well as many new age religions, hold a sort of belief that "everything is god, and god is everything" but that does not mean they worship that "god". Often religions of this nature revolve around worship of the human soul or at least devotion to betterment of that soul. Worship is a practice of many religions, but not an aspect that defines something as a religion. I know plenty of people who I would consider "worship" things like Star Trek, Marvel, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and other common fandoms, but I would not consider that they are religious in nature, as they do not hold those things as a spiritual or supernatural belif.		> What I understand about Scientology is that they want to "clear" something from themselves to make themselves powerful		Close enough for government work. At a basic level they believe they are an eternal soul which is currently operating in a human body (they believe you ARE a soul, and that you HAVE a body and mind) and the purpose of Scientology is to rehabilitate their godlike power as an eternal spiritual being. At its lower levels they are trying to get rid of what they call the "reactive mind" in order to reach a state of "clear" (a state in which one has no reactive mind) as a prerequisite to working on a simliar process with themselves as a spiritual being. In this aspect its quite similar to Buddhism or a great many new age religions. 		Of course there are a lot of crazy beliefs tied up in there. I am in no way saying their beliefs are bulletproof. Only that they are most certainly religious in nature. They deal with the "cause, nature, and purpose of the univese". They certainly believe the universe (the physical universe) was created by superhuman agencies. They have devotional/ritual observances, both in their auditing practices, as well as in more esoteric ways, such as their belief that you should be quite around injuries or their refusal to use psyciatric medicine of any kind for any purpose. And they absolutely contain a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs. I don't even see how its a debate whether they are a religion or not, nor do I see any reason to even debate whether the Church of Scientology is a cult.

A religion is not just one single belief. Its a group of beliefs which answer that set of questions/beliefs. Their beliefs about how the "world" (universe) came to be (which, btw, is not evolution, but the big bang and general physics, evolution only explains how life developed into its current state) are one of their beliefs. If you can show a religion which has the big bang and evolution as some of its basic beliefs but which also has beliefs regarding a moral code of conduct, the purpose of the universe, the origin or nature of whatever created the universe (or in this case, created the big bang), and observances/rituals then yes, evolution would be a belief of a religion.

I don't know how you've misinterpreted that into being comparable to Scientology. 		Some do. But not all. I know a few non-theistic Buddhists. They believe that the individual IS a deity (in the sense that they are all powerful) and they follow the teachings of Buddha. For all I know they are extremely rare, and not representative of any true sect of Buddhism, but I wouldn't call their religion "not a religion" because they don't believe in a deity outside of humanity. What can't a religion believe that the person themself IS the deity? Why must it be an outside deity? I don't believe there has to be a deity at all, but if you say there has to be a deity to be called a religion then Scientology would still fit. The individual is considered to be "godlike" in their natural state, and its only via the abberations of the physical universe and our existence here on earth that our power is limited. How is that not a religious belief?		> Of course there are multiple definitions for religion. 		Yes. All in a dictionary and almost all apply to Scientology.

I looked up the legal definition and in the first paragraph:		> The Supreme Court has interpreted religion to mean a sincere and meaningful belief that occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to the place held by God in the lives of other persons. The religion or religious concept **need not include belief in the existence of God or a supreme being**		The emphasis is mine... but its pretty clear that as long as the beliefs hold a similar place in the life of the person as a Christian or other monotheistic religious person's belief in god, then it can be considered a religion.		> I know as much as most moderately informed people who aren't cultists themselves can hope to since they keep it as secret as they can		Not even remotely... I know a user that posts about Scientology a lot. She has never been a member and has enough information that I would never accuse her of being uninformed about the topic in general, even next to people who were members for years. I have met quite a few people who know a VAST amount about the cult (some more than me) even though they have never been a member. There are multiple blogs, many books, documentaries on youtube (noas well as BBC, HBO), and journal articles. There is no excuse for not knowing much about the cult if you plan on speaking as if you know something about it. Especially if your assertion is that it is not a religion at all...		I also didnt say you arent qualified to talk about it, only that your lack of knowledge makes you unqualified to say whether or not its a religion since you don't even know what their beliefs are or what their practices are. You are free to discuss it, ask about it, talk about what you have learned and anything of that nature. None of that requires any special level of knowledge.		> But how can tricking people into believing shit that was always intended to be a business scam be a real religion?		Well that would depend on how you interpret the history of the cult. I think its pretty clear that Hubbard designed Scientology as a scam, but I think it was a scam designed to gain him adoration and worship as the "source" of divine wisdom. I do not believe he created it purely for money. Even so, I think Mormonism was developed for very similar reasons, by a very similar person, and thats considered a religion today. I do not understand your assertion that members of a cult are victims and not religious persons. Why can't they be both. 		Scientology fits every definition of religion we have yet come up with from any source outside of what you claimed it was. Everything I have been able to find you have said is only a "usage dictionary", and even the legal definition specifically states that a belief held just as important to a person as god is to a monotheist can be called a religious belief. Thus a believer in Scientology is most certainly a "religious person". 		That does not mean they are not victims. I have often said "Scientology is evil, but Scientologists are victims". They are victims of a predatory cult. But that does not mean their beliefs are not a religion. If we could say that Scientology is not a religion because its obviously untrue then we can also say that Chrsitianity is not a religion because its "obviously untrue". 		> I think you just want to believe the religion is a real, separate thing from the business scam because it makes you less ashamed of having been taken in and made a fool of. 		This was expected. Ive never had a debate with someone without them trying to make it sound like I am irrationally trying to defend my involvement. Its fairly ad hominem and it usually marks when we have reached a point where the person cannot defend their initial claim (your original claim was that Scientology is not a religion). It seems that every definition we have been able to find points toward them being a religion, to include the legal definition that you provided. It does not make the Church of Scientology any less of a religious extremist cult, nor does it excuse involvement in the cult. It simply means that saying they are "not a religion" is false. 		Either way. I feel we are going in circles. The only point I remotely care about is your original point. Anything else is a red herring and not what I am trying to answer here. If you want to take up another discussion on anything mentioned then please be my guest. However, all I care about is the fact that Scientology fits the dictionary (and legal) definition of a religion, and regardless of anything else, they should be legally coded a religion. That does NOT mean that the Church of Scientology should be tax exempt, or even that the Church of Scientology is opperating as a religious organization.","depth":15,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Echo1883","name":"t1_cqcd2zh","parent_id":"t1_cqcbmqb","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1429046641,"created_utc":1429043041}

{"body":"Why does it matter whether David Miscaviage (the current leader of Scientology) believes or not? His belief or his scam does not change how sincerely a member at the lower levels believes. I do not agree that the relative belief of a groups leaders changes whether it is a religion or not. The pope could know that the whole thing is false (I am actually not convinced that he does not...) and it would not make Catholocism any less of a religion. 		I also do not see anything in the legal definition saying that its the leaders who have to believe. All I see is that the belief must be sincerely held for that person individually. 		> Edit: The beliefs of the followers aren't relevant b/c the followers of a cult vs the followers of a religion can be equal in their sincerity. It's the intent of the people running the show that is different. That's why there can by Christian Jebus cults, too. 		Oh... Here is yet another fundamental disagreement. You seem to think a cult cannot be a religion, or that a religion is not a cult. A group can most certainly be both... In fact MOST cults are religions. I also do not believe that its the intent of the people running the show that matters. 		I do not believe Marshall Applewhite was intentionally running a scam. I think he truly believed he was "Do" and was leading his flock to salvation, which just so happened to be suicide. On the other hand I believe that JZ Knight is well aware its a scam, and is only keeping it going because its been successful so far and she makes a lot of money doing it, but I am not sure on that one as we havent seen what she'll do when she gets toward the end of her life. The intentions of the leadership does not define whether something is a cult or not. True believers are capable of creating religions that are not cults just as easily as they can create religions that are cults.		I also highly disagree that the belief of the follower is not relevant. I would say that it is the only relevant thing when deciding whether their beliefs qualify as religious beliefs or not. Its not about whether to organization those beliefs come from.

I'd also like to remind you that the *under God* bit was added afterward and that in none of the previous versions did they mention religion.	Not only that but the existence of the idea of conservatism is mostly "because God".

We were commissioned, so we always want to help our customers in anyway we can to make a sale. Typically we just ask for the taxid #, but honestly as long as we entered something in that field the computer would take it.		So a manager from my first job comes in and says he needs a laptop for the church just before Christmas time. I spend a hour or so trying to sell him a laptop I at least make some money off, I think I got paid 5$ off the one I convinced him to buy. A week later he comes back to return it saying his wife likes this laptop that is on sale better. I make nothing on sale laptop, so I lose 5$ and 2 hours of my time.

Taxes are used for military, health services, debt repayment, social services, education, law enforcement, energy, science, agriculture, infrastructure, etc. Mom and Pop Bagel shop pays their due.
