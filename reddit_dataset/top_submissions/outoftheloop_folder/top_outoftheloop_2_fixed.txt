{"body":"Today, we learned that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from her position with Reddt. We all had the rug ripped out from under us and feel betrayed. 		Before doing that, the admins really should have at least talked to us (and all the other subs that host AMAs, like /r/Books, /r/Science, /r/Music, etc.) (Edit: not to suggest that we expect to know about Reddit's inner workings. Just that there should have been a transition in place or something worked out to ensure that Victoria's duties would be adequately handled, which they are not) We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry (hence taking IAMA private to figure out the situation) She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does. 		The admins didn't realize how much we rely on Victoria. Part of it is proof, of course: we know it's legitimate when she's sitting right there next to the person and can make them provide proof. We've had situations where agents or others have tried to do an AMA as their client, and Victoria shut that shit down immediately. We can't do that anymore.		Part of it is also that Victoria is an essential lifeline of communication. When something goes wrong in an AMA, we can call and get it fixed *immediately*. Otherwise, we have to resort to desperately try messaging the person via Reddit (and they may not know to check their messages or even to look for these notifications). Sometimes we have to resort to [shit like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg3b8/gabe_newell_ama_100_pm_pst/cftfbio) (now [with a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UtV7fvg.png) because I can't link to that anymore for you) where we have to nuke an entire submission just so that the person is aware of the problem.		Part of it is also organization. The vast majority of scheduling requests go through her and she ensures that we have all of the standard information that we need ahead of time (date, time, proof, description, etc.) and makes it easier for the teams that set up AMAs on both ends. She ensures that things will go well and that the person understands what /r/IAMA is and what is expected of them. Without her filling this role, we will be utterly overwhelmed. We might need to scrap the calendar altogether, or somehow limit AMAs from those that would need help with the process. 		We have been really blindsided by all of this. As a result, we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.		**Tl;dr**: for /r/IAMA to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work.","depth":0,"score":6201,"ups":6201,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"karmanaut","name":"t1_csq204d","parent_id":"t3_3bw39q","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435861434,"created_utc":1435857834}

The biggest problem is that many of the celebrities won't care about such a change.  However, the entire point of the AMAs is that it's a bit more candid approach than the typical interview and if that changes, the fans will quit caring and the other media that covers it will as well.		So even if they strongarm in without saying something, it could still be a win for you.

{"body":"Hey guys, we're going to be locking the thread since it's been answered and we want to keep things organized. There's a lot of speculation going on as well, and until more information comes out we want to cool that off. Automod will be working overtime to remove new comments, and if you have any questions, feel free to [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FOutOfTheLoop)		edit: we're making an exception for some comments in reply to /u/kn0thing, [an admin who commented just before we locked up the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq6ekp). Some questions for the admin have been manually approved, while the ones that are staying removed are general commentary or overly-leading questions which aren't going to be replied to anyway. Hopefully this is a fair balance. Remember that this subreddit is mostly for clarification, and commentary can be saved for /r/subredditdrama or elsewhere.","depth":0,"score":-84,"ups":-84,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AdvocateForLucifer","name":"t1_csq6tw9","parent_id":"t3_3bw39q","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435868713,"created_utc":1435865113}
