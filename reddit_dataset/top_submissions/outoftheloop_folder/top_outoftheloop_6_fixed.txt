{"body":"Canadian criminal defense lawyer here. (please note that all of my information on this is from the article that was posted on reddit)		He has not yet been convicted and it is questionable whether he will or not. However if he was convicted, and had no prior criminal record, chances are that he will receive what's called a 'discharge' (a sentence without jail or fine, which isn't considered a criminal record). If he had a prior record, or if the behavior was worst than the initial video and article suggested, he would probably get a 'suspended sentence' (basically probation with no jail or fine). 		If he had a prior record for threats, harassment or violent offenses or if the behavior was much worst than the initial video and article suggested then he could get jail; but even then, it is very rare in Canadian criminal law for anyone to get the maximum penalty. Something like this for a person with a related record could end in a few weeks to a couple months of jail depending on how bad his record was, his personal background and circumstances and what the circumstances of what he did were.","depth":0,"score":713,"ups":713,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FarazzA","name":"t1_ct6r1t0","parent_id":"t3_3dmeay","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437181778,"created_utc":1437152978}

{"body":"> Lemme get something off my chest. My problem with modern feminism isn???t misandrists. It isn???t the petty issues. These are both problems???well, no not even that. They???re symptoms of a much bigger problem. Which is this: modern feminism is owned and run by the most privileged in our society. It???s very rare for a woman with a less privileged background to make a name for herself in feminism. Look at Malala Yousafzai - this young woman almost lost her life because she supported what at it???s core is a feminist cause, the right for girls to get an education in her country. But how often do you see the name feminist attached to her? She never calls herself a feminist, and most others don???t call her a feminist either. I???ve never seen the title attached to her. We praise her good work, but for some reason, never attach the idea of it being a woman???s issue to her - it???s seen in more general terms. Because Malala is a Middle Eastern woman, with dark skin, from a family who is probably well off in her own country but would be considered middle class at best in the Western world, and whose climb to fame was marked not by her rhetoric but her bravery. In my mind, Malala is a feminist. A fantastic feminist. Her father, Ziauddin, is a fantastic feminist. Both of them risk their lives on the daily against incredibly violent extremist groups for the right for girls to be educated. But to modern feminists, they are not. At least, not outwardly. Who is an outward feminist? Almost exclusively wealthy, college-educated, normally attractive white women who have probably not suffered a true days assault in their lives or if they have, it was something extraordinarily petty. Like, ???manspreading??? petty. And it???s becoming increasingly obvious that even these women aren???t the real face of modern feminism. No no - they???re just the pretty monikers who spread this gospel. The people running the show appear to be the most privileged group in Western nations - white, rich, cis, straight, men. The exact people these feminists so often decry, so often are the ones truly running the show. The same journalism which so often paints over travesties like Ferguson, which resorts to fluff even when there are important things to talk about, which demonstrates enormous bias in how they talk about race (the ???black criminals are thugs but white criminals are romanticized??? bullshit). Teach people to be critical of that. Yet it has been decried, and people have taken every opportunity to make it about misogyny, based only on, again, the loud assholes. Sometimes, not even the loud assholes - they go out of their way to find people to use as a front. Who is at the forefront of this mislabeling? Almost exclusively wealthy, college-educated, normally attractive white women etc. And in the background? Wealthy, college-educated, normally attractive white, cis, straight men. The likes of Jonathan McIntosh, Anita Sarkeesian, Phil Fish, and Brianna Wu.  And I have always believed one of the most divisive kind is wealth privilege. There is nothing which separates people more in this day and age than their wealth. People of color, women, LGBT individuals - they all may still have slightly lower privilege, but a wealthy woman has a lot more privilege than a poor man. An upper class person is going to, by default, have a lot more privilege than a lower class person, regardless of their race or sexuality or gender or religion, or any other factor. Those factors can influence wealth, but let???s talk about the wealth. And the thing about wealth: people with a lot of it tend to run on different rules. Wealth gives you a great deal of control over your surroundings and over your life, so wealthy people tend to be a great deal less offended by horrible tragedies in the world UNTIL it directly effects them in some way. Millions of women being forced into sex slavery internationally?  The thing about GamerGate: it includes a lot of women and no central figure, and the majority of the people behind it are between poor and middle class. This is why GamerGate has actually done more for women, in general, than it???s main detractors. Despite the fact that their detractors have enormous amounts of wealth. In fact, GamerGate raised over $70,000 to go towards projects supporting and encouraging women to go into gaming, and over $45,000 in addition to other causes such as Unicef, Child???s Play, and Extra Life. How much has Anita Sarkeesian donated? Or Brianna Wu? By all accounts: not a thing. Anita would probably count her own Feminist Frequency as a charity, even though I can???t identify a single thing Feminist Frequency has done besides put out condescending videos occasionally. Whatsmore, Feminist Frequency has absolutely no transparency in its spending practices - it is impossible to tell how much of her donations actually go to videos, and how much go in her pocket. When other charities do this, it???s a national outcry. When she does it, it???s ignored. Whatsmore, the videos themselves claim to be educational, but frequently feature stolen Let???s Play footage, misrepresent the games within, and at one point even stole art (which she later took down). Nothing she talks about in these videos are new information, nor presenting in a way that would be any more educational than any of the other discussions of video games and female representation in media, yet she receives thousands for it. Brianna Wu originally received $200,000 from her very wealthy parents to start her company, GiantSpaceKat. She then received $400,000 from Kickstarter to create her game, Revolution 60, and another $5,000 to port the game to PC. Both games cost money, with the iOS game costing $6 and the PC game planned to cost $10. She also receives $13,000 a month on her Patreon. Despite being handed money to make things and still charging fairly high amounts ($6 is fairly expensive for an iOS game) it is not apparent that Brianna Wu has donated any of this money to any reputable charity. The same goes for the vast majority of people representing the anti-GamerGate side and feminism in general - some feminists donate money, but most donate to their own charities (a la Beyonce) or donate in fairly small amounts. Generally speaking, these are women who would much rather you give their money to them, than to anyone else. The problem is: this doesn???t help women. It???s just talking. The vast majority of modern feminists do absolutely nothing to actually empower, help, or support women. They just talk. And a great deal of that talking isn???t empowerment, but victimization. Indeed Anita and Brianna seem to have made an industry on victimization. A majority of their Twitter accounts consist of complaining about harassment, or berating GamerGate. Remember, Anita and Brianna have a VESTED INTEREST in keeping other women out of gaming - they want a monopoly on it. Because then they can complain more about ???where are all the women??? while still marketing their own products based exclusively on their genders. ???Buy this, because it was made by a woman??? was essentially Revolution 60???s catchphrase. They don???t want empowered women. The very powerful men behind them don???t want empowered women. But they???re going to pretend like that is their goal, for the same reason politicians claim it???s their goal - because obviously you aren???t going to be forward about that. Recently the Anti Defamation League introduced a ???curriculum??? which essentially makes children talk about ???sexism in games??? which wouldn???t be so bad if it were not so indepth and so seemingly designed to teach men ???You???re terrible because this happened??? and teach women ???You can never get into this industry because they hate you there???. Remember ShirtGate? How so many ???feminists??? claimed this was going to scare women out of the industry, when in reality what was going to scare them more than anything was the constant bellowing rhetoric about how women can???t go into STEM because they???ll be scared away by ???evil misogynists???? Why is it instead of pushing things like this, feminists don???t implement a curriculum teaching kids, ALL kids to make their own games? Why is it, feminists don???t fund more programs to get girls interested in STEM? Why is it everything modern feminism apparently does has no tangible benefit? Don???t get me wrong - I still consider myself a feminist. Maybe a bit of an old fashioned one (or maybe, a bit more progressive). I want to design a game with an all female cast. When I create stories, I go about it specifically thinking of how to empower female characters. When I think of what it would be like to be rich and famous, all I can think about is ???I???m gonna fund scholarships, and programs, and children???s clubs, and museums, and I???m gonna make the world better???. It???s the same rhetoric used to keep many in the South bigoted, by teaching them to fear the unknown, defunding education, and making sure the population never questions. It???s the same rhetoric used by cults, who won???t let members venture outside for fear they might realize they???re being taken advantage of. It???s a tactic used, time and time again - make the lesser people afraid of something else, pin those groups against each other, and enjoy as you are able to do whatever you want without consequence, because the people who could rise up against you are too distracted by bullshit to stop you. If that is what you want to support, FINE. But don???t be surprised when nothing changes. Don???t be surprised that sexism is still a thing, that women are still underrepresented, that nothing has improved. Because under current feminism, it won???t. It can???t. It???s not the end goal. If you don???t want to support all that, congratulations. You???re a decent human. So stop, listen, and actually work on a change, instead of just worshiping and parroting celebrities who don???t give a shit about you.","depth":11,"score":-9,"ups":-9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Nikhilvoid","name":"t1_ct6s3bl","parent_id":"t1_ct6rzgc","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437158097,"created_utc":1437154497}

{"body":"I worked in a NY prosecutors office for a while, and have prosecuted harassment cases (not a long while, it was during law school for over a year). At least in my limited experience what happens in most Harassment cases is both people/sides are some what guilty.  It usually comes down to the prosecutor deciding who to prosecute.  That is, who is more culpable, if anyone at all.  A lot of times it's people arguing and one of the two crosses a line.  It's not always cut and dry.  		In this particular case, who knows why the police investigated this situation.  We're getting into over speculation territory, but it seems possible they got involved because she actually met and knew this guy in real life, and maybe knew someone inside politics to help her.  The real life connection makes the name calling and swearing closer to home, so to speak.  		It's Canada, and while the law described sounds familiar, I have no clue what their process is.  Plus, even in the states prosecutors have different ways they handle things within their own office.  		edit:  I will say when I learned you could get charged with Harassment for swearing over the phone (even if shouting it angrily) I was floored.  Swearing and yelling was not something I was unfamiliar with growing up.  Not just in my own family, but friends, etc.  It just seemed like normal, everyday life.

{"body":"Also, I presume the harassment laws are similar in Canada as in the UK, but over here there's no sort of "well it's a public forum" defence available for cyber-harassment. I'm oversimplifying here, but essentially all that needs to happen is for someone to communicate to a person that they no longer wish to be contacted by that person, and then that person persisting, for there to be a case of harassment to answer. 		This happened to a family member of mine - basically at the point you get the police involved, they then issue a notice to the harasser that if they try and contact the person anymore, they'll be committing a crime. Unless the harassed person reopens a dialog, they just need to try and make contact for there to be a crime committed. It's referred to as a "course of conduct", I think, so it can't just be a single instance that constitutes harassment. Note that the notice isn't a *requirement* for harassment to be proven, it's just a very helpful document for the police to use in building a case. If the harassment is serious, the police can proceed to charges without needing to issue the notice.		In this instance it does seem to me like the guy had been told fairly unequivocally not to bother those women. In making a judgment of harassment, the police and the courts aren't meant to consider things like "well she seemed shitty herself" or "both parties are at fault" - all that needs to happen is for one person to bother the person against the other one's wishes. It seems pretty obvious that he was doing slightly more than just "disagreeing" with feminists - he was actively bothering them online.		The defense that it's a public forum is pretty obtuse if you ask me - one could make the same argument that because you were at speaker's corner in Hyde Park when someone started shouting abuse at you then there's therefore no crime committed.

{"body":"From the perspective of somebody who hasn't seen what the accused actually said, I can't say for sure what the accused was not harassment.		However, what I can say is that the current feminist movement has a lot of serious assholes in it. It's not even so much that they make claims that we live in a rape culture and that women are poorly treated. While I'd argue those issues aren't particularly common, sure, they are bad things if reasonable things can be done to prevent them then fine look in to doing them. No, what bugs me is how completely inappropriately the subject is brought up by these so-called feminists. And how often they overlook how equal things actually are between men and women in the modern west.		The most recent example I've come across of this is at the Game of Thrones panel at Comic Con 2015. [A pair of ladies decided to be edgy and grill the cast](https://youtu.be/SJS5bDJUUdw?t=32m42s) about if they'd see more strong female characters in game of thrones, and if they'd show the bad side of the rape culture in future series. First off, I think it's a fairly loaded question, how many people actually see a rape scene in Game of Thrones an think "Wow, that's awesome" because that's how they appear to think most men perceived the scenes that they're bringing up. Then there's what is brought up by the cast in that atrocities of a sexual nature aren't limited to women. Varys, Theon and an entire army of 8,000 have all found themselves literally emasculated. The comments about the pitfalls of patriarchy, well, we kind of already had that with Tywin Lannister literally a father figure who ruled somewhat cruelly. And that's not even mentioning that the two most powerful people in Westeros for the last season were women, Danerys and Cersei. Or all the other powerful women, be it those in influence with Melisandre (Primary adviser of Stannis) or as skilled combatant in the form of Brienne who defeats the \*\*fucking\*\* Hound. Coincidently it's already shown that Rape is frowned upon due to the fact that Jamie helps protect Brienne from rapists, not once but twice (The fight when they get discovered travelling from Robs army to Kingslanding, and through Jamie lying about the wealth of Tarth family to get the thugs who capture them to treat her better no such luck for Jamie though he loses a hand). Yet, to these feminists, the show needs to do more to show equality and the impact of oppression.		This isn't the only case, there's a widespread movement targeting the game industry right now in a way that is not dissimilar to how Jack Thompson targeted video game violence. Most gamers would love there to be more women interested in the medium, sure there are some immature jackasses with the mentality of a 13 year old when it comes interacting with girls in games, but more often than not they are literally 13 year olds. Should games have more strong female characters? Sure, I don't see how that would be a bad thing. But the argument that games not have any attractive women in them stinks. Are men not allowed to find women attractive any more? Can games not be made that target the male audience? When there are [a number of games that do provide strong female](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Women_Characters_in_Video_Games) (this list is by no means complete) and a huge number of games that have asexual characters just look at pretty much every Nintendo game for examples. If you look at this purely objectively then it's quite like that there are far too many female characters in games compared to the female audience considering how much more popular games are with video games are with males (the only statistic to the contrary showing equal interest is the result of a survey that asked women if they had ever played a computer game. This survey counted people who played bejewelled a few times on their phone 10 years ago alongside people that go out and buy $500 consoles every few years). But regardless of this equality, is it enough? No, women are being oppressed. We need more women in the games industry... There are a huuuuuuge number of women developing games. It's not a 50/50 split, but again, gaming has not been a particularly popular pasttime for most women. If you went to a school 10-20 years ago and surveyed kids about what they wanted to be when they grew up, I'd be hugely surprised if any of the women said "Game developer" it just wasn't hobby that interested them as much back then. So really, how can you expect complete equality in the industry when there hasn't been enough interest?		Anyway, this rant is getting hugely long. So I'll wrap this up:		tl;dr: The guy may or may not have harassed this lady, but the reason people are so shocked is a result of the extreme likelihood that this feminist isn't a feminist, but somebody that perceives the world with extreme prejudice about how men are terrible and that women are being treat unequally.

{"body":"What the women did is not illegal, because they're not slandering the game creator. If the guy didn't want people (including potential employers) to know that he made a game where you beat a real woman to death, he shouldn't have made it. Once he publishes such a thing, it's totally legal to inform employers/friends/the media/etc that he made it. If that reflects poorly on him, it's his fault for making something that the majority of people find distasteful. It would only be illegal if these women were, for instance, calling potential employers and telling them that he's a paedophile or a rapist because they were angry about the game he made - that would be defamation and is prosecutable. But a polite email referring employers to a link where they can learn about the game, and text such as "I'm sending you this because I'm concerned having this person on staff might tarnish your company's image" is fine. It is then up to the employer to view the content and make a decision based on it. 		IMHO this is not a double standard, because this kind of thing happens to women all the time - particularly if the woman in question has done porn or something, people (often ex-boyfriends, sadly) will direct potential employers to the woman's porn video and express concern about the company's image. The woman can't really do anything about it, because she made the porn and has to wear the consequences of it (that people may not want to employ her). It happens to all kinds of morons on the internet who tweet/post racist or offensive comments, too - people will find the racist's employer and link them to the tweet to try and get the person fired. If the tweet is genuine, there's nothing the person who posted it can do, because there are no laws protecting you from the consequences of your comments/the material you produce. The best you could try to do is sue the people who alerted your employers to your offensive comments in civil court, and you might win money for lost wages if you can prove that there was a campaign against you to keep you out of a job. But there's no criminal charges to be laid - if you made the thing and people don't like you as a result, tough cookies.		The crime that this guy is accused of (stalking/harassment) is totally different. While it has never gotten a conviction based on internet comments before, the rules are basically the same - if you continually bother someone (in a mean way, a loving way, or otherwise) despite them telling you to stop, and make them fear that you might harm them, you're stalking/harassing them. You don't have to threaten to cut their throat - if I followed you around saying "I love you! Have a great day! :)" constantly, despite you telling me to fuck off, and then one day I stepped in really close and said with a huge smile "If you don't start telling me that you love me back, I might do something crazy and force it out of you!", and that made you feel scared that I was going to go all *Hostel* on you...that's stalking. Even if all I meant was that I was going to feed you delicious cake until your feelings about me changed. 		These women are arguing that this guy did the internet version of what I described above, only with a lot more animosity. After months of fighting/insulting online through hashtags, despite these women blocking him, this guy made a creepy comment that implied he might be following/watching them, and made them feel afraid that he might hurt them. That is a pattern that you could consider stalking, and that's why the prosecution would have lodged charges against him. 		Personally, I don't think he will or should be convicted, because the case is very weak and I the women involved continued tweeting about him after blocking him which makes harassment a hard sell. But comparing what this guy did to what those women did to the game developer is misleading, and it's also misleading to imply that what those women did to the game developer should be illegal. That game developer crossed a line in making the game he did (hell, Anita Sarkeesian could probably make a case for charging *him* with harassment, but that's a whole other issue)  , and it's not illegal for people to inform potential employers that he made highly offensive content.

{"body":"Did I say anywhere that I was okay with it ethically? Ethically, I think it stinks. I work in a profession where my entire professional reputation could be compromised or destroyed if I ever posted something offensive or even just...anything at all that was unsavory, a drunk photo or a stupid youtube video could compromise me. I live in terror of an ex-boyfriend somehow obtaining or posting revenge porn. I kind of hate that people's lives can be ruined these days because they had a moment of idiocy and posted an offensive tweet or - even in this case - an angry flash game.		However, that's the way the world works now, and - as I've explained in numerous comments now - the law will not protect you from the consequences of what you say online. If you post something terrible, people can legally make sure that every person on earth knows what you did - and if they never harass you directly, there is nothing illegal about it, even if it's ethically bankrupt. You're asking what is stopping someone from exposing a threesome or a BDSM relationship etc? Essentially, nothing - at least, there's nothing criminal about it (unless you post non consensual photos or video, that has been outlawed in a few places), and people do it all the time. Look at how the Duke university porn star was outed, for example, and for every high profile case like that, there's a hundred little ones. The guy who made that flash game posted it under his real name, and it came back to bite him - it's really sad and I'm sure he regrets it, but the people here crying for the law to come down on him are crying in vain. He legally posted line-crossing highly offensive content, and it's legal to link potential employers to it. Unless the law changes, the best shot anyone has is to attempt to sue for damages in civil court (even then, it's a stretch). I guess I hope that if people realise the law won't protect them from the consequences of their free speech, they'll be more careful about reputation management and not impulsively post stuff under their real name that will ruin them. 		I also think it's a little bit of a double standard that a lot of the men who are furious at feminists for ruining this guy's chance of employment  (particularly those from GG) are in some cases the same people who were angry about The Fappening getting shut down, despite it essentially doing the same thing in a less legal way (exposure of nonconsensual porn has now been outlawed in a few places).

The point of free speech is that it doesn't have to be reasonable. You're also allowed to say unreasonable things.

The prosecution in this case obviously thought that, in context, the tweets about their location were sufficiently threatening to lodge charges.		As for whether the women who travel around criticizing should be prosecuted, it depends on the form that their criticism takes. If they follow around a specific person and constantly criticize him directly despite him blocking them or telling them to go away, that could be considered harassment (if there's reasonable fear that they may harm him based on the comments they're making, it's stalking).  If they're not talking directly to him, but are directing potential employers to a highly offensive video game he created and/or blogging or giving media interviews about why they think the game is horrible - no, that's not illegal. They aren't harassing him or threatening to harm him, they're informing potential employers that he made highly offensive content (which they could argue is in the best interest of companies who might experience backlash for employing him) and critiquing someone's published work. The word "published" is key - he published his game, it wasn't taken from his hacked computer or anything, and so he isn't protected from people not wanting to employ him or people criticizing what he's made.		As I said above, I think the harassment case these women are lodging is weak and I would be very surprised if there's a conviction.

If you look at the bare elements of this case without applying opinion or bias, you can see where the bones of a harassment/stalking charge would be - he kept talking to them after they blocked him, and then made comments implying that he was following them, which they claim gave them reasonable fear that he might harm them.		Do I personally think this guy made a frightening/threatening enough comment in a threatening enough pattern to warrant criminal charges? I have already said no.

How about the fact that she was constantly colluding with other people to try to gang up on him? How about the fact that she repeatedly talked about HIM on Twitter and sent him barrages of tweets, at least as many if not more than he did towards her? How about the time when she sent fourteen tweets in a row at him over the course of a few days before he even replied once? That she was still tweeting about and to him, in barrages of several tweets, right up to and even after his arrest?		What about the time when she insinuated he was a pedophile for responding to a fake 13 year old profile one of her friends had set up?		How about the fact that this whole thing started in the first place because Elliot didn't approve of Guthrie trying to organise a online lynch mob against a thirteen year old boy who had criticised Anita Sarkeesian and she said she didn't care if the boy committed suicide over her harassment of him?		How about that Guthrie admitted there was no single tweet that actually instilled fear in her?		>When he asked her to point to one ??? just one ??? that had instilled fear in her, she snapped, ???That???s not how feelings work, Mr. Murphy. They develop over time.??? When the lawyer suggested she wasn???t fearful, that she???d made fun of Mr. Elliott and taunted him, she sighed theatrically and said, ???There???s no perfect victim, Mr. Murphy, and no perfect way to respond to being stalked. Sometimes you have to fight back a little bit???. I???m sorry if I wasn???t a perfect victim.???		Does this exchange in court with Guthrie sound reasonable to you, where she claims that she should be able to say whatever she liked about Elliot but he should not be allowed to respond:		>Mr. Murphy then suggested that what Mr. Elliott had been doing was defending himself, and his views, when he was being attacked on Twitter by her and the other complainants. Wasn???t he entitled to do that?		>???He???s entitled to defend himself to the world, Mr. Murphy; he???s not entitled to do it to me.???		>???No matter what you say about or to him???? Mr. Murphy asked.		>???Not to me,??? she said.		http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-the-twitter-trial-of-gregory-elliott-is-becoming-much-like-twitter-itself-shrill-and-uber-sensitive","depth":7,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bobbage","name":"t1_ct71mts","parent_id":"t1_ct70hcv","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437172693,"created_utc":1437169093}
