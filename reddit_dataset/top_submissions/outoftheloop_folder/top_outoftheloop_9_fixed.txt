{"body":"As most of you know this whole ordeal started because many mods felt that the lack of communication between themselves and the admin was absurd, and when we lost /u/chooter with no warning many subreddits were left high and dry. Thus the whole clamour started because mods were tired of playing nice with the admins. In response /u/kn0thing posted [this]( https://i.imgur.com/XoL3pdJ.jpg) and essentially promised that Reddit admins would open new lines of communication with the mods, put a new ama protocol in place, and general work on giving mods the tools that they've been needing for years. With such a response the mods of /r/pics were likely assuaged and so brought /r/pics back online. We'll need a mod from /r/pics to confirm, but this, along with internal discussion, is almost certainly why they're online again. 		(On mobile, I apologize for my typos and am currently praying that I didn't screw up my link)		Edit: /u/beernerd was kind enough to confirm this for us a few comments below.","depth":0,"score":594,"ups":594,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ArchCypher","name":"t1_csr1fw1","parent_id":"t3_3bzmrp","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435939321,"created_utc":1435935721}

Why do you think they wouldn't have discussed this stuff as part of their ongoing site development? The software around this site wasn't started today.
