This is more like, she physically assaulted someone in the office, or got caught shooting up in the bathroom, or something. 		No room for niceties. She won't say why because it reflects poorly on her. The company won't say why because they don't want to deal with potential liability.

{"body":"So, which demise are you speaking of? The fact that you filter out any and all discussion topics (even remotely) related to GamerGate from /r/Games just means you're a power tripping dude pulling rules out of his ass, not much else.		GamerGate, or the ideas and people supporting it, has achieved pretty much all it could given all the media slandering and smear campaigns. The main goal has been partly achieved as the pressure coming from the revolt/tag/movement/whateveryouwanttocallit is the number one reason many of the gaming sites have now published ethical codes related to sponsorships, relationships and gifts, new publications were created and some publications were reformed. It has created a platform for people to organize and closely watch the industry's BS, resulting in an excellent watch dog.		/r/KotakuInAction has almost 45k subs and in the last month, it achieved half the traffic /r/Games did. More and more mainstream figures are starting to mention "SJWs" (Joe Rogan podcast, Red Letter Media, explosm, to name a few off the top of my head). Some big game developers are now starting to critique Anita's work, core Id Software employees on Facebook laughing at her Doom tweets, Ubisoft Watch_Dogs devs coming out against her, lead developer of Vanishing of Ethan Carter dismantling her claims (and claims of many other aligned publications, like Polygon) etc. etc.		The message is alive and well.

I mean, you guys still haven't even realized that most feminists don't really like Sarkeesian.

I'm sorry, but the bulk of available evidence simply doesn't support Pao's allegation, so I see no reason to treat it with unwarranted respect (especially as every couple of weeks more of the Pao shitshow gets aired out and we see new aspects of her contemptible behaviour. If you are going to take someone's word for something, then their character is relevant to that).		The main reason I have a problem with Pao's case is that she pulled a gender card for personal gain, got caught doing so, *and made it that much harder for legitimate cases of sexism to be dealt with fairly*. Pao's a grifter, but because she's got a vagina she's been protected from a lot of the consequences of that by activists and supporters. Hell, she got given the CEO role at reddit straight off the back of suing her former employer (something that would make you *unemployable* in most industries). That job offer also stinks of cronyism. There's a lot there to criticise, but because  of cries of *oppressed asian woman* and *misogyny* (and of the *genuine* misogyny of some MRAs, who you clearly discount as an entire group) you can forget about any possibility of that ever happening.		It disappoints me that the usual suspects refuse to condemn Pao just because she has a vagina. It encourages the ongoing infantilization of women (ie. all women are victims, women can never behave badly or self-servingly, and they'll never be held responsible for their actions. If a person is never allowed to fail, to be judged, then their genuine achievements cannot be truly lauded. Success becomes nothing more than a participation award), and encourages the belief that women use their gender in the service of lying for gain (because that's exactly what happened here, people can see that, and the lack of acknowledgement of that wrongdoing by women's advocates can only leave one with the assumption they support that kind of behaviour). 		You can try to put the entirety of problems here at the MRA's door, but I think that's more than a little disingenuous.		> You'll have to forgive me if I don't find their judgements or protestations to be in good faith. Even if Pao's weren't either, the MRA set never cared about the truth. They cared about political points.		I would argue that the vast majority of women's rights activists are guilty of exactly the thing you ascribe to MRAs. The only difference is your own bias.		The truth is that there is a lot of vested interest on both sides, and both sides love to discount the entirety of the other's position based on the worst among the other. It's about as difficult for me to find an MRA saying *all women are lying whores* as it is to find an intersectional feminist saying *all white men should be killed*. There's truth and bullshit on both sides of the fence, not just one side.		> And really, that's the problem - if they weren't such whiny little nitwits maybe their constant chorus of claiming victim status wouldn't have drowned out the legitimate criticism's of Pao's record.		When you use your own sexism in diminishing the validity of gender issues of the gender you don't care about you immediately kill any credibility you had in the assertion you just made. Why would I believe you're anything but a self-serving, close-minded bigot after what you've just said? 		Sexism is a legitimate issue, but it's not just a legitimate issue when it happens to you and yours, and irrelevant when it happens to people you obviously don't give a fuck about (especially when it's you perpetrating that sexism). Plenty of us are more than willing to address gender issues, but we have no reason to listen to or otherwise tolerate self-serving hypocritical bigots in the pursuit of that. 		Pao's situation is a valid subject of criticism and discussion, and the fact there are MRAs that utterly despise her and feminists that uncritically worship her doesn't change that one bit. If you personally choose to be openly and unashamedly sexist during that discussion, then I suggest you find someone else to talk to.","depth":15,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cfuse","name":"t1_csrrebt","parent_id":"t1_csrb25b","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435995381,"created_utc":1435991781}

Since the IAmA mods didn't get any notice about what was happening and weren't told about the alternative (AMA@reddit.com) early enough. Which messed up everything. But the reason might be that the board simply couldn't tell them beforehand. Of course they might simply have mishandled it, that is absolutely a possibility as well.

I mean, I'm willing to listen to whatever story might come out about why she was suddenly and immediately let go, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be able to actually criticize what happened.		EVEN IF there is some vile circumstance out there that /u/chooter might have been involved in that somehow would justify immediately letting her go, that is still extremely short-sighted on the part of Reddit, given what her position and her duties entail. A team, an inbox, and a point of contact are simply not enough. Practically zero notice of this is completely unprofessional on the part of Reddit and it seems utterly unbelievable that they did not understand how big of a part she played in many AMAs and across many default subreddits, the ones that garner the largest amount of traffic.		If there is any notion that Reddit or its admins had a kneejerk reaction to something and fired a hard-working, caring person like Victoria before figuring out the whole story (ESPECIALLY before an American holiday weekend, what a terrible time to get rid of someone so crucial to Reddit when more people will be on Reddit) they will catch holy hell from the Reddit community for it and the default subreddit moderators (and those who command large subscriber followings, 500k+) will definitely have reason to be concerned.		To everyone's credit, no one is talking yet about what really happened, which is at least some credit to professionalism, but I completely expect with the amount of effect its had on the defaults as well as moderator response that we get an answer on what happened.","depth":6,"score":28,"ups":28,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dresdenologist","name":"t1_csqhdw9","parent_id":"t1_csqfsq7","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435886603,"created_utc":1435883003}

There was also this brand new, super swanky DRM encryption from AACS that would make Ubi Soft blush. It took years too develop and cost Trump ego money,  hundreds of millions, if not billions.		Enter Arnezami of Doom9. This guy was like that 4chan hacker guy, but from back in the day or something.

The crowning victory would make circle jerk hang up their spurs and go straight. The whole cheat code spread across multiple entries turning the whole front page into a cheat code.		In the end the diggers won. Hanging his head in shame, master digger himself Kevin Rose said, "Fine, you fuckers do what ever you want." 		Then he turned digg into a living abortion and here we are.

Nobody is more terrified of anything more than being called a racist, or being "exposed" as a racist (because everyone is racist to some degree and therefor any accusation of "racist" already has some truth to it, which explains the terror that everyone seems to have).		The situation has come to a head though. It's likely they DO want to use AMA for advertising purposes, and to remove anything stopping that from happening. Victoria.		But they tried to use political correctness as a tool to get away with this other motive of theirs, which has worked in the past. PC is such a powerful part of society as a tool for controlling thought and speech that in the past, people have been able to use it for whatever end they wanted. Money, power, repression in general.		But we're reaching the point that this tactic isn't working, as we've seen here it backfired in a big way because the people using it are in denial. They've gotten cocky. Look at what happened to Pao attempting to make money off of feminism by suing her prior employer. This stuff is built into these people at this point and their lives revolve around it. It is something they use to make themselves richer and more popular.

IMO reddit's made some big mistakes in the past few months/years because of how quickly they're shuffling admins around.

{"body":"I used to be /u/daychilde. That'll be a broken link now. I deleted /u/daychilde because of my frustrations with the reddit admins.		I came here in 2009 because of the support redditors had for [the Glenn Beck meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_v._Eiland-Hall). I ended up staying here - moved here from Fark (where the meme originated). I started moderating a few small subreddits, and worked my way up into modding /r/pics, /r/videos, /r/politics for a little while. 		I took over /r/NotTheOnion when it had 200 subscribers and was dead and abandoned by its creator. I built that subreddit up to I think it was around 20k subscribers. We needed more mods than just me, so I brought on a team - and then cut them loose. So I'm the father of /r/nottheonion. And I'm still proud of that.		As much as I have spoken up to defend the admins from some things I thought were unreasonable; as much as I tried to be understanding as they have been historically understaffed, I really started to have my fill a year ago or so. I withdrew from moderating defaults and started to pare down my involvement.		A few weeks ago, I deleted /u/daychilde. I stepped away from /r/discworld, which was another bit of pride and joy, because I just got too tired of the admins ignoring all contact attempts, as well as the tolerance for hate speech of all kinds in too many subreddits.		I've tried to move on with my life, but I come back from time to time to browse a little from this account. There's nobody to take over my local city's subreddit /r/panamacity, and to be honest, as disappointed as I am in the way things are on reddit, it's a hard addiction to break.		Although I didn't know Victoria personally on reddit, I saw all the work she put in. So I support going dark in protest of this. It's just another time where the admins do something without considering consequences. And in their defense, I think they try to do things to help a lot of the time, but for whatever reason - not enough of them or I don't know what the hell - reddit basically has very very little in the way of leadership.		Sure, it's supposed to be true that subreddits can do pretty much whatever they want, but one of the really great things about reddit was all the good people here. But these good people give up and leave when there's so much crap that they eventually get tired of.		Mods should have access to the admins. Admins should communicate and coordinate with the mods. Or else you get chaos. Kinda like what we have right now.		So reddit is still fine enough for looking at pictures. And there's still some amazing things here. But like so many others before me, I don't care anymore. The reason I'm posting this rant? Because I miss the time I had here. I'm sad that it's gone. I think it's bullshit. I wish I could get that feeling back.		But no, I come for a little brainless entertainment, and find subreddits shut down because the bullshit continues.","depth":0,"score":81,"ups":81,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_csqlqag","parent_id":"t3_3bxduw","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435895171,"created_utc":1435891571}

I quote the comment:  		Reddit management was pushing Victoria to do a bunch of highly commercial things around AMAs, but Victoria wasn't comfortable with these ideas because she didn't feel they were good for the reddit community.		One example -- people at reddit wanted to do video AMAs, and Victoria thought that was a mistake.		Given Victoria's resistance to management ideas, they decided to abruptly eliminate her position and let her go.		They didn't tell any of the moderators.		They really underestimated how much moderators relied on her and cared about her.		This had nothing to do with the bad Jesse Jackson AMA.		Remember guys, this is not fact yet but one possible explanation which may or may not be true.

{"body":"**TL;DR: Reddit is becoming an unresponsive corporate black box. A corporation isn't something you contribute your heart and soul to - it's something you pay your money for and demand your services from. Stay with your community, Reddit, and your community will stay with you.**		Hi Reddit. I want to talk a little about the community. I'm not pretending to be an expert; I'm not (I use Reddit just a few times a month and only recently made an account). But even from my limited experience, it's a shining example of what good can happen when this kind of interaction is "democratized", and how much collapses when you lose that fundamental tenet.		There's the whole spectrum of "Community" to "Corporate". We all know where things lie: for tech companies, Microsoft is firmly on the Corporate side, Google is perhaps more responsive to its users and does a lot of open-source and freeware, so it's a little less corporate, stuff like fully open-source software is entirely from the Community, facebook's framework is very corporate, but its content is very Community. Both have their ups and downs. But Reddit. Reddit is supposed to be a Community. It always has been. Yet now in the minds of users, it's drifting toward Corporate. *And a corporation isn't something you contribute your heart and soul to - it's something you pay your money for and demand your services from.* Reddit can't work like that. It has always been a Community, and it needs to stay focused on that.		Here are a few major issues.		* At /r/announcements, there are posts that have *more downvotes than upvotes*. That is deeply disturbing and wrong for a community-based website, and you need to respond to to the community's wants and needs. It doesn't mean you have to take every suggestion - but you have to be communicative and ready to compromise when there's a disagreement.		* On the /r/fatpeoplehate controversy: Yes, we appreciate the need to moderate hate speech. But wherever there is freedom, there will be things like this - you can't have the IAmA or TodayILearned without having the fatpeoplehate or coontown. I don't know how to resolve this fundamental flaw of human communities, but you need to communicate and figure out a compromise solution reasonably agreeable to everyone - that's what Reddit is designed for, after all.		* On the /u/chooter controversy: You've got to be more responsive. You *cannot* just remove a critical member of the Reddit community for no apparent reason and expect things to chug along as usual. Enough has already been said and done that the message should be crystal clear.		And a little video to close with: http://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media	"If you want to succeed, you've got to be okay to just lose control." It would do the community and your company a lot of good to listen up to those last few words - of your own co-founder, no less. Give up that Corporate control and give some to the Community that devotes itself so much to you.		If your company so clearly doesn't share the same passions and drives as the community, we have to wonder: How come the unpaid moderators are so much more responsive to and respectful of the community than the paid admins are? How come the company isn't the "democracy" it was originally meant to be? Has reddit's time finally passed? It's something that's got to be figured out now, before Reddit goes the way of Netscape and Myspace and the others.		So is it Corporate or Community?

{"body":"I think its more about how the admin team treat the mods in general, as well as the very unusual thing of just firing people instantly. I get that the admin team is small, but Victoria was a MAJOR point of contact with the user base. Picture a regular company. Victoria is like a customer front person, someone that actually makes and holds contracts with the customers. If she were to get fired, she would regularly be given 2 weeks notice just as a general thing, and maybe longer given that she needs to tell her clients and ensure they can transition after she leaves, either to supporting themselves or to whatever the company has in place for after she leaves. 		Reddit has not done this. For IAmA alone this is a devastating change, disrupting todays, this weeks, this months AMAs. But then you look at other subreddits that have AMAs, places like /r/books and /r/science. In some cases on these subreddits, Victoria was the ONLY point of contact for AMAs. So now Books has a load of AMAs scheduled and no way to contact the people doing them to set it up.		This comes after the Secret Santa guy was let go, which granted he also kept quiet about, but that the admin team didnt mention. And after mods had to start using third party tools as the ones they are provided are sub standard. After a transparency post saying we will see more information about posts taken down by copyright claims and yet continue not to see such information. 		There IS a disconnect between mods and the admins, and frankly, Victoria is just the trigger.

If that isn't undervaluing mods and community, then I don't know what is.		As a former mod on one of the popular forums where I am from, it was rather easy to talk with admins, and they were pretty much there when needed. Here, they didn't even inform any of the mods that one of the main people dealing with AmAs was fired (or for that matter, didn't even announce she'd be fired).		Admittedly, two of them said they acknowledge there is a problem. How about the rest? How about a site-wide statement? And so on and so forth, basically, how about doing something, instead of making promises (not only to mods, but community, which Ellen Pao seems to ignore - what a surprise).		Imo, I think it's rather obvious they haven't been giving two sh*ts about mods, and users, for that matter. If they had, things wouldn't have gone this way, and until they get the message loud and clear, it's hardly going to change.

I think the point is that reddit is doing a lot of cleanup of the "troublesome pages" to make themselves more desirable to investors. This involves keeping out bad press. The Jackson AMA brought some major bad press. Especially since a very inflammatory question got a reply from jackson. 		Here is the thing. I doubt jackson actually read the question and chose to reply to it. The answer wasnt even addressing the question. It seems more likely (this is speculation) that Victoria was transcribing his answers and accidently posting a reply meant for a different question to that "controversial" one. I am guessing she picked the questions she liked and permalinked them to a new window to add the given answers to.

{"body":"So far the staff have made the same half-assed apologies and promises they have made repeatedly in the past. The mods are looking for real, tangible, evidence of intent to change. 		For example you would think that one of the biggest sites on the internet would have someone around 24/7 to answer technical issues for the people who actually run the site (moderators). They do not. And even though it wasn't really her job Victoria ended up serving a lot of that function. 		Moderators requesting help with serious situations on their subs that they often technically cannot remedy themselves often go days waiting for requests for assistance to be answered and are often never answered at all. When they are answered the answers are often off point and come to late to be of any use. 		Some of these moderation teams are dealing with millions of users and they can't get someone on staff to return a message.		What's more the moderation tools are hilariously broken. Technically speaking the site is years behind your basic BBC bulletin board in technical functionality and the engineering team at reddit seems to have no interest in addressing this issue despite repeated, loud, screamy, desperate, blubbering attempts to get their attention on the issue. 		That's it in a nutshell. The lack of communication, the direction the site is going (I'm a fat guy and I'm no fan of things like fat people hate but this site used to be about free speech within the law and lately they have shown an increasing willingness to betray that sentiment and have even stated they don't care about free speech). The technical failures despite huge financial success. 		I mean seriously... How many billions of page views does a site need to get before the people who are running the show get a community team that can actually respond to their requests and concerns?

The problem is, they're running the site as they wish (which is fine, it's their boat) but they're having everybody else run their community. Normally this is okay, but when the people running the communities ask for help, it falls on deaf ears.		As it is, Victoria was doing a great job and well liked and many of the subreddits had things going on that hinged completely on her involvement.

{"body":"Unfortunately I think that it will be. Community driven sites operate a lot on trust. Trust that they can submit content, be it links or comments, and be treated fairly in their eyes. The drama with the subreddits being banned a while back largely was ignored after a day or so, because the subreddits were driven by making fun of groups of people. Initially there were five subreddits banned, arguably not among the worst on the site, but most people didn't care for these. Dozens of other subreddits were made in protest for their communities being shut down, and these were all shut down for ban evasion. This was the first huge exodus in recent memory.		People get shadowbanned all the time. Some of them justified, some of them arguably not. The most critical and inflammatory remarks against Jesse Jackson the other day had some users banned outright.		As for transparency, we still don't even know why Victoria is gone. The admins have a terrible time keeping up with the moderators, let alone their users. With Ellen Pao in charge, it seems like things are getting less transparent and more monetized.		Personally, when another site is able to sustain traffic, I'm jumping ship. I may see about starting a few of my favorite subreddits from here over on Voat to make sure there's a community for that.		As it is with Voat, they've just banned all the jailbait subreddits... which is fine, the legality there is pretty shady at best.

{"body":"I usually don't post but felt like I had to for this.		0. most important thing is that reddit admins will take away all your powers after this situation is dealt with. mark my words. at that point, you guys will all regret all this. they will even put restrictive rules on mods powers like wikipedia does with its article editors. 		1. As far as I can understand, this leiason between /r/iama and various ama participants was fired for a reason that noone really has made public yet. what if the person was fired for some unethical behaviour or something worse? I bet you guys would feel really bad about all this if the letting go had a valid reason.		2. reddit and various subreddits are bigger than 1 person, bigger than 10-15 mods. I am surprised the mods of the various reddits even had the audacity to go 'private' the way they did. The most important unit on reddit (just like in any democracy) are the people. Going 'private' the way these mods did just shows that unionization does not really work.		3. as I have said before, there are so many users on reddit. Many of whom will be willing to work for free like the mods do. You see, there are very little jobs where people are irreplaceble.		4. people on this thread saying 'yes' to doing what the op suggested are just teenagers looking for something to fill up their day other than jacking off to various porn sites and make their life a little more interesting. just like what the mods of the various sub-reddits are doing.		5. I wouldn't be surprised from the results of all of this. the mods should really be punished for doing this by the admins. after all, the mods don't own the site, the admins do. the mods volunteer and thus should do no more than volunteer. taking decisions like making an entire subreddit that lots and lots of people do every day is not a decision that mods should be allowed to take, especially for wide-use subreddits. Basically, I predict the admins will put lots of restrictions after this incident on the ability and powers of reddit mods and users just like wikipedia does to avoid a crazy editor.		6. I can't believe I typed all this up. I guess in a way, I am also trying to make my life more 'interesting'. I thought about just removing all of this and just not posting it but then i thought, what the hell, I spent the last 5 min compiling all of this and didn't wanna waste it.

Do we really expect her employer to discuss these things publicly?  Do we really expect her to be forthcoming with us?

She probably got a better gig and bounced.  Or maybe she was fired because she said some racist or homophobic stuff at work - ever think of that?  Would you still protest her termination if that was the case?  The point is: you have no idea why she's gone and you will never know - get over it.

Also, the power of the mods to completely "delete" or make inaccessible all of the work of all the subscribers in a given subreddit, where people can't even look at the stuff they themselves posted to a sub, is complete BS imo and should be in some way curtailed and what is happening now is a clear indication of that.","depth":0,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"appropriate-username","name":"t1_csqld2m","parent_id":"t3_3bxduw","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1435894446,"created_utc":1435890846}

The problem is in no way related to not having enough mods. The problem is the mods not getting help from the people who own the site. The mods are unpaid volunteers, the admin's job should be making sure that the mods can do theirs.		>go tell the admins that their tools are inadequate 		One of the major complaints right now is that they have been and the admisn aren't listening.		>Also, the power of the mods to completely "delete" or make inaccessible all of the work of all the subscribers in a given subreddit, where people can't even look at the stuff they themselves posted to a sub, is complete BS imo and should be in some way curtailed and what is happening now is a clear indication of that.		It's kind of awesome. It gives them a power over the admins. It's checks and balances. Also, don't forget that this site started without subreddits, the entire idea when they were introduced was that anyone could build their own reddit, and have control over the content on that page. Some just got huge and now represent the majority of the content on the site. The mods were always meant to have that power, but the site has changed dramatically since then.		Also, don't feel like you are entitled to what you post. This site is provided to you by a coproration. They own what you post after you post it. It is on their hardware, their networks, their everything. You own the original, but not your post. Reddit is better about it than a lot of other sites (certain watermarking sites involving 9's and gags come to mind), but everything on here is still under their control at the end of the day, and if reddit shut down, the internet would move on.
