It's not one organization, it's a collection of organizations in different regions operating very independently for the same general goals. That's why you have a situation like the one that happened in Syria with the new Islamic State (ISIL). They were originally the Al-Qaeda organization who operated in Syria to bring down the government, who then started going against the rules of the other Al-Qaeda groups who disowned them. Osama's death didn't affect anything because all the organizations operate independently and are built to withstand the deaths of anyone, no matter how high up they are in the organization. With warlords the second they die all their lieutenants will start fighting for power before their body is cold. Killing these warlords won't solve the problem forever, but it will weaken their groups significantly and make it much easier to end the human trafficking. 		tl;dr Collection of terrorist cells =/= a warlord/king.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Captinfucker","name":"t1_cm896qq","parent_id":"t1_cm7o945","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416514143,"created_utc":1416514143}

It is not even telling their story from its perspective. IC is telling its own story. It is using the people of Uganda, specifically those who suffered under the LRA as a platform to advertise their own organization. It is all about the two founders of the IC and how IC is shaping the future of Uganda and how it is awakening people to shape Uganda in a sensational way. Don't get me wrong, it was very effective and perhaps that is why it was so successful.  But let me tell you something about these people, and for this case, the Africans, those who suffered under the LRA or any other regime. They are not objects of pity. They are not ornaments for other people to wear around their necks so they can show of their humanitarian efforts and how their works shape the world. They are every bit as human as any other being in existence. They have had a different experience, and perhaps their experience has made them more profound, stronger and wiser, but they are not there to be pitied and their stories are not there to be exploited. 		There is a reason why hundreds of Ugandans in northern Uganda who were under Kony threw stones at the screen, it is because their story was being exploited, it was being sensationalized, it was being cheapened, it is being used for an organization that donates less than half of what it gets to the very people whose stories they utilize.","depth":14,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AgeOfWomen","name":"t1_cm7ja5u","parent_id":"t1_cm7fgjv","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416445550,"created_utc":1416445550}

But somewhere, I get the impression that you are defending them for the sake of defending them while ignoring legitimate issues like the Ugandans who did not have previous clarification of the movie, being offended by the movie because an organization is profiting from their story by making it about themselves and yes these are the segments they are criticizing, the ones where they are not telling their story. They failed to capture the gravity of the situation and instead edified their part in raising awareness for the situation n the video. Of course they have the grandiose idea of how the west can help Ugandans and very little on the Ugandans themselves. This discussion is going in circles because as I have said, you cannot tell the story of the LRA without telling the story of the people who suffered under the LRA.  The video on the other hand is about the filmmakers and not the cause who have starred themselves in grandiose roles. 		If you really have met Ugandans and have talked with them and have traveled with them, then respect them enough to stop wearing them as an ornament. They are human beings and not objects. Stop going around around proclaiming of how you know those Africans and how you helped those Africans and how you talked with those Africans or how you can get in contact with those Africans just to make yourself look good.

Your base is made up of clicks, tweets, shares, views, etc. We'll call these "viewers." Everyday people sharing your content, and building it in the public eye. With almost 100 million views on youtube alone, Kony2012 had a pretty massive base -- at the time, it was the most viral video *ever*. 		Now, from that base, you get the second layer -- "engagers." These people are the ones who call into congress, send an email to the white house, sign petitions. These people help build the issue on the governments radar, and bring policy-maker attention to issues. As the Kony2012 video quotes (from a US Senator), 25 calls on an issue in one day gets the attention of Congressional leader's attention. 		Now, from *that* group, you've got the "movers." These people are going to pick themselves up, go to Washington, join in marches, and most importantly, mee with their congresspeople. Face to face meetings with congressmen or their staff carry a lot of weight, and really solidify the issue in Congressional minds. 		And finally, there's the "workers." The people who are actually spending their time and lives working day-in, day-out on the issue. These are staff members, people living in the context, etc. 		The cool thing about this pyramid is that each level gets stronger based on the level beneath it. When I was a "mover" on Capitol Hill, I cited the number of views that the video had gotten -- and that was something that provoked a visable reaction from Congressional staff. 		Do I wish everyone was a mover? Sho' do.

{"body":"SIGH, Ok. I can only look at all these posts related to this for so long without saying anything. I know the guy(Jason Russell) very well. My parents met through his parents and thereafter, my parents married as a result. I am very close to the Russell family. He was a mentor of mine from about ages 13-19. I used to belong to a group of young guys, all about he same age and we met weekly at the Invisible Children office for a bible study. [proof](http://i.imgur.com/U2Uy6eh.png) Thats us holding Jason and I'm the guy in the stripped sweater(this was taken in April 2012 right around or before the time all this Kony shit started happening.) The photo is of us bible study boys at a wedding. 	      	At another, following wedding I actually mustered the courage to ask Jason what exactly happened. (This was after the South Park episode and the big controversy regarding him "Jacking it in San Diego") So when he and I were outside the wedding smoking a cigarette together I asked, "Dude...so...what HAPPENED?" to which he responded, "al54bx, I lost my mind, in front of my two children, and my wife and ended up in a police station". Essentially, he has no idea. If you'll remember, the police never pressed charges and they chalked it all up to malnutrition and lack of sleep. The guy went from basically being a nobody with a non-profit organization to being the most watched YouTube sensation EVER(before Gangnam Style). 		In addition, Jason never had a drug or drinking problem in his life. In one week he was just a dude and then he was flying all over the country defending and representing his life's work. Jason is a pretty eccentric guy to begin with and he's a perfectionist. So I can personally imagine everything that was going through in his head, and all the mental stress he was putting himself through.  	      	He just bit off WAY more than he could possibly chew and ran himself ragged until he broke and ended up dancing nude on the street near his home in SD. It was a hard thing to watch from the sidelines. Witnessing the world point and laugh at your mentor because of a big mistake he made and watching his life's work crumble because he went too hard. 	     	Watching South Park, one of my favorite shows of all time, make fun. Listening to Joe Rogan, one of my heroes, discredit him. All in all, he made a huge mistake and he payed for it. But I saw Jason over the summer this year and his kids are fine, his wife is fine, he's fine, and everything still seems to be ok. Invisible Children is still a strong company that's making a difference in Uganda and working to do positive things globally. 	     	     In the end, he was thrust into the lime light on a massive scale and it crushed him. 			*P.S. When I told him, "Dude, you have your own South Park episode." He responded with, "I know, bucketlist, right?"		TL;DR I know the guy and he lost his mind for a day.

Very few of them have just happened to me - most of the time I have had to make a conscious decision to develop a relationship with someone who I think would be a good mentor.		When I find someone who I deeply respect and who I think would be a good teacher I make sure to put myself in positions to learn from them. Sometimes if I have developed some sort relationship with them I'll even outright tell them about my intentions and ask them how I can learn more from them. Of course a mentor has to be someone who's *invested* in your growth so before you're able to develop that kind of relationship with someone you often have to prove that you're worthy of that kind of investment.

My life coach is a paid relationship similar to a therapist but around my professional and personal goals. Less about the past more about the future. One thing my life coach asked me was to get a board of director role with an organization I believe in because in 10 years it will pay dividends. I listened and reached out to a non-profit I have known for a few years and joined their board shortly after. It's already paying dues since I have been asked about it multiple times in meetings.		They originate just as you would expect, one of them was on reddit, I believe and the other was through a friendship. Life coach was through  my network, she doesn't advertise at all and does it very rarely through word of mouth, think of Hitch.

{"body":"The qualification is that someone has thought that you are so proficient at what you do that they have gone far out of their way to try and learn from you. No mentor has come to me and told me that they will educate me now on the ways of the world - they are always people that *I* believe have something that I want to learn. No accreditation process is ever going to be as qualified as me in deciding who will be the best teacher *for me*.		Sometimes mentors are people who are or were my teachers in a formal education setting, or they are people who are teachers in some other way (they lead workshops or they taught at a school in the past that I never attended), but not always.		Besides this, I think that you are far overrating the "screening process" for teachers. It's really not that hard to become a teacher and there are plenty of absolutely awful teachers in formal settings. I think that teachers often make good mentors because they have a lot of experience in offering people guidance and in investing in someone's growth - they tend to be the kind of people who deeply value helping someone else learn something, a trait that not everyone has. But I will always trust my own opinion on who is the best teacher for me far above a school's decision or an accrediting organizations decision.		I'm curious where all this skepticism is coming from. Have you personally had a bad experience with someone teaching you something outside of a formal education setting? It's important to note that no one can be your mentor without *you* deciding that they are your mentor (that is part of the definition of the word "mentor").

{"body":"Invisible Children is actually a pretty bad charity organization, and to anyone looking into donating to their cause, I ask that you look into their finances. 		From "Visible Children"	>"Invisible Children has been condemned time and time again. As a registered not-for-profit, its finances are public. Last year, the organization spent $8,676,614. Only 32% went to direct services (page 6), with much of the rest going to staff salaries, travel and transport, and film production. This is far from ideal, and Charity Navigator rates their accountability 2/4 stars because they haven't had their finances externally audited. But it goes way deeper than that.		Foreigh Affairs Magazine	>In their campaigns, such organizations [as Invisible Children] have manipulated facts for strategic purposes, exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders and emphasizing the LRA's use of innocent children as soldiers, and portraying Kony ??? a brutal man, to be sure ??? as uniquely awful, a Kurtz-like embodiment of evil.		Another from "Visible Children"	>The group is in favour of direct military intervention, and their money supports the Ugandan government's army and various other military forces. Here's a photo of the founders of Invisible Children posing with weapons and personnel of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. Both the Ugandan army and Sudan People's Liberation Army are riddled with accusations of rape and looting, but Invisible Children defends them, arguing that the Ugandan army is "better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries", although Kony is no longer active in Uganda and hasn't been since 2006 by their own admission. These books each refer to the rape and sexual assault that are perennial issues with the UPDF, the military group Invisible Children is defending.		Yale Professor: Chris Blattman		>"[The video] feels much the same, laced with more macho bravado. The movie feels like it's about the filmmakers, and not the cause. There might be something to the argument that American teenagers are more likely to relate to an issue through the eyes of a peer. That's the argument that was made after the first film. It's not entirely convincing, especially given the distinctly non-teenage political influence IC now has. The cavalier first film did the trick. Maybe now it's time to start acting like grownups. There are a few other things that are troubling. It's questionable whether one should be showing the faces of child soldiers on film. And watching the film one gets the sense that the US and IC were instrumental in getting the peace talks to happen. These things diminish credibility more than anything.		Vice		>"Now when I first watched the Kony 2012 video, there was a horrible pang of self-knowledge as I finally grasped quite how shallow I am. I found it impossible to completely overlook the smug indie-ness of it all. It reminded me of a manipulative technology advert, or the Kings of Leon video where they party with black families, or the 30 Seconds to Mars video where all the kids talk about how Jared Leto's music saved their lives. I mean, watch the first few seconds of this again. It's pompous twaddle with no relevance to fucking anything."

{"body":"Just watched the video for the first time.		To go a bit further for the people who won't watch it: what he's saying is that the overhead is chaining these charities to short-term thinking.		Many of us have our stories of working somewhere where they were happy to piss off a customer for $10 today and lose someone who paid us a thousand times that every year. Somewhere where we see that if they'd just put out that extra buck an hour on everyone's wage today, they'd make then back tenfold in the next year or two decreasing employee turnover and making everyone more dedicated and making them work harder. Where we see an employer would rather spend $10 every week replacing a $10 part instead of $100 every year on a better part.		We all wonder what exactly the people in charge were thinking. Why they were focused on the short term to the point where it cost them more in the long term.		What Dan explains in his talk is that, basically, this is how we're *forcing* charities to think. They can't spend that extra dollar today to make it back tenfold in the long run because it shows up as 'overhead' on the balance sheet, and they'll be crucified for it.		He says that if we treated charities more like private corporations, which grow at a much faster rate, we would see a much greater good being done long term.		Instead of insisting that 95% of their money goes to their direct cause *today*, let them spend some of it on fundraising and marketing. Let them spend some on hiring the best people. Let them spend some of it on longer term projects that don't show an initial return.		Sure their overhead might be 40%, but if that higher investment allows them to grow at a much faster rate, the initial $150k/yr investment might be worth $15,000,000/yr a decade later.		Compared to a $150k/yr charity that doesn't grow it's unfavourable in the short term - one is spending $90k/yr on the cause while the other is spending $143k. But ten years later the 5% overhead charity is still only spending $143k on the cause while the one that's investing in growth is spending $9m/yr.		It makes a sort of sense to an individual too - the charity with the low overhead is just a way to send my money to those in need. They take my $10 and spend $9.50 on the cause. That makes you feel good. The higher overhead is one that invests my money to turn the $10 I donated into a thousand dollars to then spend $600 of that on the people who need it. That does more good.		He suggests that asking a charity what their long term goals are, and what and how much it will take to get there are much better questions than "How much of this donation today is going directly to your cause?".		At least for me, he was just pointing out that I was guilty of the exact same thing I've always bitched about - short term thinking.","depth":3,"score":77,"ups":77,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cm7ocqx","parent_id":"t1_cm7n1zv","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416455941,"created_utc":1416455941}

{"body":"An additional point (if this is the same TED talk as I've heard on NPR) is that we assume that charity is a fixed number; aka there is only 2 million dollars that can go to AIDS relief this year, so if your charity gets all the AIDS relief dollars, and spends $500,000 on overhead/advertising/etc, you're wasting 25% of the world's donations. However, this is simply not true; the overall level of charity can and does increase with increased advertising. It's also not a zero-sum game: donating an additional $2000 to charity y does not necessarily mean someone will give $2000 less to charity x.		This fits into his (and your) comparison with private business, because we DO NOT treat businesses that way. If somebody is selling shoes, we assume that they can definitely get more people to buy shoes as long as the product and advertising are solid. So if a growing business invests 45% of their profits into shoe development/hiring more people to sell shoes/buying more ads, we go all right, yeah, definitely that's a good decision. For a number of reasons, many of which are not actually true, we have decided that charity can't/shouldn't operate that way.		Anecdotally, I think he's right. I donate less to charity than I could, and if a convincing program who were doing things I supported came along and said hey give us $10/month, I would probably say alright sure.","depth":4,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dramamoose","name":"t1_cm7pi9z","parent_id":"t1_cm7ocqx","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416458655,"created_utc":1416458655}

Part of the problem with this line of thinking is that charity doesn't grow like private business. There's a reason there's such a big deal made over how much overhead cost charities have.  Charitable donations in the US average at a practically invariable 2% of disposable income and that's been the case since the 1940s. The practical upshot of this is that any "growth" of one charity basically comes at the expense of another charity, and that spending extra overhead money to grab a bigger piece of that static pie is reducing the amount of charity that goes to the people that need it.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dug_Fin","name":"t1_cm7yqqa","parent_id":"t1_cm7ocqx","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416494635,"created_utc":1416494635}

The suing part is definitely questionable, although there is an argument to be made that some less reputable charities use their slogan to mislead donators and make them think they're donating to Komen. 		The rest is just people being morons. I mean seriously, outrage over their CEO making $700k a year? How is it that it's more socially acceptable for a CEO to make $700k a year in the private sector not helping people than it is for them to make the same amount helping millions? Add in the fact that the CEO of Komen would make significantly more managing a similar size company in the private sector and it's pretty clear how dumb it is to be mad about that. 		The outrage over the amount they spend on overhead is equally ridiculous. Charities need to spend money on advertising and growth, that's how they get more donations and increase their overall impact. Think about it this way, would you rather have a charity that spends 90% of its money on direct impact, but only gets 10 million in donations, or a charity that spends 40% on overhead, gets its name out there and gets 100 million in donations. A charity of larger scale but higher overhead is going to be doing more good and having more impact than a small charity with low overhead. 		Bottom line we need to stop crucifying charities for making competitive offers to CEOs and investing in future growth, otherwise we force them to limit their impact so that they can't do as much good, but can say "well we have low overhead!" because if they don't, people will be like "wow this company has high overhead, my dollar won't do as much".

It misses the counter argument, and just gives an argument that is very difficult to disagree with until you are given all the facts. His argument is really, why should people who do good things have to make less money whilst people in other sectors make much much more.		The argument (that I'm sure he is aware of) is that all recent research into donation funded charities leads to the idea that there is a limited fund that changes very little year on year, but that gets donated to different charities in different amounts. This means that if you campaign for more money which you spend on paying your employees more, or on advertising, or on anything that someone might call waste, you are taking that from a fixed pot of money that people are willing to donate, and you're cannibalising money to other charities. Its called charity cannibalism.		Its also fundamentally dishonest to ask for money from me, suggesting that it is to feed the homeless or something similar, but then spend it on a pay rise. This is all the more nefarious when you realise that as a percentage of their income, people on lower salaries donate much more to charities than rich people. Why should I struggle to pay the bills this month to donate to a charity I believe in when people working in a field they feel passionately about have far more disposable income than me? Is the CEO of a charity that earns $700,000 going to donate a large chunk of that back into the charity? They should do if they believe that donating to charity is worthwhile right?

If you want to talk about limiting private sector salaries to something more manageable (perhaps 50-to-1 as some European countries have reportedly done), then you'll likely get my support.

You're right that people do complain about private sector salaries, but the tone is immensely different than that of nonprofit.

We don't allow nonprofits to pay even *close* to the private sector, or to take similar marketing risks, etc. 		That is the problem.

As a percentage of GDP, we have [consistently given around 2% for the past 40 years](http://philanthropy.com/article/The-Stubborn-2-Giving-Rate/139811/).

{"body":"I agree with what you're saying, and have had arguments where I held the same opinion, but this has sort of changed over the past year. The differentiation I hold is that charities are not businesses and should not be run as such.		For the charity sector to be successful, the largest amount of funds possible should be transferred directly and efficiently to the causes represented. 		For the business sector to be successful, the largest amount of profit must be made.		These are similar - sometimes confusingly so - but *not* the same. 		A single business can call itself successful if it raises as much profit as possible. Looking at the bigger picture, this tends to be good for the business sector on the whole. The motivation is profit and, with a small amount of regulation, the entire economy ticks over just fine when made up of lots of profit-seeking businesses.		A single charity can indeed call itself successful if it runs itself like a business and raises the most amount of money (nominally) for its cause as possible. However, looking at the bigger picture, when every charity does this it has unintended negative effects. Assuming that the total pool of money the charity sector has to work with is finite (2% of GDP), charities competing with each other via ever-increasing fundraising, marketing and governance costs only transfer an increasing amount of charity money to non-charity causes: CEOs, marketing companies, transport partners, landlords of shiny offices.		The charity sector *is not the private sector*. They should not be allowed to fall victim to selfishness and short-sightedness. 10% of the funds Suasn G. Komen raises go to cancer research. They can *individually* justify that, because 10% of all of that money is better than none of that money, right? 		Wrong. That money is being taken from the total charity pot.

Will it become harder for charities to recruit good CEOs? Maybe in the short term, yes. But as we have found with the private sector, CEO salaries will continue to increase as they suck up any excess profit shareholders will allow them to. This *needs* to be stopped, but in the mean time, charity exec pay should not be tied to this. It can't keep up. It shouldn't keep up. These should not be the same people. They can be paid *lots*, don't get me wrong. They can be paid the most in their organisation, and if their job requirements can only be met by someone with private sector experience, salary should take that into account, but if they want to earn private sector wages, they can work in the private sector.

{"body":">charities are not businesses and should not be run as such		Yes, they are, and they should. 		>10% of all of that money is better than none of that money, right?		10% is a misleading figure, but I think rather I would say a charity that raises 10 times as much as another charity, but gives even 50% less of it's total revenue is still giving significantly more. This requires advertising.		>That money is being taken from the total charity pot		There is no "charitable pot". While it is true that overall we have not been spending an increasing % of GDP on charity over the last few decades, it is a fallacy to say that any dollar raised by charity A must be stealing that dollar from charity B. That's just simply not true. In fact, Dan Pallotta raises the argument that of course the charitable sector is not going to be gaining market share when we crucify charities for advertising. How can you expect a market to gain market share when they can't advertise or compete for high quality executive staff?		>Will it become harder for charities to recruit good CEOs? Maybe in the short term, yes.		No, in the forever term. Not paying competitive salaries, or even paying salaries in the same ballpark, is going to dissuade skilled management from entering the non-profit market as long as that situation exists. At no point, ever, will CEOs or other executives make the decision to leave the private sector until salaries at non-profits are at least within throwing distance of private sector salaries. They don't have to be as high, but at least somewhat close.		>CEO salaries will continue to increase as they suck up any excess profit shareholders will allow them to		What? That's just not how that works. Companies make competing bids for CEOs, that's what drives the prices up. CEOs do not set their own salaries, the companies set salaries to attract CEOs.		>if they're coming as a CEO from the private sector, they've made enough money already.

In my opinion taking the money you would have donated and combining it with the money you normally spend on stuff has a greater effect. 		Example 1: Someone spends $100 a year on chocolate. For $50 more they could get ethically sourced chocolate instead. So by "donating" this $50 they are actually directing $150 to a good cause.		Example 2: Over a 15 year period a homeowner may spend $27,000 on electricity. They calculate a $29,000 roof top solar system will reduce their utility bill to $2000 over the same time. By "donating" the $4,000 extra by choosing the solar option, they are directing $27,000 away from coal plants and directing $31,000 towards green energy.		TL;DR I think its better to use money to support socially responsible companies then supporting a combination of non profits + irresponsible companies.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vortexas","name":"t1_cm8l9sq","parent_id":"t1_cm7l5z8","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416537160,"created_utc":1416537160}

{"body":"At 19:26-32, they also cite US troops going into Central Africa, not Uganda. With that said, I guess the broader point I'm trying to make is that IC obviously knew that Kony wasn't in Uganda. If you don't think the notes from the video are compelling, that's okay -- I get that. But IC *did* know where he was operating, and had been focusing various programs in that region for years. You can see them communicate it in [Kony 2012 Part II](http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/654771-updf-captures-lra-commander.html), or from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgnYaEnMW4Q&list=PLECBCC7E6850CCEEB) released a year before 2012. You could also see the pre-Kony 2012 tool, [the LRA Crisis Tracker](http://lracrisistracker.com/). 		As to the Guardian's article, Arthur Larok seems to be operating under the assumption that IC focused it's initiative on Northern Uganda, which isn't true. He also says:		>But many organisations and governments are focusing on this. We need to secure social stability, health and education. These are the priorities. This is what we're trying to focus on. Poverty is high compared to the rest of the country. That's the practical issue that needs to be addressed.		IC, for years, and long before this video came out, helped rebuild areas of Northern Uganda (especially Gulu) where the LRA had been active. Some of these programs included the Schools for Schools program, where specific schools fundraised to help redevelop specific schools in Northern Uganda, in addition to funding specific scholarships through the Legacy Scholars program. 		> No one knows where Kony is, and most of his band operate independently. It'll be a hard nut to crack. And, frankly, I'm struggling to see what difference a mass social media movement can make.		Kony [is located in a specific region of Sudan](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/joseph-kony-hiding-sudan-border-report-lra), and AU troops have managed to take out [top commanders](http://allafrica.com/stories/201205140239.html) and defections have surged in recent years -- largely in part thanks to international attention on the issue and constituent pressure on the US Government (who provides support to the AU mission) fostered by IC and partner organizations.		I actually really like this woman's comments -- I think it's okay to be put off by the film, while still addmiting it's unorthodox style has had positive effects. 		>Invisible Children have had a huge impact on the area. They are well respected by other NGOs. I worked alongside them and they were very solutions focused. They didn't sit around talking for too long and checked with experts and that the local people wanted what they were doing. So many organisations stomp in, do what they do and leave. It was very needs driven.... It's hard, I'm caught in the middle; I do admire them. They are having a great impact in northern Uganda. They have some unique ways of working, a good mentoring scheme where they pair people who have come through the conflict with people who are coming out of it now. But then I don't agree in the film itself. It was a little self-indulgent, emotive, that's how they do things and it has had a huge impact. Perhaps development needs refreshing as an industry and this is new blood and it's causing a stir that they are doing something different.		I also really liked this quote, which highlights some often overlooked work they do. 		>"I think Invisible Children is starting some of the best work there, in terms of setting up the early warning mechanism."		>The system relies on a two-way radio network, "They're training these two-way radio monitors who can report immediately when there's LRA presence or there's an attack."		>Sawyer described the network as "crucial" in terms of circulating information in effected areas. "These are areas that don't have phone networks and the roads are really bad."		>"That's been one of the key programs on the ground addressing that issue," Sawyer added.		>She also praised Invisible Children's rehabilitation program???a partnership with the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission???for former child soldiers abducted by the LRA in Congo. While such programs have taken hold in Uganda, Sawyer noted "a gap" in similar support networks for Congolese victims.		>In Congo and Central African Republic, Sawyer said Invisible Children has been "some of the quickest organizations to respond to the needs on the ground, very flexible and willing to work with and listen to the local communities."		I think Victor Ochen misses the scope of what IC's seeking to do:		>"They are focusing more on an American solution to an African conflict than the holistic approach which should include regional governments and people who are very key to make this a success," says Ochen, "Every war has its own victims. They are advocating for a mechanism to end war with more attention to a perpetrator not victims. Campaigning on killing one man and that's the end is not enough."		At MOVE DC, the big IC event that followed Kony 2012, they had representatives from every regional government there (Sudan declined to attend). They all spoke in support of what IC was doing, and for the policy positions IC was pushing for. They've definitely been involved in holistic work, and definitely involved in pulling in local actors. 		> The people of this country can speak for themselves. KONY IS A BAD GUY. Yes! Can we at least hear from the victims?		Here, Ochen might be speaking out of ignorance of the dozens of LRA survivors (fromer soldiers, escapees, abductees, forced wives) who come join IC every semester for tours throughout the US to tell their side of the story and answer questions from those they meet.

At any rate, I wanted to look at what you said again, and see if we can't reframe the discussion a bit, because I think there *is* something fair to what you're saying, but I also don't think it grabs the whole picture. 		So, let's look at the potential claims:		1. IC thought Kony was in Uganda, and he's not	2. IC is targeting it's programs in Uganda, even though Kony's not a big deal there	3. IC didn't properly communicate the geography in this video. 		Claim 1 is baseless, 2 is partly true (and it's a good thing!), and 3 is probably on point. 		IC is one of the most forward-acting organizations out in the field right now. They've worked n the first child soldier rehabilitation center in the DRC, and are working with the UN to provide defection materials to LRA fighters in the CAR and DRC. They've built crisis tracking netowrks throughout the region, and work with the US government to help process intelligence as to where Kony is, and what his army is doing. They absolutely know the history -- it'd be hard not to when [so much of their staff is Ugandan](http://invisiblechildren.com/our-team/). So we can toss that first claim clear out the window.		Now, that doesn't mean that there's still not work to be done in Northern Uganda -- IC has focused a lot of it's educational efforts in Northern Uganda, because a lot of schools were damaged or destroyed in the initial war, so they put a lot of resources into rebuilding them, and they've continued building those relationships through mentorships (pairing younger survivors of the conflict with older ones) and scholarships. While the war may be over in Northern Uganda, there's still work left to be done by and for Ugandans. On top of that, the AU (African Union) determined the the UPDF would make up the bulk of the Kony-hunting mission, so when the videos talk about Uganda working with the States to catch Kony, they're not talking about doing so within Uganda's borders.		As to the last point, that's fair -- when I initially made the argument, I was thinking of a video sequence from a different IC video where John Prendergast walks through countries affected, but I had misplaced it into this video. With that said, IC has definitely communicated LRA geography in other videos, and provided resources on the site where the video streamed from, and in the details section on youtube. On top of that, as the video toured, there were IC volunteers and Ugandans who clearly explained the situation. With *that* said, IC certainly could have been clearer in the video itself -- and I shouldn't have taken the hardline position that they were clear enough. I think I took a more hardline position there than IC did, seeing as they went ahead and created Kony 2012 part two which very explicitly laid out the geography and touched on a lot of critques made against the original video. 		In sum, IC isn't a perfect organization. They've got programmatic and messaging problems, but they also have some outstanding successes. The criticisms of them as some out-of-touch white savior money grubbing scam group just aren't true. But that doesn't mean they can't ever face criticism or alter their messaging going forward.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GaslightProphet","name":"t1_cm7yxki","parent_id":"t1_cm7rqp5","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416495078,"created_utc":1416495078}

Only 32% went to direct services (page 6), with much of the rest going to staff salaries, travel and transport, and film production. This is far from ideal, and Charity Navigator rates their accountability 2/4 stars because they haven't had their finances externally audited. But it goes way deeper than that.		This is, and was, a lie. IC follows industry best practices, and has had their finances audited annually by an external organization. They at one point had a lower ranking due to a vacancy on their board of directors, hurting their accountability score. Now, their accountability score is a solid 100%, with financials at 77.71, partially due to a loss in revenue in the last year -- no surprise, since they had a huge spike in 2012. with that said, about 77% of their expenses are programatic. Many of those programatic expenses are travel and film based, because they're primarily an advocacy organization. In essence, the goal of advocacy is to take the revenue stream and find ways to influence congress or other third party bodies in order to provide long-term, sustainable funding for various programs. So if IC makes a million dollars, it makes more sense for them to use that money to energize voters so that Congress passes a 20 million dollar omnibus bill that helps a variety of causes in the region, rather than just sinking the million into the ground themselves. 		With that said, IC is also working with the UN to help encourage LRA defections, and has been incredibly successful doing so, in addition to providing numerous scholarships for students in Northern Uganda.		>In their campaigns, such organizations [as Invisible Children] have manipulated facts for strategic purposes, exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders and emphasizing the LRA's use of innocent children as soldiers, and portraying Kony ??? a brutal man, to be sure ??? as uniquely awful, a Kurtz-like embodiment of evil.		While it's true that IC has in some ways made a symbol out of Kony, I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily. The man is a rank *evil*, and nothing but good will come out of the LRA finally vanishing, and his influence put to a full stop. I also don't think it's true to say that IC has exaggerated the data -- their crisis tracker is a meticulous tool that's helped communities in the region build local defense networks. 		>The group is in favour of direct military intervention, and their money supports the Ugandan government's army and various other military forces.

These books each refer to the rape and sexual assault that are perennial issues with the UPDF, the military group Invisible Children is defending.		IC didn't advocate for a Ugandan army solution for a problem in the Congo -- they were, and are, advocating for an African Union solution to a primarily military problem. The African Union choose to make Ugandans the primary force for the mission, because they *are* the best forces in the region. But it's not because IC thinks that Kony is in Uganda -- they said so in the video. He's operating in the DRC, CAR, and South Sudan -- exactly the areas the AU mission is targeting. As an aside, I studied human security in college, which looks at a lot of the intersections between violence and development, so I get that problems have various, intertwining factors. 		>[The video] feels much the same, laced with more macho bravado.

I think that Blattman must have missed many of the films in the interim, told explicitly through the eyes and mouths of Ugandans, and others affected by the crisis. This film was one of dozens, and with a specific mission to engage and mobilize a young, western, audience, to continue building it's political clout.

Earlier this year the US Military deployed another 150 special operations airmen and four Opsreys to assist in the search for Kony.","depth":0,"score":68,"ups":68,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"systemstheorist","name":"t1_cm76gwt","parent_id":"t3_2mrt9h","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416422442,"created_utc":1416422442}

This is from the page linked to: "The accounts suggest nearly 25% of its $8.8m income last year was  spent on travel and film-making with only around 30% going toward programes on the ground. The great majority of the money raised has been spent in the US. $1.7 million went on US employee salaries, $357,000 in film costs, $850,000 in film production costs, $244,000 in "professional services" - thought to be Washington lobbyists - and $1.07 million in travel expenses . Nearly $400,000 was spent on office rent in San Diego."		Obviously the masturbating in public incident didn't do them any favours, but I'd argue that that this was hardly the main reason support for it dropped off, just the most sensational one. In all probability, the directors of the campaign were using it as a means to further their own careers in their respective fields (mostly filmmaking).","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vaticanhotline","name":"t1_cm7od55","parent_id":"t3_2mrt9h","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416455966,"created_utc":1416455966}

{"body":"This is a Repost of a comment i made in another thread, but relevant:		>Experiment??			>INSNA In 1976 key ???gures from the cybernetics and related Cambridge circles (including the Tavistock Institute) created INSNA, the International Network of Social Network Analysis, the leading social engineering network ever since. Their intention was to destroy the possibility that creativity could upset the equilibrium of the predetermined ???ecology??? of the system (and therefore the Oligarchy???s control). ???Change agents??? could be introduced into social networking media to bring the ???eld of discussion back to the drab uniformity of consensus.		>INSNA players developed some of the software for social network analysis, such as UCINET and SOCNET, which could analyze social networking sites such as myspace, facebook, ancestry.com, or multiple interface gaming sites. The cybernetic ???change agents??? developed technologies to map the ???ow of rumours through society, which they claim spread like the transmission of epidemics, such as AIDS.This technology could also be used to create social movements, thereby setting the stage for gang and counter-gang con???icts???techniques entirely coherent with those used in Venetian or British colonialism.These programs could be used to ???herd??? popular opinion into a desired direction. People were required to provide full psychological pro???les that could be used for manipulation. Then the social engineers could outline a ???group think??? matrix, like a ???Choose Your Own Adventure??? book, letting you think you came up with any particular option yourself, but precluding any real creativity.		>The stunning reach of the Kony 2012 campaign that earlier this month burst on to the computers of millions of people worldwide, is a live example of the social networking utopia fantasised by cyberneticians. Facebook and Twitter were deployed to create an instant, widespread consciousness, but arguably more about the campaign itself, than the Joseph Kony issue. Its success in capturing Kony, is less important than its success in cyberspace.		>EDIT: so for those who are asking, here is the original news letter i saw the article in. It is on the last page (pg.12) the article lists it's references at the beginning. In looking for the article i also found this site which while i have not read it all the way through, at a quick glance seems to touch on much the same subject and therefore, may also be of interest to you.		>EDIT 2 for the person who said that the article link would not load, [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/rPeM1.png) is a screen grab of the pages in question.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gravity_fish","name":"t1_cm7tm7n","parent_id":"t3_2mrt9h","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1416472489,"created_utc":1416472489}

The video on youtube was from  months/years before so the current problems people saw were not as relevant and again extremely exaggerated.

Also the main uganda boy that came to America I remember was a paid actor of some sort.
