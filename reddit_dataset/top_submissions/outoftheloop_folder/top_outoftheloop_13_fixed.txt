{"body":"Because they have some pretty evil business practices in 3rd world countries, especially in Africa. 		In Africa, they have a program to give free (at first) baby food to mothers who can't afford to buy it. Then, after the mothers stop producing milk naturally from their breasts, Nestl?? stops providing it for free and charges ridiculous prices for the baby food. Since their breasts no longer produce milk, the mothers are forced to pay for the food if they want their child to live.		More info: The water used to mix the formula is often contaminated, causing sickness. Also, because of how expensive the formula is, many mothers stretch the formula and end up with malnourished babies		They do other things too, but I can't remember off the top of my head.

{"body":"The abortion hypothesis is pretty sketchy, to be fair. It's tackled quite nicely in Pinker's *The Better Angels of Our Nature.* An excerpt, which I'll quote, can be found [here](http://uncertaintyblog.com/2013/08/15/fooled-again-pinker-puts-a-nail-in-the-coffin-of-the-freakonomics-crime-theory/)		>The 1990s crime decline inspired one of the stranger hypotheses in the study of violence. When I told people I was writing a book on the historical decline of violence, I was repeatedly informed that the phenomenon had already been solved. rates of violence have come down, they explained to me, because after abortion was legalized by the 1973 Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision, the unwanted children who would ordinarily have grown up to be criminals were not born in the first place, because their begrudging or unfit mothers had had abortions instead. I first heard of this theory in 2001 when it was proposed by the economists John Donohue and Steven Levitt, but it seemed too cute to be true. Any hypothesis that comes out of left field to explain a massive social trend with a single overlooked event will almost certainly turn out to be wrong, even if it has some data supporting it at the time. But Levitt, together with journalist Steven Dubner, popularized the theory in their bestseller Freakonomics, and now a large proportion of the public believes that crime went down in the 1990s because women aborted their crime-fated fetuses in the 1970s.		>To be fair, Levitt went on to argue that Roe v. Wade was just one of four causes of the crime decline, and he has presented sophisticated correlational statistics in support of the connection. For example, he showed that the handful of states that legalized abortion before 1973 were the first to see their crime rates go down. But these statistics compare the two ends of a long, hypothetical, and tenuous causal chain ??? the availability of legal abortion as the first link and the decline in crime two decades later as the last ??? and ignore all the links in between. The links include the assumptions that legal abortion causes fewer unwanted children, that unwanted children are more likely to become criminals, and that the first abortion-culled generation was the one spearheading the 1990s crime decline. But there are other explanations for the overall correlation (for example, that the large liberal states that first legalized abortion were also the first states to see the rise and fall of the crack epidemic) and the intermediate links have turned out to be fragile or nonexistent.		>To begin with, the freakonomics theory assumes that women were just as likely to have conceived unwanted children before and after 1973, and that the only difference was whether the children were born. But once abortion was legalized, couples may have treated it as a backup method of birth control and may have engaged in more unprotected sex. If the women conceived more unwanted children in the first place, the option of aborting more of them could leave the proportion of unwanted children the same. In fact, the proportion of unwanted children could even have increased if women were emboldened by the abortion option to have more unprotected sex in the heat of the moment, but then procrastinated or had second thoughts once they were pregnant. That may help explain why in the years since 1973 the proportion of children born to women in the most vulnerable categories ??? poor, single, teenage, and African American ??? did not decrease, as the freakonomics theory would predict. It increased, and by a lot.		>What about differences among individual women within a crime-prone population? Here the freakonomics theory would seem to get things backwards. Among women who are accidentally pregnant and unprepared to raise a child, the ones who terminate their pregnancies are likely to be forward-thinking, realistic, and disciplined, whereas the ones who carry the child to term are more likely to be fatalistic, disorganized, or immaturely focused on the thought of a cute baby rather than an unruly adolescent. Several studies have borne this out. Young pregnant women who opt for abortions get better grades, are less likely to be on welfare, and are more likely to finish school than their counterparts who have miscarriages or carry their pregnancies to term. The availability of abortion thus may have led to a generation that is more prone to crime because it weeded out just the children who, whether through genes or environment, were most likely to exercise maturity and self-control.		>Also, the freakonomists??? theory about the psychological causes of crime comes right out of ???Gee, Officer Krupke??? when a gang member says of his parents, ???They didn???t wanna have me, but somehow I was had. Leapin??? lizards! That???s why I???m so bad!??? And it is now as plausible. Though unwanted children may grow up to commit more crimes, it is more likely that women in crime-prone environments have more unwanted children than that unwantedness causes criminal behavior directly. In the studies that pit the effects of parenting against the effects of the children???s peer environment, holding genes constant, the peer environment almost always wins.		>Finally, if easy abortion after 1973 sculpted a more crime-averse generation, the crime decline should have begun with the youngest group and then crept up the age brackets as they got older. The sixteen-year-olds of 1993, for example (who were born in 1977, when abortions were in full swing), should have committed fewer crimes than the sixteen-year-olds of 1983 (who were born in 1967, when abortion was illegal). By similar logic, the twenty-two-year-olds of 1993 should have remained violent, because they were born in pre-Roe 1971. Only in the late 1990s, when the first post-Roe generation reached their twenties, should the twenty-something age bracket have become less violent. In fact, the opposite happened. When the first post-Roe generation came of age in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they did not tug the homicide statistics downward; they indulged in an unprecedented spree of mayhem. The crime decline began when the older cohorts, born well before Roe, laid down their guns and knives, and from them the lower homicide rates trickled down the age scale.","depth":6,"score":77,"ups":77,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Telmid","name":"t1_csx6y9b","parent_id":"t1_csx5ud7","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436430940,"created_utc":1436427340}

{"body":"Good article about it [here](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/11/why-lead-used-to-be-added-to-gasoline/)			>In 1919, Dayton Metal Products Co. merged with General Motors. They formed a research division that set out to solve two problems: the need for high compression engines and the insufficient supply of fuel that would run them. On December 9, 1921 chemists led by Charles F. Kettering and his assistants Thomas Midgley and T.A. Boyd added Tetraethyl lead to the fuel in a laboratory engine. The ever present knock, caused by auto-ignition of fuel being compressed past its ignition temperature, was completely silenced. Most all automobiles at the time were subject to this engine knock so the research team was overjoyed. Over time, other manufacturers found that by adding lead to fuel they could significantly improve the octane rating of the gas. This allowed them to produce much cheaper grades of fuel and still maintain the needed octane ratings that a car???s engine required.		>Another benefit that became known over time was that Tetraethyl lead kept valve seats from becoming worn down prematurely. Exhaust valves, in early model cars, that were subject to engine knocking tended to get micro-welds that would get pulled apart on opening. This resulted in rough valve seats and premature failure. Lead helped fuel ignite only when appropriate on the power stroke, thus helping eliminate exhaust valve wear and tear.		>The problems with Tetraethyl lead were known even before major oil companies began using it. In 1922, while plans for production of leaded gasoline were just getting underway, Thomas Midgley received a letter from Charles Klaus, a German scientist, stating of lead, ???it???s a creeping and malicious poison??? and warned that it had killed a fellow scientist. This didn???t seem to faze Midley, who himself came down with lead poisoning during the planning phase. While recovering in Miami, Midgley wrote to an oil industry engineer that public poisoning was ???almost impossible, as no one will repeatedly get their hands covered in gasoline containing lead?????? Other opposition to lead came from a lab director for the Public Health Service (A part of the US Department of Health and Human Services ) who wrote to the assistant surgeon general stating lead was a ???serious menace to public health???.		>Despite the warnings, production on leaded gasoline began in 1923. It didn???t take long for workers to begin succumbing to lead poisoning. At DuPont???s manufacturing plant in Deepwater New Jersey workers began to fall like dominoes. One worker died in the autumn of 1923. Three died in the summer of 1924 and four more in the winter of 1925. Despite this, public controversy didn???t begin until five workers died and forty-four were hospitalized in Oct. of 1924 at Standard Oils plant in Bayway NJ.		>The Public Health Service held a conference in 1925 to address the problem of leaded gasoline. As you would expect, Kettering testified for the use of lead, stating that oil companies could produce alcohol fuels that had the benefits that were provided by lead, however the volumes needed to supply a growing fuel hungry society could not be met. Alice Hamilton of Harvard University countered proponents of leaded gasoline and testified that this type of fuel was dangerous to people and the environment. In the end, the Public Health Service allowed leaded gasoline to remain on the market.		>In 1974, after environmental hazards began to become overwhelmingly apparent, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) announced a scheduled phase out of lead content in gasoline. One way manufacturers met these and other emission standards was to use catalytic converters. Catalytic converters use a chemical reaction to change pollutants, like carbon monoxide and other harmful hydrocarbons, to carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water. Tetraethyl lead would tend to clog up these converters making them inoperable. Thus, unleaded gasoline became the fuel of choice for any car with a catalytic converter.		>The requirements by the EPA, emission control mechanisms on cars, and the advent of other octane boosting alternatives spelled the end for widespread leaded gasoline use. Manufacturers soon found that cars could no longer handle such a fuel; public tolerance of the environmental and health hazards would not allow it; and it became cost prohibitive to continue producing it. On January 1, 1996, the Clean Air Act completely banned the use of leaded fuel for any on road vehicle. Should you be found to possess leaded gasoline in your car you can be subject to a $10,000 fine.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"teaoh","name":"t1_csxj9wx","parent_id":"t1_csx5sju","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436462146,"created_utc":1436458546}

The "other extreme", he said "says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value."

They changed our uniforms and let go of almost all of the merchandisers and kept all the route heads.		(for anyone that cares or doesn't know)... 	Merchandisers or vendors are they people that go into grocery stores and stock the product and build displays. It's not all the stores that do this. Coke and Pepsi and budweiser and frito lay. Etc they all stock their own products for the most part. Keeps costs down actually and is a good business model. But nestle decided to take the home grown business feel from dreyers when a few years after they  had bought the brand. It was left alone for a long time and we had a lot of freedom. Once pizza was incorporated that went away. I was let go soon after because of the downsizing and after reading all of this crap I'm glad for it. What a horrible company. 		I'm going to do a bit more reading into this and the company because I know that as far as worldwide goes there are different entities. Like nestle USA is different than nestle in... Sweden?

{"body":">In Africa, they have a program to give free (at first) baby food to mothers who can't afford to buy it. Then, after the mothers stop producing milk naturally from their breasts, Nestl?? stops providing it for free and charges ridiculous prices for the baby food. Since their breasts no longer produce milk, the mothers are forced to pay for the food if they want their child to live.		Listen, I'm not in support of Nestle, many of their business practices are suspect, but this PARTICULAR story is often retold with misleading facts and it bothers me. It's not quite AS BAD as it's made to seem.		First of all, it's given to the local hospitals, not directly to the mothers. The hospitals distribute it, and as long as the mother is a patient at the hospital, they receive free formula as part of their stay. When they leave, they no longer receive formula. Which seems fairly normal. Like in the US.....when you leave, do you expect to be able to go back to the hospital and receive diapers still? No.....you don't. Because that wouldn't make sense.		After researching it, I was not able to find hard data and studies showing that "many mothers" end up with malnourished babies, or that the formula is given to all mothers. According to Nestle, the formula was supposed to be targeted towards mothers who had issues with breastfeeding at birth. Like the baby not latching properly, etc. Those mothers were basically screwed before formula was available.		The main problem with the program, TO ME, is that the doctors and nurses at the hospital who were supposed to distribute it were given kickbacks, which encouraged them to give the formula to EVERYONE including people who didn't need it. Kind of like prescription kickbacks with US doctors now...but instead, this was for formula. I don't believe there should've been a kickback program, and I think this all would've ended very differently.		But I don't believe a company went in with the intentional of babies dying and ending up malnourished. I do believe any country without access to baby formula needs access to it. Formula can be, and continues to be, a blessing for some moms. My sister in law could not lactate and had to use it. I don't know the availability of breast pumps in Nigeria, but if they didn't have access to one, they'd have to be by their child all the time to breastfeed, instead of being able to work, etc. If a mother is not in good health during or after pregnancy, like many of the pregnancies in Nigeria, that may complicate her ability to breastfeed after birth. So in my humble opinion, the formula CAN be a good thing.","depth":1,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"homeschooled","name":"t1_csxcikj","parent_id":"t1_cswsyc5","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436450623,"created_utc":1436447023}

{"body":"Well if you take a loan to buy something I already own, say a video game, I give you a loan of $60 and you buy the video game. I part with $60 for giving it to you, but because it's me who owns the video game, I receive $60 for the video game. 		You still owe me $60, and for every passing month you will pay me an extra $1 as interest until the loan is repayed. Assuming you pay your loan, in the end I will have lost $60 for giving out the loan, then receive $60 for the video game and $60 from you repaying your loan, plus interest rates. You end up with -$60 plus interest and a cool video game, I end up with a net gain of $60 for the game and $60 for the loan (plus interest).		Like with houses, there would be a walk-out principle, which means that if you can't repay the debt you can walk out of it halfway and I get ownership over the video game. 		Assuming this happens, I end up with losing $60 for giving the loan, get $60 from you paying for the video game, then get maybe $20 from what you could repay of the debt, and because you walked out of the repayment, I get back my video game. So I end up with a net gain of $20 and will sell my video game to someone else.		This way, you can profit out of giving loans to someone who cannot possibly repay it and has to walk out of it. However, if *everyone* walks out at the same time, the bank ends up with a lot of houses that are worth nothing.

{"body":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_takeover_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac		It's a tough read to be honest. 		Essentially, two government sponsored enterprises gave out very risky loans to poorer people. Over time, the portion of their loans that were for poorer people (who would not have otherwise gotten loans at all) exceeded 50%. To meet this number they encourage other banks to make these loans and sell the loan to them. 		This is seen by most outsiders as risky and likely to fail, because it is. Of course, being federally backed, these two businesses had to follow particular rules imposed on them by the fed, the 50% low income loans being the most important. These loans barely existed before being forced by federal intervention, and due to the purchasing of these loans, it permeated throughout banking. 		Ultimately these two lenders failed. Bank of America showed only 7% of it's loans to be in this high risk category, yet represented 25% of it's losses (not 100% on the figures, short on time!). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were eventually completely absorbed by the fed, marking the largest government take over of private enterprise in US history, and had to in order to cover the cost of the recession is legally created. 		I prefer government to have little involvement in private affairs, and this is why. Not only can they easily destroy markets with good intentions, they then take on the burden of expanding their economic powers in order to save us from their mistakes. My opinion of course my opinion. 		It's also worth mentioning that no bank came even close to the 50% mark that Fannie May and Freddie Mac achieved. I don't have figures, but I've never seen a private bank with 10% or higher. And most of those were in line to be sold to the fed. Also worth noting are the major federal investigations and legal actions against banks for giving out these loans, along with public shaming.
