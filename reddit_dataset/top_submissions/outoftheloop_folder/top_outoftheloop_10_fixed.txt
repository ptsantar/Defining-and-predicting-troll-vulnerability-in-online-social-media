{"body":">Why are people sending me a strange text that turns my phone off?		People have discovered a bug in imessages recently so they are exploiting it ..they are doing this for fun by sending it to people and making them worried	_________________			The same thing happened recently in Whatsapp also , people were sending 'text bombs' thats what they called it when you open the message it crashes all the active apps on android but after some time phone return back to normal 		*so How does it Happen?*		**It is carried out by various SMS bomber apps available on playstore/Appstore or directly by some codes generated by those apps**			An SMS bomber is exactly what it sounds like. It is similar to an email bomber except it spams with different things ie SMS's instead of emails. SMS bombers are a lot more trouble than email bombers because they can be used to target phones. 	Its sends multiple messages (the amount you type in) to who ever you want to send them to or just a simple 10 byte or so code, you can also set a delay between each msg.				This is fun for people who can take a joke or someone who made an idiot of you, just bomb them with msgs 100+ and usually there phone locks up or switch off		But remember If you  flood anyone's phone with SMS's their life would get real shit real fast. 			**How to get rid of this?**		If your iMessages are crashing then just go to your photos app, send ANY picture to whoever sent the text, or whoever you sent it to. Now open your messages. Boom.		-- If this doesn???t work, have the person who sent it to you send a photo. Still doesn???t work? Go into your iMessage on a Mac if possible and delete the character texts. Retry the first and second method.		--If  a random number sent you the text and now you can???t get back in you can open the iMessages app and when it crashes double tap the home button and look from the app preview to see the number.			You could also disable iMessage (Settings > Messages > iMessage) on your iPhone to prevent someone from targeting you with the malicious messages until Apple releases a patch to fix the issue.		There are ways to stop or get rid of SMS bombers:		* Blocklist. Some phones have their own blocking feature, usually found on Messaging menu. If your phone doesn???t have, download it. Just search the terms such as, download anti sms bomb, download anti sms spam, etc.. Install and blocklist the sender???s number.		* Rest. Let the SMS Message dissolved. On your phone???s messaging menu, look for the Text Message settings and set the message validity to 1 hour or minimum time. Turn off your phone for atleast 1 hour. When turned on, you will then unable to recieve the messages sent 1 hour after your phone was off. Messages sent to you by other people will also unable to receive.		* Ask for Help. Call your telecom operator and ask for customer support. If possible, request to terminate the subscription of the bomber. Your telco operator might request you to have a personal appearance on their office.		* Revenge. lol	but on a serious note 		This action is not ethical and I do not recommend this. You can download SMS Bomb and bomb them. The bomber may reconsider stop annoying you if you can do the same.Doing this only proves that you and the bomber are the same. Anyway, if you still insist to do it, Ican  provided simple code writen in Python for S60 that continuously send sms messages.	__________________		Edit: Damn.....!! my Inbox 38 messages just for asking that code 			**DISCLAIMER: THIS SCRIPT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND MUST NOT USE TO OFFEND OTHER PEOPLE.**","depth":0,"score":627,"ups":627,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CaptainOnBoard","name":"t1_crm4zz8","parent_id":"t3_37evec","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432701533,"created_utc":1432697933}

Here, there's a string of unicode characters that shouldn't exist together, that break the simplified rendering rules in iOS in such as way as the rendering engine stops working. Other software components will be dependent on the rendering engine, and so will stop working if it fails, which will in turn make other software give up.

{"body":"Relevant: http://xkcd.com/1053/		It's cool to be able to share something with someone who hasn't heard yet.		Viruses are generally targeted to the most numerous platform, and apple's app store keeps out most of the malware. Malware is software that makes your tech do what you don't want, essentially. This text thing that crashes phones is a string of characters that confuses a program and makes it crap its pants. Not a virus. A bug. All software is prone to bugs. Thousands to millions of lines of code, written by humans, who aren't perfect.		Taking advantage of a flaw in coding is called an exploit. This text thing exploits a bug in the banner notification for the messaging app. It doesn't run arbitrary code, so it isn't really a hack, just crashes the app or the phone.		A virus is a self-replicating bit of code that spreads. Malware is malicious software. This text thing is neither. 		Apple is not immune to viruses. It is a smaller target, and is coded differently than windows, the main target for malware. No computer is completely perfect. There are computers or operating systems that have no viruses in the wild, or are unaffected when patched up to date and follow best security practices, at least as far as can be known at the moment. But generally, any system has flaws that can be exploited. 		This text thing is sort of like kicking the shifter of your car while you're driving. Or tossing a wrench into the gears of a machine. When it's been fixed, this string of text won't crash the messaging app, but for now it's a flaw people are having fun using.		Some flaws can be exploited for a good purpose. Jailbreak can allow you full control of your iphone, using flaws in the system to break the security that locks it down, and then you can install apps that apple doesn't really want you to be able to use. 		The tools one can use and the flaws one can take advantage of can be used for good or ill.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_crmlroq","parent_id":"t1_crm9kyj","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432746694,"created_utc":1432743094}
