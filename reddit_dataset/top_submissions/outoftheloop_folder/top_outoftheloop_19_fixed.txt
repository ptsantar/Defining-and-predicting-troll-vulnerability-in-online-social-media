{"body":"Reddit is a terrible place to get news. An individual subreddit's culture can make the problem better or worse, but the real crux of the issue is the voting system. People upvote what they want to see. In aggregate, this means that any news subreddit will conform to the worldview and biases of its users. /r/worldnews, for instance, is very much focused on issues that affect or are of interest to young, white, technically literate, American men. This leads to the strange situation where an single false rape accusation can get more attention than a story about rape in general. (Obviously, I'm not saying that false accusations aren't bad, just that they have undue prominence). You're better off getting your news "in the wild" from a range of trustworthy sources across the political spectrum. In the UK, I'd suggest the Guardian, the BBC and the Times as a good selection covering the left, centre and right, respectively. None of these sources are totally without bias, but they all try to focus on the facts.

When people realize every story can be told with an angle, they start discussing not just the way you present political news, but also the way you present every other piece of news.

If their media reports on a fire in their large hotel that burnt a while ago, it'll definitely have a political impact. If they report on how they just discovered a cure for aids and cancer, it will have a radically opposed political impact. Talking about the latter and ignoring the former helps  increase nationalist sentiments even though these are not strictly speaking "political news" (well, unless you consider that the cure for aids and cancer was "found" by their leader).		Now, the North Korean people that are aware that their media tell stories (even non-political ones) based on their agenda rather than by ranking facts by order of importance and trying to keep a neutral point of view as much as possible, well, they can doubt the news they are told.		In our case, the propaganda is not that severe, but more importantly, we have ways to check news sources with opposite agendas and infer some kind of a realistic intermediate story in between two extremes. Or sometimes we can find sources and draw our own conclusions from them.
