{"body":"Mostly because they perceive baby boomers having had much easier lives than them. The oft-repeated story is this: baby boomers never went to college and got a well-paying 40-hour job with high school diploma only. With that job supported a stay-home wife, multiple kids, their own house and two cars. Meanwhile, the current generation has people with a college degree struggling to survive working minimum wage for 60 hours a week. Then the baby boomers call those people lazy and entitled.","depth":0,"score":2717,"ups":2717,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Nine_Gates","name":"t1_crd6nje","parent_id":"t3_36e2k6","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1431977721,"created_utc":1431974121}

Except I suppose the *actual* outcome would be that at least some employers decide to take on less experienced candidates, when they hit the point where the lack of ideal applicants becomes too obvious to ignore, and continuing without the role being filled becomes too harmful to their continued operations to tolerate.		Or they'd have to offer more money to the existing pool of sufficiently experienced employees to entice them... although really that just pushes the problem of finding a replacement off onto whoever they're being enticed away from.		The original "grinds to a halt" thing was a broad generalisation without much thought put into it; I realise it's the sort of situation that eventually resolves itself because people don't *actually* stick steadfastly to a rigid policy of only hiring people who have already done that same job for N years already.

Do you disagree with the following?		* If *everyone* were more willing to train staff then the situation would be broadly improved for almost everyone involved - there would be no shortage of experienced employees available for employers to benefit from, and the employees themselves would have more mobility and better prospects. (I anticipate that you might contest that, but I stand by it).		* *But*, each individual employer making their own individual decision can benefit by refusing to train staff unless absolutely necessary, if we assume that training is more costly than the immediate benefits unless the newly trained employee stays with you for a significant length of time to 'pay it back'.		* If there's a background of most people being willing to provide training then the hypothetical training-refusing employer can benefit from that at no cost by hiring from the pool of well-trained employees, and if there's a background of most people *not* being willing to do that, then they're no worse off than anyone else and they aren't disadvantaged by the "brain drain" of people leaving after training, before they've achieved a net benefit from training them.		* Therefore,  since there's no way to force everyone at once into cooperating, or prevent them from 'cheating' even if an agreement were somehow made voluntarily between all employers everywhere, the current situation is liable to persist to everyone's collective detriment, with no-one being able to unilaterally decide to change it.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"noggin-scratcher","name":"t1_crf4tto","parent_id":"t1_crf44je","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432128985,"created_utc":1432125385}

{"body":">How were they set up for success? 		In the post WWII economy, the United States was the only major power not rebuilding.  It entered into an era of massive deficit spending, in which government investment propped up markets.  The U.S. was still an industrial power, building what the world needed right here, so finding a decent-paying job wasn't hard.   But, to many of us, the boomers seem to believe that they found it easy to enter the middle class and therefore it *is* easy, and anyone who can't do it has personal failings.  What they don't recognize is that boomer leadership outsourced those jobs and moved that production overseas, that boomer-negotiated trade agreements maximized short-term market profit at the expense of long-term industrial growth at home, and that, once boomer politicians were in power, they bit the hand that fed them by insisting the deficit spending that had given them their fortunes was morally wrong and needed to end.		In other words, a rising tide lifts all boats.  But some boats in it think, "damn, I am so good at rising."  Then the tide shifted.  An ebbing tide lowers all boats.  We're those, and they're looking at us saying "why can't you rise? It's easy."		> How did they change the rules and which rules did they change to maximize their greed? 		 They profited from deficit spending and never paid for it, then demonized it and insisted future Americans need to pay those bills.  They removed many of the market protections the Greatest Generation had put in place to prevent a second great depression, and act shocked when that's causing income inequality. They inherited an economy with a trade surplus caused by WWII and negotiated free trade agreements that reversed it.  And today, if anyone proposes any New Deal-like policies or financial protections like the ones that made the economy work so well for them when they were young, they whine about who's going to pay for it and vote in conservative politicians who kill it, and use false equivalence to argue that they're being financially prudent, as though the economy of the world's only superpower could be treated like a household budget.		And they dismantled the pension system, leaving 401(k)s that, by definition, mean some people lose their retirement to keep the system working.		> And what did they do to the environment and policies that you would consider as total disregard?		They argue that they were the first generation to care about the environment, through their love of their self-image from the 60's.  But they have systematically dismantled what few environmental protections we had, and have failed to enact the ones they supposedly wanted.  Such that today we are facing global warming, and the time to do something to prevent it was 40 years ago.  Why didn't they, if they were so proud of their higher level of consciousness?  As near as we can tell, it's because they needed short-term profitable investments for those 401(k)s because they stripped the pension system.","depth":3,"score":198,"ups":198,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autojourno","name":"t1_crdi9ee","parent_id":"t1_crddz4n","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1431996932,"created_utc":1431993332}

So it was easy to get a well paying job and career, because jobs were on high offer and lower demand. The US provided both money and material to Europe. Japan industrialized and made its inauguration as one of the most technologically advanced countries in the 70s. Germany went from completely destroyed and divided (at one point Berlin was under jurisdiction of four different countries) to a major economy.		On top of all that, although this is more true to Europe than it is to the US, welfare state. People had public transit, health, social security, housing, etc, etc, etc all provided by the state through taxes. Economy was blooming. If you failed, you had a social security net to fall onto. Debt was safe to go into.		But all this started to end in the 80s. As social inequality was in decrease, the worker class divided again and the welfare state became too expensive to maintain itself, the social security net started to unthread. With automation, getting into the job market got difficult, especially the unskilled one. Higher education also have higher costs, and the specialized market started getting saturated.		So, you have less jobs and less important things to do now, and social disparity began to grow again. And the baby boomers, now in power (achieving their career primes on theirs 50s and 60s, even as politicians) like to blame the current generation for every demise that happens around the world, as if the newer generation just doesn't have the drive to succeed or expect everything handed to them.		This creates the conflict: the older generation blames the newer for any problem because "when we were young, those problems didn't exist, so it's clearly your fault" and the newer generation both blames the older ones in creating an apparatus that serves them and shits on everyone else and is resented that the ones that had everything handed to them on a gold plate feel that they have the right to criticize the ones who struggle.","depth":3,"score":38,"ups":38,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gogoliath","name":"t1_crdl54p","parent_id":"t1_crddz4n","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432002087,"created_utc":1431998487}

{"body":"I think there's definitely some truth there but regardless of tenure in one's career: the economics are different. The costs of good health care &  a *quality*education (two crucial things for a flourishing society are sadly far from reach for many people. What's worse is the technological advancements are pushing those same people out of the job market and there's no bandaid or short term solution we can use.		We should have been preparing for this but our government chose to hunt witches instead of placing hardly any amount of consideration for education. Every single study of society will refer to the importance of education. Not just for quality of life but our very evolution. 		The high cost of education is no reason to give up on bettering yourself and the world around you but it certainly puts Millennials (and everyone, actually) at an unnecessary disadvantage. We've got new tools at our disposal but it will be a long road ahead. Ultimately, I'm hopeful about the future but perhaps that's naive. Still, life goes on. 		As a young adult, I know I have some angst about the situation. Sometimes I'm lit with passion because a problem always merits a solution. Other days, I'm beside myself with rage and contempt at what seems to be endless greed and selfishness by a group of increasingly irrelevant people who refuse to unplug their eyes and ears to reality. I went through public school in the "No Child Left Behind" era and I can tell you - it's not a very rounded education. It's as is I was taught to use tools that no longer exist. Not much more than a number to count at the end of the year and I'm sure many people my age had similar experiences. 		That isn't to say all education was terrible but generally speaking, unless you live in a nice area or a school district with their shit together - good luck. That's not even counting the costs of higher education *after* lackluster primary education. There's this cultural habit now to trade the future for some short term gains and I'm sick of it.

Why are you too good to work at McBurgerville? Did you save up and buy your first car on your own? Did you do well enough in school to get a scholarship to college?		I'm going to tell my story because that answers the devil's advocate part of your post.		I got my first job at 17 (in a rubber car parts factory, which closed 2 or 3 years later, circa 2004), I would have got it at 16 if my parents didn't offer me to do work around the house (lived in the country, but didn't have a farm) at 10$/h which was better than the minimum wage back then (I'm in Canada, the minimum wage in my province is currently over 10$/h). Of course I took up the offer, but after doing about 300 hours over a month and not getting paid a penny (and I never got paid either, thanks mom and dad), I decided to stop and go back to the regular chores which took about 12-15 hours a week anyway. 		Doing menial tasks for money? I had to do them on a regular basis for no allowance at all. I had a certain amount of money to buy clothes+shoes (about 300$ per year), if I had any left I could spend it on other things of my choosing.		After taking up a couple of summer jobs, or just a part-time job while in college, I bought my first car (a rusted out VW which I kept for 8 years until it couldn't move without spending 10x its worth in repairs) and moved out when I entered university. Didn't flip burgers, but working in factories and a 3rd party call center is just as mentally debilitating. 		Didn't get a scholarship, entered university in physics, but since I had to work 20 hours a week at the same time, I couldn't get good (or average) grades and switched to humanities, graduated and realized I didn't have any future in academia so I tried to get a master in economics. That didn't go well, I was in the student's union of the university, pretty much burned out by the 2nd semester, fell into depression by the 3rd semester and didn't get the grades to be accepted in master. 		Tried to find a job with my degree, got fired twice in the meanwhile (I hadn't gotten fired in the 5 or so jobs I had in the 8 years prior) and ended up in a call center again where I've been working for 3+ years.		**TL;DR The devil's advocate can fuck baby boomers for all I care.**		edit : fixed typo and stuff","depth":3,"score":62,"ups":62,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tamer_","name":"t1_crdirld","parent_id":"t1_crdhnap","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1431997848,"created_utc":1431994248}

{"body":">or was smart enough to earn a free ride to college. 		Would you say I wasn't smart for NOT getting a 'free ride' to college? *Is that even available anymore?* I don't think it's a smart thing; it's a guidance thing; information resources. My guidance counselors worked hard JUST to get my low income classmates to barely graduate and had no energy to educate me on scholarships or grants. My parents were first generation and didn't know. I had no source of such knowledge to even understand opportunities available to me (AOL 3.0 didn't help with that if you're wondering). It's not a generational problem either, though I think there is an income gap problem, for which I do think baby boomers are very responsible, especially in my area (an area largely afflicted by post white-flight symptoms). Those on the higher end of that gap can influence the direction their children go (i.e. not to graduate school for six years), while those on the lower end have to experiment or learn to network better (which I eventually did).			So you don't worry about your children,	>because they are working and will have them paid off shortly after they graduate.		Again, *must be nice*. Your wisdom passed on to them and you may have even influenced them to strive towards higher earning professions. Good on you as a father/mother. I'm not blaming YOU - I don't think it's an issue with any ONE person. It's a misunderstanding and lack of empathy problem. It's the idea that no matter how hard one has it, if they JUST WORK HARD ENOUGH (your own language echoes this sentiment), they will make it out okay. Well guess what? My parents can't help me the way you help your children, and I certainly didn't have the resources they do when I was their age. No matter how hard I work, it doesn't feel easier and I've busted my ass for 10 years straight post-high school. I still earn less than I owe, and I will be paying back student loans for 25 years, with no chance at ever paying them off even making the six figure salary that I do (which is not enough to really thrive in Southern California which is why I have to weigh the option of moving away from my entire life). And once the remainder gets waived because I've been on income-based repayment for 25 years, I'll have to pay taxes on that amount because it'll count as income - *for some reason*.

If you aren't aware of the extreme expense that is medical school applications - let me just tell you that it is 100 dollars here, 100 dollars there - over 2 years - it adds up. You don't need an inheritance to afford it, but it still is costly. In my case, I worked full time during undergrad as a medical biller to afford to pay for my tuition and I also kept money aside to pay for applications.		> Would you say you would be ahead of the game if you just saved your $5000 and tuition and just went straight to work?		Certainly - but this is all in retrospect. At that point in my life (nearly 9 years ago now) I was dead set on getting into medical school and worked hard to get there. In the end, it wasn't meant to be so I pursued a different path - but I did it all on my own. I didn't have the wisdom of parents who went through higher education (both my parents only completed high school in their home countries). If I HAD gone straight to work, sure, I could've been in a better financial situation than I am today: without the student debt but with a lower salary... but, hindsight is 20/20. I know that *now*, but I was raised my entire life being told to work hard, go to school, get a degree, get a good job, -- the formula was very clearly outlined -- and I would live a good life - *the American Dream!* - or did you forget that little message the boomers ingrained in us?		>Do you think you want to change your opinion about that? 		Not really. We seem to have a difference of opinion here on what the advantage each generation has. From your arguments, millennials have the advantage of mega-information *vis-a-vis* the internet. Waze, wiki, and weather.com (does anyone actually use that?) may provide conveniences in every day life, but they do not make life *easier*. To even use those features, it costs at least 30$/month (for internet service), 30$/month (for cell phone service), 20/month or 50-350$+ for a cell phone - these are financials cancers that previous generations never dealt with. On a tangent, how about massive resume databases or talent management software (read: automated resume denial services) that make finding a job nearly impossible unless you know someone? When you needed to find a job, how did you go about it? Could you even find a job in today's market without consulting someone you know? I challenge you to find a job strictly through the internet in whatever your profession is, could you do it?		The advantage boomers (and to some extent gen Y / X) had is that the money coming in was generally higher than the money going out - and the harder they worked, the more money came in, and the more responsible they were, the less money went out - so hard work + responsibility = success. The disadvantage for millennials is that the money coming in is generally lower than previous generations had (and harder to come by), and the money going out is generally higher than previous generations had it. And working harder doesn't equate to more money coming in the way it did before, and being responsible to reduce the money going out means really sacrificing (if you don't believe me, go check out some of the daily habits redditors at /r/financialindependence take on to do so).","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"oldschoolcool","name":"t1_crewp7h","parent_id":"t1_creugli","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432100554,"created_utc":1432096954}

Say in district 1, Obama got the most votes, then that means that the representative from district 1 is going to cast one of the 538 votes.

Since its a winner-take-all system, if Obama got 5, Romney got 3, and Bobby got 4, then Obama would get all the electoral votes in that state. 			In order for a presidential candidate to win, they have to win at least 270 of the total votes, not just more than the other candidates. 			Because of how party identification and population works, this system has been heavily criticized because of campaign focus.

{"body":"You are more right that you are getting credit for. My own story is typical somewhat of someone born in the early 70's.	     	I saw your generation have Camaro's, GTO's, and the like. I saw 20 year old home-owners, and everything that goes with that generation.	    	When I turned 16 a car was something rich kids got as a gift from their parents. Insurance dictated many of my friends not getting a car at all. I was lucky and saved nearly $1000 and bought one pile of crap by working, and saving. My parents (raised by a single mother until I was 13) were EXTREMELY generous. They paid the insurance. I was working the limit of my underage work permit at a fast food chain, and even a FULL HALF of my yearly salary would just cover the insurance premium in the late 80's.	     	Those times in the mid / late 80's working sucked. I quit job after job chasing a 5?? raise. $3.75 vs. $3.90 was grounds for immediate walk-off-the-job. In the early days I shoveled sidewalks for $1.25 an hour at the condo complex I lived in. I couldn't mow because you had to be 18 to operate a power tool.	     	Think about that for a minute Redditors. $3.75 an hour, limited to 16 hours a week. That is $3,120 a year. That is less than a month's salary for the average American today. Once I hit 18 I could get $4.25 an hour, and work 40 hours a week. That's a yearly salary pennies over $8,500 a year. It's the 90's and I want to go to college. Oops, guess I'm only working 24 hours a week. Drop that to $5,300 a year. Tuition: $2,900 a year for a state school. I now have $2,400. Car insurance for a clean driving record and a family sedan is $1,100 a year. I now have $1,300 to live on for a year. That is $25 a week, with NO other expenses.	     	Sorry for the off-tangent detailed explanation of a "budget", but that's how I experienced it. If you are as I assume born in the mid-to-late 60's it was an entirely different world. By the early-to-mid 80's you could have had a $20,000 home, even with a high mortgage, and been somewhat stable with a job / career. Hell in 1985 a condo in my complex was "luxury" and we still had a few of the 80's Milwaukee Brewers players living there (LONG story, but basically my dad left my mom, and never paid a cent in child support... gave her the condo though).

Of course you don't remember women being barred from most jobs, or from not being allowed to wear slacks into a restaurant, or the shame they were made to feel if pregnant out of wedlock.

I grew up in a middle class family.  After high school I went to college for a short while and then felt that those going to Canada to avoid the draft were wrong, so I enlisted in the Army.  After 3 years in the Army and one year in Viet Nam, I returned home, went back to college and became a pharmacist, and spent 36 years helping people.

{"body":"You might be interested in reading about the Strauss-Howe generational theory.  You can browse it [here](http://www.lifecourse.com/about/method/insight-overview.html), but for a brief summary:		There are four generational archetypes, which explain how generations interact with each other and with the world.  Each generation is shaped by their own place is history and how they were raised.		The first archetype is the "Hero" generation.  The most recent Hero generation was the G.I. generation.  They are born during an "Unraveling", a time of disillusionment, social apathy, and hedonic individualism (Roaring Twenties).  They come of age during a "Crisis", a time when the mistakes of the Unraveling come to a head (Great Depression, WWII).  They tend to be very collectivistic, optimistic, and empowered as they grow up and overcome their monumental challenges.		The next generation, who are children of the older members of the Hero generation and younger members of the generation before them, are the "Artist" archetype.  The most recent Artists were the Silent generation - think Don and Betty from Mad Men.  They were children during the crisis, watching their older siblings make huge sacrifices, and came of age during the "High" period that followed the crisis, when the Hero generation had strengthened institutions (government, schools, community-oriented businesses, etc.).  They learned to keep their heads down and work hard, and that they would be rewarded.		The next generation is the "Prophet" generation, and here is here the Boomers came in.  They were the children of younger Heroes and older Silents, and they were children during the High, when everyone was focused on giving them everything and they had not a care in the world (societally speaking).  They came of age during an "Awakening", during which they began to rebel against what they viewed as a stagnant and oppressive civil authority (the "strong institutions" created by the G.I. Generation).  They tend to value freedom and individual expression.  Unfortunately, this kind of individualism leads to the economic and social laissez-faire approach that spurs the onset of an Unraveling (like the 1910s/1920s and 1980s/90s) and eventually a Crisis.		The last generational archetype are the Nomads, most recently Gen X.  They are children of younger Silents and older Boomers, growing up during the Awakening, often ignored and overlooked as adults are more concerned with freedom and expression (Gen X is the most aborted generation to date.)  They come of age during the Unraveling, feeling alienated and focused inward.  Think Daria and Kurt Cobain.		And thus the cycle returns to where it started: the Hero generation.  The Millennials were born to younger Boomers and older Gen Xers, grew up oversheltered in an uncertain Unraveling and forced to band together to right the wrongs set in motion by the previous Prophet generation (Boomers) - in our case, I believe it's the economy, although the theory suggests we still have 10-15 years to potentially experience another total war like WWII.		According to the theory, Millennials of today will preside over the "strong" and stodgy institutions that our children and grandchildren (new Prophets) will rebel against in about 30-40 years.","depth":0,"score":726,"ups":726,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"peppermint-kiss","name":"t1_crdfq6d","parent_id":"t3_36e2k6","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1431992294,"created_utc":1431988694}

Previously this generation argument would have held more water when children were quite reactionary to their parents, at least in the UK it was the case in the 40s and 50s, you dressed like your parents, however in the 60-90s you dressed differently, young, a tad of rebellion. This really isn't the case any more, the line between adult and teenager is much blurrier than it use to be. My point here is that the lines that divide are growing blurry and as a result they do not fit the patterns that have been predicted. 		People also have a habit of changing throughout their life, as a result an argument that a certain generation is destined to have certain traits is just erronous, a human is alot of things during their life, and almost always a hypocrit at some point.		I hope you don't take this as ad hominem, but your point about the artist generation, their kids and you're they're teacher, you're suppose to be bossing them around and them obeying that. I don't feel it is a good point, and if we are allowing anecdotes into this discussion - I feel that many millenials are many things, including better fits to 'Gen Xers' and this 'Artist' generation. 		My overarching points were outlined at the beginning, that this generation idea is simply too reductionist, it strips away alot of the complexity of humans in society and just tries to fit them into a pattern that doesn't hold up on a person by person basis.

Brains somewhat fried from alot of writing already.","depth":5,"score":62,"ups":62,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Pseudolus_Festivus","name":"t1_cre2x3p","parent_id":"t1_cre0zg8","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432050312,"created_utc":1432046712}
{"body":"I really appreciate you taking the time to write your reactions to the ideas. Part of the reason that you're finding the argument simplistic is that I vastly oversimplified it in order to fit it into a Reddit comment. Actually, many of the points you brought up here are addressed in the books Strauss and Howe wrote together. I'll try to answer some of them here.		It is absolutely true that personal experiences, genetics, etc. have a hand in shaping any particular individual's personality and outlook. Generational environment is only one of many factors that influences how a person thinks and behaves. The argument is not that ALL Gen Xers are cynical - far from it - but rather that the overarching mood of that generation - as displayed in media and consumer trends, general life decisions, and so on - tend to suggest a preference for the practical over the moralistic or optimistic.		Consider, for a moment, music and art trends. The Nomad generations - Gen Xers and, before them, the Lost generation - grew up relatively discarded and ignored by society in general as compared to surrounding generations. Their music, literature, honbbies, and art during the "Unraveling" - 1980s and 90s, and 1910s and 20s, reflect their feelings of introspection, alienation, and pragmatism. Consider not only grunge and Survivor, but also jazz music, surrealism, and T.S. Elliot.  Referring to the Lost Generation, Samuel Hynes wrote in 1990 that "Lost means not 'vanished', but disoriented, wandering, directionless."		The fact that you sense that people are more individualistic - without a "mould" - is not an accident or a departure from historical trends either. You are comparing the conformist "High" of the 1950s and 60s with the every-man-for-himself "Crisis" of the 2000s and 10s. To get a more accurate perspective, you would have to go back to the previous "Crisis" era - 1929-1945 or so. The current era started around 2008 according to Howe, so we are within the first decade of our Crisis. Compare our society now to the society of the 1930s - even ignoring the obvious economic parallels, let's look specifically at personal identity and popular culture. Some trends of the time were horror movies, Art Deco, and realism in art, but these trends were not society-wide movement. Most people were too concerned with their own survival to participate in consumeristic collectivist trends. More importantly, collectivism was a trait that was valued by the G.I. Generation, who were still too young to exert much influence over mainstream society, in the same way that Millennials have their own microsocieties now (e.g. Reddit) but little influence over the cultural and societal landscape of the world. Some ideas are starting to bud - the Internet of things, for example - but it'll be another decade or so before these things become ubiquitous, and people start being defined in terms of what role they play in their community versus how they see themselves. This is part of the cyclical nature of history - whether society as a whole is inward-facing or outward-facing.		Children's relationships with their parents, too, are cyclical. Younger Prophets rebel against and define themselves in opposition to their collectivist parents, but their collectivist children often feel a close bond to their more relaxed, values-driven parents. This is not a recent anomaly, but an ongoing trend of how children and parents interact with each other. However, Millenials do not blindly accept the world they have inherited from the predecessors, as you can see in this thread, just as G.I. did not blindly accept the society that had allowed men like Hitler and Stalin to gain control or the wild speculation that caused the crash in '29. They set up new institutions to guard against such things, just as Millennials are primed now to start implementing new solutions for the economic and technological challenges we've been facing.		You are very right that people change over time, and that too is accounted for in the theory.  Hero (G.I. And Millenial) generations grow from protected children, to optimistic young adults, to hubristic elders. Artist generations (Silent and the kids of today) grow from sheltered children to conformist adults to sensitive elders. Prophet (Boomers) generations grow from indulged children, to narcissistic young adults, to moralistic and wise elders. And Nomads (Lost, Gen X) grow from abandoned children, to alienated young adults, to pragmatic and survivalist leaders. Again, we are not talking about any particular individual's trajectory, but rather the overarching trend of how particular age groups tend to act at particular times in their life depending on when they were born. Young Millennials, for example, are very different than Gen Xers or Boomers were at their age, although the older generations often misunderstand or overlook these differences and make false equivalences. And although I often talk about the 20th century, these are not isolated cases but rather representative of patterns that trace back at least to the 1400s		It's all rather fascinating and I do hope you'll give it more of a chance than my incomplete explanation warrants - you may find more thorough answers to these questions and others you may have about the issue.

{"body":"Hmm, that's a good question, and a bit harder to answer.  Boomers tend to be very polarizing - the ones that I agree with, I find inspiring and almost breath-taking, to be honest...Bill Gates, Elizabeth Warren, the state leader of my political volunteer group.  And the ones that I disagree with, I find not only distasteful but almost downright evil.  Even within a single Boomer...e.g. my dad...it's hard not to absolutely look up to and admire certain aspects (his views on technology, for example, or his wisdom on making life decisions) while simultaneously detesting and rejecting others (his constant defeatism, his personal/relational choices).		For Millennials and Xers I meet, I tend to see them as whole people, with the good balancing the bad, and see them more from a personal connection (Millies) or practical utlity (Xers) point of view.  So for example, I empathize with my Millie coworker's rigidity because I can understand her feelings of confusion and lack of direction in the workplace, and I forgive my Xer older sister (much older) for being distant because I know how hard she works and that she's there for me if I need her.  With Boomers, I see them as idea-givers, direction-pointers.  But if they seem to be pointing me in the wrong direction, or being judgmental of my choices because they can't see the world the way I do, I find it hard to synthesize that into my overall picture of them - to accept that this person going on about what is, to me, total nonsense, is also a complete and nuanced person in and of themselves who is similar to me in any way.  And similarly, when they are kind or helpful or wonderful to me, I appreciate it so much, but I still feel this disconnect that makes it hard to empathize and connect with them on a personal level, just because so many of them tend to come at the world from an entirely different direction than I do.  It's like being given a glass slipper from your fairy godmother - you're like, fuck yeah, glass slipper, that was so kind, thank you...but you don't feel like you *know* the fairy godmother any better as a person because she did that for you, you know?

Strong institutions do not *require* central control, and in fact... the strong institutions of the past (in the USA) were born from our individuality... what we're actually experiencing is the lack of self-control. People aren't taking responsibility for their own actions. Individuality without responsibility produces chaos. As a society we then started to lean more and more upon centrally controlled government.

{"body":"So I don't think you and I disagree necessarily based on what you said. What I specifically meant was that the invidualism and lack of community spirit that generally defines the Boomer generation is inherently contradictory to the idea of creating a strong economy that benefits everyone in the society as opposed to the elite few who are knowledgeable and powerful enough to stack the deck in their favor. I agree that strong institutions don't require central control, and don't even necessarily need to involve the government at all, but the theory posits that the weakening of these institutions is what leads to the Unraveling and eventually the Crisis. So for example, in centuries past it was the weakening of the Church that led to religious awakenings, which led to disillusionment and fracturing, which led to a new resurgence of community spirit in some other form.		In the most recent case, my understanding is that the individualism of the Boomers led to them dismantling the worker and economic protections of the past, as well as paving the way for corporations to engage in practices that resulted in short-term profit in lieu of long-term stability (trade agreements, etc.). Not so much "laissez-faire" as "laissez-ME-faire-what-I-want".		You're right that the chaos now is a result of the lack of responsibility, but luckily we have some pragmatic Gen X leaders and some optimistic and group-oriented Millennials coming up the pipeline to get our hands dirty and deal with this mess, which is not to discount the large number of idealistic and fair-minded Boomers who will set the tone (agree with her or not, Elizabeth Warren is an example of a Boomer who sticks to values and ideals over short-term profit and advancement).","depth":2,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"peppermint-kiss","name":"t1_cre9zob","parent_id":"t1_cre8g1r","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432061715,"created_utc":1432058115}

{"body":"edit: Gilded and in /r/bestof, I can only say that I think it's funny that the "fuck you" version of this comment rises above. Love you, Reddit!		One of the points in my unedited comment [below the line] is that "long term wage compression" is ignored by economists. It is so ignored that if you wish to read a non-fuckyou version you can google exactly that phrase, then read a less profane version of the same piece written by me and posted right here on reddit. If a random internet guy can write a comment on reddit and it shows up on the first page of google... it might actually be fair to say that economists ignore this topic. Almost every source on wage compression is a discussion in business management and they also use the term wage inequality.		* Wages = Consumer Demand = Good Economy	* No Wages = Demand Suppression = Shitty Economy		Laws matter because they have institutional force. **VOTE for wages.** Demand that candidates pledge definitely to bump the minimum wage. Accept nothing less than a legally binding agreement with your country that the lowest legal wage for an adult results in a consumer that can pay some damn rent. And don't freak--skilled labor and college degrees will still get better paychecks. This vote for wages is the most PRO-BUSINESS thing you can do. **Business is suffering because consumer demand is too low.** A national minimum wage above the poverty line ends the need for the taxpayer subsidies called Food Stamps and the Earned Income Credit. Those programs are corporate welfare.		Ask your family to vote with you. The world needs the young desperately--and it needs them to be full wage participants in the economy.		-----------------------			[original comment] Because they fucked something up and won't admit that they were wrong. And the thing that they fucked up was HUGE. JOBS. How the fuck stupid does one have to be to deliberately break jobs? Before Boomers, everyone had basically agreed that civilization was a good thing and marauding hordes at the gates of your town was a bad thing. The way that civilization ended the practice of marauding hordes was to ... invite them in, give them jobs and sell them real estate!		Boomers fucked up Jobs and Wages! Why? Because they wanted to be able to use the phrase: "You loser." So, instead of everyone gets to have civilization--they get to say "This loser", "That loser" and "Those losers." What did they pay for this privilege? HALF OF THE FUCKING ECONOMY. No shit. In their broken fucked up attempt to say I am great, they decided to begin excluding people where it really counts. They voted against people having money--and HALF of the money is now gone.		**Wages.**		When boomers were kids, the minimum wage was really only for teenagers--and real jobs paid on a very different scale. You might get a part time job in high school at 17 and then when you could work full time you would get a 'real' job. That job paid you... are you ready... 400% of what your kid job paid. It is now down to a little more than 200% because boomers liked the idea of using money as the easy mark to identify "Those losers."		* In 1980: Min wage = $3 per hour. Real wage = $12 per hour. 400%. This was normal for most people.		So... how come it don't be like that NOW? Economists call it wage compression. It should be called LONG TERM wage compression, but all of the economists are boomers and they don't give a shit about 'those losers" so they never study wage compression except in tiny 6 month increments in maybe two zip codes. During the last 35 years, every time the unemployment rate burped the price for Real Jobs would settle after the crisis and be just a little lower. The business community became really good at looking for cheaper labor--and a steady supply of 'those losers' were a little more eager to accept the scraps of the real economy. Why pay wages for a 'Real Job' when you can hire someone a little hungrier for less? THIS is what happened--and the boomers WANTED IT TO HAPPEN. "I have stuff, you don't--now you are a loser and I am not. Neener fucking neener, you loser bitch." Sounds petty and stoopid, huh? The difference between kid jobs and real jobs went down 5% per year.... for 35 years.		* In 1980, the real job vs kid job differential... 400%	* After 2 years, the real job differential... 390%	* After 5 years, 375%	* After 8 years, 360%	* After 22 years, 295%	* After 35 years, 230% (this roughly matches up with 2015 numbers. $7.25 x 2.30 = $16.65)		**Hey kids! VOTE those dumbasses to hell.** Fuck those guys--they are calling you losers because they won't pay you. The way that you really say fuck those guys is to VOTE AFFIRMATIVELY for wages. Do not vote for any candidate that is not directly telling you that they will change the laws to mandate living wages. Wages should be your dealbreaker. NEVER listen to a businessperson telling you that they can't--they can. But it is true that those whiners are pussies and business has no place for pussies. Coffee is for closers, motherfucker!		**The evidence** that some of you need is Australia. **The median net worth of an Australian is TEN TIMES the median net worth of someone in the US.** [Here's a fucking source on that.](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/news/economy/middle-class-wealth/) In 1980, Australia locked in their minimum wage to the cost of having a real life and their min wage was exactly the same as here. Today, the Aus min wage is $16 an hour and skilled labor gets almost $30 an hour. Aus unemployment is low. An Aus hamburger costs the same as here and McDonald's is profitable. As it turns out, [EVERYTHING that Boomers say about raising the min wage is a fucking lie](http://www.dol.gov/minwage/mythbuster.htm). 		I really think that the only certain solve for The Economy Problem is to push from the bottom up. Minimum wage needs a big increase. Yes, there are other possible solutions which -maybe- would work. Raising the minimum would absolutely, positively make big repairs to the economy overnight.		**tl;dr: Quick recipe for having civilization: Include people economically.

{"body":"The poster is talking about a minimum wage being lower for workers under 18 than those over. There is nothing that says they can't make the same or more than an adult, just that legally they are allowed to be paid less. So if that kid is a better worker than an adult counter part, business would dictate a wage increase to keep their services. It creates competition and incentive right from the start as there is a goal to work for. If you are 16 and work your ass off I'd imagine you have a better chance of getting close to the adult minimum in Australia than even getting a dollar raise in America. America's minimum wage jobs tend  to never give raises because our culture has ingrained that those jobs are for kids who are going to college soon. Well, because we have a surplus of unskilled minimum wage jobs and a lack of educated/skilled labor jobs, you have people with trade skills and degrees working and getting minimum wage. You also see people at McDonald's who have 20+ years of service getting a nickel or a dime raise every year. You cant live off of that and there is no reason to give better raises in the company because there is nothing to create competition. A low minimum wage traps workers, they can't get educated in our system and they can't work a few years to get a decent salary over time. Instead, they will work that job until a slightly better one comes or pick up more part time Jobs to boost income all while being told they are failures and that these jobs are for children and if you want to succeed go to school. Guess what, I know lots of people with degrees who make under 10 an hour, they went to school but our shitty economy doesn't have any jobs. Now they work 3 part time jobs, live with their parents, and still come close to defaulting on student loans.","depth":8,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"warriormonkey03","name":"t1_crdxc6n","parent_id":"t1_crdwrwr","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432036686,"created_utc":1432033086}

{"body":"TLDR:		It's 1975, the Labor Party (social democrats) under Gough Whitlam form government after 23 years of Liberal governments. However the Liberal Party (conservatives) still have a majority in the upper house. 		This is because Senators serve a term of 6 years compared to 5 for Representatives and the last Senate election was in 1970. Only half of the senate seats are up for grabs during an election so there's an overhang of senators from the previous election. 		Australia's economy is in recession during the 70's, mostly because of the end of the post-war Bretton-Woods system in 1971. The US stops exchanging dollars for gold in 1971 which indirectly causes the '73 Oil Crisis. Australia is hit by high inflation but also low growth and high unemployment - stagflation. Whitlam's policy of increased government spending causes an increasing trade deficit. 		The Labor Party embarks on a series of major policy changes: they introduce universal healthcare (medicare), abolish university fees, grant independence to Papua New Guinea, introduces no fault divorce and Aboriginal land reform. Whitlam allegedly also wants the removal of US bases from Australia. 		Malcolm Fraser, the Liberal leader, refuses to pass the supply, basically the budget. Flat out blocking supply is an extreme tactic but also constitutionally valid. Defeating two supply bills is a trigger for a double dissolution election - simultaneous elections in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Liberal senators vote to defer but not defeat supply. They have until November 1975 before supply runs out. 		Whitlam wants to wait until after the 1976 half-senate elections because NT and the ACT gained an extra senator. Since these new senators would sit immediately while the other senators would be replaced a month later this would probably give Labor a temporary majority. 		Sir John Kerr, the Governor-General, is the representative of the Queen. He ticks off on legislation and has the power to dissolve Parliament. By convention, like the British Monarchy, he only ever acts on the advice of the Prime Minister - maybe the Parliament. 		Fraser wants Kerr to dismiss Whitlam as Prime Minister if supply cannot be passed and call a general election (which he will probably win). Whitlam wants to destroy the senate's right to block supply and isn't interested in any compromise. He wants that senate half-election early. Fraser tells Kerr if he calls a half-election that he's convinced the 4 Liberal state premiers not to issue the election writs. 		Kerr determines that nothing is going to break this godawful deadlock and decides to dismiss Whitlam. Which is kind of controversial because of the possibility of Liberal Senators crossing the floor to vote with Labor. Kerr also doesn't notify Whitlam of his intentions to dismiss him which is another area of controversy. Perhaps because Whitlam might have asked the Queen to dismiss Kerr. 		So Whitlam rocks up on November 11 with a letter advising (read: ordering) Kerr to call a senate half-election. Kerr dismisses Whitlam in accordance to the constititution and asks Fraser to form a caretaker government. Fraser then calls a motion for a double dissolution - which is defeated - so he advises Kerr to call for one instead. Fraser wins the election and business continues as usual.","depth":5,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"a_furious_nootnoot","name":"t1_crdu0jb","parent_id":"t1_crdpbrs","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432022408,"created_utc":1432018808}

{"body":"Honestly I do not think that negative gearing has that much an impact on house prices as ppl think. What most don't realize is the massive risk inherent in property investment. That risk is very hard to quantify but the best way I can put it is that if you have a property you are expecting compensation from your property going up in value however you could also take a massive loss at any time. If you are negative geared, it's really scary because every year you are losing money plus the opportunity cost of your down payment. Sure you get back a % of your loss as a tax deduction but the rest you pay out of pocket. That amount is chump change compared to the loan amount which could be 100x what you get back on tax. What most ppl don't realize and a lot of investors is that you are betting a huge amount of money which you don't really own as it's a loan. 		I've been a renter, home owner and property investor and I would advise against anybody getting an investment property unless you are doing something like renting it out and living at home or you are a builder and the property industry is your job.		Edit. I do agree though that the notion of negative gearing drives up property prices by sort of tricking investors into believing it helps a lot when really it doesn't.

The median household income before tax in Australia is **$46,900 (6468 hrs 58 mins)**. To convert that $46,900 figure we will start with removing the taxable amount. For 2011, the taxable amount we are looking at was a 1.5% Medicare levy, plus a $4650 flat rate combined with 30% of any amount over $37,000. This gives us a total of **$38576.50AUD**.		2011 was a particularly good year for the Australian Dollar, with a AUD to USD exchange rate average of 1.033853. This gives a new total of $39882.43USD. As a side note, the trend of a strong Australian dollar in the last few years has a lot to do with Australia weathering the 2008 financial crisis relatively well, having strong non-American trading partners (China and Japan predominately).		Because we had a strong dollar, prices rose and the Australia PPP modifier rose to 1.51, making our adjusted total now **$26412.21USD**.		This is in comparison to the USA with a median household income (after tax) of **$29,056USD**, meaning comparatively speaking the typical Australian household is earning the equivalent of **$2643.79USD less** than their American counterparts.		_____________________________________________		**A quick interlude about the usefulness of minimum wage.**		Americans love to compare their minimum wage of $7.25USD to Australians, as it makes them look harder-done-by in comparison to Australia's minumum wage of $16.37AUD. Besides the PPP problem elaborated on above, another major flaw is the variable wages according to age in Australia. Anyone under 16 get paid 36.8% of the minimum wage, and this continues on with 46.3% for a 16yo, 57.8% for a 17yo, 68.3% for an 18yo, 82.5% for a 19yo, and 97.7% for a 20yo.		Apprentices get paid 55% of minimum wage for their first year, 65% for the second, 80% for the third and 95% for a fourth year apprentice.		_____________________________________________		**Some bonus information about housing prices, courtesy of the original comment I made this wall of text for.**		The average home price in Australia is **$539,400AUD** (~$487,400USD), compared to the American average of **$152,000USD**		This means that a typical house costs a typical American **5.23 years**  of total household income to buy a house. An Australian will be expected to spend **13.98 years** of total household income to buy a house.		Neither of these figures are inclusive of loan interest, or cost of living expenses (which are 51% higher in Australia, see the 1.51 PPP value).		_____________________________________________		**Bonus info on alcohol prices from another thread I posted this in.**		The same way it relates to everything bought in Australia, the base alcohol price is 51% extra due to our higher wages. This would mean that a $25.00USD bottle of spirits in the USA should cost an average of ~$40.00AUD. the difference between that and the $50-70.00AUD we would actually pay is the insane alcohol tax we have.		_____________________________________________		TL;DR: Americans complain too much about their minimum wage, all things considered.		Please keep in mind those are 2012 numbers, now the Aus dollar is buying approximately 0.79 USD so Americans are better off than we are beyond what is shown in the post","depth":1,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"joachim783","name":"t1_crdzf3r","parent_id":"t1_crd99sf","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432043181,"created_utc":1432039581}

The great thing about being a sentient human among billions of humans is that I have the power to choose what my life is for - I can live to experience as many cultures as I touch, or to nurture the elderly whose family's can't or won't care for them, or to foster animals that have been abandoned, or to donate my time to troubled teens or the homeless. A life without children is not a pointless, selfish life.  		Because I have thoughts and feelings, I can choose what my life means. I have chosen to make my life something other than parenthood. My choice in no way leads to the extinction of our species, nor does it enforce other people to choose what I choose, nor does it diminish the validity of the choice to become a parent.   		If humans were an endangered species, I can see why procreation might be imperative, and how any fertile woman would have a duty to preserve the future - but that's not the case. Humans have more than enough people producing children that I do not need to worry about my bloodline. In fact, part of my choice to not have children is the host of significant medical issues I'd pass on to my children. It's not fair to whatever children I might have to expose them to any of the risks my blood would breed in them.   		My point is, I am human, much like yourself. Much like your children. Though we differ in our choice to bear children, it doesn't mean we differ on how we view the importance of ensuring a healthy community, society, and planet.  We just make a difference in different ways.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AlaskanFeesh","name":"t1_cremfvb","parent_id":"t1_creg6ru","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432081620,"created_utc":1432078020}

{"body":"So, looking at this specifically; the boomer's philosophy as they aged is "I've got mine".  Except there's far more of them than there were of previous generations, so it really doesn't scale well.		The boomers, in many ways, didn't plan for any future *after* their generation.  		Take California's government worker pension system.  They paid far more than the future citizens of California could ever afford to pay, unless the state's population kept expanding exponentially.  It can't mathematically do that, so the state is broke, and is paying the agreed-upon pensions.		Or take Proposition 13, also in California; property taxes can only go up 1% a year once you own a house, and can go down if the house decreases in value.  You lock in your property tax, even if the price of real estate around you goes way, way up, and even if inflation makes 1% an actual decrease.  It strongly rewards years-in-one-place... which modern jobs don't really allow us, while for the retirees, they don't care, and let others pay for them.		Or the biggest one of them all?  Social Security?  For those of us under 40, we're unlikely to get it; the system is mostly broke.  (And yeah, that's a crazy big simplification.)  The current retirees - the boomers - will likely be the last generation to get that benefit, while the rest of us keep on paying for it.		The boomers... also didn't save as much money as previous generations.  So lots of boomers keep working past the normal retirement age, especially with the stock market ~5 years ago... which means they were still in jobs working while millennials couldn't find jobs, stalling the rotation of that system.

{"body":"Boy howdy, had this discussion between me, my sister, and my mother with my father eventually interjecting. 		Both of my parents are considered "Baby Boomers." My mother was just nearing the outside of that 'generation' being born in 1960, and my old man soundly inside it being born in 1949 (Age gap discussion to the left). My mother comes from an Airforce family, where my old man comes from a Navy family. 		Mom had to travel around a lot, my old man was stuck in his home town for his natural life. Mom had a more 'seasoned', eh, 'liberal' stance on things than my old man who only really traveled when he was in the Navy. Just to give a background. 		So this discussion happened...christ...almost 3 years ago I'd like to say? I was visiting in town (moved to a different city) and my sister came over because of that. My sister and I got in to a rather agreeable discussion on the state of the country, and every time we were able to source some issue to a baby boomer or a group comprised of baby boomers. 		This practically made my mother a bit livid. She at first came at us angry (Both of us just kinda put our hands up like "We're not meaning harm, but we're seeing some correlation here that concerns us" kind of thing, mom promptly blurts out the "You have to admit that your generation is lazy." 		Me:"That's...I'd say we're trying to take life in a more relaxed light than being truely lazy. Sure we've got our honest fair share of weakest-links in our generation, but we haven't quite been propped up for adult life like your generation has- and that has cost our country as a whole quite a bit of money."		Sis:"I mean, the GI Bill, the easy student loans, the ability to practically pay off a student loan in a summer in the 1970s"		This is where my mothers' age kinda comes in to play		Mom:"Well, I didn't have it THAT easy."		Me:"You were raised by a highly ranked Airforce officer! You had a -HUGE- house! If anything, you had it way better than your own generation"		-Omitting detail due to privacy- 		Mom:"Well, I still don't see how its our generations fault for the current situation"		Me:"Mom, look at the laws that were passed in the 90s that are effecting us today. Half of my generation was still in diapers by the time half of these crummy laws were passed. (IE Deregulation of banks and loans, relaxed interest rates for banks, relaxed rules on Mortgages, etc) 		Mom:"I...but this generation is still so lax..."		This is when to my and my sisters surprise, my old man jumps in. 		Dad: [Mom], its not terribly hard to see the writing on the wall. Our GENERATION fucked up this county, there's no way around it. It doesn't entirely mean that we as individuals are directly the reason, but we share responsibility for it. That responsibility was electing unqualified dumbshits to pass laws they hardly understood. It was like giving the keys to a big rig to a toddler."		From here on in the conversation devolved away from the topic. I agree with my old man, its the baby boomers who got elected long ago and held on for dear life to their positions who didn't understand wtf they were doing (or did and being purposefully destructive) elected by the very generation entrusted with safeguarding the next. 		From my old man's perspective, they failed. They failed hard.

{"body":"Here in the UK at least, the boomer generation made use of the social safety net and support structure that existed, it helped them to manage the cost of living a normal life, on a normal salary, and support a normal family in a normal home.		They were, from there, free to strive for more and to gain progress through their hard work.			They managed to make lives from there, and enjoy relative comfort and security.			My issue arises, when, from their position of comfort and security, and in blind ignorance of the rapidly expanding population, they did, and continue to do so to this day, vote against those social securities and safety nets. They support "affluence" and "prosperity" at the cost of social security and support structures.		It's like they used the support structure to climb to a comfortable position, then on the back of promises of making those comfortable positions even more plush, voted to throw away the ladder.			Eg. Many baby boomers had their further education funded by government grants. Then voted to allow tuition fee increases and for student loans to cover the costs. They got essentially free education, then decided those who came after them should go into debt for it.			Housing, many baby boomers had social housing. Rented at affordable rates allowing them to house their families without being at the mercy of the private rental sector. - Then opted to buy those social houses, after being promised the wonders of becomming a "homeowner" and most of them ended up in the hands of private landlords, who in turn increase the costs of renting to maximise profits.		Those who owned homes already saw them more as investments than homes, and enjoyed the personal gains bought on by rapidly inflating the housing market.		I believe the biggest issue the baby boomer generation has, (something that clashes severely with the popular opinion that the post-war economy and country they were born into was in "easy mode" as they rebuilt after the war) is the self attribution fallacy.		The idea that someone got to a comfortable, successful position through hardwork, intelligence, and sacrifice. While ignoring the social support structure, education and relative comfort of a safety net that allowed them to take the risks and make the moves it took to get there. It's just because they're better than people who didn't do so well, not because their situation was conducive to success.		This promotes a negative opinion of younger people as "entitled." As it looks, through the self attribution fallacy glasses, that young people just want to be given success rather than work for it. When in reality, for the vast majority of young people, via compressed wages, and the dual income norm for a family, it takes major effort just to get by, with any extra work or intelligence, or sacrifice going largely unrewarded.		That's another issue, we're talking about the generation who grew up in a World where a single income could support a family, and via, no doubt unintentional, individualistic voting and supporting, created the "dual income required" family setup we see today which clashes horribly with such basic human conditions as raising a family.			They essentially climbed the ladder, found themselves a comfortable perch, and cut the rest of the ladder off, and sold it for personal gain.		From there they have the sheer audacity to tell younger generations, who are living and competing (something else they really supported, the transition from cooperation to competition) in a world population TWICE the size, without the safety net, or social support structure that they enjoyed, to "work harder" and stop being so "entitled."		I'm sure we would all like to quit our safe, secure, but low paying jobs and chase our dreams, open our own businesses, and try to secure better jobs that may or may not work out, but when the punishment for our failure is abject poverty, foodbanks and homelessness, it's much harder to take risks than it was for them where the only punishment is a small drop in social status, with the very worst possible outcome being a semi comfortable life on the social safety net.		They tell us to take risks, make moves and to persue our dreams, while all the time making those risks more and more dangerous for us.		That generation has done incredible damage to society it's self, the economy and the planet and while the following generations try to fix it, the boomers are still around, still voting against fixing it, and propping the entire thing up.			They turned "society" into a race, and the economy into a pyramid scheme, but not until they had passed through the hardest parts and established themselves, and they continue to support the setup they created at the expense of everyone coming after, them despite losing touch with how the world works.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheBestWifesHusband","name":"t1_cre3t61","parent_id":"t3_36e2k6","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432051843,"created_utc":1432048243}

{"body":"We don't; we want them to die. It's harsh, but it's (relatively) true.	If you look at your family tree 100, 200 or even 500 years back, you'll find out that your grandmothers churned out at least half a dozen babies in their lifetimes. Due to poverty or sickness, many of these poor kids died, but one or two would go on and have kids of their own. In better times, maybe three or four would survive, but due to war or terrible working conditions, they would die off in their teens or 20s, leaving very few children behind. Similarly the women, if not dying during childbirth, would die at what we now consider a relatively young age of around 50-60, because they wouldn't be able to support themselves.		Fast forward to the 1940s, and we see countries with safe jobs, strong economies, and low mortality rates thanks to improved medicine and working conditions. Women still have 5 or 6 kids, and most of them survive... all the way through till now. Good for you, gramps - you're one of the Baby Boomers.	And because these old people are staying fitter and healthier for longer, they're staying at work. No more quitting at 50 because of a bad back or arthritis; these guys just neck a few pills, take up some physiotherapy and carry on. This means that the younger kids can't move up the career path; the top jobs are all being held by people in their 60s or even 70s who have decades of experience and who still have all their marbles too. They're making all the money as well, so younger people earn less, and keep earning less well into their 40s.		With all their working years they've bought all the houses and they own all the business and they're not giving up any of it. So it's really hard for the next generation to move up.		The trouble is that this lucky Baby Boomer generation only had one or two kids themselves ("because kids hold you down, man"), so there's a much smaller generation to come next. And when the Baby Boomers get really old, and can't look after themselves, they're going to want pensions and healthcare - the sort of stuff that's paid for by the taxes of the working classes. But the working classes don't have the money to pay their own taxes, AND the pensions of the previous, larger generation, AND the taxes that pay for their own kids' education and healthcare. What it eventually means is that for every person working, they need to earn enough to pay for themselves AND their parents AND their kids; they need three times as much money, which doesn't exist because these old retired baby boomers still own all the houses, companies, stocks and shares, and will until they die.	The longer a Baby Boomer lives as a pensioner, the harder it will be for their kids to make a decent living.		*originally posted by /u/Grrrmachine about 2 years ago but I had emailed it.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"duhblow7","name":"t1_creerrx","parent_id":"t3_36e2k6","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432069094,"created_utc":1432065494}

All the same exact stuff you kids bitch about today.		Really. Seriously. Word for word. If you don't believe me I suggest you go watch a few episodes of Dragnet. There are tons of episodes dealing with the youth and college aged crowd of the late 60s. (The Boomers) Watch when they bitch and moan about the government and weed and everything else. It's laughable how much it sounds word for word like reddit. 		So millennials really have no business hating boomers. They're exactly like them in every way.","depth":0,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DXGypsy","name":"t1_crdrsyo","parent_id":"t3_36e2k6","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432015492,"created_utc":1432011892}

{"body":"Lol, no. What happened is the Boomers grew the fuck up. They learned what the real world is. They learned realism is much different than their idealism. 		And the same thing will happen to your generation as well. Idealism is a young man's game. Hungry bellies fire the rebellious youth but it just makes an old man weak. Sleeping in tents makes the self righteous youth feel like a martyr for the cause, but it just makes the old man's bones hurt. Eventually, common sense and material need overcomes idealism.
