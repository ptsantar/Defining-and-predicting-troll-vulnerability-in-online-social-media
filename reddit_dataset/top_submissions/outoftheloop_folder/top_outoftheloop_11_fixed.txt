{"body":"A man named Freddie Gray was arrested by Baltimore Police, while in custody his spine was found to be broken and he died from complications from his injury. What isn't completely clear yet is when and how did his spine break. While most people are understandably upset by this and decided to take to the streets to protest the police's brutality **peacefully** others have decided its a wonderful opportunity to riot and loot the area around the protests.

{"body":"I think that the governor, having seen what happened in Ferguson, is trying to avoid this from becoming the same. In fact, everyone - including a lot of people on the protesting side - seem to deliberately steering this away from becoming Ferguson.		While the evidence isn't all in yet, I think that it is likely that Gray's death occurred at the hands of our city's police. I suppose it could have been an accident, it wasn't necessarily a race thing, and it may have occurred specifically because of the officers involved (ie if other officers had been in charge, this wouldn't have happened), but I can't come up with any scenario that explains his tragic death that does not involve the police who had him in custody. I'd like to be wrong, and I'm not going to get involved in any protesting, but I think that Gray's death was probably avoidable. Regardless of cause, his death was tragic.","depth":5,"score":64,"ups":64,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rbaltimore","name":"t1_cqqunln","parent_id":"t1_cqqu2qr","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1430182620,"created_utc":1430179020}
{"body":"(Admittedly, I haven't been watching the news as much over the course of *this* police fuck-up, so I might be confusing it with other recent police fuck-ups. With that said...)		I'm optimistic.		I get the impression that the city government is willing to let the cops fall where they may to some degree. Of course, correct me if I'm wrong on that (reiterating the above).		I think Ferguson-- both the audacity of the local officials and the visibility of the rioting-- actually managed to shake things up, effectively, and I think we're starting to see the dividends in more and more cases of, as you put it, "Not wanting this to be another Ferguson".		Yes, there've been more police fuckups like this in the news lately, yes, but on the other hand, there've been more police fuckups like this *in the news* lately, which is dragging the problem into the light where it should be. The visibility of incidents and responses have made it impossible not to investigate, and disgusting numbers and solid sordid information are being brought to light by the sorts of mainstream news outlets that get things talked about.		This, in turn, has put the spotlight on officials and practices, even where something hasn't gone wrong yet. The continuing flow of incidents does show that the problem hasn't gone away yet, but the satisfying smell of soiled trousers is certainly in the air.		What's more, the Ferguson controversy happened when body-camera technology was finally mature, which meant that there was actually a new solution to suggest, a novel wedge to crack the apathy open and break the usual stalemate between angry citizens and the shrugging status quo, and it's heartening to see that both Obama's public statements and (in my wholly-unrelated neck of the woods) local police and activist groups answered the outrage by pushing for these and other concrete solutions, and the media has their eye on police and municipal corruption more and more.","depth":6,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SuperFLEB","name":"t1_cqr2at1","parent_id":"t1_cqqunln","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1430194589,"created_utc":1430190989}

{"body":"Thank you. I live in the suburbs, and because the violence is dispersed, I know where not to go, if I had to go into the city today (I don't).		If this is police brutality, we have to remember that, unlike Star Wars, the law enforcement officers are not all clones of one psychopath. The individual psychology of the police who committed the alleged brutality are the primary factor. Police culture cannot and should not be taken into consideration, but not every cop could have been (allegedly) responsible for this. 		Hopefully the PD will be transparent and we'll find out what actually happened. If we've learned anything from Ferguson, it's that the truth will always come out and trying to cover it up will backfire big time. I don't want to add that nightmare.

{"body":"Good thing you don't have to go into town.		I agree with what you're saying about police brutality. I actually am an administrative assistant for a small police department. It's sad, because a lot of scummy people in our surrounding area do not like us simply because we are the police. Our department is no where near being a horrible place. We're pretty reasonable, and very helpful of victims in crimes, and some times with suspects. We're also very lucky that we are able to have taser, body cameras, and in car video for all of our officers. They go through so much training every few months for taser, and other situations like an unrest. No many other departments are able to have access to the things we do. 		The truth will always come out. No matter what the situation is, the truth will be found out. I believe that it will also come out for this situation. We, as people, need answers, and the citizens of Baltimore County deserve answers, along with Gray's family. While I understand that he has made poor choices, his death should not have been due to anything police related. I, too, have a family member close to my that is heavily involved in drugs, and I could no longer offer her my help. It was too taxing on my emotional state.

{"body":"Yeah, while I suspect that Gray's death is the direct result of police treatment while in custody, I don't know that for sure, and I have had enough positive interactions with the city police (I used to be a social worker there) to know that you can't judge the whole department based on the actions of a few. But, if I'm right, these are some pretty serious actions.		I just hope this resolves quickly.

He was successfully sued for the murder of NBS, but he was never found guilty of murder. Civil judgements have a lower legal burden of proof. In a lawsuit, the defendant essentially has to prove their lack of culpability just as much as a plaintiff as to prove some kind of culpability. It's a 50-50 judgement. If a jusge is 51% sure that the defendant was culpable, then the judge rules in favor of the plaintiff.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CFRProflcopter","name":"t1_cqrcrxf","parent_id":"t1_cqralbz","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1430227142,"created_utc":1430223542}

It's pretty poor, mostly black and has had many problems with racism in the police force leading up to the riots. 		I will say that I was shocked at how out of hand things got. I can maybe see your point there. It makes sense that larger riots would happen in a city with a larger population. But I also think that the smaller population might have been a contributing factor. There's more of a sense of community, and people were more personally connected. That's at least how the protest got so big to begin with. The riots got so out of control, not usually by the Ferguson residents, but from the rest of the "most dangerous city" population who wanted to take advantage of the situation. It was then further fueled by all the attention it was getting, since yeah, you wouldn't normally expect that sort of thing happening in lil ol Ferguson. 	But just because it was unexpected, doesn't mean it makes any less sense. We were definitely overdue for something like this to happen.

As far as knives go, some knives are legal, some are not.  What differentiates the two?  Size and conceal-ability.  Generally a switchblade or a butterfly knife will be illegal - they're highly concealable, and don't tend to serve a true work related purpose.  Length is also an issue.

Black or white, if you are perceived to pose a threat to the system (by being a minority, not being a successful capitalist/professional & therefore "not working hard," etc--simply existing as anything but a straight rich cis white man is a threat to a system that relies on relative homogeneity) you are a target for the police.","depth":5,"score":37,"ups":37,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"news_flesh","name":"t1_cqr45xa","parent_id":"t1_cqqw0o1","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1430198148,"created_utc":1430194548}
{"body":"Going to take your statement a little further, and add that the perception of the straight, rich, cis, white man is only as good as his age allows. 		My point being, even a straight white male born into a upper/middle class home can be targeted at a young age (teen-young twenties) because they aren't yet discernible to police as to whether or not they'll be functioning members of society or not. You see it all the time; wealthy white kids intentionally behaving/wearing boho chic clothing and hipster gear. Urban attire. Police who aren't hip to trends in youth will often mistake white entitlement for ignorance or contempt of the law, and it gets a LOT of college/high school students in trouble with police, but they're targeted with ridiculous charges and legal battles because the police can expect a rebuttal from their families.		Inner-city youth, gang members, poor people, urban blacks; many police officers wouldn't be able to distinguish the difference between these 'descriptions' in people on the streets today. What's to say that an over-zealous police officer won't pull a gun on you while you ride your bike down the street because you 'look suspicious', and you're black? You have a much higher change of being killed if you're NOT white, but statistically speaking, Black american's are targeted more frequently (per capita) and have the highest rate of violent encounters with police officers among any demographic. 		Baltimore PD is half black. So are we to believe that it was only the white officers that killed Freddie Gray? Or, can we assume that the police force as a group, is over zealous in their patrolling the cities in the U.S. with higher minority rates per capita? Or is this just coincidental as police look for crime in areas that are run down, most likely to be minority neighborhoods?

That's the important part and here lies the difficulty - maybe you truly would refer to white people as "ignorant savages" but my (as someone who is not a native speaker) impression of general usage is that "ignorant savages" is generally used to describe black or Arab persons, whereas whites are "ignorant trash" etc.		And in all matters related to communications it doesn't really matter what you want to express but what the other person perceives you as expressing (something reddit at large doesn't seem to understand when it comes to literature, *it doesn't matter* whether the author intended some device or symbolism). 	       	So if most people reserve the term "savages" for people of color (my impression based on internet usage), drawing on racist stereotypes, and you use the same term to describe black persons, then it doesn't matter what your intended message may have been - because your actual message is racist.

What we disagree about (*probably*) is my stance that words are shaped through usage, through history, and take on more subtext through social backdrops. Because of this, usage of particular words in certain scenarios is very problematic due to how the word has evolved. Which means, you're right in a way, when you speak of connotations. But I'm not talking about a different meaning, I'm talking about a more embedded meaning. For example, you can have two paintings with all the same lines and colors, but the second one may have more deeper hues. Or another example, a higher resolution photo. The photo's still the same but some details are clearer. The word savage because of how it has been used has a deeper ingrained subtext simmering underneath the surface in our society whether you personally intend it to or not, whether you personally think it or not, in particular situations. But regardless, language and communication is not only governed by definitions, and there's a balance of many different aspects. Like I wrote before, in this particular instance, your intent really pales in comparison to everything else and the balance isn't tipped on your end. And sure you can say the word "savage" and you can then clarify what you mean, but, I definitely would disagree with you if you say you are more correct if and when miscommunication and misunderstanding occurs.

It involves an emotional catharsis, but it must be followed by a sense of futility. --MLK		The point, that many seem to be missing, is that riots aren't intended, nor are they planned.  They happen for a reason. Riots are the natural consequence of hopelessness. 		The message is this: there is a large group of people out there who feel that they have nothing left to lose.

Actually, this latest attack against Freddie Gray is just the latest fucking incident in police brutality against black men. It is rooted in years and years of systematic disenfranchisement of black communities and the systematic disenfranchisement of low-income communities. This is due to the law enforcement's perception that black men are inherently dangerous and therefore must be 'put down' as swiftly as possible. It is a continuation of the Jim Crow era, except now people are somewhat refusing to be complicit in the actions of those police officers who are meant to protect us.	This sequence of events led to rioting and looting, which in turn led to the horrific and unnecessary deaths and injuries of several police officers - that would be absolutely correct. But to think it is the effort of "those poor, black heathens who think life is unfair" is to ignore the fact that their government overlooks them.
