Just so happens, Jenny and Carly have a girls' weekend planned for the upcoming weekend. OP acts like he sees no evil, but lawyers the fuck up. Lawyer says he's in the clear, since him and Jenny have a prenup with a cheating clause in it. But he needs evidence to back it up in court. OP then hires a couple of PIs to tail the girls for the weekend 'round the clock. The PI supposedly has cameras that record to a live stream so OP can TiVO that shit. Most of the posts are live updates from OP.		*Act I* (post 1)		The girls don't go where they said they'd go, but instead go to some shopping mall. Jenny drops Carly off at a Starbucks before randomly driving around the neighbourhood only to go back to the mall. Some unknown guy goes into Starbucks and talks to Carly (OP calls him X). X leaves, Carly goes into the car, and the girls go to some hotel.		After grabbing food at the hotel, Jenny shows Carly where Zack's house is (for safety). Carly then gets dropped back off at the hotel and Jenny goes back to Zack's house. In the meantime, *for some reason*, Carly texts OP's brother and rats out Jenny. OP's brother texts OP, but since OP is already running Operation Delete Facebook, he tells both of them to keep mum. A couple hours later, Zack and Jenny go back to the mall and pick up X. The 3 of them go to the hotel Carly's at and all 4 stay the night there. At this point, it's Jenny's turn to rat out Carly, who texts OP about it for an equally unknown reason.		Next morning, OP calls his brother over, briefs him on the whole thing. The Sticks brothers mentally face divorce together. The PI then updates that the girls and their dicks have breakfast at the hotel, all but X looking very hungover. They go back up to the room for a couple hours (probably for Round 2), and then the weekend dicks get dropped off at their houses. The PI snaps some pictures of Jenny and Zack making out for ~~his fap folder~~ OP's case. The girls then go back to the Starbucks alone and try to get their stories straight (revealed in the 3rd post).		*Act II* (posts 2 and 3)		Jenny and Carly get their shit from the hotel and head back home. In the meantime, the brother is helping set up a couple of cameras around the house for when they come back. They get their cover stories straight, get prepared to confront the girls, etc. The girls come home, and the OP ceases updates while they question them and cry and argue, and generally have some good old-fashioned married fun.		After lots of drama and lies (80% of the 3rd post, go there for details), the girls finally spit up the truth. Carly claims to have gotten cold feet and refused to do anything with X, while Jenny admits to fucking Zack multiple times. They basically confirm everything that the PIs saw. The brother looks like he *might* believe Carly, but OP and Jenny are obviously done. The brothers say nothing about the investigation or the cameras, etc., and they go off to watch football at a friend's house. While he's away, Jenny gets desperate and tries to seduce OP and tell him she misses him, etc. He just updates reddit.		*Act III* (post 3)		OP goes home in time for dinner. Jenny pulls out all the stops; prepared his favourite meal, wore his favourite outfit of her, etc. Our well-endowed hero eats dinner with his not-so-fair maiden in silence, and rejects her advances the whole night. More tears are shed, and Jenny ends up breaking her phone in anger and frustration (details in post).		In the morning, OP hits the gym and sees his lawyer, but despite all advice to the contrary, leaves his Facebook alone. They review OP's prenup and determine the cheating clause is still valid. The lawyer then tells him to keep the whole PI investigation to himself, and both go home for the rest of MLK day. Once he gets back, OP checks in with the brother, who says everything has gone more or less back to normal on his end. It looks like OP is the only one going through with a divorce, and plans to resume the process with his lawyer tomorrow. In the meantime, Jenny desperately wants a movie date.		*Act IV* (post 3 pls stop)		They go see American Sniper. Jenny tries to get it on in the theatre, OP keeps turning her down, and says they're getting a divorce. She then Comes Clean: Episode 2, and admits that she had sex with X as well, and that every M/F combination you can think of (including Carly) happened in that hotel room. Pissed off, OP calls his brother and they both go over to his house. Carly tries to throw Jenny under the bus again and says she was pressured into doing everything. Jenny then bitch-slaps her for it, and everybody's getting a divorce.		The next morning, OP wakes up and has breakfast with his cheating wife, who has given up on seducing him. Carly suddenly shows up with a police officer, citing a restraining order on all 3 of the others, as well as a ban on ever contacting her again unless related to the divorce. Claims depression, blames them all. She then chews her fingernails and leaves.		---	Will we get live updates from the courtroom? Who is the mysterious X?

OP talks about first reading the text on iMessage: I decided to open up the phone and reply something stupid and funny in order to embarrass Jenny. **So I opened up the iMessage app** **Shows that it must be an iphone** and went to read their previous conversation to see what was happening, so I could tell a relevant joke. 2nd to the top of the list of conversations was a chat with a guy/girl named Zack. I didn???t know who Zack was, but the most recent thing he sent her was ???<3 gn???. I was curious, so I put off replying to my brother and opened up Jenny and Zack???s chat.		OP says she threw her phone: I go through my routine and go to bed, where she is waiting for me with one last attempt to have sex. I finally told her "this isn't happening, and you know it.

As for marriage, the current marriage/divorce laws are SO one sided (woman gets alimony, custody and child support almost exclusively) that they make marriage an almost self-destructive act.

I didn???t know who Zack was, but the most recent thing he sent her was ???<3 gn???. I was curious, so I put off replying to my brother and opened up Jenny and Zack???s chat.		OP says she threw her phone: I go through my routine and go to bed, where she is waiting for me with one last attempt to have sex. I finally told her "this isn't happening, and you know it.

{"body":"Here is the abridged version of events:		OP in the post starts out with the perfect life - big dick, well paid job, sex 4-5 times a week during which his beautiful wife (Jenny) has multiple orgasms. Despite this, he finds out that his wife wants to be pounded into submission by some guy called Zack. Zack totes has a small dick, by the way. Like way smaller than OP's.		Anyway OP's brother is married to Carly. Jenny and Carly were going away for the weekend however Carly dropped her phone in the toilet and was using her husband's. Oh but it's okay, because her expensive warranty magics a replacement phone out of thin air to allow her to suddenly start texting people over the weekend.		Jenny and Carly go on their trip - originally it was a 2 hour drive but conveniently OP needs to create a sense of urgency and it becomes a one hour drive - and convoluted shit happens as a PI hired by OP tails them. It looks like Carly is meeting up with a guy too.		During this time, Carly texts her husband to say Jenny is cheating. Since he's OP's brother, he of course tells OP **totally creating drama because OP doesn't want them to blow things up before he has actual evidence and it's super intense**. Jenny texts OP that Carly is cheating. What a couple of cunts, amirite?		After above mentioned pounding, the girls head home. *It's an intense race against time as they rush to set up recording equipment for more evidence* or some shit.		Not that it matters, because Jenny walks in and breaks down, admitting that she kissed the guy because he was blackmailing her. Then it turns out she **touched his penis and played with it a little**. Oh and they had sex too. Jenny is mentally retarded and believes that after revealing this to her husband, he'll want a share of the cream pie Zack gave her.		(This is totally how grown ups talk and act, you guys).		Carly chickened out and didn't fuck her guy, they just held hands, because a man who was meeting a chick for the express purpose of a hook up would be totally okay with that and stick around just holding hands instead. Carly and OP's brother go and scream at each other for about 5 minutes and then go home apparently totally okay with each other now. I guess *planning* to fuck someone else is okay as long as you don't go through with it, right?		Anyway, OP went to his buddy's house and Jenny is home alone. $50 says the next update says Zack came over as soon as OP left.		**Edit 1** Oh hai ~~Mark~~ you guys, I have an update. So for some reason rather than kicking Jenny out or staying at my buddies and avoiding her until I talk to my lawyer, I went home to find out what my **sexy** surprise was. Turns out it was just my fave things - meatballs and spaghetti with ice cream for dessert.		Jenny asked me if I was still mad because she has three brain cells - like all women, amirite fellas? I got all alpha as fuck and went upstairs. She hung around wanting sex but I told her to call her little (**and I do mean little, nudge nudge**) fuck buddy Zack on speed dial. She got mad an **smashed** her phone on the floor, except it wasn't all that dramatic because our floor is carpeted though. It did impact hard enough for the sim card and battery to come out though, which was weird because she has an iPhone. Whatever.		Despite how much I now hate this woman, we fell asleep in the same bed, but *we didn't have sex guys, really you have to believe me*. I hit the gym because I **am so fucking alpha**. Then I saw the lawyer who told me to not tell Jenny anything, but apparently it's *totes* okay to post this shit all over the interwebz because here I am not deleting fucking everything. Sure hope that doesn't come back to bite me in the ass!		As for my brother, he texted me saying things were back to normal. Instead of sticking by me to go through divorce together like the way it should be (**BROS B4 HOES 4EVA**), he's actually working his problems out like an adult and not the way he's being told to by the Internet.
