{"body":"Short answer: [this](https://i.imgur.com/bnWmD60.png)		Long answer: What you see up there is the Gnome Child from oldschool Runescape (I won't go inot why there's a 7 year old version of Runescape running in parallel to the new version, just accept that it's an old-ass game). Basically he's an NPC who resides in a little corner of the world who, for some reason, instead of the usual filler NPC dialogue that MMORPG characters have, the Gnome Child will instead recite philosophical ideas and questions to the player. Telling you to remember to enjoy the journey as well as the reward and saying that true kindness if doing something good for someone who doesn't even know you've done anything (also he hints to some pretty major stuff in the Runescape world that no other NPC's really know about)		Naturally this lead to him becoming an internet meme. Praised as some form of Gnome Child prophet and he became the posterchild of Runescape Memes (think the video game equivalent of Jaden Smith's tweets). It's all hyperbolic but his fame in the Oldschool Runescape community reached such a point where the developers acknowlage and toy with the meme in-game. Treating his bargin-bin philosophy as a running joke that ran all the way too the image linked above. Pretty much turning him into a proto-advice animal. And that particular image is one of the bigger known Gnome-child memes. Since it's about Dank, and Dank is a word adopted into weed culture, and today is 4/20... the rest writes itself. 		EDIT: More from /u/suddenly_summoned		>You're forgetting the part where the "born too late to explore the earth, born too soon to explore the galaxy" part of the meme started, which seems to be from a version of this [sad Pepe the Frog](http://i.imgur.com/vFox7.jpg) 4chan macro.","depth":0,"score":1438,"ups":1438,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ellie_X","name":"t1_cqijfky","parent_id":"t3_338mlz","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1429546312,"created_utc":1429542712}

{"body":"RS3 stands for RuneScape 3, the version of the game introduced in July 2013. People generally dislike it for a few reasons. One reason is the changes to RS3 from RS2, which have altered the feel of the game.		The changes include updates to the combat system, from a very static format where in melee combat the only influence a player had was to heal themselves (via eating) and occasionally turn on/off passive healing abilities (Prayers), into a more dynamic system, with abilities on short cooldowns, somewhat reminiscent of World of Warcraft.		Another of the reasons is the increased emphasis on microtransactions in the game. Originally the only way to spend money on the game was to pay for membership ($7.95/month) or but merchandise from their online store (t-shirts, mugs etc.). 		Now, however, players can buy ingame things, most egregiously ~~items from "Solomon's General Store", which sells various items, mostly of cosmetic nature.~~ keys for the Treasure Hunter minigame. Priced at $5 for 15 keys, they allow you a chance to win various rewards, not only cosmetic but also equipment to speed skill levelling (the main goal of the game), and to win large amounts of money (200,000,000 coins being the top prize).		~~The dislike of this store is largely because of the NPC, Solomon himself, who is placed in many prominent locations throughout the world, especially in teleport hubs where the players pass through, as well as near the 'Grand Exchange', the main hub of the player-based economy.~~		This about sums up everything I know.

{"body":"What you got there is an RS3 players version of why people hate RS3.			Jagex, who owns Runescape spend most of their profits, which are derived from increased membership fees & oversaturated MTX, on funding failed projects such as funorb, stellar dawn, block n load, transformers and chronicles, which is why their total profits at the end of last year were 1/10 of what they should have been. 		Less than 2 months ago they had to raise the price of membership again because they've fucked up so much. The "main game/live game" as RS3 players like to call it (even though OSRS has more players and receives updates every week) has 100+ developers and has been declining since early 2011. OSRS has 400K active members, with more new members joining everyday than RS3, yet only has 2 developers. 			Most OSRS players quit RS3 because they hate what it turned into. Nowadays, RS3 has MTX that give bonus xp, buyable xp, double xp, d&d tokens, treasure hunter which is an ingame casino where you pay real money to open chest to receive pixel prize and solomans general store that gives disney cosmetics such as [shark costumes](http://i.imgur.com/Ckqbc8z.png) and [wings](http://i.imgur.com/zJWXqXG.jpg). Lets not forget this games foundation is based on a medieval realm. There are so many over the top cosmetics and credit card advantages currently ingame now that they can't go back. 		Everyday on /r/runescape, [the community complains about MTX](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/search?q=mtx&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) but the game makers receive way too much money every day off disneyscapers. I'm not even going to mention EoC, the broken combat system that they rushed to introduce in 2012 which caused over 50% of the entire playerbase to quit the game.

Additionally, the NPC was put in a lot of locations for *one day* to advertise a large sale Jagex was running. I can't believe people still think he's all over.

No, we don't hate the goblin, we hate the game-breaking minigame!!  		Bonds are in theory a bit dreadful, BUT lots of people use them to get free membership via ingame cash - you can buy the Bond off a player (or GE) for, say, 2m (I've not checked for a while) and redeeming it gives you half a months' members.

Old School Players talk a *lot* about the Microtransactions in the game, which are actually pretty tame 90% of the time. That 10% off-chance is when they introduce something stupidly OP, but generally they're good at dealing with it. The Cosmetics are completely harmless, and simply allow players to customize their look in a *fantasy* game.		The biggest point of contention is the Evolution of Combat. It's a different combat system than the old, more afk, system that has various abilities you can cast on a customizable hotbar. The system also introduced weapon and armor tiers, which normalized the gear system. A lot of old school players especially like to hate on this, but it really did a good job of opening the playing field, so you could use a weapon other than a Scimitar to melee. It also balanced Magic and Ranged so melee was no longer the "end all" combat style, and the other two were worth using, sometimes more than Melee. A lot of Old School players also neglect to mention the introduction of a "Legacy Mode" which allows players to use something similar to the old combat system, as well as the "Revolution" mode, which autocasts the Basic abilities on your hotbar for you, saving you button presses.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Maridiem","name":"t1_cqj1v71","parent_id":"t1_cqitwy7","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1429576180,"created_utc":1429572580}
