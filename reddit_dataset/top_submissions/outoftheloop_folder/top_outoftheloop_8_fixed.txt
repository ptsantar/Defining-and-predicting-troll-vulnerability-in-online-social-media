{"body":"Obviously, that was always the case. The pixels were always light blue and gold. That's not the point.		White balance is a maleable thing to your brain. If you look at a sheet of paper in the shade on a sunny day, what color is it? It will look white. But if you measure the light's color with a machine it will say that it's light blue. So why do you say it's white? It's because your brain knows that the only light source in the shade is the blue sky, so it adjusts for that and makes you perceive white.		If you take the piece of paper into an office, under flourescent light, it will still look white, but now it will likely be green or possibly pink depending on the lights. But it doens't matter. The *paper* is white. It will reflect whatever color light hits it.		When people say that the dress is "white", they are saying that they think it is a white dress in a blue shadow, just like being in the shade on a sunny day. Youur brain's ability to adjust the white balance of a scene is so persistent that these people will actualy perceive the dress as white. They won't even notice that it's actually blueish because their brain has already assumed it's from blueish light and it removed the color cast. They *literally* see white. 		If you isolate the color of an individual pixel (or an average in a small area) and blow it up to a large swatch like you did, then it becomes obvious that it's blue. That knowledge still doesn't prevent your brain from correcting for the color cast and making you perceive white.		On the other hand, if your brain instead interpreted the scene (correctly) that it's a blue dress with black trim that has been severely overexposed, then you see it as a blue and black dress. Nothing is truly black, and if you overexpose it a ton with yellow light, it can look gold. The overexposure and yellow white balance also makes the blue look more gray. It's truly a bright, deep blue, but the yellowish lighting combined with a severe overexposure makes it look light blue.		This photo just happens to be halfway between both interpretations. It could be white under a blue light, or bright blue under a yellow light and overexposed by a lot. Obviously, the pixels themselves have a fixed color, but that's not the point. The reality of the scene and what lighting is causing it to look like those pixel colors is what everyone is arguing about.","depth":7,"score":106,"ups":106,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LunarUmbra","name":"t1_coz8umd","parent_id":"t1_coz3nx3","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1425067462,"created_utc":1425067462}

{"body":">no, that's not what the white gold people are saying, it certainly wasn't what i was saying. i saw the paler blue and interpreted it as white in shadow.

The blue/black side *see* a DARK blue and interpret that to be dark blue with a yellow tint.		The difference is that blue/black is seeing something fundamentally different, due to color illusions. Even white/gold people say it's blue/black once it switches for them. It's not just pointing at the same colors and calling it two different things.

No, they *see* a darker blue, and then interpret that to be the color of the dress, rather than a shadow. The color is fundametally different. Just like the dancer illusion. It's not spinning in any way in particular, but your brain makes you see it spinning one way or the other, rather than seeing it as it is. Same goes for the color.

{"body":"The blue black people see it as a dark blue because they're interpreting it that way from the brown and light blue, same as what we are doing.  I dug into this more with people I know - show them the pixel extractions, and they're like, 'yeah, ok, fine, the pixels are actually lighter, but is obviously a dark blue because of the crappy photo quality and the lighting'.  That's the same process that we are doing with our gut reaction to it being white/gold.  I'm convinced that everyone is actually seeing the pixels the way they are, when you dig deep.  Our interpretations are where we differ, and some people are having a hard time realizing that it is an interpretation.   One group is interpreting the lighting in the photo to be indicative of shadow on white, while another group is deciding that the photo must be overexposed, and that the fabric is actually a dark blue.  I think this just isn't getting articulated on the part of the blue/black group.  Both interpretations make sense, as you can see in the article I linked.		Seriously, look at the article.  The fact that you posted the blue colour, to show me how light it is (I disagree - it's a medium blue in my books) makes me think you haven't looked at my article.  The colours are laid out in there nicely as well.  		Edit: let me be very clear.  I've asked the blue/blackers I know if they see those colour extracts as dark blue.  They say no.  Then they realize that what they claimed they were seeing was actually their interpretation of it.  This was the same thing I did for the white/gold, until I took a second and analyzed the fact that the colour on screen is actually a lighter blue, and that what I thought I was seeing, was actually an interpretation from the true light blue colour.  I truly believe this is what blue/black people are doing as well, since that's been the case with the people I've talked to.

There are some copypastas floating around that try to explain why people see the different color schemes ??? one saying that if you experienced trauma in the past year you see black/blue, and another saying if you have good eyesight you see black/blue. The explanation about recent trauma changing the hue in what you see is a complete fabrication with no basis in science, and the other which means to explain that seeing one color scheme over the other means you have better or worse eyesight is more hogwash. Your eyes don't change on a structural level from "good" to "bad" within the span of minutes, even less multiple times a day.

No black, and the brown is pretty light. And the blue is very pale as well. Very different from the dark blue/black that people see (and I also saw at one point). The sampled colors is what the white/gold people see. Black/blue people see very different colors (much closer to the alternate photos).		> I have honestly tried to trick my brain to see white and gold, but it is far too dark blue, and black for me to even imagine.

The same thing goes for yellow/orange, but you get that base from being outside or being around old school light bulbs.		 This is easily seen if you are using a camera.

I can see the white and gold -- and it makes sense -- when thinking that the dress is lit partly by daylight (bluish light) but also shadowed. It's hard to explain -- honestly I think the best parallels would be to look at some classic oil painted portraits -- you'll see that when white or gold or any light color is shadowed it isn't simply shadowed with gray, but often with darker undertones that feature color somewhat heavily, like blues, warm grays, browns, etc. So the white and gold dress is being shadowed, and those shadows are coming across as cool blues and warm grays -- the exact same colors that the dress actually is.","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KevinMcCallister","name":"t1_coz6mez","parent_id":"t1_coz5mih","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1425063756,"created_utc":1425063756}
{"body":"I think I will have a hard time making it gold and white, as even though it's a bad picture, and even though I know the dress is in shadow, I can't seem to fool myself into thinking it's in enough shadow to cause that dark a blue (from white).  :-(To your point regarding colors in shade, they only change colors because they pick up the reflected colors around them.  Without a nearby blue color (wall, etc) to reflect, white will not just change to blue merely because it's in shade.  To get such a deep blue consistently over the whole dress, that would be a very blue wall behind the camera holder.  If it was a red wall, the reflection would be reddish.  There's a picture of MLK (can't find it right now) where his face is super red reflecting (if I recall) the robes of a Cardinal standing next to MLK.  I believe that photo has a similar effect to this one depending on whether the image is cropped and you can see the adjacent source if the red reflections.Worth adding here this little link about white balance in photography.  http://digital-photography-school.com/why-is-the-snow-in-my-pictures-so-blue/  But then everything in the photo would be tinged blue, right?Anyhow, I think I can suspend my disbelief and assume there's something blue being reflected, but then...1.  The remaining context would also have blue reflections. The black and white cowprint jacket behind the dress would also be in shade, and therefore also some shade of blue.  It is not.  It is white.  And, nothing else in the photo is taking on any blue reflections except for the dress. So the dress itself must be blue.  This, I think is the hardest thing for me to overcome.2. Second, the color of the dress at the very edge of its profile, at the arm where the sunlight is brightly spilling over it, the dress color fades from bright white at the sunlight to a very very light blue to a light blue to eventually the dark blue. And similarly, when I look at the gradation of light along the hip area of the dress. To me, the shading variations in these locations make sense for a blue dress in backlight, and not a white dress in full shade with blue reflections.  I'm not sure how much this second point affects the way I'm seeing it, since I think the context is my bigger issue.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RDCAIA","name":"t1_coz8rh9","parent_id":"t1_coz6mez","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1425067316,"created_utc":1425067316}

So while I see the fabric as white, someone else may see it as blue because my cones aren???t responding to the dim lighting. My rods see it as a shade (white). There???s three cones, small, medium and large. They are blue sensitive, green sensitive, and red sensitive. As for the black bit (which I see as gold), it???s called additive mixing. Blue, green and red are the main colors for additive mixing. This is where it gets really tricky. Subtractive mixing, such as with paint, means the more colors you add the murkier it gets until it???s black. ADDITIVE mixing, when you add the three colors eyes see best, red, green and blue, (not to be confused with primary colors red, blue and yellow) it makes pure white. ???Blue and Black: In conclusion, your retina???s cones are more high functioning, and this results in your eyes doing subtractive mixing. ???White and Gold: our eyes don???t work well in dim light so our retinas rods see white, and this makes them less light sensitive, causing additive mixing, (that of green and red), to make gold. **** UPDATE to prove this theory I turned my phone brightness from the lowest to highest and saw it switching from white and gold (at the lowest) to light blue and darker gold (at the highest) meaning people that see blue and black are more sensitive to light (better eyesight and not looking at the sun like your moms told you)		~~TLDR: If you see white/gold, your retinas aren't as good as the people who see blue/black.~~ *Guys, the explanation is incorrect!*		It may also have something to do with the brightness.

{"body":"Actually this is very related to how the dress illusion works, except it's more like the lighting being ambiguous so our brain has to decide whether it's one lighting condition or the other. The grey pixels in that image would be equivalent to the actual light blue and brown black pixels in your image, the difference is that some people see it as "being in the shadow" in the context of your image while others see it as being in the light. I think I explained it better with another comment:  		>But it's the same color, and that's exactly the point. The pixel values in the original image are the same light blue/purple and brown/slight gold. The difference is that the lighting condition is supposedly ambiguous, so that your brain might see it as a white dress in a blue shadow under blue light, or a blue dress under warm yellow light. It's just like how lighted/shadow rubix cube illusion expect the picutre is lighted at the edge of the cube between shadow and light, but our brain randomly decides to fall down either lighting conditions since ambiguous lighting conditions don't exist in real life.

However There are several things that will be throwing off the Untrained eye. 		1: The White Balance on this Photo is off, Everything is Far To Warm and has a Yellow Cast to it.	2: The Material this Dress is made from, is Reflective. therefor the Black is Reflecting A lot of the lighting back and because of the Color cast of the white balance being off its reflecting Yellow back causing it to look a bit Gold. 		Now here is the part that I cant fully explain... When I showed this picture to my wife she said it was black and Blue, however when I pull the colors with the Eye dropper in Photoshop and show them to her again she is seeing Gold and White. 	Now Granted there is a very yellow and washed out Black due to the poor picture same with the blue its very washed out and bright. So my only conclusion is this.... Its a Color Optical Illusion.

So now I have 3 photos, two edits and the original.  Move these over to photoshop: The dress is two different colors.  Select a section of the first color and then go filter-blur-average.  This helps to eliminate pixel to pixel noise variation.  Repeat this for the second color.  Do this for all 3 images.  		[This Image](http://i.imgur.com/YijfcSh.jpg) shows the result.  	Exposure edit on the left; original in the center, and white balance correction on the right.  There's a swatch for each color beneath them with their associated RGB codes.

{"body":"This is what everyone's overlooking and the greatest mindfuck that's actually happening is people saying "blue/black" or "white/gold" instead of actually breaking down the color spaces and trying to describe those. 		When my roommate showed me I immediately said "white/gold" because that's what my brain *assumes* the dress *should be*, which also serves to skew the colors towards the white/gold side, and is not an accurate description of what specific colors I'm actually seeing in the image.  		When he explained the controversy over it I just laughed and was like, yeah, I can see how people are calling the dress blue - the "white" *really is* a light blue/grey (when you actually compare it to pure white) and the "gold" is far from an actual true gold (it's more of a muddy yellow/brown) - but my initial response is to simplify that to white/gold. 		That's where the confusion is coming from. Everyone is using the far end of whichever side of the spectrum they "correct" the colors to in order to describe the color they see, when in reality the actual colors are *far* from an actual blue (think a nice vibrant blue) and black (deep dark black) or pure white (fresh snow) and gold (a gold ingot) which is what everyone thinks the other side means when they say those colors.

{"body":""Your eyes have retinas, the things that let you interpret color. There???s rods, round things, and cones that stick out, which is what gives your eye a textured appearance in the colored part. The ???cones??? see color. The ???rods??? see shade, like black, white and grey. Cones only work when enough light passes through. So while I see the fabric as white, someone else may see it as blue because my cones aren???t responding to the dim lighting. My rods see it as a shade (white). There???s three cones, small, medium and large. They are blue sensitive, green sensitive, and red sensitive.  As for the black bit (which I see as gold), it???s called additive mixing. Blue, green and red are the main colors for additive mixing. This is where it gets really tricky. Subtractive mixing, such as with paint, means the more colors you add the murkier it gets until it???s black. ADDITIVE mixing, when you add the three colors eyes see best, red, green and blue, (not to be confused with primary colors red, blue and yellow) it makes pure white.	???Blue and Black: In conclusion, your retina???s cones are more high functioning, and this results in your eyes doing subtractive mixing.	???White and Gold: our eyes don???t work well in dim light so our retinas rods see white, and this makes them less light sensitive, causing additive mixing, (that of green and red), to make gold.	**** UPDATE to prove this theory I turned my phone brightness from the lowest to highest and saw it switching from white and gold (at the lowest) to light blue and darker gold (at the highest) meaning people that see blue and black are more sensitive to light (better eyesight and not looking at the sun like your moms told you)"		Not sure who originally wrote that","depth":0,"score":54,"ups":54,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kenshh","name":"t1_coyffzf","parent_id":"t3_2xanry","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1424997856,"created_utc":1424997856}

We figured our dominant eyes with the the simple eye dominance test: Align your thumb with a distant point with both eye open, the eye that doesn't change alignment when the other eye is closed is the dominant eye.		So we tested the dress and then determined dominant eye with our friends and family, and almost to the person, we found that right-eye-dominant people saw gold/while, while left-eye-dominant people saw black/blue.

So my question to people seeing black and blue - is that some interpretation your eye is making based on an idea of the flash?  Like it's flashed out somehow?		Can't figure any other interpretation for this - the black simply isn't there in the image itself according to Photoshop - a fairly reliable source.
