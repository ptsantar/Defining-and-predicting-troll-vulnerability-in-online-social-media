{"body":"If one person goes there and comments in an abrasive or toxic way, or does something to discourage good discussion, like downvote/upvote inappropriately, it's not a big deal, and to some extent, it can even be expected when they come to the discussion organically, such as being subscribed to that subreddit.		The problem is that you take a community that is more or less about bitching about things other people do, say or, simply are, and then you have them linking into other areas of reddit to provide the focus of their circlejerks. If the topic is a popular enough thing to hate, that's a lot of people being given a direct link to other areas of conversation. A lot more than would ever happen "organically".		Requiring np links basically absolves a subreddit of any responsibility of what you do with that link, since the link you were given was one that would prevent you from participating if you don't modify it. 		If you choose to change the url so you can post and vote, then that is your action alone, as long as the subreddit's moderating team, rules, and enforcement actively discouraged you from doing so.		It could still be argued that giving a direct link of any kind is still giving people the tools to harass others, especially in subreddits that are about being hateful, toxic and negative towards others. At least with np links, there is a small step that puts the intent on the individual.		It's a tough line to walk, between individual freedoms and protecting the community at large. It would be one thing if people participating in hateful, toxic subreddits were good about policing each other and preventing harassment of others while they circlejerk, but if the sentiment is generally "people who are like this are subhuman" they probably don't really have a reason to prevent each other from harassing those people.","depth":7,"score":98,"ups":98,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"theywouldnotstand","name":"t1_cs2o779","parent_id":"t1_cs2i7yp","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433999588,"created_utc":1433995988}

{"body":"I'm sorry; I'll try to reduce the amount of condescension in my tone. It is something I struggle with, and thank you for calling me out on it. 		I interpreted your reply to my original comment as denying the fact that I stated -- the idea that locks on front doors serve to dissuade normal people, not professional thieves. That is the claim therefore for which I provided a citation. 		I now believe, based on your clarification, that you had intended to dispute the anecdote's relevance to brigading and the np construct. I feel that you could have been more clear in the beginning, but the fault is partially mine for not seeking to clarify. 		That said: you cite common sense as the source for your comment, but studies have shown that common sense is actually rather a poor predictor of human behavior. Putting up small roadblocks can and does serve to change human behavior in surprising ways.		I am reminded of an effort in (and I may be misremembering the details, I apologize) an African country to protect the locals from HIV. The hospital offered screening for the virus as part of the normal check-up, but the patients had to opt in. Very few did. 		However, when the process changed to requiring the patients to opt out if they *didn't* want the screening, they were able to increase the number of screenings to more than 90% of patients. In this case, putting up a small roadblock (having to check a box) caused the behavior of a large number of people to shift. 		Would this be sufficient to dissuade someone who was truly determined not to be screened? No; neither does "np" stop those who are truly determined to downvote a post. But I would argue (and am arguing) that most people are not truly determined.

So it looks like that's the kind of 4chan assholery that reddit has decided it doesn't want to be known for. Since many of the pictures in question belong to people who posted them in other places and had them reposted, they're even subject to DCMA, so reddit has a legal liability and needs to intervene when mods refuse to honor take down requests. Just because someone put it on the internet doesn't make it public domain. They still have photo rights. And who's going to make a freakin' federal case out of it?

I'm not so infantile to take offense to homophones, especially when they're in different languages.		I'm not against social justice. It's just that all this care that is taken to avoid offending minorities (sexual, ethnic, etc.) is infantilizing and makes them seem weak. That things like "microaggressions" are assumed to be things that minorities need protection from is more offensive than the "casual/subtle racism" behind the microaggression itself.		Regarding feminism: I won't say that I'm a feminist despite the fact that I tend to side with feminists on issues of gender equality. The same applies to the Men's Rights Movement or even conservative and liberal politics.

It has encouraged creativity, intelligence, community participation, and discouraged censorship in any form.		Now, every other person is participating in this silly "Victim" Culture, and finding new ways to be offended and wallow in self pity. And I sure as hell don't appreciate that they want to selectively censor things. 		If a topic is uncomfortable it, still needs to be discussed, because despite the discomfort, there are good things everyone can take away from such a discussion, rather than freaking out and declaring that someone's statements triggered you and now you're a victim, which effectively 1) teaches you nothing and 2) ruins any chance of a reasonable discussion. 3) wildly disproportionates your reaction towards anything offensive. 		It's as if there's an expectation with this new generation that is starting to find its way online, that the world is designed to coddle them. That's really the basis of all these SJW's on Tumblr, and the SJW culture that is spreading everywhere. 		"victim culture" is absolutely poisonous.

I'm completely aware that this is the "deeper issue", but I fail to see why that's a problem. Let's be totally honest, FPH was not *just* "not up to SJW PC standards". You do not have to be a SJW to think that FPH was an absolutely pathetic and disgusting sub, you've simply got to be a sane human being. Censorship is a very serious issue, but people acting as if they're being persecuted by FPH et al being banned are just trivialising the entire thing. Government censorship and civil liberties being degraded through law are serious things. Reddit banning a distasteful (to say the least) community is not. Reddit management wants nothing to do with subs like FPH. They don't want anything to do with it because it hurts their brand. I don't want anything to do with it because I don't want to see bullying on the front page of reddit. The result is the same and I'm happy with it.

{"body":"> They've gotta feel comfortable, so you back off and just hang out for a bit. She gets comfortable and sexy times are had. 		YES!!! See, this is truly the best case scenario, and this is what I wish TRP was teaching. It's perfectly human for a girl to be nervous about having sex. However, the key here is that the guy (you in this case!) *backed off* and let her take things at her own pace. Afterwards, she became relaxed and gave her consent. That's how it's supposed to happen! My problem with TRP is that *from what I've seen PERSONALLY while lurking,* they endorse never, ever backing down, even if she's afraid. They tell you to push through her fear and that's wrong on so many levels. What TRP needs to endorse instilling confidence in a girl and making her want to be with you. If they were all about making yourself more attractive to women such that she truly wants you (instead of being harassed, pushed around, frightened and pressured into dropping her pants), I'd support them for sure. Women aren't teenagers or imbeciles who need to be molded by a man. Women *and* men are all humans who need to be molded by themselves.","depth":7,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TwentyfootAngels","name":"t1_cs2lixn","parent_id":"t1_cs2ku5o","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433994884,"created_utc":1433991284}

People sincerely and seriously suggest things like: "I eat 500 calories a day, exercise for hours, but gain weight!" or "my thyroid caused me to gain 100 pounds," "This plate of ranch-dressing-covered lettuce is healthy and only 200 calories because MFP said so!" which is absolute nonsense and only keeping them fat.

We are literally a bunch of formerly-fat men and women (though mostly women) who lost the weight and don't like other fat people saying "it can't be done."

And eating less than your TDEE is the only way to lose weight (well there's always amputation... or a really big dump, but we're talking long term fat loss).		The human body conserves energy and mass (by which I mean it isn't creating energy and matter from nothingness - it comes from the food you eat).  Every day just being alive burns X calories (your BMR), and every activity you do beyond being comatose burns even more calories (your TDEE).  		Any food you eat in excess of your TDEE is going to have one of two things happen to it: It's going to get stored for later use, or it's going to get excreted as waste.

{"body":"The weight-loss industry is definitely larger than the Healthy-At-Any-Size industry, but they cannot be judged by the same standard.  		The most important distinction is that obesity is bad for you.  There are rare situations where being overweight is beneficial (which IIRC mostly relate to starvation), but typically an individual having an ideal fat percentage is healthier than having too much fat.  With something like 2/3 of Americans being overweight/obese, the weight-loss industry is booming, and the HAES market is developing.  			  The weight-loss industry is so vast, and it's clientele are so varied, that there is a lot of shady money to be made.  Pills, body wraps, magical potions, no-effort equipment, etc.  These are all products geared towards people who don't want to be overweight, but are unwilling to make the lifestyle changes necessary.  These products are shameful, because they give people hope, and then shatter their confidence when their (doomed) attempts fail.			Similarily, the HAES sellers are also shameful.  They have taken the positive message of, "You deserve love and respect no matter who you are," and warped it into a counter-culture that will be directly responsible for their own customers deaths.  Granted, there may be select obese people who are fit, and even healthier by comparison to select non-obese people, but without exception they are jeopardizing their health by being obese. Anyone who profits off telling the obese otherwise is deserving of the backlash that groups like Fatlogic (and even FPH) deliver.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Milo0007","name":"t1_cs35bpu","parent_id":"t1_cs2z8ha","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1434042327,"created_utc":1434038727}

{"body":"Was this a response to what I wrote, because I don't see anything specific to what I said?  I agree, bullying isn't very helpful. 		I do take other people's best interests to heart, especially when it comes to their health.  I've worked at gyms, and volunteered my own time to attend group exercise classes with people whom I thought needed a friendly face to help them get through it.  Likewise, I've volunteered at running clinics/groups where I would run at the very back of the pack, to encourage those that needed it.  I have done countless workout and diet plans for free, spent hours listening to discouraged people vent about their health problems, given cooking lessons, coached sports, and a lot of other things to help people lose weight and increase their overall health.  I have helped more people than I can count lose more weight than I can count, and 90% of it, I did during my own time. 			Am I frustrated at the obesity epidemic?  Do I get mad when I see Tess Munster, or Ragen, or other HAES advocates promoting death and calling it fat acceptance? Do I think it's ridiculous when some obese people blame genetics for their gigantic size? Do I think it's disgustingly hypocritical for some obese people to ask for fat acceptance, and then bully underweight/athletic/average-weight people by saying they have eating disorders?  			I would answer all of those questions in the positive.  I agree, that some people at FPH went too far, and a lot that went on there was immature.  I would also argue that an individual creating a problem (becoming obese), and then relying on society to deal with it is also immature.  A large part of maturity is taking responsibility, and the HAES movement is trying to shift the blame so they can complain about how society is treating them.  Obesity is selfish by it's very nature, by consuming too much food and taxing health-care systems that cannot afford the additional strain.  FPH often went too far, but I am glad that there are people out there who feel the need to fight back against a growing, serious problem in our civilization.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Milo0007","name":"t1_cs4cda9","parent_id":"t1_cs3mdfi","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1434129091,"created_utc":1434125491}

{"body":"As someone who suffers from weight gain as part of atypical depression - it's fucking hard to lose weight when you're depressed. I got so desperate that I ended up with Bulimia because I was so distressed by the amount of weight I had gained both from being depressed/sedentary and from the meds I took to treat it (Remeron + Seroquel = 60lb weight gain, no exaggeration). 		However, hard is not impossible, and it's not impossible to lose weight when depressed. The trick is finding a coping mechanism that you can use to substitute for overeating. Ideally it should be something healthy - exercise or yoga, relaxation therapy, etc. However, most people find it very hard to make the huge jump from overeating to yoga, especially if their energy/motivation is low from the depression, so any kind of comforting thing is good to use as a interim step. For me it was TV and tea - every time I would feel like binging, I would make a huge pot of vanilla tea (pretty much no calories) and watch a new episode of a TV show. It was comforting and non-taxing enough that it gave me the escapism that food gave me without me actually eating 2000 calories in one sitting. And then I have slowly transitioned to stuff like taking walks and mindfulness. Therapy (specifically distress tolerance skills) has helped me to learn to sit with uncomfortable feelings without trying to numb them, too.		So yeah, not impossible. While I think r/fatlogic can be a bit simplistic every now and then (at least when it comes to the complex interactions between mental illness and weight) and sometimes a little harsh, I generally find them okay because a big part of conquering overeating is learning to recognize the justifications/fat logic statements that go through your mind and try to convince you that binging is the best way to deal with how crappy you feel.","depth":5,"score":30,"ups":30,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gasolinerainbow","name":"t1_cs2a2x1","parent_id":"t1_cs27y22","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433976049,"created_utc":1433972449}

{"body":"It's kind of like /r/TumblrInAction with a specific focus on the fat acceptance movements.  Content is frequently x-posted between the two.		Some people use Reddit to look at cat pics or dank memes for amusement, some people like to gawk at the weird/dumb/funny stuff people are out there saying in real life.  There are a lot of repeated tropes (for instance: Marilyn Monroe being used as a mascot for fat acceptance, HAES (Health at Every Size), losing weight is impossible and no one has ever done it so don't try, you can be fit and fat, being even morbidly obese has no impact on a person's health, fat acceptance being treated as a feminist issue, various notorious people in the FA movement that I won't name here, obesity/body size in general has nothing to do with caloric intake/expenditure or health, dating site catfishing, etc.), but my personal favorites are the entitlement, hypocrisy, and lack of self-awareness.  We often see pseudo-empowering images of idealized drawings of fat girls kissing ripped 6'+ dudes or screenshots from dating sites where the girl asks the guy how tall he is and he tells her and asks how much she weighs and she flips out.  That kind of stuff.		I don't really know what FPH's deal was; I wasn't a subscriber and I didn't contribute or vote, but occasionally, I'd look over there and see what's doing.  I got kind of an /r/ImGoingToHellForThis vibe focused specifically on fat people.  From what little I saw, it got vitriolic, but it seemed pretty self-contained and I sort of got the sense they were being over-the-top and kind of circlejerky, but like I said, I wasn't a member so I could be way off.  Most of the accounts I saw were named such that I think they were dedicated accounts for the sub so as not to get banned from other subs on their regular accounts.  I think it also functioned as sort of a stress release valve for people who are frustrated with fat acceptance and the culture surrounding it.		On /r/fatlogic, most of the posts that you'd find on FPH would be removed. One of the sidebar rules specifically forbids harassing fat members/posters, which, surprisingly, there were many (or at least more than you might think).  Much like TiA, contacting anyone featured (aka touching the poop) is also a bannable offense.  On Saturdays, they have a stickied thread dedicated to fitness progress pics where I've never seen anyone be anything other than encouraging.		For me, /r/fatlogic is a humor sub most of the time and a jimmy rustling source for the rest.  It also makes me feel better about things I've experienced.  I have a lot of dangerously obese relatives who are grossly misinformed about fitness, nutrition, and health and I grew up hearing their crap and just kind of nodding along and sighing on the inside.  Then I discovered this phenomenon is actually a pretty common thing for other people all over the world and it has a name and even a sub dedicated to it and I was relieved it wasn't just me.  I used to be a very different weight and state of health than I'm in right now, so when people are telling me that I'm just lucky that I'm randomly the size I am now and I should pity them because your habits and what you eat don't determine your weight/size at all and they once tried eating only 300 calories per day and running 10 miles every morning and wound up gaining 30 more lbs, it's particularly irksome to me, but it's not the sort of thing you can call out in real life.  It's refreshing.		/r/fatlogic isn't the reason I got on reddit, but I think it's my second highest source of comment karma after /r/askreddit (it might be the highest, I can't check now while it's private).  In my experience, it's really been a non-toxic environment, but I can imagine that the mass exodus from FPH to /r/fatlogic has been a lot to deal with.  I just hope it comes back soon.		**EDIT:** For what it's worth, I don't like that FPH was banned.  I think the explanation was flimsy at best, especially when pressed as to why SRS is still allowed, and I'm afraid that it will set a precedent that we have to treat everything with kid gloves from here on out.

{"body":"Absolutely not.		The obesity crisis in the western world is a very serious thing.  Lots of people are very fat.  Lots of very fat people have absolutely no nutritional knowledge and believe some very crazy things about their body, their diet, and their nutrition.  People sincerely and seriously suggest things like: "I eat 500 calories a day, exercise for hours, but gain weight!" or "my thyroid caused me to gain 100 pounds," "This plate of ranch-dressing-covered lettuce is healthy and only 200 calories because MFP said so!" which is absolute nonsense and only keeping them fat.  		What each individual gets from fatlogic is different.  A number of people say they use it for inspiration in their own diets.  Other people use it for humor.  Others just because they seriously do oppose the fat activists who want to normalize obesity as a healthy and positive thing.  		**ultimately** fatlogic is about tearing down the the leaps of logic and mental gymnastics people use to excuse themselves from personal responsibility for their own weight.			Also point of notice: we've done numerous surveys.  While I don't have the most recent one available (the person who ran it up and deleted everything), we're approximately 55% women, 40% men, 5% "other", and while over 2/3rds of us have a normal BMI at present, our users also indicated that 2/3rds of them have, at one point in their lives, been overweight or obese.		We are literally a bunch of formerly-fat men and women (though mostly women) who lost the weight and don't like other fat people saying "it can't be done."		The thing is, a lot of people don't like being told "you are responsible for your own life and consequentially your own weight" and take that to mean we are bullies who hate fat people.  We do our best to tear down that image when we can, because it's not who we are or who we want to be.","depth":3,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tahlyn","name":"t1_cs26kpb","parent_id":"t1_cs26bwz","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433971063,"created_utc":1433967463}

{"body":"I find these types of subreddits abhorrent, but I think someone should make a new /r/fatpeoplehate with a clear message that they will not tolerate doxxing nor brigading and see if they ban that. Because if they do, that would be ridiculous. The world isn't a safe spongy playground. The helicopter children need to grow up and respect free speech, especially when it's bigoted.  If no one is allowed to have a 'negative' view/bias they will take it other, more harmful places. When they are thrown into the rest of the world, they get to experience different views, and have a much greater chance of changing their minds. Reddit should strive to be that, not some bullshit 'safe-speech zone bubble' crap they've been talking about.			EDIT: It should probably have a name that isn't too similar, so as to cut down on the chance it'd be banned for ban evasion. Something like, 'obeasefeast', 'childrenofmcdonalds', or 'planetsized.' 		Also, can someone explain what would be eligible for ban evasion? Is it just a similar name with the intent to perpetuate the same ideals as the original? What if it's a different name and the person has no intent on replacing the banned sub, but rather just wants a smaller/slightly different user base? 			EDIT 2: I just want to reiterate, I do not support these biased views at all. Rather, I support freedom of speech on this wonderful site as long as it doesn't break the law(sharing of child porn, conspiracy to commit crime, etc.). I am not apart of the fat acceptance movement. I think all people should be allowed to live the lifestyle they choose, regardless of its impact on their health. Honestly, you aren't them, so who gives a shit? If you hate fat people, don't be fat. Putting ourselves in an echo-chamber of political correctness stops us from being able to communicate our opinions effectively, thus reducing our chance of changing our view on a particular subject. It's a dangerous thing for reddit, and if it continues to patrol based on what it thinks the site should be rather than what its user decide it should be, they will see their core migrate to a platform more suited to them.

The beauty of reddit is I get to chose not only where I participate and how, but that I get to do so anonymously and safely from behind the barrier of my computer. This means I can sometimes participate in topics that are too controversial for polite conversation at work or home. But that doesn't make them unimportant. 		/u/handlegoeshere 's analogy was a bit over the top, but sometimes hyperbole is an effective tool in pointing out the ridiculous.

{"body":"The outcome is not the same. The pattern of behavior is the same. There is a standard pattern that administrations fall into when they want to misrepresent themselves as being free while actually being authoritarian.		**Of course such a regime in charge of a country causes more human misery than a similar group in charge of a website.**		But the similarities are uncanny, and it really shows how the core of reddit's response to this is dishonest. 		Straightforward authoritarians are relatively common in history. They don't pretend to be constrained by rules and they brag about their power. Burma's regime is not like this - it makes a show of democracy so the West gives it aid and doesn't impose sanctions. Here are some of the tricks:		1) Have ambiguous rules that can always be applied against political enemies.	2) Don't apply those rules to your partisans.	3) Don't take input from the accused when considering their case. You should try them, judge them, and punish them on the strength of an accusation.	4) Never give any public evidence that the crimes were committed. Doing so would impinge on the first rule. Also, with this as your policy, you can simply invent crimes and attribute them to innocent foes, perhaps exaggerating something they actually did do that wasn't really a crime.	5) Impose collective punishment on all your enemies when one of them is convicted of breaking a rule. Say that the opposing group to which the individuals belonged was insidious to morals and otherwise a terrorist organization.		Again, this is all assuming you want to pretend to be applying neutral rules fairly. Burma is ruled by an elite group and not a single strongman, which is one of the reasons it is most similar to reddit's admins. Other autocracies are governed by (usually military) men who gain prestige from being demonstrably above the law, and historically tyrants didn't have much cause to project an image of lawfulness abroad.

Generally I agree with this, in that I believe it's fair for sites to make their ToS much stricter and far more arbitrary than legal systems if they wish to. It's their site, they have no real obligations to anyone but potential investors and whoever they themselves sign agreements with.		The thing about Reddit and free speech as a concept is that the site has a long and somewhat complex relationship with the concepts behind it (just google "reddit free speech" and have a glance at the articles), sometimes saying "we protect free expression" and sometimes "we are not for complete free expression".

{"body":">"Freedom of speech" doesn't mean the same everywhere in the world.		No, but "freedom of speech" as a concept - not as a legal subject - is pretty decently defined by Wikipedia's opening statement: "Freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one's opinions and ideas."		>Absolute free speech in the sense that Americans use it is eventually unsustainable because haters and such accumulate and prosper.		Agreed. I'm from Denmark myself, and we had a pretty big case what with the drawings of the prophet Muhammad a few years back, the debate about freedom of expression occured here as well. 		Legally we have a sort of "freedom to speak responsibly", speech is limited in the way that it's not **the speech** that's governmentally considered illegal, but the potential moral, ethical and financial damage that one is responsible for in speaking certain things in certain contexts.		>I'm hoping this movement goes further and removes coontown and other such subreddits. 		Personally I'm either for that or for them rescinding the decision. I don't mind that they're doing either, but the half-assedness of this solution's implementation so far (as you mention, coontown is still around) looks a lot more like saving face to advertisers than an actual attempt at helping the community.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PM_ME_YOUR_WORRIES","name":"t1_cs2uccp","parent_id":"t1_cs2u4fa","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1434016736,"created_utc":1434013136}

{"body":"To be honest, I personally thing it's overdue.  Reddit has spent the vast majority of its livespan miserably unprofitable and held together by piecework stopgaps from people thanks to it being opensource, enabling whoever had the skills to come along and make fixes or improvements.  Their servers *still* get bogged down with traffic from time to time, and they just weren't able to meet the demands of its quickly-growing userbase.  		Enter the sponsors. 		They provide the financial means for reddit to meet the needs of its users, but we all knew it would come at *some* cost.  Reddit has done well to align themselves with sponsors who share similar values, but *nobody* is going to want to associate themselves with such controversial communities, regardless of how much traffic on reddit those communities got.  And if it was confined exclusively to reddit in some corner, it would be easy for them to brush aside or sweep under the rug, but when it spread out of the subreddit and even offsite (allegedly) while continuing to use the sub as the hub or home base, that's a black eye they can't cover up.  		99% of subreddits likely aren't ever going to have to worry about this, and 99% of users likely aren't ever going to be effected by these practices, but it's necessary from a business standpoint if reddit wants to continue to exist and grow.  You can't afford to alienate huge swaths of your potential userbase to appease a smaller group.  In this case, the scales are in favor of the sponsors and the general public, and against the likes of FPH and those who would see reddit as a platform for unmitigated free speech.","depth":1,"score":143,"ups":143,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":true,"author":"splattypus","name":"t1_cs25b4h","parent_id":"t1_cs24lri","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433969343,"created_utc":1433965743}

The problem there was [their whole 'relaunch'](http://www.reddit.com/comments/m0w30/eli5_the_great_digg_migration/): Paid advertising suddenly became the only way to get to the 'front page' there. Again: this is absolutely not the case with reddit (despite how adamantly some people think it is). Digg didn't lose traffic because of censorship, they lost traffic because they *completely sold out*. Reddit hasn't done that. 		Voat, Hubski, and all the rest are basically *already ghost towns*. And the number one reason for people joining those? So they 'don't get censored by reddit'. What's reddit really censoring here? Bullies. People who are trying to belittle and demean other people. I'm *totally okay with that*. 		So those being censored are leaving to these alternatives. Meaning now they're just bastions of bad behavior under the guise of 'free speech': They're toxic. A bunch of bigoted children running around acting like the same group they're usually mocking: They all *love* to talk about how *oppressed* they've been under reddit, and how they're *victims* of censorship. See the irony in that? Because most of them sit around saying the other side is doing just the same thing.  		All those 'alternatives' can talk about is how bad *reddit is*. Which is hilarious: "We'll start our own club! And we won't censor people! But we'll sit around all day and talk about how the old club sucks. Welcome to the New Club of the Old Club Sucks: we're mostly made up of bigots and self-made victims, and oh yeah, literally everything is the result of a conspiracy and nothing happens on accident." 		Yeah, that sounds like a *wonderful* sales pitch to get me to leave. /s		Bottom line: Reddit wasn't created *in response* to Digg, but all these reddit-clones were created *in response* to reddit.

{"body":"> there is only one way to become fat: overeating		Blanket statements! They're very easy to disprove.		I have multiple close friends and family members who have been struggling to lose weight for years. One spends half an hour at the gym every day, consumes no more than 1200 calories a day... and is still 30 lbs overweight.		I used to piss all over him, accusing him of not making enough effort. Here I was, vacuuming up calories as fast as I could, confident that I could gain weight and no longer be so small that people could literally throw me across a room if they got angry.		Then, one day, I looked back on five years of effort and saw that all I had done was yo-yo between 85lbs and 92lbs. I looked at myself, and I looked at him, and I realized that all my superiority was just fear and insecurity. Ever since I decided to be more accepting and empathetic, I've been much happier. I no longer feel like I have to fix the entire world.		I know that from the inside, it feels righteous, like you're just trying to help people be the best they can be. But becoming more accepting doesn't mean letting people be 'disgusting failures'.

As a terminally thin person, I really appreciate your anger! Skinny-shaming needs to stop just as much as fat-shaming; it doesn't do anyone any good when uninvited.

{"body":"They're not isolated incidents, it's the majority of the movement. There's an entire HAES conference every year now that is basically an echo chamber of these kinds of incidents.		The whole movement consists of talking about how they are not unhealthy and how they look and feel exactly as they were meant to. Then they cry that they're being oppressed when a doctor tells them to lose weight or when a doctor says they are too fat for a certain surgery or medical instrument. The echo chamber then moves on to crying about how they need society to cater to them by making everything bigger and giving everything higher weight limits.		The people who usually talk at these conferences are people who are popular advocates of the movement, and most of them are quite large. For example, there is one advocate who on her blog constantly talks about the same stuff spoken about in the conference. She claims to be a regional dance champion, but when you look her up you'll usually find the only notable championship she ever won was only won by her because she was the only participant (AKA she won by default). In addition, this same woman tends to recommend crazy things like switching doctors repeatedly until you find ones that don't mention weight...well, among other things. IIRC there were many posts where she was crying oppression because of a doctor mentioning weight to her (which she repeatedly claimed he knew nothing about because apparently only you can know how to make yourself healthy) or something.		And that's the common kind of person talking about HAES at the HAES conference.		Every single criticism towards HAES or a HAES advocate is taken as "concern trolling", bullying, or oppression. I can't figure out how to define the concept of "concern trolling" properly, but it's often compared to times when someone asks on 4chan for advice and 4chan responds with messages that start out positive and helpful but end with things like "kill yourself".		Google defines concern troll as "a person who participates in a debate posing as an actual or potential ally who simply has some concerns they need answered before they will ally themselves with a cause. In reality they are a critic." When it comes to talking about medical issues of larger people, most HAES followers/advocates will claim you are a concern troll for even the slightest non-indicative comment. For example, there is one well known HAES Tumblr that will call you a concern troll and resort to a hissy fit toddler tantrum if you ask for them to cite their sources when they make medical claims.		Oh, and there's also that whole thing where they constantly put down and occasionally bully thin people and think thin people are crazy and insane if they get offended...but if a thin person bullies the person back in response, it's the worst offensive thing that can happen to someone and there was no reason for it.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CarolineJohnson","name":"t1_cs2et90","parent_id":"t1_cs2dccx","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433983742,"created_utc":1433980142}

That's the thing with psychology, it's a world of unknowns and associations.		But no, I'm not equating depression with being obese. I'm saying they're often linked.

What? No. Dysthmia can be fixed with willpower and effort, major depression disorder can't be fixed with positive thinking and happy butter. It's something you learn to live with, or are lucky enough to no longer be effected by, or something you are treated for (with anti-depressants / drugs).			> That was never the point of HAES, and that's never what therapists try to do who treat people with obesity problems.

Which is part of the reason I have a problem with the societal changes we are allowing to happen. People don't need to be coddled. If people can't understand that they will die if they don't change their habits, then they will die. I don't agree with obesity being a reason for therapy either. If you are unhappy about your weight, you are unhappy. Therapy will not fix obesity, maybe physical therapy, but not talking to a shrink on a couch. 			Poor people do have a much harder time with weight, but this is because it's easier, faster, and usually cheaper to eat unhealthily, at least when you're buying for more than one person.  It's not that obese people suddenly lose their jobs and everyone leaves them. When you make bad decisions concurrently, they most likely will compound your issues.

I'm not certain, but I'm reasonably sure somebody overweight and happy actually lives longer than somebody marginally less overweight but terrified. Plus, being scared is pretty much a horrible way to actually lose weight, because you keep having to eat sweets to deal with the crushing fear that you're eating too many sweets.		Seriously, this is cog psych 101.		Plus, there's this thing called [QALY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year). Implication should be clear. Here's another link: the [repugnant conclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox). That's what happens when you calculate utility using pure years instead of QALYs, you tile the earth with subsistence-level barely-worth-living people. What about if you only want people who are alive currently to live as long as possible? [Oh look there's horror stories about that too.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream) Human values do not reduce to a single dimension such as lifespan.		If people want to live long, happy lives, should they have healthy bodies? Sure.

The rules that led to these bans didn't exist the same way back then, so SRS managed to slip through. 		2. A lot of Reddit has become overly reactionary against the SJW-boogeyman.

They consider removal of posts, subreddits and comments to be unfair censorship and violations of their freedom of speech. 		4. Part of this is the same as #3, but a lot of it is misinformation.

{"body":"I've pointed it out many times to others --- a sub dedicated to disliking other groups but NOT all groups is slowly just going to become a circle jerk and move further to the extreme and drive out the moderates.  There's a reason most people in TiA are white and male since they attack almost all things not white and female. If they were equal in attacking whites and males, it would be a moderating force. But since they are not, non-whites and women start leaving and become a smaller % of the sub so the content becomes even more negative towards non-whites and women. The moderates then slowly start to leave as the material and comments that is more extreme becomes more popular. 			I've been told that when TiA first started, it was just harmless jokes making fun of 'SJW' but that it now much more political. Rather than just poking fun, TiA is now making a big deal about these random stupid comments they find online and attack whole communities over these stupid comments said by random individuals. 		For example, suppose someone said something insane in supporting Jesse Jackson. Harmless joking is just laughing at the contradictions made in supporting Jesse Jackson. However, when I slip into TiA to see what's going on, they will take that same posts of someone supporting Jesse Jackson and turn it into this whole "that's what's wrong with black people, they are supporting people like Jesse Jackson". 			Worst is that many of these individuals they pick on have their heart in the right place --- for example the lack of women as leads in major movies or how every Disney movie with a female lead is a real problem.

{"body":"I totally agree. I was around when TiA first started, and it really was just lighthearted joking. Then (funnily enough, around the same time that /r/fatpeoplestories really started taking off and spawning other fat hate subs) it started getting meaner and meaner and more dedicated to actually trying to hurt the people they used to just snark about. I'm a woman and got the hell out of there when it became apparent that angry white men were taking over and pushing everyone else away, just like you've described. I remember that there was actually a post around the time I left which called out what was happening, and we discussed a theory much like what you're talking about - how every sub like TiA eventually goes to shit and takes itself too seriously and becomes less snark and more actual hate. It was a learning experience for me - I wish I'd never posted there, seeing what it's become, and since I left I haven't joined any more dislike/snark/hate groups no matter how lighthearted they seem. 		I feel like it wasn't always like this. Back in the days of livejournal communities (we're talking around 2003-2007ish) I remember being a member of a lot of snark groups that never got too mean or tried to actually attack the groups they joked about. But maybe I just got a good batch of groups and I'm being naive.

I definitely feel like the mentality you're describing in your last paragraph seems to be spreading across reddit like a virus, that said. It's almost impossible to have a legitimate discussion about certain topics without dozens to hundreds of people turning up to downvote the thread into silence and drown out the discussion with mocking and dismissiveness.

{"body":">  how every sub like TiA eventually goes to shit and takes itself too seriously and becomes less snark and more actual hate		This is very true. In fact, this [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/2yjs25/this_video_will_make_you_angry/) does a good job in describing how this work. It's a video about how things that make you angry spread more and how the content gets more negative as it spreads. As one comment said, ["*Subreddits like that (TiA) are phenomenal infection vectors.*"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/2yjs25/this_video_will_make_you_angry/cpaotxf). 		It's also why I don't like fatlogic.  People from there say they are doing good things and just pointing out 'fat logic' but that there are no personal attacks and they encourage people to lose weight. But it's not really an innocent sub --- they have no understanding of why someone people are fat (depression, low self-esteem, etc) and that much of what they make fun up on fatlogic is actually a overweight person's coping mechanism. 			> Things do seem to escalate on reddit a lot faster than I've seen them escalate elsewhere, though - I guess it's a combo of both the site's general character and the large number of people here.....

You are 100% right on everything. I became a regular here after Digg crashed and burned so I've been here about 4 yrs, I think? I signed up much earlier but I chose Digg over Reddit initially. Anyways, when I was on Digg I didn't notice that much hatred towards other groups. And in my first year or so on reddit, things seemed okay. But that's because those websites where initially based around technology stories and tended to have a more 'liberal' opinion about race, gender, etc. But then Reddit blew up and the larger the number of users got, the more it started drifting towards youtube comments. A lot more name calling, more negative views of minorities and women, etc. 		A great micro example is to look at subs before and after they became a default sub. I use to love dataisbeautiful. Before it went default, it was filled with stories that were usually not political and the comment sections tended to avoid the politics and you had to provide a source to any claims made or else you weren't upvoted. Now.....well, a lot of crappy content is upvoted that isn't exactly 'data is beautiful' and there is a lot of politics. Before, a discussion about gun or crime would have lots of interesting comments with GOOD sources cited. Now?? "You are a communist for wanting to take away my guns!!" is screamed rather than having a reasonable discussion about the topic. I rarely go to dataisbeautiful now...i stick to mapporn where people are scientific in the discussions with many experts actually weighing in and providing sources.

{"body":"Hey guys, I'm not sure if my opinion is unpopular or if people are just whining, but I think it's important to consider that the concept of free speech is more nuanced than being able to say literally whatever you want. I'd first like to differentiate between offensive speech and hate speech. People will be offended by all sorts of things, but the only speech that ought to be censored is hate speech. The primary difference to me is that hate speech actively perpetuates some sort of system of oppression i.e., fat shaming. In that way, hate speech actively infringes upon the recipient's freedom as an individual to be treated with a certain degree of respect. Thus, censorship of hate speech is not a matter of free speech, but rather that of preventing harassment and ensuring the freedom of those targeted.

{"body":"I know I'm late and this will get buried, but, this is coming from someone who has been a redditor for 6+ years.		I think it just seems silly that there is blatant censoring going on of a community that, for the most part (can't say for 100%, but they tried to remain) kept within the confines of it's own subreddit. One of the big issues was that /r/fatpeoplehate got so popular that it reached the front page of /r/all a lot, but that just shows the activity of its' user base as opposed to leaking to other subs. the further subsequent bannings of the spinoff subs just further prompted more outrage, because they kept entirely to their own subreddit (having only been around for a couple hours), they just happened to reach /r/all due to the popularity and activity of those subs.		Then the hypocrisy comes when other subs (like /r/shitredditsays , /r/coontown , /r/adviceapes , etc.) who are much worse, objectively speaking, as hate groups (racism vs. weight, uncontrollable vs. controllable, external skin color vs. internal mentality (HAES)) remain unbanned, even when reported many many times.		Then comes the final bit in how (temporary?) CEO Ellen Pao is attempting to change reddit from what it was supposed to be (a free speech platform, as stated by previous CEOs) and making it more of a "echo room" or "hugbox". 		All in all, the change from a free speech platform to a censored one, along with the hypocrisy shown in the selectivity of the bannings caused a veritable shitstorm and is causing many more people to get annoyed and active and sympathize more with the fatpeoplehate subreddit, not for agreeing with the subject necessarily, but for essentially becoming martyrs in the reddit censorship/free speech battle that has begun.		Also the fact that any post about Ellen Pao's legal proceedings, questionable (at best) entrance as CEO, censorship quotes, husband's ponzi scheme, etc. etc. gets removed and most of the users get shadowbanned. Because, even though it is in the news, it is not "news" (according to reddit admins), nor is it tech related even though it's about an internet company (again, according to reddit admins). It is just clear censorship and goes against a lot of what Reddit used to stand for.

So in recap of the top ten threads **7** are from FPH, the other three concern FPH and one of those is directly calling out Chairman Pao. 		I checked the sub members at 7. I just now checked and it's at over 20K. *20,157 to be exact.* I joined at 5 or 530. I was number 827. 		I can't help but think this reaction to the banning of FPH, is resounding. If I ran Reddit I would be paying very close attention. The userbase has spoken.

{"body":"My guess on why these particular subreddits were singled out? A few thoughts:		- We all know SRS is untouchable. So let's rule them out. They could conspire to kill Bernie Sanders, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye while donating Billions to the "Nancy Grace for President" fund, and they'd still be allowed to exist. 		- Reddit, in the past, has done investigations, and this is all something we signed up to allow - using IP addresses, PMs, and obviously user post history, deleted and otherwise. I suspect that they saw a pattern of behavior from Mods and top users where they "privately" advocated brigades, doxxing, and more. I also suspect that the Mods let doxxing attempts slide with a deleted post vs. an outright ban. If reddit wanted to be completely transparent (they won't) then they'll reveal this to us. Remember Unidan? He was banned because of a similar reason - they studied his voting history, PMs, and traced his IP to multiple accounts, verified by timestamps on login events. I bet they did this too for mods and members of the 5 banned subs.		- All about the money. What if I told you that most of the users of Reddit probably aren't fit, and might even fit the moniker "hamplanet" in the eyes of FPH subscribers? If FPH keeps making its way to the front page (and it was regularly), then casual browsers of /r/all might just click off to another site. They know the traffic details, we don't. I imagine that it's possible that they said "oh wow, notice that time spent on the site falls off more and more as FPH's subscriber base grows!" Also, imgur's ban on FPH (which was recent) might have shaken the imgur/reddit relationship.		- Speaking of the imgur banning. After this happened, MANY posts went up criticizing it. There's nothing wrong with this. However, how many messages, emails, and threats went to the imgur staff from immature people who didn't think things through? How many of these might have corresponded with information we know about Mods and regular posters?  		Aside from the "all about the money" hypothesis, I don't think Reddit simply banned these subs for being distasteful, or for their criticism of the imgur staff. I think there were valid reasons.		Unfortunately, Reddit will likely never share them, so we're left to speculate. The test will be probably over the next few weeks as we see a few more subs get banned. If we become more and more surprised, then we can probably guess that Reddit just bans material it hates. If the banning makes sense, then it's probably because they're trying to more strictly adhere to policy.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nobody2000","name":"t1_cs2i034","parent_id":"t3_39bzdf","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433989132,"created_utc":1433985532}

{"body":"I've struggled with body issues all of my life, on top of depression, social anxiety, and all sorts of fun things. I'm not obese but I am overweight and not very fit. When I found FPH a couple of months ago, read a few pages of posts, and finally saw the huge number of subscribers...my first thought was, "Is this what people really think of me? When I'm at work, when I'm standing in line at the grocery store, or taking the bus, or walking the dog? When people stare at me in public are they thinking I'm disgusting and deserve to die?" This train of thought is easy to slip into when you have a mental illness. When you already have anxiety about leaving the house everyday, the last thing you need is another reason to be anxious. It honestly made me feel like shit for a while.		I try to take care of my health and eat balanced meals. Limited junk food, veggies with most meals. Over the past few years I've become aware of my problem with emotional eating and I'm working on it. But because of the way I look, I'm apparently still disgusting in most people's eyes. Fine.		I admit to getting frustrated with some people's lifestyle choices (especially when they choose to remain stubbornly ignorant about how their habits are affecting their weight and health), but in the end it's not my life, it's theirs, and I'm not going to attack them for it. Changing diet & exercise habits isn't easy for everyone, and the way Western society is structured (desk jobs, sedentary living, cheap junk food) doesn't help.  		Fat people are human, thin people are human, everyone has a story, and spewing hatred on the Internet won't motivate most people to make positive changes in their lives, it will just make them feel like shit. If you want to help people lose weight, offer to be someone's gym buddy. Work to make healthy food more accessible to low income families, and help fund sports programs for low income kids. Treat others with love and compassion. You can express your worries about someone's health without being a dick.
