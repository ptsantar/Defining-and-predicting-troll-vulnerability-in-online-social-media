This is fucking ridiculous.		-50 CAMERAS ALL OVER THEM THROUGHOUT THE GAME AND THE NFL CANT FIND ONE MOMENT OF TAMPERING??		-They're considering ending the investigation tonight because the "NFL is struggling to find anything that supports this idea of cheating.		-Latest article says it was most likely just an error		-AT THIS POINT....THIS ENTIRE STORY WAS BIRTHED/ AND SENSATIONALIZED BY ONE LYING SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ARTICLE AND SUPPORTED BY ESPN STUCK ON REPEAT. Their entire basis of "Fact" was that Jackson said he noticed something about the balls and reported it.		Colts LB D'Qwell Jackson: "The deal about me saying that I noticed anything about it (the football), that's totally false"		So the ONNNLY other facts are:	-11 of 12 balls were found underinflated by 2lbs PSI.		"10degrees decrease in temperature typically equates to 1 lb psi lost. The footballs were measured indoors at about 70degrees before the game and at halftime, approved and then remeasured after they played in a game at about 45degrees." Theres your 25degree difference and 2lb psi lost. (not sure if this holds true to footballs like it does tires however...just repeating what ive read)		-Its such a ridiculous idea, that it even made Sports Science relevant again. 	"The 2lb deflation amounts to making the ball 1 gram lighter, travel .003mph slower, and create 1millimeter of indention when gripped."		"If anything, it would have made the ball harder to throw and travel slower in the rain."    		So... every single person who has said the pats cheated just stopped following the topic after reading one inaccurate headline?		G-damn....sooo this is how the news works? they can just say anything and people make up their minds about a topic without reading or researching it?

Plus... it would require a tool the size of a hypodermic needle to let the pressure out. So it is entirely possible that the cameras, who don't typically focus on the sideline staff, wouldn't have seen it.		I'm not saying this was sanctioned by the Patriots... or that Brady or Belichick knew it was happening. Just that it is entirely possible that this did happen.

{"body":"People *say* it's easier to catch, throw, whatever. But people have been testing this 2 psi difference in inflation and it just doesn't make enough of a difference in the ball to call it "easier to catch". It would amount to a single gram on a 400 gram ball (the minimum weight as per the rules). And that's only if air was taken out or that much not put in. Any pressure changes from the temperature delta would not change the weight. Furthermore, it was found that 2 psi less in the ball makes for about a single millimeter more in the amount the ball gives when squeezed. I would assume that the gloves they wear and the rain that was falling that night would have a much more significant impact on how easy or difficult it is to catch or throw the ball.

As such, all calculations and speculations will be done from 12.5 psi NOT 13 psi. At this level, the weight of the air in the ball is ~9.5 grams. So, we have a ball that weighs ~420 grams and air that weighs ~9.5 grams. 		The percentage difference in psi is not 15%. This fails to account for absolute atmospheric pressure. I'll let /u/chiropter explain succinctly: 		"A 2 psi drop on a 12.5 psi ball is not 15% less pressure, because you have to account for the fact it 12.5 psi is gauge and not absolute pressure. Absolute atmospheric pressure is already 14.7 psi. Add on to that 12.5 psi, and a drop in 2 psi is actually just a 7% difference."		So, we've got the percentage difference and the approximate weight of the ball and air in it. Keep in mind that the weight of ball (excluding the air) stays relatively constant unless you want to be anal and include the weight of water droplets, etc. 		Now, we do a simple calculation: weight of air * percentage difference = weight lost from drop in psi		9.5 * 0.07 = **0.658** grams. Brady might be a god on the field but he ain't good enough to detect a weight difference that small. Keep in mind that this is not an exact science and there are many variables being overlooked. But you get the point. Non of this proves or disproves that there was delibrate tampering with the balls. It simply shows that when Brady says he didn't notice a difference, he's not lying. No one would have noticed a difference and anyone who says they did is full of shit. 		What really annoys me though isn't just the hate filled speculation and baseless accusations. Or even the fact that CNN brought in an "expert" to talk about whether Brady should have noticed a difference, although the segment was mind numbing. What pisses me off is the fact that NFl memory seems to have been wiped, completely forgetting about a team being caught on camera tampering with the balls. Panthers. They were caught doing it on the sideline and their punishment was a sternly worded letter. Yet, when the Patriots are accused (without any tangible proof) of doing the same, there are cries for a fine and loss of a draft pick.

{"body":"I see that since I left you argument in tatters, you changed the subject. Thing is, the fact that a deflated ball is not significantly easier to catch, and actually harder to throw (the ball moves slower and wobblier), is important here. They would not cheat in this way because it is too much risk for no reward. 		Secondly, head coaches don't dictate ball condition. Quarterbacks do. Belichick has nothing to do with this. There goes your argument about repeat offending.		Thirdly, the patriots had 4 days to bring in consultants and craft a response. If they were guilty, the obvious smart play is for Tom to take the blame, apologize, and plead ignorance. It would kill the issue immediately, absolve Bill and the organization, and Tom would get a slap on the wrist (something around $50k probably). But they chose to give a flat, bold, and specific denial. If they are guilty that is a really stupid move.		There is no way they cheated. I am so sure of this I'd like to propose a wager: if the NFL investigation absolves the patriots of any willful wrongdoing, you must come back here and apologize for making accusations based on emotion and without the facts, and you must promise to not do so to anyone in the future. If the NFL finds the patriots willingly cheated by actively removing air from the balls after Walt Anderson's approval, or if Tom or Bill are proven to have lied about any of this, I will donate $50 to the charity of your choice. What do you say?		Edit: So, it appears that Tom Brady has lied, and I was wrong. The texts between locker room attendants seem to suggest that Brady pressured the locker room attendants into deflating the balls beyond the legal limit. Whether Brady knew this would be a rule violation or not is unknown, and irrelevant to my challenge to /u/alwaysmispells1word. The report also exonerates Bill and the larger Pats organization, but that is also irrelevant. The fact is that I wagered that Tom was telling the truth, and despite of a lack of any evidence to incriminate him, a reasonable person would still conclude that he was probably not entirely truthful. Though /u/alwaysmispells1word never accepted my wager, I still feel compelled to be contrite and offer to uphold my end of the bargain, which was to donate $50 to the charity of your choice.

{"body":"Piggy backing off of this it's pretty ridiculous to say that expecting equal responses from the league on situations like this is somehow a childish conception of justice. The NFL's biggest problem since Roger Goodell became commissioner is how ego driven the enforcement of rules have been. Just from a doctrine of fairness rules should be enforced objectively with set punishments and limited latitude for the commissioner to adjust them. 		This was the biggest story of Spygate that went untalked about for the most part.  The rule that Belichick broke was reinterpreted by the league in 2006 based on the decision of the commissioner, not the rules committee. Belichick defied this because he believed that the rules committee should be in charge of such things. That's why the punishment for something relatively minor in the grand scheme of things was so absurdly large, it was the commissioner driving home the fact that he can basically do whatever the fuck he wants. 		That's only continued to this day with Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, he's all over the map but as long as the NFL keeps making money none of the owners are going to complain about it. If the NFL gets in some hard financial times I would bet that people start making real noise about how unevenly the commissioner responds because I have no doubt they are already frustrated about it but keep their mouths shut because Goodell keeps growing their stacks of money.","depth":3,"score":50,"ups":50,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Druuseph","name":"t1_cnydruz","parent_id":"t1_cnycd3x","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1422029303,"created_utc":1422029303}

{"body":"It's because his statement is overstated.  By all means, if they prove that balls were deflated send them a fine.  The reason that folks are bringing up other teams' infractions is that rule are not simply rules.  Yes, every team should follow them, but not every rule is treated equally.  There is a reason a false snap loses less yards than a personal foul and why some personal fouls result in ejections from the game.  There is no precedent for being punished for altering balls (there is language suggesting altering balls can results in a 25,000 and more).  		Moreover, the Pats were already fined for spygate and they lost draft picks.  It's not as if the league has given them a pass on anything here.  Seattle has consistently had the most or near the most team-wide game penalties in addition to having several players caught for PED use.  Do we just tally up any type of infraction even if they are unrelated to each other any label it a pattern of cheating?  The short of it is that the Pats simply have two big occasions that blew up into scandals.  		Suggesting that the Pats are eroding away at the game of football is giving a little too much credit to them when other teams doing far more serious infractions.

AMIRITE ? and and that yes, the other 10 (11? or was that one sold by the NFL employee stealing them?) were just under by the same amount - an amount which was pretty much verified (except by the weather forecaster whom is a Seattle Seahawks fan and damned be the science).  I gots more to say to dah facts o' dah mattah also in a few.		Please, Watson, explain it to me again how "investigations work" and about "evidence".  How about the "airtight" NFL officials pregame protocol for checking the balls which really makes for a rock solid foundation which we can certainly rely on as sound documentation of their pregame check.		Investigations and evidence are best founded with torches and pitchforks, no ?  That is all the investigation I saw.		Let us malign all the players, the coach, the team, the fan base and anyone whom ever even travelled through New England first.  They all deserve a good swift kick in the nuts.		Yeah, I cannot speak for anyone else but for me it all just felt so horrible - and - really, it is just a sport at the end of the day (nope nope nope Randy Moss says it is big business and thats why they no want him back, *sigh*). Guess I got my priorities wrong, who cares if Boko Harram is gunning down children in Africa.		I just love your last sentence...	> What evidence do the Pats have to prove they did nothing wrong?		There is some fair proof right there - proof that everyone is prejudiced before a fair jury can even be formed. The Patriots have to prove their innocence in a country which was founded on the belief that all are innocent before proven guilty (insert Soviet Russia joke here).  Just perfect.		Finally, yeah, i know, finally a finally but here it is for what it is worth...		HArbaugh got outcoached in a mean way.  Julian Edelman's throw was like a kick to the crotch for him, for instance.  After the game, HArbaugh made comments and Brady responded to HArbaugh telling him he needs to go back and reread the rulebook or some such....  heh, well, I guess HArbaugh did just that.  Mastahfull evil bastahd even gave the NFL a "black eye" too since the pregame check was dubious at best.	Cheers.

The NFL rules say that they must be filled to a certain PSI, which is dumb, because obviously the NFL doesn't check this.		Anyway, during this particular HIGH PROFILE game (winner goes to the Super Bowl) one of New England's balls was intercepted (meaning the opposing team caught it).  The player that intercepted the ball claims to have felt something strange with the ball and took it back to the sidelines with him.  Upon investigation, it was found that something like 10 of the 12 balls New England brought were underinflated.  People say this gives New England an advantage since underinflated balls are easier to throw (better grip) and easier to catch.

{"body":"> And anyways if deflating the ball makes it slightly easier to handle, which might result in an additional catch or two		I understand that your post is sarcastic, but there is no way you can say "it might result it an additional catch or two". The general consensus is that it made little difference (especially since New England was clearly the better team), but there's no way to objectively tell how much of an impact it made. What happens when another team breaks the same rule in a game where it comes down to a receiver making a catch as time expires to win the game? THAT's the issue here. Notice you don't see the Colts whining about it.		Also if this was any other team they would have gotten a letter from the commish or a fine and it would have been a non-issue. The ONLY reason people are saying draft picks should be on the table is because the Patriots have gotten punished for skirting the rules before. I don't see a problem punishing a repeat offender for ticky-tacky rules a little harder than normal.","depth":1,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tonytroz","name":"t1_cnyf6xz","parent_id":"t1_cnydewt","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1422031624,"created_utc":1422031624}
