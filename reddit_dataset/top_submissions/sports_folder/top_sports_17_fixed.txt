{"body":"Uh, it doesn't really have anything to do with what we're talking about here, and the article really tells most of the story already, but I suppose I can try.		Zwarte Piet ("Black Pete") is part of the tradition of Sinterklaas (Saint Nicolas), a gift-giving tradition that was the inspiration for Santa Claus. The Black Petes are akin to Santa's elves. They assist Sinterklaas in delivering the presents by going down chimneys. They are most often played by white people wearing black face paint, colorful clothing and red lipstick.		They have been a controversial subject for a long time. But lately the issue has gathered more attention as other countries heard about the tradition. Especially Americans were appalled, as they associate the black facepaint with the practice of Blackface. Most Dutch citizens are unfamiliar with blackface as a method of ridicule, and don't consider zwarte piet's looks to be an expression of racism. According to a 2013 survey, 92% of the Dutch public don't perceive Zwarte Piet as racist or associate him with slavery.		It's a very complicated debate. There have been protests, talkshows, all sorts of suggestions to change pete's appearance that don't seem to satisfy, and every year it bubbles up again.

National oriented politicians (members of parliament) tow the party line, which is usually dogmatic (except basically the PVV who are opportunistic and populist). There are many political parties (both local and national) and most target a certain religion, set of ideals, demographic or economic background. The divide between rural and urban isnt *that* big, as the Netherlands is very small, you never far away from a city.		Race riots are not a thing, gettos are (almost) non existent.

{"body":"> do you guys have politicians who take advantage of the urban/rural divide and use it to divide their population for political gain?		The Netherlands use an open party list proportional representation system and have no real election threshold, leading to an incredibly diverse political landscape - at the moment, there's 11 different parties represented in parliament. There's a clear divide between those, though: cities vote left-wing or socially liberal; countryside votes national-conversative or Christian democratic. 		Drug policy is a great example of the urban/rural divide. Following pressure from rural border regions, the (conservative-dominated) parliament introduced a "weed card" system, effectively barring foreign visitors from buying (tolerated) drugs.

Biodiversity is supported by science, which you seem to be confusing with the concept of race in general. The incidence of lactose tolerance is [quite variable](http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/7.11661.1375182095!/image/lactase-hotspots2.jpg) and appears to exist in populations across the world at varying frequencies. You can't declare it is a 'white thing' or use it as a marker of 'whiteness' when it is neither unique to nor universal amongst the people you would classify as 'white'. Try not to [beg the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question) by using a statistical characteristic of a pre-defined population as evidence of its own existence.		>Or I guess the reason that most Asians can't metabolize alcohol is because of social constructions.		Same as above. [Some can and some can't](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/assets_c/2009/10/GeneMap-thumb-550x468-17735.jpg); it all depends on whether or not they have the specific genes that cause alcohol flush syndrome (and the intensity of their reaction).		>Or I guess the reason that 23andme genetic researchers were able to figure out my race from a DNA sample, without me telling them any information about myself, was because a social construct.		No, it's because of biodiversity. Pigliucci (2013), regarding the following question:		*"If Races Do Not Exist, Why Are Forensic Anthropologists So Good at Identifying Them?"*		*That is indeed a good question, though the answer is actually well known in statistics, and need not invoke the existence of well characterized and biologically meaningful human races. It is a truism of multivariate statistical analysis that membership in individual clusters of pretty much any heterogeneous collection of objects can be ascertained with a fairly high degree of accuracy if one has a sufficient number of discriminatory variables to play with. Indeed, Sesardic approvingly quotes a study by Ousley, Jantz, and Freid (2009) which concludes that seven variables are sufficient to achieve a classificatory accuracy (i.e., attributing the right geographic origin to a given individual) of 95%, and that 19 variables raised that probability to 97%. Very impressive, until one looks at Table 4 of the Ousley et al. (2009, p. 74) paper.*		*It turns out that the groups that their analysis identifies include not just (and not surprisingly) ??????races?????? identified by large geographical provenances, but also more local geographical provenances (just as in the continuous hierarchy that emerged from the Rosenberg et al. paper discussed above), and even tribes (of Native Americans) and time differences (as in the differences between white males born from 1840 to 1890 vs white males born between 1930 and 1980). Now, again, Sesardic owes us (and, needless to say, does not provide) a principled account of why we should not take the Ousley et al.???s results to indicate not only that Arikar and Sioux Native Americans actually belong to distinct races, but that late 19th century white males apparently also belonged to a different race from white males from the middle part of the 20th century."*		It is a weak argument. People with trait A = 1000 people, people with trait A and B = 200 people, people with trait A, B and C = 50 people, etc. They can continue this process to any degree of accuracy they want. If people with trait A, B and C are considered a race then they can declare that you are a part of that race. It is an pre-defined category, so people can obviously be assigned to it retrospectively.		>Or the reason that people of different races have a lot harder time sharing organs or bone marrow is because of what society tells them.		Again, this depends on their biological compatibility; genetic differentiation generally increases over distance, which is why people who have similar geographic origins are more likely to be compatible, but this is not a certainty. In several instances people's own immediate family members are incompatible.		>Or the reason that Africans have different nose shapes and a greater susceptibility to certain blood disorders is simply because of society......right.....		Biodiversity. If you're referring to sickle cell then, just like lactose tolerance, this is not an 'African thing', [as this map of neonatal sickle cell incidence shows](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547249/figure/fig2/). Also note that in the most heavily affected areas, only 18% of the population express the allele.		>Because you apparently can't see the difference between African and European.		I can see the difference between any two people. What is the value of your statement?

"He had no race you fascists! But his problems are all white people's fault I can tell you that"		Evolution is continuous and taxonomy in general is a construct designed to impose order on what is inherently disordered. Yes, species are constructs: there isn't even a single definition of the term. *Escherichia coli* and *Homo sapiens sapiens* are both called species, yet they obviously do not adhere to a single definition of 'species', given the concept of 'reproductive isolation' does not apply to the former. Depending on the specific biological area being studied, different definitions of 'species' are used for different purposes.		*"Various different ways of defining species can be found in the literature. There seem to be 26 to 28 separate definitions [...] No successful definitions have been found which capture necessary and sufficient properties that determine membership in Species ??? at least not for all types of species, as I will demonstrate shortly. Most definitions are successfully applicable only within a limited scope of cases. Overall, those definitions and delineation concepts are applied very inconsistently, and different ones may be called upon in different contexts; so much so, that the claim or aspiration for a unified Species kind, category, or rank that is arrived at by way of those species definitions, seems rather manifestly to not hold" (Kober, 2007).*		*"In translating the standard Linnean framework into a working taxonomy, one operational problem has been an instability of taxon names partly as a result of historical shifts in the meanings attached to ranked taxa (de Queiroz & Gauthier, 1990, 1992, 1994). Traditionally, taxa were treated (implicitly or explicitly) as abstract classes of organisms based on shared traits rather than shared ancestry per se. However, even when taxa were interpreted under a strict phylogenetic framework to be monophyletic assemblages or clades (which themselves can have several different meanings; de Queiroz, 2007), cascades of name changes for Linnean ranks often have been necessitated when new taxa were discovered or previously named taxa were either split or lumped subsequent to reinterpretations of new or existing data.*		*Systematists have attempted to alleviate the instability problem in various ways. The mainstream approach has been to adopt and periodically update an official International Code of Zoological Nomenclature that formalizes how to name organisms (Polaszek & Wilson, 2005), whereas proponents of an entirely different approach known as the PhyloCode (Cantino & de Queiroz, 2007) want to convert to a system in which clade names (traditionally referring to taxonomic rank) are redefined as clade types delimited in the context of a phylogeny.*		*Another obvious flaw of the traditional Linnean system is that its implementation to date has not entailed any serious attempt to standardize taxonomic ranks across different kinds of organisms. This problem has both conceptual and empirical aspects. One conceptual inconsistency arises because some traditional Linnean taxa of a given rank (such as Class Aves) are monophyletic, whereas others of identical rank (such as Reptilia) are paraphyletic or even polyphyletic. The empirical inconsistencies originate because disparate groups of organisms of identical rank in the traditional Linnean hierarchy are not necessarily identical or even similar in other attributes such as morphological diversity, rate of phenotypic evolution, contribution to extant biodiversity, diversity of ecological roles, or any other biological or evolutionary features of which we are aware. For example, some genera have dozens of species, whereas others are monotypic; species in some genera are phenotypically diverse, whereas those in other genera are almost indistinguishable in morphology; some taxonomic families encompass major components of an ecosystem, whereas others include only rare species of negligible impact; some taxonomic families are quite ancient, whereas others are relatively young; and so on. These points all have been made before repeatedly (Laurin, 2008; Lee & Skinner, 2007; Minelli, 2000) but, in any event, the undisputed fact is that conventional Linnean ranks are blatantly nonstandardized and thus inconsistent. In other words, under the current Linnean system, a taxonomic genus or family of insects, for example, does not necessarily compare in any specifiable way to a genus or family of plants, fungi, birds or amphibians.*		*This type of inconsistency is not just a minor inventorial glitch in taxonomy but, rather, it is a fundamental impediment to cross-taxon research and interdisciplinary communication in the biological sciences"* (Avise and Xiu, 2010).		You really don't understand the topic at all.

Except when I'm citing research, original arguments and not repeating tired, weak points that can be found on any far-right forum?		Race is a social construct, just like colour categories are [social constructs](http://www.starchamber.com/colors/colors-and-language.html). Declaring it is a social construct is not the same as declaring 'there are no people/objects with the characteristics that this social construct describes in mainstream discourse'. Using the term is not a concession that the properties it describes are biologically/physically significant.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sameold1","name":"t1_csjax6s","parent_id":"t1_csj50aj","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1435323368,"created_utc":1435319768}

I very much doubt your simplistic points that misrepresent biodiversity are the product of 'major genetic research organisations'.

A continuum by definition does not have separate categories.		>Is gravity a social construct?		No, it is a natural phenomenon and a physical law that is not subject to discretion.		>Since humans can interbreed with other species of humans (Neanderthals) I guess being human is just a social construct?		Again, you're begging the question.		>Do you have the mind of Rachael Dolezal?		Is there a point here?		>Even dogs can recognize different races. But they can't recognize the difference between rich and poor. Those are social constructs.		Again, the ability to recognise difference is a poor argument. If difference is evidence of 'race', then it follows that everyone is a member of their own 'race', but this is obviously not your position so stop using that argument.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sameold1","name":"t1_csjc2p6","parent_id":"t1_csjbrez","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1435326517,"created_utc":1435322917}
