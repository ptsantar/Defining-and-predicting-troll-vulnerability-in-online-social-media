The same idea is to be applied to those scenarios where possession is momentary and bouncing around. There's always flow to the game sometimes long and smooth, other times quick and jarring, but they all fit within one big surge that is the game. You should look back to Games 6 and 7 of the 2014 Western Conference Finals (LAvsCHI), they had great moments of flow that lasted upwards of 10mins, pure insanity.		3-hours? It's called network tv.

{"body":"Rubgy and Cricket have relegations and promotions as well, but it's possible in all three sports due to the sheer number of teams and professional organizations.

The 6th, 7th, and 8th divisions include various conferences if you like that include groups of 22 or 24 teams. So while there are 20 teams in the top division there are more than 80 spread about different conferences in the 8th tier of English football.		Naturally with American sports where there are only a handful of teams in comparison, such a system would not be feasible.

{"body":"I was overzealous in my reply because I feel so strongly the other way. Vince Doria and two fans aren't going to convince me the sky is plaid. I find it interesting that Doria said hockey doesn't translate well to TV since it so clearly does. I question his motives for making such a claim. The fans of course are just fans, laymen with opinions of negligible value, much like my own.		Like anyone else I can only speculate. Especially when it comes to cultures other than my own. If I had to guess, most people like a sport because they play it as a child, and when the barrier to entry is too great then they don't play it as a kid and don't enjoy it as an adult, it doesn't become ingrained in their culture, and the cycle continues.		That said, I enjoy NFL and I didn't play football at all as a kid, and it was nowhere in my culture. So where does my enjoyment come from? Well, I'd like to speculate a bit on the nature of the most successful North American sports: we'll say Football, Baseball, Basketball, and Hockey. Out of those hockey is in last place in the NA market. Why? Well the aforementioned barrier of entry is in place, but you could argue football has a similar barrier. Also, why isn't soccer on that list?		I think it has a lot to do with the nature of these games. In Football, Baseball, and Basketball, there are tangible gains and losses after every play, then a pause to analyze the gains and losses that were just made. A good team wins by taking a thousand steps. In hockey and soccer, I hear people say "nothing happens" quite a bit. It's pretty common to see a period/half with no scoring on either side. I think people want to see good plays result in tangible gains, and are disappointed when players have brilliance blanked to make no impact.		That might not be quite the reason, but I think it has more to do with the nature of hockey vs the nature of the audience and *nothing* to do with the translation to television. I would guess roughly half of fans would say hockey is better on TV than in person.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"clearsimpleplain","name":"t1_cse1avq","parent_id":"t1_csdzebg","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1434917995,"created_utc":1434914395}
