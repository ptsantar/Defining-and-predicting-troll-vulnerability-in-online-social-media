In my mind, if a hitter shows he can bunt for a single against a shift teams will be reluctant to use the shift against that hitter. You don't shift  to hold a guy to a single instead of a home run. You shift to get that guy *out*. If you are conceding first base to these hitters, and facing the next guy in the line up with a man on, I don't think the shift is worth it.

{"body":"Since he is stealing second yes they have to tag him to record an out. Now if the batter had hit the ball in play all they have to do is touch the base to record an out since the batter would be running to first. This is called a force out since there is a player running to the base behind him.		However lets say the runner was on second base and there was no one on first when the ball is hit into play. The runner on second would have to be tagged to record an out since first base was vacant at the time this does not cause a force out but the runner on second also does not have to run to third in this situation he can just stay put on second if it would be to risky to run to third depending on where the ball was hit		If all the bases have runners on them when the ball is in play then there is a force out at every plate because there is a runner advancing directly behind each person. 		In this situation the runner is stealing the base during a pitch and the ball was not hit into play so there is no one else advancing on the base paths so the runner always has to be tagged out.		EDIT: I found your other question in the other thread and tried to elaborate some more on that question. I love baseball and even though some say its popularity dwindling I think it a is a beautiful game and love explaining the intricacies.	Baseball has a lot of intricacies in the rules of base running among many other things which makes it very difficult for a new viewer to understand.

{"body":"It depends. The runner's objective is always to get to the base as fast as possible. In some cases he has to run to a base, and sometimes he chooses to take a risk to try to advance (as getting to the 4th base aka home is the only way to score). In cases where the batter is forced to run, for example...		- when he is batting and hits the ball, he has to run to 1st base, or 		- when he is on first base and the next batter hits the ball and is running to 1st, he has to try to advance to second base		- (same rules apply as #2 when runners are on 1st and 2nd, or even on all bases, but when runners are on 1st and 3rd base and a ball is hit, only the runner advancing to 2nd and the batter running to 1st are forced to advance. The guy on 3rd can stay if he chooses, as the base before him is not occupied). 		... the defensive team simply needs to tag the base by stepping on it while holding the ball. If that happens before the runner gets there, the advancing runner is out. If I am batting and I hit the ball on the ground, the opposing team simply needs to pick it up and throw it to a man standing on 1st before I get there and I am out. If the opposing team catches the ball before it hits the ground, I am automatically out. 		If the runner is choosing to advance at his own risk without being forced, for example...		- the runner standing on 1st waits for a pitch to the next batter and starts running 		- the batter hits a ball pretty far and thinks he can run past first and make it to 2nd base before the ball gets there		... there is no longer a force out, and the runner must be tagged with the ball. While you do have to touch the player with the ball in your glove, it is good baseball practice to throw to a guy standing at the base where the runner is trying to advance, and that guy stands waiting at (but not blocking) the base to touch the runner with the glove before he can get to the base, simply because the runner has to get to the base, and while he does have to advance in a nearly straight line to the base (he cannot go running off far into the field to avoid being tagged), he can avoid the tag by moving a few feet to either side, or sliding on the ground. 			Another type of force out is when there are guys on base and the ball is hit into the air and then caught before it touches the ground. Not only is the batter who hit the ball out automatically, but all runners who were on base have to return to their original base until after the ball is caught. Often a runner will go halfway to the next base when the ball is hit into the air so he has a chance to advance farther if the ball is not caught, but when it is, he has to get back to his original base as fast as possible, otherwise the team can also throw to that original base and step on it (without tagging him) to get him out. 		If the ball is hit very well and caught very far away from the bases, the runner may choose to stand at the base and wait for the ball to be caught, then run to the next base once it is caught. In this case, the runner would need to be tagged, as he is advancing at his own risk. this is a common play when a runner is at 3rd base, as the 4th base (the one where you are awarded a point for reaching) is the farthest one from the outfield, so a ball hit deep enough can mean a long throw for the player who caught the ball.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cgiall420","name":"t1_cqcxtqr","parent_id":"t1_cqcfy6s","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1429088483,"created_utc":1429084883}

{"body":"Notice how the guy at the plate is a left hander (David Ortiz).  David is known to "pull" the ball to make his power, meaning he hits to right field.  To counteract this, the defense has "shifted" on him... the 3rd baseman is actally to the right of 2nd base.  Therefore, no infielders were near 3rd base. 		The pitcher should have covered 3rd.  He tried ,but was too slow by the time he saw what was happening, and the way his body was turned after ducking under the throw put him in a bad position.  This is why they call baseball a game of inches.  if the bases were 4 feet further apart or 3 feet closer the game would not work.		While there's no spot for this on the record books, this extra steal was a result of the BATTER being such a good hitter, even though he didn't even swing.		This is why I love baseball.

{"body":">You must keep moving forward, and can never go back a base.		This is not true.  You don't have to go forward.  In many situations it is extremely unwise to go backwards, but you can do it if you want, and it's not always unwise (rundowns, for example).		And you can go back a base, too, or even multiple bases (unless the pitcher has assumed pitching position since you acquired your current base).  In some cases the umps can call you out for doing it, but not all.  In fact in some cases it's what you *should* do.  For example:		You're on first base, and you take off for second.  The batter hits a fly; you think it's going to fall in for a hit.  You keep going.  You step on second and don't break stride.  While you're on your way to third, an outfielder makes an awesome play and catches the ball for the out.  The defense can now put you out too by tagging first base while in possession of the ball unless you get back there before they do so.  And you have to tag second base on your way back.		And it's even possible to go back a base after legally acquiring a further base, without being called out.  The umps are only supposed to call you out in that situation if they think you're doing it to confuse the defense or to make a mockery of the game.  If they think you're doing it because of an honest mistake - e.g. the defenders have tricked you in some way into thinking that you need to go back - they're not supposed to call you out.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"moom","name":"t1_cqcjkmp","parent_id":"t1_cqcgbn6","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1429057248,"created_utc":1429053648}

{"body":"If you throw a baseball and hit a player on the opposite team, they are not out except in the rare case that the umpire calls intentional interference (the person on the other team puts themselves in the way of the ball to mess up the play).		While you can only land on the next base forward you can "lead off"  which means to take some steps off the base you are on so you get a head start running if the batter hits the ball.  The danger there is that the pitcher (guy on the dirt mound who throws the ball to the batter in the first place) could throw to his player who is near the base your are on and he touch you with the ball (more likely the glove with the ball in it) making you out. So, it's a delicate balance how much you lead off. 		This clip is an example of a steal. The pitcher threw the ball to the batter. The batter didn't hit it but the runner on 1st base saw an opportunity to "steal 2nd" so he ran. The catcher threw to the person on his team near second. It order to get the runner out he would have to touch him with the ball (or the glove or hand holding the ball). The runner makes a "heads up play". He saw that the guy near 3rd base was standing pretty close to 2nd. He figured he could run fast enough to get past him before the guy near 2nd who had the ball realized what was happening and threw to the guy near 3rd. After he touched second (mandatory) he took a risk and ran to 3rd. A pretty rare play. Now he just needs the batter to get a little hit or a long fly ball (batter hits the ball in the air, caught by opposing player, batter is out, man on 3rd just has to run the one base distance to home to score a run for his team (one point). He has to wait on third until the ball is caught though. If he had been leading off, hoping for a hit by the batter, he'd have to go back and stand at 3rd base until the ball was caught before he could run home.		Wow, it sure takes a long time to explain things when you have to assume the other person doesn't know the terminology or the basics of the game. I hope I was understandable. Sure baseball is boring compared to a lot of things but I grew up with it and it's like coming home after living abroad for me.

The official scorer shall score such a play as a fielder's choice.*		*Rule 10.07(g) Comment: The scorer shall consider, in judging whether the defensive team has been indifferent to a runner??s advance, the totality of the circumstances, including the inning and score of the game, whether the defensive team had held the runner on base, whether the pitcher had made any pickoff attempts on that runner before the runner??s advance, whether the fielder ordinarily expected to cover the base to which the runner advanced made a move to cover such base, whether the defensive team had a legitimate strategic motive to not contest the runner??s advance or whether the defensive team might be trying impermissibly to deny the runner credit for a stolen base. For example, with runners on first and third bases, the official scorer should ordinarily credit a stolen base when the runner on first advances to second, if, in the scorer??s judgment, the defensive team had a legitimate strategic motive??namely, preventing the runner on third base from scoring on the throw to second base??not to contest the runner??s advance to second base. The official scorer may conclude that the defensive team is impermissibly trying to deny a runner credit for a stolen base if, for example, the defensive team fails to defend the advance of a runner approaching a league or career record or a league statistical title.*","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PleaseShutUpAndDance","name":"t1_cqcsnz6","parent_id":"t1_cqcs8yn","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1429073479,"created_utc":1429069879}

{"body":"ELI5 answer: The batter, David Ortiz, is well known to only hit the ball to the right side of the field (his right, between 1st and 2nd base).  Because of this, when he is up to bat most teams will do what is called a shift, where the third basemen will position near 2nd base, the shortstop will move over to where the 2nd basemen usually plays, and the 2nd basemen will move back to become a de facto 4th outfielder.  The left fielder will also shift to the right side of the field.		Because of this, where it would normally have been the shortstop catching the throw from the catcher in that video and trying to tag Mookie Betts, it is actually the 3rd basemen, positioned far away from his normal spot.  Because the throw and his momentum carried him past 2nd base after trying to tag Betts, there was nobody left between Mookie and third base.  Literally that entire half of the field was empty.		It should be the pitcher's responsibility to cover 3rd base in this situation.  The problem is, teams probably practice defending situations like this while in the shift so rarely that the pitcher got caught sleeping.

{"body":"The basic goal of baseball is to advance runners around the bases ultimately to home plate where they score a run.  The bases are safe spots.  In this case the player at bat tends to hit the ball to the right hand side of the field; as such, the players have shifted severely to the right hand side of the field to accommodate.  After the ball has crossed the plate, the runner can try to advance, steal, at the risk of being thrown out.  He must be tagged to be out in this instance, while not on a base.  The runner, in this instance, beats the tag and when he realizes that 3rd base is undefended (no one there to catch a ball and tag him out), he takes off for it.  Most players wouldn't have that awareness or speed to take advantage of that and that is what makes this play incredible.

{"body":"Certain players notoriously "pull the ball", meaning they intentionally swing early which causes the ball to be "pulled" to the direction over the shoulder with which said player leads his swing. The main reason players pull the ball is because it's a lot easier to hit a ball out of the park that way, rather than trying to go opposite side. A right handed batter, even when not attempting to pull the ball, will hit a majority of his balls towards left field (that's just simple timing + physics), and vise-versa for lefties. 		In this case, David Ortiz was up at bat. He is a left-hander who notoriously pulls the ball (read: he RARELY ever hits the ball the opposite way). When he comes up to bat, managers will call a shift and have the right side of the field loaded up and the left side of the field empty. This is done a) to shorten the gaps between players fielding the ball on the side where he's most likely to hit, and b) to dare him to hit the ball the other way, which will likely result in a swing and a miss or an under-powered swing that the pitcher can field (because he's not used to swinging that way).","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OhMyGodsmith","name":"t1_cqcnz38","parent_id":"t1_cqclh2a","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1429064978,"created_utc":1429061378}
