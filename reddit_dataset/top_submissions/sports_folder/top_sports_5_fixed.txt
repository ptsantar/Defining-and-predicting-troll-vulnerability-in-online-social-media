FIFA has pissed off a lot of people, especially with how this whole Qatar thing is going down. If I were the leader of Switzerland I would see interfering with the investigation that the ***United States*** is performing regarding an organization, *that literally everyone in the world hates, and knows is corrupt as fuck* would net my country nothing, while potentially costing it a LOT in the eyes of the general world public. Not only would it be really bad PR for Switzerland, but it's also one thing to remain neutral amongst european countries, and quite another to tell the CIA, NSA, and FBI no. 		But all of this is moot. Politics aside, Blatter is still hated even inside of Switzerland. Soccer is huge to them, and he is the devil in the world of soccer. So while switzerland is typically a place where criminals can hide their big bucks, most criminals aren't engaging in abetting slavery. I think that even Switzerland has a line and FIFA has crossed it. If I were blatter I would move to Russia ASAP, but honestly, even Russia would probably extradite him. In fact, I'm racking my brain for a safe country that wouldn't extradite him and also isn't so dangerous it's not worth moving there, and I literally cannot think of a single one except for Qatar. Not even Putin and Xi Jinping resist the US when they are angry *enough*. They push the envelope as far as they dare, but they keep their heads down too, thats why *only* Crimea was annexed, that's why Japan gets to keep bullying china in the south pacific. And while Russia has done things like harbor Snowden, it is *for the exact same reason that they wouldnt harbor blatter*. Snowden is a world hero and a saint who will go down in the history books alongside Gandhi, Blatter is a douche who will go down in history alongside Benedict Arnold. Russia is gaining favor with the entire world, including the majority of US citizens themselves by harboring Snowden (in fact, it's not unthinkable that Obama himself even secretly approves). Meanwhile, they would gain the ire of the entire world by harboring Blatter. Switzerland will definitely be cooperating, as will every other country. Blatter's best bet really at this point is to join ISIS or move to Qatar, hahaha.		Everyone hates him, and everyone will fold, not because of pressure from the US (though that too), but because he is a disgrace to the world's most popular sport.

{"body":"The NFL is not and never was tax-exempt. "Every dollar of income that is earned in the National Football League ??? from game tickets, television rights fees, jersey sales and national sponsorships ??? is subject to tax. None of this income is shielded in a tax-exempt entity. Instead, the NFL's 32 clubs pay tax on all of these revenues. 		Claims that the NFL is using a tax exemption to avoid paying the tax due on these revenues are simply misinformed. The confusion arises from the fact that there is one small part of the NFL, unrelated to all this business activity, that is tax-exempt: the NFL League Office. The league office is the administrative and organizational arm of the NFL and does things like write the rules of the game, hire referees, run the college draft, negotiate the collective bargaining agreement with the players, conduct player safety research, and run youth football programs."	http://www.snopes.com/politics/taxes/nflexempt.asp","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dukefan2227","name":"t1_crmdxoy","parent_id":"t1_crm6y7z","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432731007,"created_utc":1432727407}

And made a subscription fee for the games which is high considering that's almost the wage or double that of an Egyptian family which constitute the majority of that country when we are talking about income levels. Middle eastern spectators found themselves having to resolve to illegal means just to be able to watch it, and even then the Qatari network started making legal suits against anyone who makes the poor population of the middle east watch the world cup.  	Here comes the fun part, Israel had the world cup shown on their channels for free, and the entire middle east was watching Israeli channels in last year's world cup, Israel even suggested introducing arab commentators in the next world cup.

{"body":">Nobody is forcing these kids to take these classes.		You're very misguided about this. Plenty of schools put pressure on athletes to avoid difficult and time consuming majors or courses. The AD will have dedicated academic advisers and they don't tend to say "sure, go out for engineering. We can make that work with football". Some schools in fact *do* specifically disallow athletes from taking some or even most majors on campus. UNC was accused of allowing football players just five majors to choose from, among their other many scandals, and you'd be a fool to think they're especially heinous. They're just the biggest fish to get caught so far.		Lots of majors, including many with the best job prospects, do not fit with 50 hours a week of sporting. The athletes simply do not have the time for any one class that takes four hours a day of studying, much less one that can take eight...and plenty of chemistry, physics, engineering, and biochemistry classes actually take that long, especially when you include lab time. Physical chemistry takes most students no less than four hours a day to even get a C, and that's just one course out of at least 3 in a full load. The very, very few athletes - I'd bet money less than 0.5% - who take rigorous majors like these have supererogatory dedication. They're doing more than should ever be expected of anyone and more than most other kids in the major with them could ever handle.		The 'value' of a full ride scholarship is a joke compared to the hours required for your sport and the networking, internship, research and other opportunities athletes sacrifice in their field of study.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lolpubs","name":"t1_crmqf34","parent_id":"t1_crmi1v6","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432754133,"created_utc":1432750533}

And yet there were several athletes (yes, even ones on the football team) in time consuming STEM courses. The difference between these athletes and the ones majoring in elementary physical education is that they had no illusions about getting drafted and were actually going to school. There were several other athletes in the business school as well. Both are rated top 20 in the US respectively last I checked. There is absolutely "pressure" from the coaches for these kids not to take intensive courses, but you're seriously fooling yourself if you think most of the kids signing up for the easy classes genuinely want to take anything else. There are plenty of kids who skip those courses and only show up to the "tutor" meetings so they can stay eligible. Lots of kids are there only to play football and drop out as soon as their eligibility is gone. It's much more an enabling system than anything, as the coaches and the kids both want them to focus on football.

{"body":"I understand that *some* athletes actually get an education and take it seriously, but overall the system takes advantage of way too many poor kids who don't know what they're doing and *don't* take the education seriously. We're taking under-educated 18 year olds from areas with little cultural emphasis on education and putting them on a team with coaches and advisers who genuinely prefer they do *not* take difficult majors. College staff discouraging athletes from enrolling the hard classes which take too much focus away from sport perverts the entire premise of the NCAA.		Your edit seems incredibly naive, too. We see far too many athletes struggle with grades and behavior in college even under the eye of multi-million dollar staffs dedicated to keeping them eligible and out of trouble. It's foolish saying these kids could just leave the sport and finish challenging majors as though this might actually happen. If the average revenue athlete should be in college at all, far behind the academic curve as they are, they should be receiving all the support and attention they receive from the AD but from tutors and impartial advisers. Pretending they could just wander out on their own and do well in college with just the resources of a typical student seems laughable.		Overall it doesn't even seem like you're disagreeing with me on the core point: the schools and the NCAA knowingly encourage "college enrollments" of kids who don't care for an education and/or won't do well in school. The huge proportion, almost certainly the majority, of students for whom they provide this dubious 'service' makes a travesty of their lofty statements about "athlete scholars" and such. Overall we'd be much better off divorcing the sports teams associated with the schools from automatically enrolling the athletes.

I've seen this sort of discussion before and when the size (and population) is pointed out, some people acknowledge that they didn't consider it and that it's a factor.		Then there are people who just assume it's "American dick-waving."   I hope you see some of the irony in you making a bullshit comment about Americans making bullshit comments.		When I said grographic area, I was referring to region, not size.  That's my mistake for articulating it poorly.  Especially considering I was also talking about size as well.  North America, is a large region of the world and has a lot of people.		My point about the size of states was that when somebody says "country x hasn't had it", that that country is more comparable to a single state in the U.S., not the country.  To further clarify, If somebody says "the U.S. just had it", that's not comparable to "the u.k. just had it."  The U.S. could host two in a row and the distance could be further apart than the U.K. and Italy.  So if U.K. to Italy would be fine, why not Eastern U.S. to Western U.S?  They're geographically *distant* or greatly spaced *because* of the size of the states.  I'm sorry I merely implied that for you to infer rather than stating it directly. Clearly, you weren't able to infer it for yourself.  That's my fault.		Does that make sense?  I'm not saying "we're big" in the sense you're implying. I'm saying the states are spread out like the entire European union, so it would be more apt to compare it to all of Europe as a region rather than most of the individual countries within Europe.

{"body":"FYI, for those who don't follow Asian football, I'm an Iranian supporter, and the AFC branch of FIFA is even more corrupt than FIFA. Keep in mind that the problems with this organization run deep into every confederation. Arabic oil money runs the federation and there are many instances of fair play being ignored to benefit Arab teams, particularly against Iran.		For example, during the 2010 World Cup qualifying, it came down to the wire between Iran, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea. Iran was to play an already qualified South Korea, and with a win they would move on, and with a tie, they would go as the third team to the playoff if either Saudi Arabia or North Korea won their game.		What happens? AFC decides it's too hot that day, so Iran and South Korea play first, hours before the other match. They tie 1-1. Now with Saudi Arabia and North Korea knowing the result, they purposely tie in order to eliminate Iran. If matches weren't played simultaneously for a UEFA World Cup final matchday, people would blow a gasket. AFC has been dealing with Arab corruption since 30 years ago.

{"body":"I honestly have 10 examples of this corruption that I can rattle off man that has hurt teams like Uzbekistan, Korea Republic, Japan, and mostly Iran (due to the long-festering hatred between Arabs and Persians) and have directly benefitted Arab teams.		Qatar bought a win from Lebanon in the 2014 WCQ for Brazil. A Lebanese player was found to make a back pass to a striker clearly on purpose for Qatar to win the game. You know who was punished for fixing the match? The 1 Lebanese player, not the individuals who paid him to throw the match.		Also, in the last game of WCQ for Brazil 2014, the games were luckily played simultaneously. Qatar v. Uzbekistan and Iran v. S. Korea. Iran won our game 1-0 and qualified as the top team, but if we has tied 1-1 (which it was honestly very close to being, Uzbekistan would have gone instead of us if they beat Qatar by 4+ goals.		Qatar was actually winning the game 1-0, until Iran scored on Korea. In a stroke of "luck" Qatar conceded 5 goals in 30 minutes, the exact number needed to make Iran go 3rd in the group and face a playoff with Uruguay, where we would have been eliminated.		Funny how that happened, but luckily Iran persevered and didn't concede that late Korean equalizer. No punishment or any real investigation by AFC or FIFA.		I can guarantee if Iran had done a fair play abuse like this, we would have been banned from all competitions for at least 1 year, and suffered immense sanctions. Fuck AFC and FIFA.

But because Hillary is active politically I can see corruption issues and do think an audit of the books might be necessary. But honestly, I'm so inundated with vitriolic misogynistic hatred for Hillary that at this point I've just learned to tune it out.		I used to be like you, a far left supporter but anti-Hillary. However, I realized a lot of my dislike of her wasn't exactly her politics but just her being who she was and me being from Texas and Ron Paul country. As a feminist I support her. I dislike a lot of the stances she has but it's the same for Obama.		I think a Hillary/Bernie ticket would be awesome but I'm not exactly holding my breath.		Overall, this FIFA tie to the Clinton Organization has more to do with Bill than Hillary because he was PISSED about Qatar getting the 2022 World Cup and he was making waves about it. Shortly thereafter we had the 2011 FIFA scandal and we got squeaking rats flipping to serve less time & that's led us to now.		It might come out that the FIFA ties to Clinton Foundation as a kickback for not being more vocal about 2022 will be used as evidence against FIFA because Clinton went to the feds about it.

Your local little league or kids hockey team or block party doesn't need anti-corruption measures in place because it hardly matters enough to anyone whether Dennis or Louise brings the Kool-Aid to practice.		FIFA started small but has grown to a point where it absolutely needs anti-corruption measures built-in from the ground up as it's incredibly vulnerable to manipulation: It's not under the authority of any govt.. It sits *between* countries like a privateer, picking off moneybags in exchange for use of it's international power.		I hope at some point a new organization is formed that is designed to not only manage international football well (not *that* difficult) but to be essentially corruption-proof. I don't know what that will look like but I do believe it's possible.		As much as I'm glad to see these idjots (ie: typical humans taking irresistible bait instead of maintaining values) put to the sword, I have pretty much zero faith that this won't just keep happening. Fuck FIFA. It was good while it lasted. Now we need to start a new organization that has at least a chance of promoting all the good bits of sport and resisting these ugly pitfalls.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Biomirth","name":"t1_crmf6vz","parent_id":"t3_37f31l","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432734436,"created_utc":1432730836}
