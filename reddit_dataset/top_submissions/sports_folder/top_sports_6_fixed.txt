{"body":"There are a few different avenues to becoming a camera operator for live sport. 		Route 1: Go to school for video production. 	Go to a college, most public schools will have a video sports department who loves looking for fresh meat to grind up. Get a great internship, graduate and start looking for the crewing companies that are hiring, you will probably only get a day or two work a month if you're lucky when you start. But eventually you may get consistent work. 		Route 2: go to a video trade school	Same thing as 1, but harder since you won't likely have a sports team you can internship for easily. 		Route 3:  starting from the bottom	There are entry level jobs on these shows that you can get from the crewing company with little to no experience. These jobs have awful hours and the pay is terrible, but if you work one of these jobs, you may advance up the ladder.  Ex: nationally televised games have a few "runners", they do everything from bringing food/equipment to people to running out to get alcohol for the talent (on-air people) to driving the talent to and from the venue. 		It's a long arduous process, most people can't make a living off of just sports video work for 5-10 years. The pay isn't great, I make enough to support my family, but my wife needs to work. Divorce rates are also amazingly high in our field, my wife has to be a single mother every game I work. But, my job is to watch sports... So you have to decide if it's right for you.

Let's say the camera operator needs to pan over to allow room for the graphic that goes over the anchor's shoulder. The technical director could feed the effect to the camera operator's return feed, allowing them to see their shot *with the box* so they could get the positioning just right.  (This is an outdated example since studio cameras for newscasts are almost all robotic and driven by automation now.)		Ultimately, you can route any video you want to the return feed. In this case, the operator doesn't really need to use the feature, so he made nice with the TD and they're sending him his hockey game.

And nothing beats a walk off home run in the bottom of the ninth. I like basketball, but each team scores so often it doesn't become incredibly exciting until the very end of the game. And I get annoyed by all of the fouling late in the game. Hockey and soccer to me are basically the same in terms of excitement.

{"body":"It's laughable that this has upvotes. DAE HOCKEY BEST SPORT!? DAE BASEBALL SO BORING!? The excitement isn't just watching people get hits, it's the anticipation of whats going to happen next. There are lots of times where you're hanging on each pitch.  		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJyxzaLNlNw		2013 ALCS Game 2. Bottom of the 8th, bases loaded, 2 outs. Red Sox trail 5-1. What's going to happen next? If he's out, it's pretty much over for the Sox. They'd have to get 4 runs in the 9th to take it to extras. If he hits a home run, they're right back in it. It's extremely nerve wracking. And there's nothing the pitcher can do except throw the next pitch. He can't run/skate around until the time runs out, he can't foul the other team. It's just him vs the batter.		This is why I think that baseball (and football for that matter) are much more exciting than hockey. There are so many more ups and downs in the game and exciting moments. Hockey might be more physical than baseball, but if you ignore the physicality it basically becomes a game of baseball where you can only score by hitting home runs.
