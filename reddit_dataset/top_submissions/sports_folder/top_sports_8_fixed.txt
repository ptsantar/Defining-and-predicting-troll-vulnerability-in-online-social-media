{"body":"This IS a hell of a catch, but why is this fool jumping full-on into the stands? I hate even seeing it in basketball when someone tries to save the ball from going out of bounds by leaping their behemoth bodies straight at fans. Like them making a play is worth more than the safety of the fans seated that are totally not expecting to have Shaq's (or anyone else's) sweaty ass on any part of them. Most of you are probably going to say it's a risk you take for having good seats, but F that. Stay your over paid ass on the field or court, jackass. Edit***His shit eating/"hey mom, see what I did??" grin at the end makes this even more annoying.","depth":0,"score":-10,"ups":-10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"loaf_loaf_loaf","name":"t1_cshm4ju","parent_id":"t3_3azlhe","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1435189828,"created_utc":1435186228}
