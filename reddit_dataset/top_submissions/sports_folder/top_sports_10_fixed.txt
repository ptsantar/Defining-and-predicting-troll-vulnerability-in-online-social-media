{"body":"Yeah, American Football is pretty unique in the sense that we get a break every 5-20 seconds.  Honestly it probably increases the accuracy of penalties.  Very frequently a ref will throw a flag, then after the play deliberate with his fellow refs and then pick up the flag and wave off the penalty.  This happens usually when they don't have a complete view of the offending play.  Say for instance a qb throws a pass to a receiver and the defensive back tackles him before the ball gets there so the ref behind the defensive backs throws a flag.  Well, that pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage, making it legal to tackle the receiver before the ball gets there.  So after discussing it, they will wave off the flag and announce something like "there is no penalty for pass interference on the play, the ball was tipped before contact was made."","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Callmewolverine","name":"t1_cmc3e9k","parent_id":"t1_cmc33qt","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1416874701,"created_utc":1416874701}

Yeah I've seen the goal line replay a few times, they have been doing that in ice hockey as well for years and it's a good system.

In addition, you can never *grab* a guy unless he's a ball carrier you're trying to tackle (that's a holding penalty), although there's some lenience for slight tugging on the line.

Sometimes I think that you can catch better without gloves, but without gloves your hands will probably sting if you catch a bullet pass like that. 		If that pass was a lob, like the quarterback put it up in the air, and he wasn't trying to zing it in like he would a pass over the middle, I'd say someone without gloves could probably make that catch.
