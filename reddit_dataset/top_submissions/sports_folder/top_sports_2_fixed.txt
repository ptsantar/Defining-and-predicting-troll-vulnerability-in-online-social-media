His role was an enforcer, which basically means he was paid to fight other enforcers, so by no means is he a good example of a goal scorer.		The other side of this is the fact that there's much more for a goalie to pay attention to in a normal game situation. Not only would he have to keep track of the puck, but he'd also have to have a general idea of where all of the other 9 skaters without the puck are on the ice, and he'd regularly have to make saves while being screened by opponents as well as his own teammates.		>because of the lighting		This is the only point I can't really argue against. It'd obviously be much easier to see a black puck against white ice in a well lit arena than it would against a dark blue floor on a poorly lit TV set. I still doubt he'd be able to react quick enough to make any saves even if he could see the puck, though.		>You need to take an NHL keeper sized guy with similar hockey experience to use as a control.		Why? The question isn't "is some random 500+lb guy who has never played hockey before better at goaltending than some random normal sized guy who has never played hockey before", it's "why don't NHL teams replace their normal sized goalies that have played hockey for most of their lives with a morbidly obese man".

{"body":"> The other side of this is the fact that there's much more for a goalie to pay attention to in a normal game situation. 		It is still empirically harder to score in a normal game situation than in these one on ones, and easier for a keeper because he can use that info to judge where the puck is likely to go.		> How many 500+lb people have played enough hockey for this to matter at all?		This is relevant because we're trying to see if a 500lb man can be a good keeper. If he can be, then 500lb men would be playing hockey all the time.		You can't try and make philosophical arguments for why the other variables don't matter. Have a look at some of the work by Imre Lakatos on scientific research programs, also see [Mill's methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill%27s_Methods) and probably some Popper and some Khun, mainly Lakatos and Mill though. The problem with what they are doing is they are testing a group of hypothesis, you need to minimise the number of variables. That sport science show is atrocious at experimental setup, I watched 5 or 6 episodes and I've not yet seen one that actually tests what they want to test, even the big fat guy will get better at plugging the net with training, and it's much harder to aim in a moving game state, the guy was probably shooting with the same accuracy as Gretsky would have in a real game.

It's empirically harder to score against very mobile, normal sized goalies in a normal game situation, yes. But against a 500lb goalie with basically no mobility? Obviously there's no empirical evidence because nobody of that size has ever played in the NHL, but odds are he's not going to be good in either situation because he doesn't have the mobility to position himself well enough to make saves.		>You can't try and make philosophical arguments for why the other variables don't matter.		I'm not trying to make a philosophical argument about why the other variables don't matter, I'm making a realistic argument about why the other variables aren't very important because I've watched hockey for 15 years. There's no way they can get the super accurate tests you're looking for without actually having a pro hockey team employ a 500+lb player as their starting goalie.

Three sources told SI they have seen Oiler players use cocaine or marijuana at parties in Edmonton and other NHL cities. One agent quoted an Edmonton player he represents as having told him, "Every time we go into New York City, it's a real blizzard, and I'm not talking about the weather." One of SI's sources, a player for another NHL team, told of having used cocaine with three members of the Oilers during the '85-86 season.

Although I am still a big fan of hockey, and I participate fantasy hockey, I have to say that Gretzky played in a league that is not in comparison to what the league is today. Of course this is my personal opinion, but the NHL has evolved into a much more challenging game all around. From the players, rules, and even the equipment, I would say that Gretzky, in his prime, would not put up the same numbers as he did in the 80's and 90's if he were to play in today's NHL. I didn't look it up, but I believe that Gretzky had at least one 200+ point season. Who the fuck scores that many points nowadays? It's just insane. I would have loved to have Gretzky on my fantasy team. Anyways, none of what I say takes away the fact that he is a legend. Right now, I'm a huge fan of Steven Stamkos. That guy is as consistent as ever. Besides the injury last season, the guy is incredibly reliable.

{"body":"I can see your point.  However, with out body contact in peewees and bantams how will these kids learn?  Peewees is a great time to start contact because you get to learn, but most kids aren't big or strong enough to cause any really damage.  If you start contact in midgets, you have a bunch of kids with adult bodies who don't know anything about proper contact trying to figure it, which would result in more injuries IMO.			You pointed out that there is no contact in house leagues.  If the kid is scared he can play house leagues.  He won't make it far in hockey if he's afraid anyways.  Especially considering that body contact in peewees is actually minimal since everyone is learning to play.  Of course there are exceptions.  I remember this kid,  Bigsby.  He was already 200 pounds in peewees and he didn't really hit you, he slowly crushed you against the boards (haha), but you learn to play through the fear, it's one of the great lessons you learn while playing hockey.		By bantam age, you should know if hockey is the sport for you or not.  Kids who dropped out because didn't want to get killed would be weeded out eventually anyways.

They're not trying to get the puck, they're just trying to fuck up your passing and shooting options (force you to shoot from shitty angles). 		In this clip...the first defensemen didn't make *too* bad of a decision by going after the puck handler, because he knew his other D-man was in a good position, and they weren't out numbered. But then the other D-man really fucked up by attacking the puck handler, when he should have positioned himself **between** the puck handler and the puck handler's teammate. Disrupt their coordination, and let the goalie worry about stopping the shot. If you do your job correctly, the goalie only needs to worry about a shot coming from the original puck handler, and thus, the goalie can cheat and cover that side of the net, instead of the entire net. If you look at the end of the GIF, you will see the goalie shifts from left to center as the puck gets passed. Then he gets scored on on his left side. With the puck being passed to center ice, he had to cover both sides of the net and be ready for a shot coming from all kinds of angles. But if the pass was never allowed, the goalie would have only had to cover the left side of the net.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cnpc03o","parent_id":"t1_cnpbdxy","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1421285929,"created_utc":1421285929}

In the end, synchronicity is probably the single largest factor in the effectiveness of a crew team, which is why it really is one of the most intensely cooperative, team oriented sports out there. 		Think about it this way- when it comes down to it, you are all operating parts of the same apparatus, the boat, and where the hull meets the water, the stability of your overall hydrodynamics is totally a shared effort. If even a single oar or seat is out of rythm, or with a length or force of stroke different (stronger OR weaker) from the rest of the team, it can cost you the race. 		This is as much of an issue with an individually superior athlete as it is with an inferior one, sometimes more so because a teammate who is lagging behind can be encouraged and trained, whereas a top athlete with a bad attitude is much harder to fix. A good set of rowers need to be of one mind and body. This is why a lot of your best crew teams are good friends both on and off the water. It's a shared body language thing.

The discussion is teamwork, and the point is that hockey is *arguably* the most team-oriented game there is when it comes to "buying into" a coach's methods as well as working together as a unit.
