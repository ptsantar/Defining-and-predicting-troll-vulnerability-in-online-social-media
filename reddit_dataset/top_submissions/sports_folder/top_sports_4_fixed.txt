{"body":"Okey this is probably way to late but I'm gonna try and explain why I hate youth football. It might get a little free form but that's just the rage that builds inside me from discussing football drives me mad.		It's so broken down now that scouts come out to games and watch 10 year olds play a silly game of random football, millions are being bet on the backs of teenage boys who shared some initial talent.	Talent flees abroad before they are legally allowed to fuck sometimes, because there is so much potential money in football, all the good young footballers pool into predictable teams with strong youth clubs, it's always the same teams, and it's annoying and stunts overall progression of the game, it's like bigger banks buying up all the small banks (all the talent) and then raising the intrest rate (starting to suck because there is no competition)	It's annoying, 	It destroys talent, 13 year old boys are being bought by huge clubs like manchester U or FCB and get lost in the shuffle, it's much harder arena to develop in, sure some might benefit from it and that's why they do it, but I think overall most youths don't, some require a small pond until they're big fish, I know this is something coaches can't wrap their heads around because all they see is a path for THEM to ride.	Also it's a big ridiculous that we take these 10-15 year old boys and make them work out as if they were pro level MMA athletes, fucking hell they're literally boys, training every day is not something you should be doing unless you are like training to fight literal battles and shit with weapons, these boys are most of the time shit grown ups, look at most footballers today, they come from a proud tradition of training every day and getting their schoolwork done for them by a nerd.	Whatever I just wish we'd let the kids play and maybe not care so much about their skill until they're a little older, it's getting ridiculous is all I'm saying.		Sports were better when there wasn't that much money in it for sure, a fuckton wonkier and random and not as extreme but they were actual people that had lives and liked a sport, instead we put boys into factories and out comes this blank piece of shit that is good at nothing beyong football","depth":3,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vcanka83","name":"t1_ct6wt9w","parent_id":"t1_ct5p8ia","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437165054,"created_utc":1437161454}

{"body":">Not necessarily, most Latino/Hispanics (specifically Mexicans) are some of the most hard working and nicest people that I know		Uh yeah, that's not what we're talking about at all. 		Most of the Hispanics I've interacted with are also very hard working and family oriented people - which is why I largely have respect for Hispanic cultures. 		You made a comment about now knowing what good Blacks feel like when other people are ragging on Black criminality or other shitty behavior. 		Your analogy is that as a Mexican soccer fan, you now understand how it feels to feel the need to distance yourself from and apologize for the negative behavior of some people in your in-group. 		I brought up the idea that I'm surprised by this, because the **fact** Hispanics are the second most criminal group in America and the widespread stereotypes that go along with this - especially in areas where there are large Hispanic populations like the Southwest - would lead me to believe that you should have already had this experience purely from being Mexican and not just a Mexican soccer fan. 		The fact that most Hispanics you and I know are great people, doesn't change the facts of reality. 		So, have you never heard people pissed off about Hispanic criminality or other behaviors before? Is this literally the first time you've been acquainted with this concept? 		Orrrr, as I reread your original comment... 			Were you saying you know what it feels like know to be a Black person experiencing *other* Blacks making apologies for bad black behavior? 		In that case, I suppose you must have never heard a Hispanic apologize for the bad behavior of many Hispanics in order to have never experienced that before. 		That would make sense. I guess Hispanics don't acknowledge the facts of their demographic as much as some Blacks might.","depth":6,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WhyDoBlacksRapeALot","name":"t1_ct624hv","parent_id":"t1_ct61r3f","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437099108,"created_utc":1437095508}

{"body":"Okay, I totally understand what you are saying now.		To answer your original question; whether we are going by the numbers and by the facts or if we are just going from personal experience, it hasn't been until just a month ago where I started having to feel awkward about my heritage.  I am in my 20s and never ever felt more awkward than I have at this moment.		It didn't start until Trump expressed his opinions about Mexico.  At first, I thought it was hilarious.  The reason being is because I knew from personal experience it wasn't further from the truth.  Then I thought about what if he made those same comments about a different race/culture/heritage, how would most people react?  What if he said the same things about the black community?  I think the fact that there is less rage about him targeting a very specific group kind of makes me resent some people.		Then last week the Mexican drug lord escapes out of prison and he/someone creates a Twitter account threatening Trump.  This is where I started initially feeling like, "Ooops, sorry guys".		Finally, I see this today, and well, not a proud day.  Very sad to see.		The short answer to your question, however, would be, no I never heard people being pissed off at the Hispanic/Latino community.  Orrrr...  Maybe I have but because I am from the inside, the Hispanic/Latino community is soooo broad that it is easy to filter out certain groups.

With 58 seconds remaining in an NHL game between the New York Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks at Madison Square Garden, hecklers poured beer and soft drink over the Canucks' bench, causing a five-minute delay; Craig Coxe attempted to retaliate, but was restrained by his teammates and security. One fan, Patrick Nugent, was arrested and another six fans were ejected.[43]		>August 26 ??? A fan threw a Bowie hunting knife at California Angels rookie Wally Joyner at Yankee Stadium; Joyner was hit on his left arm by the butt end of the knife, escaping injury.[45]		http://bleacherreport.com/articles/388192-10-worst-philadelphia-sports-fans-moments		>October 1 ??? During a game between the Cleveland Browns and the Denver Broncos at Cleveland Stadium, officials had the teams switch end zones in the fourth quarter to protect Denver players from batteries and other objects being thrown from the Dawg Pound. The switch put the wind at the Browns' back, and the Browns wound up winning on a field goal that barely cleared the crossbar.[48]		>December 23 ??? With the San Diego Chargers leading 27???17 during the fourth quarter of a game between the New York Giants and the Chargers at Giants Stadium, intoxicated Giants fans threw hundreds of snowballs and chunks of ice at Chargers players and team officials, injuring fifteen people, while Chargers equipment manager Sid Brooks was knocked unconscious (as the NBC broadcast showed him laying injured on the sideline, long snapper David Binn was seen in the background making an obscene gesture and yelling abuse toward the snowball-throwing fans [58]) and had to be removed from the stadium on a stretcher. 15 people were arrested and a further 175 were ejected, with 75 fans having their season tickets revoked.[59]		>	November 22 ??? After having been pelted with snowballs throughout the second half of a game against the Denver Broncos, Charles Woodson of the Oakland Raiders retaliated by throwing a snowball back into the crowd which hit a woman in the face. An arrest warrant was later issued for Woodson. Raiders tackle Lincoln Kennedy later ran into the stands and punched a drunk Broncos fan, who had thrown a snowball at him, in the face. The fan was ejected from the stadium.[65]		>December 16 ??? During an NFL game between the Cleveland Browns and the Jacksonville Jaguars, Browns fans angered by the overturning via instant replay of a referee's call with 48 seconds left in the fourth quarter threw beer bottles, cups and garbage onto the field, with officials as well as players on both teams being hit, resulting in a thirty-minute delay. Initially the game was called, with CBS announcers Gus Johnson and Boomer Esiason???who was with the Cincinnati Bengals when their coach made his "You don't live in Cleveland" speech???highly critical of the fans' conduct and the officials' handling of the incident. At least three Browns fans who attempted to run onto the field to remonstrate with officials were arrested, a number of Browns fans were ejected, and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue later ordered the final 48 seconds to be played.[69]		>May 28 ??? In the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference Finals between the Utah Jazz and the San Antonio Spurs at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Jazz fans gave way to frustration, with most of it aimed at San Antonio Spurs swingman Manu Gin??bili and his flair for drawing fouls. Four technical fouls were called against Utah in the fourth quarter, and Jazz fans threw empty water bottles and garbage onto the court after head coach Jerry Sloan and guard Derek Fisher were both ejected for arguing with officials. After the Spurs won the game 91???79, Jazz fans threw beer cups and garbage at Spurs players and officials, with Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich being forced to rush his team straight into the locker room instead of submitting to post-game interviews.

{"body":"The Town of York was the capital of Upper Canada (Upper and Lower Canada had not joined yet) and during the end of the Battle of York the American troops burned and looted military and civilian proprieties in the city.  The inclusion of civilian property was seen as a mistreatment of the civilian population and considered a violation of the laws of war (by the British), this happened again shortly after in the raid on Port Dover.  This arson/raiding happened mainly as an act of revenge by the soldiers for the timed explosion of Fort York that wounded and crippled the American force (first use of this tactic in military history I believe).  		In retaliation for these two events, in 1814 the town of Washington was captured and occupied by the British and many buildings were burnt including the presidential mansion and the capitol.  Some soldiers committed the same looting and theft of civilian properties, against direct order, and were later punished for this by their superiors.  The sandstone walls of the mansion and the capitol stood (albeit now scorched) but all timbers burned.  In an effort to not have the capital city moved, Washington business men bankrolled the rebuilding efforts and the presidential mansion was rebuilt, repainted and re branded as the White House.","depth":4,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MrE_is_my_father","name":"t1_ct5ykwi","parent_id":"t1_ct5uh6r","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437092412,"created_utc":1437088812}

Now my facts, many people that are illegal pay taxes and don't receive benefits because they well, are illegal. I worked illegally in the USA in 1999 while studying college, I needed the money to buy a computer. I went to Palm Springs during the summer, 122 F, fixings roofs.

My taxes and my check a courtesy from me to you. I agree that Mexicans should stay in Mexico, and that illegals should be all expelled from the USA.

I truly believe that America was founded by honest and hardworking people, but at some point in time, I don't know when, Americans became lazy.

I'm studying a PhD in Engineering in the USA and here it is full of Chinese and Indians, Americans don't like STEM, they only want MBA's and the easy money from Wall Street. That's a truth that you also need to acknowledge.   	   	Edit1: I was totally wrong, STEM interest among American citizens is excellent. There is no need to promote it and raise awareness about the lack of American students in those fields because my point of view was totally biased.

Just to simply say yeah those are shitty people but didn't mean everyone is. To a lot of Mexicans soccer is one of the few thing the people have going for them. So soccer is one of the most held treasures to them, and that passion and love for the have can sometimes cause people to act irrational especially under the influence of alcohol. I will admit that Mexican fans do this more than others but don't hate a nation for what drunk fans do. There are many other Mexicans that feel the same as you and I believe that those who do such as actions should be punished.
