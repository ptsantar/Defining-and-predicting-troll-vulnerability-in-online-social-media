{"body":"There's a lot of variables in that equation. But basically, the slope gives the player more room for error. That particular hole location is in somewhat of a gulley. So if he were to land his ball either halfway up the slope or at the very top (as he did), the ball would settle in roughly the same location. That, on top of the downslope between the player and hole (which would be the path of a more traditional shot) demanding a lot more accuracy for him to get the ball to settle at the hole from that particular angle.

Anyway, the reason you can't go straight for it sometimes is because how the greens are sloped. It was probably easier to play that slope like a backboard and have the ball nestle close as opposed to playing a straight line and trying to stop the ball on a downhill slope.
