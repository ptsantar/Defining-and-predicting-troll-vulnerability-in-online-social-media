{"body":"I do think at least part of the reason for generic commentary from players and coaches is to keep strategy close to the chest, at least in playoff time when adjustments are made every game.  It'd be a little unusual if, say, in the NBA 2014 finals, a reporter asked "Pop, what are you going to do?"  And he replied:		"We're actually going to guard Lebron straight up 1 on 1 this year and let him score around 28 points a game so long as we can control where on the floor he's scoring from, and with that allowance, we're going to stay home on shooters at all times and force them into contested shots and risky passes.  Last year Lebron was allowed to shift between distributor and scorer as the team needed.  This year we're making him choose the latter--if Lebron can't collapse the defense, they'll have a hard time creating good shots and finding open players since they're weak at the point guard position and lost some of their shooting depth.		"Then on offense, we know they're going to blitz our pick and rolls, and try to be more athletic, but we're betting that in their fourth consecutive finals trip, they're a step slower than they used to be, so we're going to beat those blitzes with ball movement from all five positions, similar to what we tried last year.  It caused us a lot of turnovers, but we're adding Boris Diaw into the fold along with more shooters, and we've been developing Kawhi as a ball handler and scoring threat throughout the regular season, so they won't be able to rotate their defense effectively without a level of athleticism we're thinking they don't have."

{"body":"ESPN IS ???PILING ON??? - - -  In football, it comes with a 15 yard penalty. The guilty party, feeling a need to show his might and add an exclamation point to a play, ends up making himself and those around him look like undisciplined dunderheads. I???m not an FSU grad and I don???t have any family who went there. However, I have to speak out in support of that institution and a football program that is the envy of many and rightly so. The recent rants by sports analysts, talking heads and the center of the sports media universe, ESPN, has hardened my view of what is right and wrong. In my opinion, these latter-day ???me too??? guys, seem to be quite uninformed in presenting facts and assigning blame on incidents involving Jameis Winston at the school. While the facts clearly have been published and have not been disproven, these ???me too??? guys want to add their exclamation point to a story to make themselves one of the heroes in making the stop. In this case, they are showing what they truly are, plagiarists of ideas and falsehoods that do nothing but bring shame and dishonor to themselves. It seems that the ESPN staff doesn???t want facts to get in the way of their new crusade. A good journalist, uncovers the real facts whether it be in sports, politics or world events. I as a self proclaimed avid college sports referee give them a 15 yard penalty for piling on, another 15 yards for a personal foul and 15 more yards for un-sportsman like conduct.
