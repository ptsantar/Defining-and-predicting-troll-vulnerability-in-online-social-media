{"body":"The thing is, grounds don't matter any more because this is probably just the work of some hobbiest.		Coke has a huge legal staff. It doesn't matter if they know they can't win in the long run, they can still destroy his life if they chose. They can litigate until the end of time, they can challenge any verdict and move up another level in the legal system.		The bottom line is, joke or parody, slander or whatever. If coke wants to drag someone through the legal dirt for the next 10 years they can. The stress and the court dates and the impact on his family/friends would be enough to make him want to wash his hands from this.		[source]		I was dragged through the court system by an ex-employer for something they knew they could NEVER win. They went after me for doing work for a client on the side, stating I had signed a non-compete (true). The work was for lawncare, I'm in I.T....  and the client was a family friend. I won, they didn't get a dime. But I had to go to court 4 times, I had to miss 4 days of work to attend, and I had to seek legal council several times just to decipher the notices they were sending me. Even without having to pay my lawyer (they had to pay my legal as well) it still cost me a huge amount of money and time. I lost days of work (4 court dates, and 4 days before each date to go through things with my lawyer) along with the fact that, although they had to pay my legal fees, they had 6 months to do so. Meanwhile I had to front the legal bill.		TL;DR My ex-boss hated me so much after I quit he tried to sue me for mowing my neighbours lawn.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Vyper28","name":"t1_crhock1","parent_id":"t1_crhksku","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432323425,"created_utc":1432319825}

So no, in this case you can't "sue the fuck out of someone to eliminate them". 		That isn't to say a version of your warped view of the legal system can't happen. In reality this happens when there is a factually intensive issue, such as a patent case. Say a small inventor sues big company or the other way around. Cases like these need a lot of expert testimony, large amounts of discovery, lots of depositions, etc etc to get the facts of the case established before the law can be applied to those facts. A big company has the funds to defend and counter, the small guy does not, so it usually gets settled out of court (a good film depicting this kind of case is called "flash of genius", I highly recommend it). This case has one person to depo, one image to discover, and would be founded on a legally tenuous argument that is based on no actual law I have ever seen (to clarify I have studied slander and libel thoroughly but the perversion /u/telnor proposed is just plain wrong), so the likelihood that the artist would get "thumbed into the ground" is pretty much nil.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SMELLS_LIKE_FARTS","name":"t1_crhjmtn","parent_id":"t1_crhj8ob","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432315815,"created_utc":1432312215}

{"body":">So you're saying that if health care is free people will use it enough that it will fall part and the government will be unable to fund it?		Basically, yes.  You'll need more and more taxes to fund it, and eventually even that won't do, because past a certain point of tax hikes, and you won't be raising revenue, you'll be depressing economic activity.  The government's bureaucracy is susceptible to industry capture and favorable treatment, bureaucrats and politicians will do business with their favored corporations out of political need, rather than on what's best for our healthcare.  They don't face competition, either, which means that you're depending on one source (the government) to come up with good, cost-saving ideas *and then implementing them*.		>You could just have unconditional government insurance, or something along those lines.		A voucher system where the government pays would be preferable, because at least that encourages customers to shop around, but even then I'm skeptical that would control costs.  What stops a system like that from simply doing what colleges do, and raising prices because *they know* they will get their money from the state?  Hell, if the government simply pays for it, what's *your* incentive to be thrifty and efficient with it?  You're getting it just for existing, not because you spent 40 hours working hard last week.		The limits of individual wealth are *what force* providers to be efficient.  If you don't have enough money for something, then to get at it the provider *has* to lower prices.  Sometimes they can't, but at least they have a systemic, built-in, real-world incentive to keep trying.  Lower-prices beat the other guy, and win YOUR dollar.		Again, you're arguing that the government has the power to grant everyone free healthcare, and *it doesn't*.  The reason healthcare isn't free is the same reason nothing else is free:  Because we live in a world with finite resources.  Our policy should reflect that.  The government is not God.

I'm going to assume that you meant "fee," not "free," but you are nonetheless accurate.

With decentralized institutions competing for your dollar and patronage, they are.		>It's only free in the same way public education is free.		And public education has had per-pupil costs rising at faster than the rate of inflation with nothing to show for it.  Student scores have been stagnant for 40 years.		>As far as the voucher system goes, I think the price rises you're talking about already happen.		Agreed, but that's because we have *the worst* parts of public and private systems.		>Pharmaceutical companies at least already have basically guaranteed income. 		Right... but that's a problem, not a benefit.  They have guaranteed income because of government policy and favorable treatment by regulatory bodies.  They're not all evil or bad, though, the best medicines and new medical technologies are overwhelmingly born from the United States... because the United States is the only place where companies can expect a return on the capital they invest in R&D.		>Many people have insurance, and people are willing to pay very high prices for medicine they need to live.		People have insurance because it's mandatory, or because the government has incentivized employers to provide it via the Employer Healthcare Tax Credit (I personally think this is the single most distortionate government policy on the books, pertaining to healthcare, anyways).  They shouldn't have insurance that covers everything and the kitchen sink, because that isn't insurance.  Comprehensive health insurance is less "health insurance" and more "extended warranty for humans."  Catastrophic health insurance is *actually insurance*.		The entire concept of insurance is to buy, together, into a fund that represents our shared risk against **uncertain** losses.  When you use health insurance to pay for **certain** losses, IE "going to the doctor" or "I broke my arm," you're just exploding the cost.  Your insurer doesn't save money the same way you do, your insurer saves money by negotiating bulk care contracts with hospitals.  If you break your arm or want a doctor's checkup, you should shop around.  This would drive prices down as providers competed with eachother to do it, and it would allow consumers to decide for themselves what they need.		Will some people overlook tests they might need?  Yeah, sure.  You won't solve that problem by nationalizing health insurance, but you might blow costs through the roof by requiring a bevy of tests for even minimal issues -- which is sort of what Obamacare already requires.  At that point you're squandering wealth and sequestering it away from *other* parts of society that would ALSO have tangible impacts on our standards of living.		>Also, I don't really buy that the U.S. Government couldn't pull universal healthcare off, just because many other countries already have it, or at least something close to it.  If france can pull it off, we can too, right?		France isn't inventing 20 of the top 27 medical innovations of the last 40 years.  France doesn't have more Nobel Prize winners than the EU, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Japan *combined* over the last 40 years.  France also doesn't spend more than the rest of the world combined to have a massive military sphere of influence that guarantees the security of all of Western Civilization, either.		They *enjoy* those benefits.  They don't research new medicines, they receive medicines from those who do and put price controls on them.  They *enjoy* the protection and tranquility afforded to them by the U.S. military, and they don't pay a fucking dime for it.  		That's why they can spend a not insignificant part of their budget on free healthcare for their citizens, and even then, how long will they be able to?  Europe's healthcare costs are rising faster than ours are, and their economy is not exactly the envy of the world right now.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cantletthatstand","name":"t1_cri8qbi","parent_id":"t1_cri81re","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432366445,"created_utc":1432362845}

You're right, no one is literally forcing you to work against your will. They are, however, stacking the odds so that if you don't "choose to work" you will very likely starve to death. They are also not providing you with the skills or knowledge to survive in a natural environment. It's like declawing and domesticating an animal and then throwing it back into the wild.

The live off the land argument may have flown before the era of globalization and before our societies made a point to spend centuries eradicating and/or marginalizing all the self-sufficient native communities on the planet. Many human communities use to be self sufficient until manifest destiny and colonization and globalization and world trade. Now every community is interdependent on the rest in a complicated and increasingly strained system. Why is everything getting more expensive? Because each country focuses on a few select products to export and has to rely on other countries for the rest of their basic needs. That is the best way to maximize profit in a global economy. Specialize. But then it creates the reality that the cost of food is also tied to the cost of gasoline (which fuels the machines that transport the food) as well as many other factors which cause inflation. 			I find it strange when people tell others who criticize a flawed system to go fuck off into the woods. It's seems like more of a defensive knee-jerk reaction than a logical approach to greater societal issues.

You have to understand why companies like coca cola are spending so much to advertise in the world cup. It is not to inform how great their product is, or to reach new markets. 		Coke's primary objective here is to maintain relevance as the dominant desirable fizzy product. They need people to think they are current and that drinking coke is the 'cool' thing to do. Most recently, the public has become more concerned with company ethics (see organics, ethically sourced labor, sustainable manufacturing, etc...), and thus coke will need to adapt its company image to fit this new definition. They should be very afraid of becoming known as that company which codoned slavery and ruining that precious corporate image in which they have spent billions to cultivate.

That's great and all, but how is it Coca-Cola, McDonald's, or any other companies fault, let alone how does it say they support slavery or right abuses? They help fund and support FIFA, that's it. Its hardly FIFA's fault, either; as I understand it, they say "Hey, we want to have the 20## world cup in your country, can you make this happen?", and if the government agrees, FIFA pays for the cost (or helps?) and the government hires a company to build it (if one is not already available). FIFA isn't hiring slave workers, and it sure as hell isn't Coca-Cola or McDonald's or any other FIFA sponsor that's hiring them to work like this. Coca-Cola, at the least, has done a LOT for countries like these, and has given back to them by distributing immensely cheaper and/or free drinks to those who want/need it, given free phone minutes to those who need to talk to their families, etc...

Slavery - Pretty much what private prisons and a number of state prisons are		mistreatment of women - Our entire fucked up legal system is basically "legitimized" mistreatment of the citizens at large.		other forms of suppression - Yea ok.

We put everyone in prison rather than try to solve problems. You think the US isn't rife with cultural injustice? Look at all the people that live in slums and the poverty-ridden parts of cities.

Since FIFA isn't doing much to address these issues (similar concerns were brought up during the last world cup in Brazil, but we soon forgot about the issues because it was an incredibly entertaining event).

{"body":"I think it warrants drawing some attention to the extravagant, contemptuous malfeasance that saw FIFA award said world cup to Qatar. Fifa's stated mandate of making a 'strategic' decision on Qatar based on expanding the profile of the game in the region?...Qatar barely tally's a million permanent residents as I recall (give or take) so that points moot. To win by pitching their plan to erect space age climate controlled stadia which seem to defy modern engineering conventions just make it sound like an old Simpsons episode. (The monorail episode seems analogous here). So Sepp and his boys 'get paid' whilst the actual Football world is aghast at the prospect of fronting up to play the games showpiece in sauna conditions for no valid reason (other than graft and corruption). The key difference between Sepp Blatter and Robert Mugabe is that Sepp seems to always have greased the right wheels during his tyrannous racket. On the context that the whole event was assigned on the basis of exploiting peoples good graces (every player, every fan outside of Qatar) for blatant personal gain..... I think all the well meaning folk (myself included) pouring scorn on Coke's indifference to human concerns, are pissing in the wind if we think they are even capable of processing  humanities plight on a genuine level. Sadly, capitalism still has a lot to answer for.... I mean I've never been to Atlanta, but my daily diet of American TV paints it largely as an objective of derision (working class, lacking in any notable merit). If Coke could just make some calls and get the Olympics Games awarded to Atlanta, despite the States already being grossly over-represented as Olympic hosts in terms of frequency - then nothing is beyond them. Maybe the charge sheet should amended from 'culpable negligence re inhumane practices'  to 'complicitous from day dot'. Lets be honest. Who's making the money....Qatar won't make dime on broadcast rights. So their ticket sales wont even cover the cost of pulling the 8 new stadiums down straight after the world cup let alone the cost if building the things and I dont buy the 'tourism' angle. Oil Sheiks didnt get rich by being stupid.

Any worker can be replaced, there are thousands others coming to Qatar. The Qatari Population is 12% native and the rest is Migrant Workers. The Qatari government have a ministry on it's own called "Ministry of Labour Work" dedicated completely to oversee migrant workers. The Qatari government is extremely rich, they are money spenders, they do not cheap away from technology or future development, plus they are highly traditional people. And they hold extreme pride in their culture. The noble among them is the one with Good Traits, and self-respect. And culturally, they are primed to be noble.  They deeply believe that, it is implemented in their core-belief. Nobility is considered from them and within them (without undermining other nobility). Each respects his own. Their religion tells them to be merciful with the weak, and encourages them to treat the needy with charity. They are famously known for "generosity". They teach their kids at elementary school the exemplary figures of nobleman who lived the Arab Peninsula, the noble one among them was the most generous. One popular figure who lived a thousand years ago, named Hatim al-Tai, who was blessed with a big fortune, he was extremely rich. For years, he used to start a camp fire at night to attract travelers crossing the desert, and he would welcome them for a dinner meal, just purely out of generosity. Once he met a group of starving strangers crossing the desert, and he sacrificed his precious horse in order to feed them dinner. And he did it without letting those strangers know this horse was the only thing he had left to own, he made those strangers believe that horse was not important to him. So examples like that, are what the Qatari look up to, they are good people. Who currently at the moment are being misjudged wrongly.
