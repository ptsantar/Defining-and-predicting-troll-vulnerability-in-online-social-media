{"body":"This aint boot camp. Its a big game of tic tac toe. The dude  could clearly see he put a piece on top, then the bottom. His turn again, because it means he didnt lose yet, hey lets put that piece in the middle to finish the line! 		They were astronomically retarded. Dont act like nobody could do it, its much more accurate to say pretty much anyone else could have played and won but either of them. It wasnt that fast or stressful, and seriously the pieces are big and distinct enough to see them and know where the fuck to put them. Its impossible to remember what piece you are when all your pieces are right in front of you to pick up, all the way on the opposite side of your opponent, so its impossible to mix them up.		Fucking up that bad in tic tac to, even at some live event, is not hard. I live in vegas, i see shit like this every single weekend. Tourists and locals alike have no problem being on stage. I was whipped and stripped on stage at a bourlesque show and i could keep up with all the women around me.		The people that play carnival-like games at live outdoor events with crowds of people watching dont fuck up so badly either, not unless they are clearly severely disabled.		Again, this shit is NOTHING like bootcamp, the analogy dkesn't work at all.		Its like saying "Of course that man would cry from scraping his knee!

{"body":"The point of my comment  (which was originally incorrect and has been edited to be correct) was that Center start of corner start for X are pretty much the same result regardless of their options because competant players will know all of the ways to win from either start.		So really either start is equally silly because tic tac toe is a solved game.		However, as you pointed out both starts have their advantages. 		Corner start for X means that O has to go center or lose, but after that move O has more move options that are safe.		Conversely a center start for X gives O more options for safe plays on the first turn, but as you pointed out, if X responds properly O's second move is then decided for them or they lose. So assuming both players are inexperienced, a corner start for X means a higher chance of O losing on the first move, and a center start for X means a higher chance of O losing on the second move, just based on the number options available to them.		And ultimately, nobody wants to be O because your odds of winning the game are inherently lower than Xs just because all of your moves except the first are responses and it's impossible to take control of the game unless X messes up.		**TL;DR Tic Tac Toe is stupid, why do people even bother playing it?**","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"paragonofcynicism","name":"t1_crledht","parent_id":"t1_crlckpi","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432658141,"created_utc":1432654541}

It *is* factual, however it is NOT concise.  It is also misleading in that it is incomplete.  		This statement could lead one to believe that in order to not lose, two conditions must be met:		1.  You must go first.	2.  You must make optimal choices.		Statement 1 is the only thing I take issue with.  You do NOT have to go first in order to be guaranteed to not lose.  		Tic Tac Toe is strictly a two player game.  BOTH players are guaranteed to NOT LOSE  if they make optimal choices.		It seems odd to me that you would say "If you go first you can't lose."  as well as  "If you go first and make optimal choices you can't lose."		It is weird to me that you would include the "go first" stipulation at all.  		A way to evaluate a phrase for correctness is to replace it's components with other things.  		Let's replace "go first" with "have two hands".	Let's replace "can't lose" with "should go to jail".  	Let's replace "make optimal choices" with "molest children".		Original phrase:		*If you go first, you can't lose.*		New phrase:		**If you have two hands, you should go to jail.**		Neither of these phrases are correct.		*If you go first and make optimal choices, you can't lose.*		**If you have two hands and molest children, you should go to jail.**	 	Well, okay, you're right I guess, but having two hands/going first is a trivial fact and doesn't lead to the conclusion.		*If you make optimal choices, you can't lose.*		**If you molest children, you should go to jail.**		This is the correct assertion.			Here's what it boils down to: You keep mentioning going first.  WHY does going first matter at all?  This is what I was originally responding to.  It was only *after* I responded that you said anything about making optimal choices.  		If you go second, and make optimal choices, you still won't lose.  Just like if you go first.","depth":12,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ichbineindonut","name":"t1_crm54em","parent_id":"t1_crm1pgf","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432701780,"created_utc":1432698180}

Like I know these two guys are boofs, but there is no strategy to tic-tac-toe besides tying, IF the other opponent is also aware that tic-tac-toe can only really ever be a tie; the only way you WIN is if the opponent makes a mistake. If each person always plays the most rational move, which is extremely easy to identify, then it's always a tie.		Again I realize these two had opportunities to win because they BOTH made mistakes, but to all those arguing about what your strategy would've been...it's pointless, you're best strategy pitted against another non mentally retarded person's would always equal a tie.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TzucciMane","name":"t1_crlqz90","parent_id":"t3_37b8zm","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432677674,"created_utc":1432674074}
