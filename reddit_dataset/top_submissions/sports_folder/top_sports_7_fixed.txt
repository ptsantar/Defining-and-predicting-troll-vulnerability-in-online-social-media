{"body":"German here,	Yes, although the two in this video are competing at an amateur level, they both seem very skilled and have a lot of promise to make it to the pros. The player on the left has an amazing NRP (Neck Rotation Percentage) which is very useful in the sport, but as you can see it's overcome by the sheer dexterity and speed of the player on the right. I was also impressed with the player on the right making the dive grab, which is essentially what you saw him do when his head came into contact with the ball before it even hit his side of the table. This is a risky move because if it fails, the other player is automatically awarded a Service point at the beginning of the next round, which might not seem like a lot, but it can really go against you in a competitive game like this where every point counts.

Wegner in der Wesch, einem Freibad in Kaiserslautern, erfunden. Da der Fu??ballplatz belegt war, die Tischtennisplatte aber frei, fing man an, den Ball nur mit dem Kopf ??ber das Netz zu spielen. Im Rahmen seines Sportstudiums entwickelte er dann zusammen mit seinem Kommilitonen Felix Weins ab 2007 die Idee weiter. Nach der Aufnahme von Headis im Jahr 2008 ins Programm des Hochschulsports der Uni Saarbr??cken breitete sich die Sportart in Deutschland aus. Headis wurde bereits mehrfach in Zeitungsartikeln und Fernsehbeitr??gen ??ber Headis berichtet und im Februar 2010 als Finalist beim weltweit gr????ten Start-Up Wettbewerb der Sportartikelindustrie, dem ispo brandnew Award, in M??nchen geehrt.
