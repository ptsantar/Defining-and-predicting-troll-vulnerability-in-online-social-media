Because you could reintroduce the patients own Hematopoetic (blood producing) cells which they mentioned, except with them being modified to have the CCR5 co-receptor deletion (??32) which is needed for HIV to attach and replicate.

{"body":"Hard to say what caused it. Some of RA can be attributed to genetic predisposition, for example MHC genes and an enzyme expressed in T cells (Ptpn22), but there are other known and unknown factors.		MHC is a protein that is shaped like a hot dog bun and is the most variable family of proteins between different humans. The function of MHC is to "show" bits of viruses, bacteria, and other foreign proteins to T cells (we call these peptides, which are strings of amino acids) . These peptides are like the hot dog in the bun and T cells have proteins that recognize the combination of the hot dog and the bun. This recognitions triggers an immune response. The variants of the bun between different humans bind different peptides (one variant might bind peptide A but not B and another variant might bind B but not A). There are a few common variants associated with RA and it is hypothesized that these variants bind different peptides that contributes to RA.		"Hot dogs" from your own proteins also bind to the buns, but your T cells are supposed be ignorant of these. First, T cells that are react too strongly to them are supposed to die, we call this negative selection, during their development in the thymus. Secondly, T cell activity is controlled by variety of enzymes. Some of these enzymes promote activity, while others limit activity. One type of enzyme is called a phosphatase and removes phosphate from an amino acid.  Ptpn22 found to be mutated in some patients with RA. Ptpn22 is involved in controlling T cell activity, but it is not yet known exactly how the mutations in this gene affect its function.  Ptpn22 is also associated with other autoimmune diseases including Type 1 diabetes.		Essentially, the simplest hypothesis for autoimmune disease is that a combination of factors affect which (or how or how much) peptides are in the hot dog bun and how your immune cells respond to this. From there it is unfortunately a snowball effect where each part can make the other worse.		There are definitely more possibilities, but I'm a bit out of the loop on RA associated genetics.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"notofthetops","name":"t1_cnj70lr","parent_id":"t1_cnj14jw","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420779805,"created_utc":1420779805}
{"body":"The short answer is that we don't really know what caused it.		The long answer is that out immune systems play probability games and that sometimes we lose. Our immune system has the awesome ability to identify and attack virtually any possible protein. Unfortunately this also means out immune systems have the ability to attack ourselves. We have several mechanisms to prevent this.		 Our first defense is the thymus. Before we let t-cells (adaptive immune cells) out to do their job, they have to pass a test. They go to the thymus where they are given all sorts of prices of our own proteins. If they decide to attack them those proteins, the cells are killed. At the same time, we only let cells out that at least show interest in the proteins. This ensures that only functioning cells make it out.		Our second defense is that t cells require two signals to attack. They require a protein that they recognize, but also some signs of stress or infection. 		What we think happens in autoimmune disease is that there is a sort of perfect storm. Maybe a person has been infected with a virus, so that cells that normally would not pass the second test now can. The wrong cell in the wrong place at the wrong time, but once that cell divides and picks up momentum, it is hard to stop because now it is causing enough stress to avoid the second defense.		The tricky part here is that that "perfect storm" hasn't really been observed. An infection seems like a reasonable first cause of autoimmunity, but no viruses have been shown to be conclusively related, so for all we really know, it could have just been a bad burrito.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kelny","name":"t1_cnjyybf","parent_id":"t1_cnj14jw","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420844528,"created_utc":1420844528}

{"body":"Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease, not a gluten intolerance (which has not been proven to exist, to the best of my knowledge). It is nothing like lactose intolerance. 		Lactose is a disaccharide. This means two sugars (molecules). An intolerance to lactose is based on how the small bowel is able to break down and digest these sugars. This is not an allergic or autoimmune response. It is not genetic. There's no lactose intolerance gene. It is broken down in the small bowel by an enzyme called lactase. This is an enzymatic deficiency,and considered relatively mild.		Gluten is completely different. It is a protein existing in certain grains (Wheat, rye, barley, oats.) It's not a sugar molecule. In coeliac disease, which is associated with certain genetic haplotypes, the response to gluten is *autoimmune*. The body responds to it as though it were poison, not a difficult-to-break-down sugar. One of the ways coeliac disease is diagnosed is through a biopsy after a "gluten challenge" to see whether there is any breakdown of the "vilious architecture", which is to say the lining of the small bowel. One of the reasons that coeliac disease can have drastic systemic consequences is because of this damage to the small bowel, which causes serious malabsorption.		Lactose intolerance will *never* do this. Disinformation about gluten in recent times is leading to a view of it as a *sensitivity* for many people (suddenly..) rather than an *allergy* for people with auto-immune disease (i.e. in hospitality industry *and* the community. 		Please don't say stuff about gluten in public forums if you do not know what it is; it can and does impact on people with medical illness. The more disinformation there is, the less understanding there is. People may overlook gluten in food served to coeliacs imagining it is just a matter of a slightly sensitive stomach and no big deal.		People *can* have difficulty digesting wheat products based on enzymes. Wheat and rye products contain moleculular chains called fructans.These have chains of fructose molecules with a glucose molecule at the end, and may represent a source of digestive difficulty. That's not gluten, not an allergy, and not genetic. 		I'm not sure I understand the other stuff you were trying to say. Phagocytes for instance..

{"body":"And high saturated fats, low omega 3s is huge.		I can't find the full text but this is an overview of the study:		>Beginning in 1949, he enrolled 150 MS patients and commenced them on his MS diet, a very low saturated fat diet.3 He followed them with meticulous examination and **recording of their dietary fat consumption for 34 years**. There was no control group who had normal diets, however many of the patients were unable to stick to the MS diet, allowing comparison between those that did and those that did not. There are also data on relapse rates in MS from many other studies. The study was supported by grants from the MS Society of Canada, the Montreal Neurological Institute, the Department of Health and Welfare of Canada, the MS Society of Portland and other grants. This was a major piece of medical research.		>A number of papers resulted from this study, one in one of the world???s premier medical journals, the Lancet in 1990,3 and another in Nutrition in 1991.4 The results provide enormous hope to people with MS.		>The paper in the Lancet reported results for 144 patients. Of these, **72 patients were able to stick to the MS diet (good dieters)**, that is they consumed less than 20g/day of saturated fat. **The other 72 could not keep fat consumption below 20g/day**. The patients??? neurological disability was graded using a neurological disability scale devised by Swank, which went from 0 (essentially unimpaired) to 6 (deceased). Point 4 on the scale represented wheelchair needed, and point 5 confined to bed and chair. Swank???s scale essentially used 2 points on Kurtzke???s EDSS scale to every 1 point on his.		The results were dramatic. **Regardless of level of disability at entry to the trial, good dieters did not deteriorate significantly. Good dieters at level 1 on entry had an average final grade of 1.9 34 years later.** Good dieters at level 2 had a final level of 3.6, and those at level 3 or worse a final level of 4. The results were best for those **who started with minimum disability, with 95 per cent surviving and still physically active 34 years later,** excluding those who died from non-MS diseases. The benefits occurred in all three groups, and even people with significant disability were shown to markedly slow the progression of the disease if they could stick to the MS diet. The picture for poor dieters was terrible, in line with results from other series of MS patients whose conditions have been monitored over time. **Poor dieters with minimum disability at entry ended with average grade of 5.3, that is wheelchair and bed bound.** Those with moderate disability ended up at 5.3 also, and those with severe disability at 5.6. **Only 7 per cent of patients who did not stick to the MS diet remained active. The death rate amongst the poor dieters was extremely high.** 58 of the 72 were dead by 34 years, 45 from MS-related causes. The statistics were very strong. The p values were generally of the order of p<0.0001 to <0.0005 for most of the differences between good and poor dieters. That is, the difference was extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance.		Swank noted that patients who adhered to the diet for MS actually consumed 16g of saturated fat per day on average, whereas those who did not adhere to the diet for MS consumed 38g/day.

{"body":"Before any type of treatment can be made widely available, it's efficacy and safety must be proved.

I'm not exactly sure what phase this trial was, but it is either I or II and although it looks promising the long term effects simply are not definitively known yet.

Something not widely known is this, the federal government covers the cost of Phase I and Phase II trials.   Phase III trials are usually paid for by pharmaceutical companies.  Let's put it this way....Tysabri was $20,000 a month as billed to my insurance company.  Most MS medications are $8,000-$20,000/month as billed to the insurance company.  A one time treatment that cost $40,000 ended up costing the pharmaceutical companies a great deal of money over time.  (This was at John Hopkins using cyclophosamide which is a chemotherapy that was patented in 1970).  NO PHARMACUETICAL company wanted to touch it,, at the end of the day they are a business.  If they can't make more money they aren't going to put in the money for research and development.  My insurance company is the reason I even received the treatment.  They were spending $60,000 every three months.  I was on Novantrone and plasma apheresis.  Additional therapies after treatment weren't allowed for six months.  (Other than life saving).  Therefore my insurance company ended up shelling out money on an experimental treatment to avoid the cost of $120,000.  They saved $80,000. The treatment I received lost funding in 2009 after completion of Phase II despite the fact that I was in remission.  This one sounds slightly better because they eradicate the immune system totally, mine they brought levels down to 0 before they started Nuepogen, stem cells were protected by a protein but the whole miracle cure thing is correct.

{"body":"Almost certainly, although the specific therapies may have to be changed depending on the exact nature of the disease. Autoimmunity occurs because the immune system's targeting mechanisms are failing to distinguish self from non-self for whatever reason. This does not happen instantaneously - these cells have to be "educated" against the affected tissue (in the case of MS, myelin sheaths). This part of the immune system includes a positive feedback loop, which means that the effect will be aggravated until the stimulus is gone. This works for normal pathogens - after all, you want your immune system to go all out when dealing with a virus or infectious bacterial species. However, the stimulus in the case of autoimmunity is the body itself, which means that the body will continually destroy itself.		But as I mentioned earlier, these cells are educated (or "indoctrinated" if you wish for a superior analogy) to attack the body's own cells by positive feedback signaling. There are naive populations of hematopoetic cells in your bone marrow (and other locations, but bone marrow is the best studied), but they too quickly become indoctrinated by the matured cells attacking the body. Thus, the solution is fairly simple. The naive cells are extracted from the patient and stored for later. All indoctrinated immune cells are destroyed via chemotherapy. The stored naive cells are transplanted back into the patient, where they are no longer primed for destroying the body's cells by errant immune cells, since those are all dead. Thus the immune system is repopulated.		The advantage of this therapy is that because it is autologous (same source), there is no need to find a matching donor and there is no risk of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). However, any therapy that kills off the entire immune system, however briefly, leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infection. Additionally, because the "old guard" is gone, the immune system's memory may very well be gone with it if the memory cells have been killed, meaning that all the vaccinations and prior infections the patient had before chemotherapy may be rendered useless and re-vaccinating may be less efficient due to age or the stress endured by the body. Make no mistake: even though it uses rather advanced immunological and stem cell biological knowledge, this technique is a very blunt instrument. Research is being done to develop methods by which the immune memory can be preserved or replenished after therapy.","depth":1,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"onlymadethistoargue","name":"t1_cnirhtz","parent_id":"t1_cniofsp","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420751591,"created_utc":1420751591}

{"body":"My father had a version of this procedure done around 1997 in Seattle (I believe the researchers were with UW) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to treat his Chronic-Progressive MS. They harvested stem cells from his bone marrow and then gave him high does chemo before reintroducing the stem cells back into his blood stream. A stem-cell transplant, and as far as I can tell from the article, it is the exact same procedure described here.		The process was very arduous due to chemo sickness, and since the patients were housed nearby each other we learned that several of the patients died as a result of complications from being immuno-suppressed (they got infections). As described in the article, insurance refused any coverage and my parents paid $145k out of pocket to try to save my dad from MS.		Now, I don't want to discourage anyone with MS, like many others I am hopeful that someday MS can be completely cured. In my father's case, after initially appearing to have had a halt in new symptoms and plaque sites, after several years his disease returned and progressed, eventually leaving him functionally a quadriplegic. He died in 2009 (12 years or so post procedure) from Leukemia that may have been brought on by the chemo treatments he received. In general, for a man with Chronic-Progressive MS, he lived longer than average with his diagnosis, but the stem-cell transplant did not cure him.		My point in relating this personal (and anecdotal story) is just to say that this procedure has been around at least a decade before this study, Also, this is a small study and over a short period of time. Hopefully with more research it can lead to an actual cure for MS, but don't forget, much more work probably needs to go into it for that to become a reality.

{"body":"Hi guys. I'm a second year medical student who has some prior experience with some of this stuff. I'm by no means an expert, but I'd love to lay some things out there for anyone who is interested!		**How/why Does This Work:**	Very briefly, there is a portion of your immune system that is termed the "adaptive immune system." It is called this because it responds ("adapts") to infectious invaders in a way unique to each invader. For example, certain types defenses would be better to develop and use against a strep throat infection (IgA antibodies for the curious) vs others that would be better to use against a leprosy infection (CD8 cell-mediated cytotoxicity for the curious).	Your adaptive immune system is the part of the immune system that orchestrates a unique response to each different foreign invader your body encounters, and very importantly, **it remembers how it responded**. By remembering how it responded to a certain invader in the past, the adaptive immune system makes sure to keep that type of response in "stockpile" so that if your body ever encounters that same invader again, your body can fight back really strongly from the get go. **This is why you generally don't get infected with the same pathogen more than once,** with some exceptions of course. This is also how vaccinations prevent/lower the intensity of future infection.		*Why does this matter for autoimmune diseases like MS?*	The theory is that in autoimmune diseases, your adaptive immune system, for whatever reason, has developed a specific weapon against one of your normal tissues in your own body. Your adaptive immune system "thinks" it has a constant infection on its hands, and is trying to eliminate it. So really, your adaptive immune system has made a huge mistake and the patient has to deal with a terrible disease.  		*Why does your adaptive immune system develop an immune response against your own tissue in the first place?*	There are several theories for this, but suffice to say that **something at some point in time pushed your adaptive immune system into an error in which it targets your own tissues. Because the adaptive immune system always remembers what it has targetted in the past, from the point of the error onwards, it will always recognize the targetted tissue as an enemy to destroy**		*The effect of chemo and bone marrow transplant (BMT)*	Basically, chemo drugs are used to **destroy the entirety of your immune system. This means that all "memory" of past infections and "stockpiles" of weapons uniquely crafted for each invader are destroyed because the cells that functioned as this memory/stockpile are destroyed.** This means that any "memory" your adaptive immune system had about targeting your tissues as an enemy is also gone! **So, just like many of you have aptly said, this can be conceptualized as an analogy of restarting your computer when its acting funky.** Now, this obviously has its own host of risks and things. For example, any "memory" of vaccinations or past infections has also been erased, so you need to completely re-immunize these patients. Additionally, during the process of the chemoablation therapy and subsequent BMT, the physician has basically made the patient have a non-existent immune system, which is for obvious reasons a very risky thing to do. **However, as many of these autoimmune diseases are so debilitating, many patients consider the risks to be well worth the potential rewards.**		**Others Using this Therapy to Great Success:**	Similar to Dr. Nash in this article, Dr. Burt at Northwestern University's Division of Immunotherapy for Autoimmune Diseases (DIAD) in Chicago has made some really exciting progress in this field, and has treated patients of many different autoimmune diseases with this therapy.	Some of the diseases being treated with this research: **MS, Crohn's Disease, Scleroderma, Lupus (SLE), Diabetes Mellitus Type I.** Website for the interested:	http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/index.html		**Patient Perspective Success Stories:**	http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/pub_vid_edwin.html		Hope this was at all helpful to anyone who is curious about this stuff. Sorry that I was not "very brief" as I Initially stated I would be.		**Edit for readers with MS or with loved ones with MS:** Dr. Richard Burt of DIAD at Northwestern University is currently performing a large scale Randomized Control Trial with this sort of procedure as a treatment for MS. I think is about 70% complete and the team is looking for more patients.

{"body":"They took out nascent immune cells (blood stem cells) before they wiped out the patients' immune system.  This means that the nascent immune cells would still carry the defect that caused them to target the myelin resulting in MS.  Thus, when they put these cells back into the patients (after their immune system is wiped out) the **defective immune system would be reestablished and the patients would still have MS, right?  Apparently not because the MS improved significantly. So what is going on here?**  			Well I looked into it a bit and the last paragraph in the Discussion section of the research article (http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2084840) indicates:			> In the early months after [administration of nascent immune cells], MS remissions are likely achieved as a result of [low number of immune cells]. However, we speculated that long-term remission may result from persistent immunomodulatory [i.e. immune-modifying] effects of [high-dose immunosuppressive therapy/transplant of nascent immune cells].			Now I take this to mean that improvement in disease severity in the early months after the therapy is likely due to the fact that the body no longer has the defective autoimmune cells because the entire immune system was killed off.  But the question still remains...how does the therapy result in long-term remission given that the defective immune cells are reintroduced into the patients?			The paragraph continues:		> 	> ...CD4+ **memory** T cells have **not** recovered to baseline levels in peripheral blood even at 2 years **after** transplant...For CD4+ T cells, dominant T-cell receptor clones present **before** treatment were **not** detectable following reconstitution, and patients usually developed a **new** repertoire consistent with an immune reset. In contrast, the CD8 [cytotoxic protein component of T cells] repertoire reconstituted largely from clonal expansion of cells that were present **before** treatment.			To me, this means that 		(1) the memory cells that would have reminded the immune system to attack myelin did not recover to normal levels, 		(2) the few memory cells that were present didn't have the same cell surface protein receptors (presumably the same ones that target myelin) as before the therapy, and 		(3) that the reconstituted immune system still had the same capacity to attack (whatever it deemed to be foreign) because the CD8 of the reconstituted T cells was the same type as before the therapy.  		Collectively, this **implies** that the therapy changed the memory T cells such that they no longer directed the immune system to target myelin.  		Okay so this is getting closer to the answer, but the question of how (molecularly) the nascent immune cells differentiate into a mature immune system that no longer targets myelin (or at least no longer induces autoimmune-mediated MS) is still unclear and largely unaddressed by the article.  Am I understanding all this correctly?

One of the foremost bacteriologist/virologists in the world stated her opinion that 90% of the US population has been infected. But of course - this can go dormant in hiding, remaining undetectable for quite a long time. 		There are only about 5 labs in the country capable of detecting spirochetes once they've gone into "hiding", and it can take a long time and upwards of $20,000 to do it.
