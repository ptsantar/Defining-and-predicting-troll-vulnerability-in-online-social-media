{"body":"I work in a lab that uses adeno-associated (AAV) viruses for gene therapy. AAV is the virus being used in this study. Adenoviruses, albeit similar, are something completely different. AAV is called adeno-associated viruse because in the normal scenario, AAV requires infection with adenovirus (which causes the common cold) in order infect a human cell. Adenovirus is responsible for the [gene therapy disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger) that occured around the turn of the century that set back viral mediated gene therapy leaps and bounds. Jesse Gelsingers death (what I linked in the previous sentence) was caused by a systemic inflammatory immune response induced by the virus itself. Since this incident, there has been a lot of research into utilizing viruses that are safer and less immunogenic, and AAV is what this research has produced. Currently, there is a lot of research utilizing this virus, [including clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=adeno-associated+virus&Search=Search), with many different strains being used. [Some strains of AAV have been modified to make them less antigenic in the human body](http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v20/n2/full/mt2011237a.html) with a some really great success *in humans*. The big problem that we've encountered using AAV is not a systemic inflammatory response, but a normal immune response producing neutralizing antibodies to the AAV strain after repeated use (similar to what a vaccine does). These neutralizing antibodies are produced by the body specifically towards AAV and work to bind AAV in the blood stream inhibiting it's ability to reach the intended target and deliver the genetic payload. Theoretically a response such as this could result in a systemic inflammatory illness, but to my knowledge this hasn't been observed and AAV has been relatively safe.","depth":1,"score":1083,"ups":1083,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"pok3ypup","name":"t1_cre2wcz","parent_id":"t1_cre272s","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432050275,"created_utc":1432046675}

{"body":"This is all correct. Current research is largely focused on identifying different viral capsids (the protein shell encasing the viral DNA) in order to identify capsids that show high tissue specificity and low immune reactivity. Numerous different strains (serotypes) exist so by combining different elements from serotypes that show preferential properties we can identify optimal capsids. This is a large focus of my Ph.D lab.		The major downsides to AAV are the small capacity to deliver DNA, ~4.8 - 5kb, and (depends on how you look at it it can be a downside) is that AAV viral vectors don't integrate into the host DNA. This is why this study uses muscle injections as the cells are non-dividing, rather than modifying the blood stem cells. The lack of integration is preferential as you run no risk of the delivered DNA from inserting near/within a gene and driving cancer formation.","depth":2,"score":88,"ups":88,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"turtle_flu","name":"t1_cre4ppc","parent_id":"t1_cre2wcz","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432053339,"created_utc":1432049739}

{"body":"To follow up on some of the comments from u/pok3ypup.  Adenovirus vectors are absolutely still being pursued clinically.  The STEP trial here in the states used an adeno-based vector against HIV and failed spectacularly, but researchers continue to use different adenoviruses as bases for new vectors like rarer serotypes or primate serotypes.  They are definitely safe and have been widely used in trials specifically set up to determine safety.  How effective adeno-vectors will be for preventing HIV is still up for debate though I think they will never be the solution.		AAV vectors are also widely being pursued as gene therapy vectors and u/pok3ypup outlines a lot of the work in developing the vector to make it better suited for different uses.  This paper is on the HIV receptor mimetic, that is basically all it is a protein engineered to mimic residues of CD4 and CCR5 to bind HIV viruses and prevent entry.  So they are using AAV to deliver the DNA coding that mimetic attached to an antibody-like domain and make the host make the protein.  This is a very clever protein but has a lot of potential pitfalls before it is a real "universal cure."  It probably induces an immune response against the protein given enough time.  AAV vector-induced protein expression is not incredibly long-lasting.  No adaptive protection is induced by this vaccine so once protein expression wanes so does protection.  Because of the immune system will mount a defense against the vector, the vaccine only can be administered once to a patient unless you change the AAV background of the vector every time.  So you have to vaccinate at risk people with a one time use vaccine and hope that they are protected long enough that all their at risk behavior is all done.

{"body":"While there is absolutely no doubt this is an exciting paper, this is not a cure all miracle treatment for all HIV (I actually recently presented this paper for a journal club, I'm a BMed Grad Student). Look at the paper's supplementary figures (Supp Fig 4a/b, 5a/b), they show the eCD4-Ig's relative in vitro IC50 and IC80 values for a variety of known SIV and HIV strains. The amazing thing about eCD4-Ig and it's variants is how many strains it's effective against which is not typical of HIV treatments due to certain intrinsic properties of HIV. You can see that in some cases however eCD4-Ig is no better than the current best option (bNAbs) and can sometimes be worse. You also have to consider that this uses an AAV (gene therapy) formulation which in this study is tested as a prophylactic, a good question is: will it still work as a treatment considering it's MOA? Gene therapy for healthy individuals can be a subject for debate.		This most exciting part of this paper can be seen in Fig 1 and 4 where they run an in vivo model using humanized mice and rhesus monkeys with a modified version of HIV (SHIV) and challenge them with multiple infections. It shows great survivability but only with a very small number of strains actually tested and without randomization. I don't want to get too into depth on my opinions and possible criticisms since it would take 5000 words to scratch the surface. You can look at [my ppt](http://imgur.com/a/H5jLl) if it interests you, but keep in mind this is only the slides and is completely lacking my actual talk which took about 2 hours.		Don't get me wrong, this is a big deal but it's also science journalism being a bit sensationalist. It's not like HIV researchers will pack it up and go home now. I would say this is a bit like the PDL1 cancer vaccine "cure" level of excitement.

It kinda sounds like the T cells have the HIV in a permanent sleeper hold.		But when would the HIV actually "die" or be flushed out of the system. Like, if you transfused blood from a positive carrier on this medication, wouldn't the recipient get an HIV infection still? To /u/cr1s 's point, how long can the virus remain in the body, dormant? Or does this treatment bind up all the HIV floating around in the blood stream? So many questions and such an exciting discovery.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gnarlwail","name":"t1_crebm7e","parent_id":"t1_creaviq","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432064258,"created_utc":1432060658}
{"body":">In fact, it seems like they are almost trapping the HIV and forcing it to remain attached to the host cell while preventing it infecting the cell.		How so, if they cap the receptor? That would imply that it prevents attachment.	What this solution doesn't do is remove the foreign DNA from your genome (that's what  retro virii do, splice themselves into the host DNA).	But cells die all the time, and if you prevent the resulting phage release to do anything, at some point the unaffected Tcells gain ground, and at some point actually start fighting the inactive virus.		>Like, if you transfused blood from a positive carrier on this medication, wouldn't the recipient get an HIV infection still?		That depends a bit on how you define terms. When are you actually infected? When you can detect the virus in the blood, even if it is inert, or once it starts splicing itself into host DNA? Or in between when it is able to inject itself?		>how long can the virus remain in the body, dormant?		Better use inert here. The capped virus particles should not be confused with what we consider a dormant retro virus. A retrovirus is dormant, if it's DNA is integrated into yours, but not expressed, and not actively assembling preceding lysis.		>Or does this treatment bind up all the HIV floating around in the blood stream		You could probably design the protein in a way that it does that, but I would think you wouldn't want to, since that would have clotting implications. You wouldn't want the protein to link the virii together in a potentially unending chain/mesh in your bloodstream.		I would venture a guess that the particles remain in your blood until your immune system comes back and deals with them in the regular way.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DaHolk","name":"t1_creeoqp","parent_id":"t1_crebm7e","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432068973,"created_utc":1432065373}

{"body":"Yes, that's why I was making the distinction.	When it's just the DNA without the actual virus as an object, that is the dormancy. I thought you meant the "deactiveated" stage when this new protein blocks the receptor.	That too means the virus technically still being in your system, and you don't really know how it will leave /get filtered then.		The thing is it's not really ONE t-cell that stays dormant for so long. They die regularly, too. But each time an infected dormant one splits, the virus DNA is in the new one as well.		But once you cap the actual viruses, there is no reinfection, and thus it becomes a statistic game of your uninfected t-cells multiplying, and the ones with virus DNA multiplying and dying statistically more often when they activate.		Also, how long this method works depends on how you apply it, I am not sure that the version where they splice you with the genome for the protein will ever really be marketable.	On the one side it remains to be seen whether that is a good idea to begin with (because you can't get the DNA back out should the need arise), and secondly, being cynical, I doubt that the pharma complex will use such a solution when they can sell you regular injections of the protein instead.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DaHolk","name":"t1_crek4ko","parent_id":"t1_crei0n9","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432077527,"created_utc":1432073927}

{"body":"This is a fantastic question, and the answer is *complicated.*		   Journals started as a publishing scheme where you would literally write letters to the journal and the journal would publish it. Thats why when you read Nature papers from the 19th century, they start out "Dear sir," or whatever. Now, journals are managed collections of scientific paper-- think sophisticated lab reports-- and each journal carves out a niche in the scientific community in much the same way that individual scientists do. Today, journal subscriptions are usually held by university libraries, so the journal curates the new material and then the library subscribes, giving everyone on campus access to the newest material and all the online legacy articles. The costs are high so the average person cannot afford access to scientific papers.		   Science and Nature are often denigrated as magazines. They publish shorter papers aimed at a more general audience. Its an opprotunity to read about whale migration on one page and then flip to diamond nitrogen-vacancy spin physics at the same place. I've also seen them on sale at airports. The cost of Science, at least, is lower, and it has a lot of easier reading material before the manuscripts begin. Science and Nature have become the "Showcase" journals. I think of them as follows: the papers that change the way you think about science are supposed to publish in science. Major achievements, monumental discoveries, overturning old beliefs.		   Reputability is a huge problem facing scientific publishing. As the total number of scientists has mushroomed, theres only really two good metric for output: number of papers and impact of those papers. As a result, it makes sense that if you want to get ahead in the career (science is a career for humans, first and foremost) you need a lot of papers and bonus if they're high impact. How else will someone on a committee know whether you are the person to hire or someone else if they have no background in your specalized field? Well, X had 2 science papers and Y published 10 articles in the International Journal of Phrenology. Perhaps you can guess which one might get the job.		   The reputability becomes a problem because the number of journals has EXPLODED at the same time that open access has hit the scene. Theres lots of great chinese science, for instance, but i'm simply not going to bother publishing in chinese journals. No one I'm targeting reads those journals, so why publish there? and more importantly, if I don't want to publish there, why should i review any of the papers? thanks but no thanks, guys.  		   There are a LOT of great arguments for open access publishing. However, what we're seeing emerge is starting to look a lot like a 2 tiered system (in the physical sciences, Plos one seems to have traction in the life sciences?) where you have the big name established journals that everyone wants to publish in, and you have the open access and small journals that start to look like paper mills because of the sheer volume of material that passes through them. Its a seperation that emerges between "original" science and "incremental" science. I do a new reaction no ones ever heard of with molecule X. I publish a big JACS paper and run off to my next position. Someone follows in my footsteps and does it with molecule Y. They publish a more incremental paper and don't get as much attention. edit: some people argue that incremental science is unfit to be published. But don't those scientists also deserve to get papers when the entire metric for the profession is based on papers?

{"body":"Just an aside as others have discussed what journals are quite well. 		I thought I'd say how you could go about looking at a journal article. Well one way is to go to a library or university and ask to see where they keep their copies of Nature etc, but If you go to scholar.google.com and search something, you will ONLY get published articles from scientific journals. Now the problem for someone not in science is that they are often not Open access. What that means is that even though taxes paid for the scientists to do the work, and the scientists did the work, and other scientists edited and reviewed the work (process called peer review) for free, that a company who literally just prints the work that scientists say is good work (for free) demand about ??40 for a 3 page PDF of the paper. It's insane. Scientists hate it too.		Have a look around, some might let you read them (click PDF for the best version of the paper).

{"body":"> Are they like magazines that are published results/articles?		Yes, that's exactly what they are, although they're mostly in electronic form nowadays. The term "scientific journal" usually implies that it is *peer-reviewed*. This means that any article that is submitted is first sent to one or more other researchers from the same field, and they write up a review with any questions or criticisms that they may have. Depending on these reviews the paper may either be outright rejected, published as-is, or (most commonly) eventually published in a revised version that the referees and the editor at the journal are happy with.		There are also variants such as *proceedings*, which consist of conference submissions. In some fields (e.g. computer science) these proceedings are also peer-reviewed and are the standard way of publishing. But most scientific fields use "normal" journals.		> Can anybody get a hold of these?		Of course. If they were secret, that would defeat the purpose! However, depending on the journal, access can be quite expensive. University libraries and other research institutions usually have bulk subscriptions to a number of relevant journals for their students and staff. Single-article access is also possible for people outside academia, but that can get expensive really quickly if you want to read more than a handful.		This is a common criticism of academic journals, especially since the referee work is unpaid and done by the same researchers whose employers pay huge sums of money to access the journal. 		Because of that, so-called *open access journals* are becoming increasingly popular. These can be downloaded by anyone free of charge. Many of them are well-respected and it is widely believed that open access will replace traditional publishing models eventually.		Some examples from my own field: 		* [Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics](http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/)	* [Atmospheric Measurement Techniques](http://www.atmospheric-measurement-techniques.net/)			> And how can you tell if they a reputable?		As with any reputation, it's mostly word of mouth in practice. When you're in a community of researchers, you just get to know what the important journals are. There is a metric for it, though, and that's the *impact factor*. This quantifies how often articles from the journal are cited as reference in later research. If I read about something in an article and use it in my own research, I need to cite it. Even if my goal is to refute the research, I need to cite the article. That means that articles that are interesting to other scientists and have an impact on future research get a high score, and a journal that has many important articles also gets a high score.		*Science* and *Nature* are the journals with the highest impact factor, and are relevant to *all of science*. So for something to be published there, it must be of general interest, not just for a specialised community. Then there are journals that are relevant to a whole field of science, such as Cell for biology, or *Physical Review Letters* for physics. And then there are more specialised journals that deal with subfields like atmospheric physics, solid state physics, molecular biology, or whatever. This is where the bulk of articles will be published.		Journals can change and rise and fall over time. For example, in Einstein's time, *Annalen der Physik* was one of the most highly regarded physics journals where a lot of revolutionary stuff was published, and like many important journals of the time was in German. It still exists but is a much smaller affair nowadays (and in English).		> I remember seeing about a Chinese journal scandal a while back.		China is a huge country with a lot of scientists, and they kind of have their own national community where a lot of stuff gets published that wouldn't be internationally. It's hard to get insight into it because these journals are in Mandarin, not English. But of course there are also very good Chinese scientists who publish in reputable international journals. I'm sure there are also good Chinese journals, but like I said, they're kind of their own microcosmos.		However, scandals can happen anywhere - there was a German scientists about a decade ago who published several articles in *Science* which later turned out to include falsified or made up data. There was also the infamous article in a British journal which claimed the MMR vaccine could be linked to autism. A good journal will check and retract such articles if it is found that they are fraudulent. But all in all, the peer review process already weeds out the more obviously wrong articles.		If you're interested in a certain topic, you can check out journals pertaining to that topic, or search [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) for relevant keywords.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eypandabear","name":"t1_cre9pjk","parent_id":"t1_cre7laz","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432061275,"created_utc":1432057675}

They operate similar to a magazine with the main difference being that there is no writing staff, and that there is a much higher emphasis placed on editing for accuracy.		The importance/prestige factor is hard to understand. It's similar to how universities have prestige -- how do you know Stanford is more prestigious than Chico State?

{"body":"I think the question you mean to ask is why are results published in journals in the first place (i.e. why do journals exist). It all boils down to the peer review process and the infrastructure around it. There's a wide range in the quality of studies with a lot of them being sub-par or even terrible. To attempt to filter these out, experts evaluate the quality of studies in their field before they get published. This is the peer review process. Journals were created to manage this process. Publication in a journal means that it has received their stamp of approval. Over time, so many journals have been created that they have separated out into fields and subfields, and by prestige in each category. Nature and Science are the two biggest and hardest to publish in. They span all of science so any of their publications are supposed to be relevant to the scientific community as a whole. Because they have such a wide readership, they receive the most submissions from scientists and therefore exercise some of the most stringent selectivity.

This leads to more assumptions that safe sex is not required because everyone is doing it. It also creates a secondary market for HIV meds for those that take them "just in case".","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gnorris","name":"t1_crepz3d","parent_id":"t1_crecx5u","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432087837,"created_utc":1432084237}

At least, that's the basic idea, obviously it's a lot more complicated than that: it's very difficult to find/build the right virus to do your injections, to not get mopped-up by the immune system, to not cause fatal immune reactions, to alter DNA, to alter DNA to confer HIV resistance, etc.","depth":2,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"antiduh","name":"t1_cre79k0","parent_id":"t1_cre5q3r","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432057427,"created_utc":1432053827}

In high risk individuals you would say it was worth it but		B-As they go onto to say in the paper the monkey produced an immune response against the anti-HIV protein. If they kept this trial going for longer it is likely that the hosts immune response would keep this out of circulation where it is needed for its anti-HIV activity. Thusly leaving the monkeys at risk of infection again. 		C - they challenge their monkeys by injecting the virus directly into circulation. Whilst this is a good model for testing transmission via intravenous drug users. The vast majority of people are infected via mucosal barriers such as during sex. It is well know that stopping the virus at this stage is significantly harder than simply stopping it in circulation. It's more difficult to get the anti-HIV protein to this area of the body. Thusly the virus can just get around the anti-HIV protein at this stage and into a cell.

The problem with AAV gene therapy isn't generally with the therapeutic target, it's with the AAV capsid itself.  However, one workaround is to transiently suppress the immune system to allow the virus a chance to infect the cells before becoming eliminated.		C- While exposure from a needle stick injury is pretty low, we're talking about a direct injection of HIV, which mitigates any mucosal barriers.  More importantly, they are injecting lethal doses of HIV (4/4 macaques in the control experiments died) and are able to show full protection with the eCD4-Ig (all 4 macaques lived).

Sixteen weeks after AAV inoculation, two control macaques became infected following challenge with 200 pg p27.A subsequent 400 pg challenge infected a third control animal, and, afterresisting an additional 400 pg challenge, the final control was infectedwith 800 pg, 34 weeks from the date of AAV inoculation. None of thesechallenges infected AAV-rh-eCD4-Ig-inoculated macaques, indicating that eCD4-Ig protected them from four doses capable of infecting con-trol animals.		This specifically means that this functions as a vaccine, "a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease". The cells need to be genetically engineered to produce a specific protein, but this protein innoculates the monkeys and protects them against SHIV.

{"body":"While your skepticism is most assuredly warranted with vaccine research regarding HIV, I think this article deserves merit. I don't know what your background is in molecular/cell biology but I'm going to assume you don't know much just for the sake of argument. Vaccine research with HIV has been so difficult to produce because of the way HIV replicates itself. (1) It replicates fast and (2) It makes a lot of mistakes during replication. Because of it's speed and infidelity, a strain of HIV replicating itself within a human is capable of undergoing [every single possible point mutation in its genome multiple times per day](http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v2/n1/full/nri700.html). Because of this in early HIV/AIDs treatment trials we tried to treat with 1 anti-retroviral (anti-HIV drug) and found that HIV would quickly develop resistance to it. Currently we treat HIV with multi-drug regimens, you hit the same target from multiple angles and it has a harder time changing itself to become resistant and still maintain functionality. For the same reason any attempt to create a vaccine toward HIV has been unsuccessful. A vaccine requires a protein target, an antigen, and because of HIVs mutation rate any antigen we target will simply change itself and evade the immune response. 		The authors of this article have circumvented this by targeting an antigen that the HIV viruses CANNOT change without deactivating itself. This antigen is the protein, or portion of a protein, it uses to bind onto the T-lymphocytes so that it can infect the cell. This antigen has a very specific amino acid sequence that allows it to bind the receptor, any change to it would render it inactive, and make the virus useless.		Now I haven't looked into past HIV vaccine literature so I don't know if this has been done before (I don't have the time currently). But just reading this with my knowledge of molecular biology it sounds like a pretty good idea, and I think it has potential to work.","depth":1,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pok3ypup","name":"t1_cre3zve","parent_id":"t1_cre2cix","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432052154,"created_utc":1432048554}
