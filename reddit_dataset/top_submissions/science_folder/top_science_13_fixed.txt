{"body":"So, this is not a terribly new finding (first paper outlining ultrasound clearance of AB plaques was in 2011 I believe), but it is a neat finding. Plaque formation obviously indicative of something wrong going on in these neurons, but it is unknown if it is the result of, or in response to, the actual problem.		Since clearing these plaques in these model mice restores memories, whatever their particular flavor of Alzheimer's is seems to place plaque existance as the problem. A different model, say, a ubiquilin or ESCRT mutant system, may not be receptive to this treatment. 		That said, as always, neat!","depth":0,"score":1121,"ups":1121,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Izawwlgood","name":"t1_csmwmja","parent_id":"t3_3bk4hv","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435621192,"created_utc":1435617592}
{"body":"I mean, the problem in general is that there's widespread suspicion that mouse Abeta models (particularly the APP23 model used in this study which carries the Swedish mutation overexpressed) don't accurately reflect the pathophysiology of the human sporadic disease (particularly in that they seem to be much more dependent on amyloid fragment deposition than the actual disease appears to be).  So it's *nice*, but I'll be much more excited when I see this work in, say, the PSEN or APOE mouse models.		Other thing is, yes, it's minimally invasive, but it also seems to be very equipment-time intensive. 		>"1 MHz center frequency, and 6-s sonication time per spot. The motorized positioning system moved the focus of the transducer array in a grid with 1.5 mm between individual sites of sonication so that ultrasound was delivered sequentially to the entire brain."		Not sure what treatment time that'd work out to with a human-sized brain, but I feel like it'd be significant.  		Other thing that worries me	>"When the focus of the ultrasound beam was moved in 1.5-mm increments until the entire forebrain of the mouse was sonicated with SUS, the BBB was opened throughout the brain."		If this disrupts the BBB, is it *really* less invasive than intravenous Abeta antibodies (which are what companies seem to be hedging their bets on at the moment)?  I think you could maybe say that it'd be worth trying this sort of off-label in patients that show abnormally high amyloid deposition by FACT PET and abnormally quick decline?

So yes, the plaque is extracellular, but the process of cleaning it up is likely an intracellular process.   Yes, cells also secrete extracellular proteases, but the main function of those would just be to cleave junk into smaller fragments.  In the case of insoluble aggregates, proteases can't really do anything to them anyway and you need some sort of chemical denaturation/unfolding pathway like what happens in the lysosome to break them up, or you need to sequester them in some intracellular organelle (e.g. aggresomes) where they can't interfere with important stuff.

{"body":"I feel relevant for once, but I bet this post will be too late and probably buried. 		Anyway,  the current belief is that the disruption of the BBB is what is responsible for the clearing of amyloid plaques.  Not because it allows for the immune system to come in and break them up, but because it allows for HSA (human serum albumin) to enter the brain.  		HSA is a well known transporter and the most abundant protein in your blood.  Basically, HSA is known to bind just about everything, including many types of drugs and fatty acids.  The group I work for has spent a considerable amount of time looking at HSA's interaction with amyloid beta and we have found that it can bind to the soluble aymloid beta aggregates and dissociate the monomers.  Physiologically, it means HSA would bind and remove the disease causing A-beta from the brain, transporting it to another part of the body for breakdown/removal.  		However the issue to date was that HSA wasn't able to pass the BBB very well, explaining why it doesn't naturally remove A-beta.  This is solved by the scanning ultrasounds which break up the BBB and allow HSA to enter the brain.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"boultos","name":"t1_csnwqd1","parent_id":"t1_csn7abo","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435697917,"created_utc":1435694317}

So you have to genetically (or chemically, or surgically) modify the mouse so it gets something that resembles human disease, happens fast enough that it won't take you decades to do an experiment, and is severe enough to measure in an animal you can't talk to.		In this case, it's the APP23 model (there are tons of different models for Alzheimer's now), where the mouse gets an extra copy of a human gene (APP) that carries a particularly severe, rare mutation that causes very early onset Alzheimer's in a very small number of Swedish/Scandinavian people.  		At the late stage, mice of this model get brains that look similar to people with very late stage Alzheimer's.  But that doesn't mean the brains got there via the same process.		This concern about mouse models is shared to a greater or lesser degree in all disease research (cancer is another one in which mouse models are problematic).

Alzheimer's is a complicated disease that has several pathologies, and each will probably need different treatments.	- What higher level symptoms does it alleviate? There's only so much you can know from a mouse model - it seems to restore memories but memories are complex and it may only affect the certain types of memories these researchers tested. More complicated types of memories like the kinds you might want restored in humans are difficult to extrapolate about from a mouse model.	- What are the side effects? It might do something terrible to mice, and it may be a miracle cure for mice but immediately kill a human.	- What's the right dose? Timeline of treatment? Interactions with other drugs?		And many, many more. 		> It should be available tomorrow as far as I am concerned .

We scientists have no stake in anything but discovering truths about the world and making it a better place.

Unfortunately, I never worked with patients directly so I don't know the process by which they enroll in such studies, so I can't help you out there.

The most compelling result is the improvement in the active place avoidance test--within the day SUS treated mice improved significantly compared to SHAM mice, and in the long term it was even more significant (short term and long term memory both restored and not significantly different from controls). If it were too late, it wouldn't even work in mice--and yes tau is the cause of degenerate amyloid-beta, it doesn't mean that amyloid-beta isn't the agent that confers the effect--clearing A-beta will help. That's not saying it's ideal and will necessarily be the same for humans, but it is promising to demonstrate efficacy in a mammalian model especially given there is not *always* a clear way (usually the more severe cases are genetic, but it's not always genetic) to diagnose and identify Alzheimer's risk factors before it has progressed too far. The only problem is figuring out how to scale the microbubbles to adapt to human vasculature, and how many additional points of entry they have to use to correct for the size of the human skull. 		Regardless, it is undeniably much more promising than acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (still the only common treatment available for some reason).		Even more compelling about this study that was mentioned at the end of the paper (and various pop sci coverage) is that transiently opening the blood brain barrier is almost unprecedented (for this use; they used SUS to treat tremor/chronic pain with a high degree of efficacy).

My understanding is that tau bodies accumulate which then can proliferate via synaptic connections, and it is becoming more conclusive that tau confers degenerate amyloid-beta. I suppose that part was just me injecting my opinion. (Also Professor Goetz supports this theory apparently)		Exactly. The impact of humans is not proven--the problem is to study the clinical effect in humans. First you establish its safe. That's been done--via mouse model and SUS not showing any neural damage upon histological analysis, as well as no off-target effects of SUS, and also the safety of FUS in humans (focused ultrasound) suggests the more "mild" SUS would also be safe.

They're also genetically pretty easy to manipulate. Some conditions map to humans better than others; cancer research is a good use of rats because they get cancer so damn easily. However, the correlation between curing Alzheimer's in rats and curing it in humans has been, well, 0 at this point. For Alzheimer's, they're really just knocking in a gene. Think of it as gluing a gene on which causes the protein to form, leading to plaque deposits on the brain. But, because we added that gene, it's also easy to remove it. So curing Alzheimer's in rats is like pouring dirt on a smooth floor and then immediately wiping it up to show how well your Swiffer works.
