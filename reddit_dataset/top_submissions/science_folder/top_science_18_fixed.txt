{"body":"Saw a study where babies that were placed near boa constrictors divided by glass. The babies were completely calm until they brought mothers into the room. The babies would cry and freak out the second they saw their mothers acting frightened. Even more interesting, even women that maintained a poker face, but were uncomfortable, would trigger fear in their infants.		In the wild, kids that quickly recognize their parents fear are more likely to escape a dangerous situation safely.		EDIT: I'm trying to find the source. I believe it was a Nova special, but it's been years. It was definitely PBS programming.","depth":0,"score":230,"ups":230,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"theslowwonder","name":"t1_cr61vfd","parent_id":"t3_35m71k","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1431390724,"created_utc":1431387124}

I've no doubt that some of it is genetic, and there are certainly medical conditions that can create anxiety too. OCD is considered an anxiety disorder, and is often treated with CBT.

Our organs depend on the fact that the epigenome differs from organ to organ.

They're often in a mess because their meds aren't working, their meds have stopped working, or they've come off their meds and had a complete relapse. There are even people who don't know that their lifestyle choices might be adding to how they feel, like how five cans of caffeinated soda a day or skipping breakfast might be driving panic attacks that seem to appear out of the blue.		I've been to doctors myself who have told me that medication cures everything, therapists are all quacks. It's quite common in the country where I live to be offered purely anti anxiety medication instead of the recommended combination of medication along with therapy and lifestyle change. There is definitely a culture of throwing medication at mental health problems (mostly anxiety and mild depression) without looking deeper into what therapy and lifestyle changes may help. 		I think that's possible where /u/Cakemiddleton's "purely" was coming from, it's really not uncommon to see people relying solely on medication and floundering because of it.		CBT and similar therapies don't teach us to forget anxiety, they simply teach you to manage it better and function normally in the world again. If you're a type A personality and tend to stress and worry about things, that's not going to just disappear because of therapy. But what will happen is that you will learn management techniques to recognise and deal with the initial anxiety, then cut it off before it snowballs into a panic attack or chronic anxiety problems.		If your anxiety is genetic or learned it doesn't matter when it comes to therapy, because regardless of what triggered it, it is often driven by the way that we think and view the world, and so by being taught to challenge your thought patterns you can learn to better manage how you feel. There are certainly people who don't find any help in CBT, and people who have a biological reason for their anxiety that therapy won't help, but for a lot of people it's an essential accompaniment to their medication.

I wasn't using my anecdotal evidence to infer that my experience is the norm, I was using it as an example to support the notion that many people live wholly unfulfilled, hollow, and gaunt lives while using psychiatric medications, when their needs could be met using therapeutic avenues vs. pharmacological.		Those individuals are being done a disservice by people saying that they cannot overcome their particular psychological issue without medication. Psychology may be a science, yes, but psychopharmacology is analagous to neurosurgery in that the body of knowledge to support its efficacy is limited. I am an inpatient psych RN and on many occasions I've spoken with psychiatrists who just "wing it" when it comes to medications because the interactions between medications and the brain are so poorly understood. It can often take 2 years of various trials on different medications before any efficacy can be found for psychological problems. This is not science to me, that is throwing darts at a dartboard. 		I believe the aim of the study was to open up the possibility that perhaps anxiety and other psychological disorders are holistic, in that they are  physical manifestations of a complex series of interdependent anomalies, and not simply having a variable amount of dopamine which can be pharmacologically corrected.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kthxdots","name":"t1_cr6lg7i","parent_id":"t1_cr6kqm4","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1431445213,"created_utc":1431441613}

{"body":"Glad this article made the front page.  I've been diagnosed with bi-polar anxiety / depression about 5 years ago.  I also am the father of two sons, and one of them, age 10, has been under psychiatric care for about the last 3 years for hyperactivity and anxiety.  I quit drinking and smoking when I was diagnosed, and work very hard on being a good dad.  Unfortunately, I don't know what CBT or DBT is. I've not had a counselor, something I really wish I had, I just have my personal psychiatrist, who is extremely sharp.  I take medication daily for my mood disorders, and I never speak about it to anyone other than immediate family and my closest friends.  I'm assuming the 'BT' stands for behavior therapy, but I don't know the C or D reference.  Reading this article and the comments really makes me want to get into counseling or group therapy as well, I could sure use it.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar I, but have felt that was incorrect and fought the diagnosis for two years. I do realize the resistance to diagnosis can be a part of bipolar disorder, but I really feel like DPD and borderline personality disorder are closer to my symptoms. BPD is actually more heart wrenching than Bipolar I as a diagnosis, at least in my mind. Bipolar I can be medicated. DPD and BPD don't seem to be helped by medication.

{"body":"I can only give you more info on CBT, Cognitive behavioral therapy. It's basically becoming aware of your thoughts and how they affect you. There's a little bit of "where did these thoughts come from/tell me about your childhood", but not very much. Those questions come up to help you understand where you have gotten some thoughts from so you can reflect on if it really is true. ("I am a terrible person and manipulate people to like me" -> why do I think that?) But the main part of CBT is becoming aware of how these thoughts affect your body and behaviour, and experiencing how your behaviour actually can amplify the whole situation. CBT is very effective in treating phobias for this reason, because if you listen to the thoughts and avoid something, next time you are confronted by it your brain has learned that "last time went well because I avoided it. we can not NOT avoid it now".

I'm a marriage and family therapist who works with all sorts of issues, ranging from anxiety and other DSM diagnoses to drug addiction to couple and family problems. MFT (marriage and family therapy) stems from whats called family systems theory, which suggests that people involved in a family (or soceity) are all influenced by each other and cannot be looked at as only individuals. So, in relevance to this article, its important to recognize now everyone involved in the family influences each other. Not only do the parents influence the child, but the child will influence the parents. The way we treat this is focusing on the attachment of the child and the parent and how they structure themselves in terms of roles, rules, and hierarchy.  Now, of course these aren't the only two options and these options may not work in much more severe disorders, such as schizophrenia. CBT and DBT are effective if you want to correct the thought processes, but whole family involvement can have a much more profound impact.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sigmund_Fraud1856","name":"t1_cr69bte","parent_id":"t3_35m71k","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1431407972,"created_utc":1431404372}

Next game gets up to pitch same thing, hit him with the inhaler and he gets better but still cat go back out, next game same thing and we decide it's just too much for him and he's never pitched again. Then a few weeks ago he struck out, and I go up to the dugout to encourage him and he looks at me and is full blown crying and screams just leave me alone!! Not typical of him at a all.

In mice without gut bacteria had generally more anxiety than mice given rhamnosus which was totally the chill group.  So we have also seen that environment such as a farms where people are exposed to more bacteria and have less issues with allergies.  These people generally have good bacteria count and number of strains vs a clean city people whom have a higher chance of having allergies.  I'd think that anxiety can be brought on by an overabundance of a group of bacteria that that can induce it.  When you're born your gut is sterile but your first dose of bacteria is during birth.  As a child you'll share many of the bacteria your parents had.  Could it be that bacteria that aren't good for us are controlling our anxiety triggers and how hard they hit.

{"body":"I find this interesting...I've been dealing with severe depression/anxiety since high school, and started taking medication during my junior year (after a failed suicide attempt). I was unaware that my father also had been dealing with depression/anxiety throughout his life as well. He started to really struggle with his depression when he lost his job due to the recession, and was prescribed lexapro to help cope. My mother claimed this was long overdue, as his overall well-being changed dramatically after being medicated. I was unaware about his struggles until my junior year of hs, when he told me his story in order to help me deal with my own troubles. 		Again I was clueless of his anxiety/depression...he was a very hard worker so I would assume he was just tired when he wasn't "feeling well". My dad is the most well-liked man I know...everyone loves him. He always had a smile on his face and seemed to enjoy life, so this was a shock to me. But then again, close friends and family say the same nice things about me, and the few people that know about my depression find it hard to believe as well. 		Lexapro helped my mental health dramatically as well. My therapist/doctors claimed this may be due to genetics, as the same medicine helped my dad as well. 		I'm not trying to say that my story "proves" that genetics play a role in mental illness...I just find it interesting that my father and I shared the same mental illness, had similar results with the same medication, while I was clueless of his depression just as he was clueless of mine [before the incident].

{"body":"I would like to see more research done on this, as this is one study only after multiple studies claim it's hereditary.		I say this because every woman in my family suffers from anxiety dating as far back as we have record.  This goes to my great, great grandmother on my maternal side.  I have four sister and four aunts.  We all suffer from immense anxiety issues.  Yet none of my five brothers do.  All of our lives could be considered highly volatile, which could be the result of choices made because our anxiety, or simply the cause of the anxiety in the first place.		My mother insists that I was born a very nervous child where none of her other kids were.  My entire life has been guided by anxiety for as long as I can remember.  I started taking medication for it when my son was about 8.  I made conscience life choices to live in an anxiety-free environment from the day he was born.  This includes meditation, al-anon, steady employment, steady friendships, steady romantic interest, etc...  When my son hit puberty, his anxiety, which seemed non existent before, went through the roof.  At the age of 16, he requested to be medicated to help him cope.  Things were bad enough that I agreed.  		I showed him this article just now.  He thinks it's a load of crap (in his all-knowing 19-year-old mind) because he said he felt fine until about 14 and then EVERYTHING just became too much for him.  He doesn't think he learned anxiety from me.  He feels it happened with age.
