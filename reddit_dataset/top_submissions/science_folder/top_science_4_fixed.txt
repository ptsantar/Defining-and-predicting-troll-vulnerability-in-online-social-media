{"body":"From the paper:		>Isolation and cultivation of producing strains	A sample of 1 g of soil sample collected from a grassy field in Maine was agitated vigorously in 10 ml of deionized H2O for 10 min. After letting the soil particulates settle for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted in molten SMS media (0.125 g casein, 0.1 g potato starch, 1 g casamino acids, 20 g bacto-agar in 1 litre of water) to achieve an average concentration of one cell per 20 ??l of medium. Then 20 ??l aliquots were then dispensed into the wells of an iChip. The iChip was placed in direct contact with the soil. After one month of incubation, the iChips were disassembled and individual colonies were streaked onto SMS agar to test for the ability to propagate outside the iChip and for colony purification.		They basically attempt to isolate single cells and let them form a small colony in their native soil, and then transfer those colonies to agar plates to try to establish more robust colonies. They still ultimately grow them on agar.","depth":1,"score":321,"ups":321,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Monory","name":"t1_cnhlci5","parent_id":"t1_cnhj674","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420661709,"created_utc":1420661709}
{"body":"You are missing what is truly novel about their technique (I think, my appologies if not). The iChip was placed in direct contact with soil and any nutrients or growth factors in the soil could permeate through a filter and "feed" the bacteria within the agar. 		The problem with using agar plates / petri dishes has nothing to do with the agar itself or the way it grows, but the carbon sources (food) and the growth factors (sort of like vitamins) that are added to the growth media not being able to support bacterial growth.		Sure they are still using agar as a medium for colonies to grow on, but they are putting these iChips back into their native environment so that the bacteria can grow using whatever nutrients are available there. The iChip serves as a barrier so that a single cell can grow within the well and form a homogeneous colony, and not be contaminated by any other bacteria.		Edit: The other cool, but maybe not novel, thing about the iChip is how they grow colonies from single cells so that you have homogeneous populations to study. The iChip has many very tiny wells within it that are isolated from each other. When they innoculate the chip, they dilute their sample containing bacteria out enough to that by chance each well will receive only one single bacteria. Some wells will have 2 and some will have none by random chance, but the majority will have one single cell. That single cell will then hopefully grow into a larger colony of the same bacteria. It's very difficult to do experiments on a single cell of bacteria, but when you have many cells in a colony you can really start working with it. Like discovering a novel compound that the bacteria produces.

{"body":"Here's the paper: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html		The important thing about this is the way the new antibiotic, Teixobactin, was found... One new antibiotic is nice but only goes so far.... a system that can repeatedly produce new antibiotics in a turn-key fashion is MUCH more useful.		The OP's article doesn't really explain well how this was found and why it falls into that turn-key repeatable class of operations, but I can fill that in.  The key thing to note is the fact that one of the authors of the Teixobactin paper is Slava Epstein.  Slava Epstein is someday going to get a Nobel prize.  This is because of the fact that he has solved the culture problem... the fact that most organisms won't grow in a petri dish.  		The way he did this is pretty cool:  He realized that it wasn't that they COULDN'T grow in the lab, it's that they WOULDN'T grow.  Bacteria, like most organisms, take cues from their environment: for example a bear doesn't intrinsically know when winter is coming, rather he sees the leaves change, and the birds flying south and from this data (that predominantly originates from other organisms) knows when it's time to get ready to hibernate.  Likewise, bacteria collect information from their environment in the form of soluble molecules, mostly produced by other micro-organisms, to know when it's a good bet for crucial biological processes such as cell-division... if they don't get those signals, then they don't divide.  Since the other organisms providing those signals do not exist in the otherwise sterile petri-dishes in a laboratory... they won't divide there.  		So, what Slava Epstein's lab did was that they collected bacterial cells from the soil, suspended them in a lump of agarose (basically gelatin) called a "plug", and then surrounded that agarose plug with a semi-permeable membrane which would not let cells through, but would let small molecules through, and then put the whole thing back into the soil that the bacteria were first removed from.  Because the small molecules of the environment can enter this agarose plug, the cells suspended there know to divide.  When the agarose plug is later retrieved there are colonies of bacteria growing there.... but this is just the beginning.  Each of these colonies is composed of many cells that are all descended from a single bacteria that would grow in the soil environment but not the lab.  Slava Epstein's people then collected cells from such a colony, those cells were then placed into two new agarose plugs.  One of those new plugs was placed back into the soil, and one into an incubator in the lab.  Of course the cells in the soil plug grow since they are getting whatever signalling molecules they need from whatever else is in the soil.  But there's a chance that the incubator cells will grow too... the reason is that the more you grow the cells, the more you select for UNCONDITIONAL growth.  That is, as the cells divide, mutations will naturally occur and eventually a mutation will occur that causes the cell to stop looking for whatever signal(s) it normally needs in the environment in order to unlock growth.  Some times this is a easy mutation to arise, and sometimes it takes many dozens of rounds of harvesting colonies from soil-agarose-plugs... but it's just a matter of time eventually evolution will work and the selective pressures created by this system will force an unconditional growth phenotype.  The final result is a previously ungrowable bacteria that is now domesticated and growable in the lab.  Once you have that, you can test it for the production of useful products such as antibiotics.  Want to test more products?  No big deal, just repeat he above system with more organisms... since there's a near unlimited and unique diversity of micro organisms in every single cubic foot of dirt, you'll basically never run out.		Of course, in the long run, synthetic biology techniques that allow us to bypass messing with growing the source organisms for such products and just skip ahead to the products themselves by sequencing DNA from single cells and then synthesizing the interesting parts of that DNA that encode for products (called "biosynthetic clusters") and then expressing them in already convenient laboratory or industrial microorganisms.   But the bacteria domestication approach is still important for several reasons:  It proves the underlying thesis that the reason we had "run out" of antibiotics wasn't that there aren't more, but merely because we were only looking in same very small space over and over again.  Also, many of these interesting gene products, like antibiotics, must be synthesized from metabolic intermediates that are not universally in all bacteria.  That makes the domestication approach faster to produce products of interest in the short term.  However, in the next 10-15 years look to see the synthetic biology world creating chassis organisms with interchangeable metabolisms to address this. 		edit: Thank you for all the Gold kind strangers of the internet!","depth":1,"score":1913,"ups":1913,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lucretius","name":"t1_cnhoig2","parent_id":"t1_cnhkj3c","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420666594,"created_utc":1420666594}

{"body":"EXCELLENT QUESTION!		The answer is embedded into two facts:		* Bacteria live hand-to-mouth:  Things happen fast on the molecular and cellular levels, and bacteria are constantly balanced on a knife's edge of reaction to any of thousands of environmental stresses that can have life-or-death consequences for them if they don't react (such as by turning on genes in the nick of time) or react poorly (such as turning on the wrong genes).  (Most bacterial genes are turned off until the instant they are needed).  Similarly, almost all of them literally can't store enough energy and material to replicate inside their own volumes all at one time... they have to start replication before they have enough to finish it.  This bring us to:		* Cell division is a risk for a bacteria:  Resources have to be diverted into copying DNA (a non-trivial metabolic cost in its own right) those resources would otherwise have been maintaining the machinery of the cell: replacing ribosomes, lipids, and proteins as they naturally degrade etc.  If mid-division, a cell's resources get critically low, the cell division will stall.  If this stall state persists too long, the cell may not be able to recover.  Even if it succeeds in dividing, both daughter cells end up splitting the remaining resources of the mother cell between them. If that resource pool is too small, one or both may die.  Further, while a bacteria is dividing, it's ability to cope with environmental dangers is often compromised.  For example the activity of it's own replication machinery might make it more apt to be taken over by a virus (which in some cases co-opt some of that machinery), or the activity of the DNA polymerase crossing a gene might hamper the competing activity of the RNA polymerase to cross that same gene and thus interrupt the just-in-time production of the gene's product.		The result is that cells which grow unconditionally on average are taking unnecessary risks.  If the cell can wait for a signal that indicates conditions are now, and will likely continue to be favorable, for reproduction then that risk is at least partially mitigated.  This is why the vast majority of bacteria don't grow unconditionally.  It should be pointed out, however, that this limits the niche that the bacteria can persist in to one where that signal exists and is a better than random indication of when it is safe to replicate... since that limitation also has its downsides, there are also some bacteria that do grow unconditionally.","depth":3,"score":171,"ups":171,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lucretius","name":"t1_cnhuboz","parent_id":"t1_cnhsn2o","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420676351,"created_utc":1420676351}

If you wanted to do the Biosphere project right, then you would start with as simple a system as you could get to work, and then move upward in complexity:  For example: Just 3 species: Human, an Anaerobic bacteria, and an algae.Start by managing their growth and metabolisms artificially, and only allow for natural homeostasis to take over as you understand the dynamics of the system.

The technology for this company basically tries to solve the [great plate count anomaly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_ecology) which, in a nut shell, says we can only grow 1% of the entire microbial environment in a lab setting. Soil environments (and more importantly micro-environments) are incredibly complex. Standard microbiology plating techniques to isolate bacteria include streaking bacteria onto agar with some sort of carbon, nitrogen, amino acid, etc mixture which only allows around 1% of environmental bacteria to grow while the 99% of the remaining environmental microbes simply do not have the necessary growth factors (nutrients, correct pH, signals from other bacteria etc) to grow on a petri dish.		The iCHIP claims to solve the great plate anomaly allowing the remaining 99% of environmental microbes to thrive in a lab. A TLDR explanation is they dilute bacteria from a soil sample down to single cells in agar and place it between two membranes which is then inserted back into the soil it originated from. The membranes have pores which are small enough to allow factors from the soil to diffuse in and out while the single cell stays put. In theory this allows the 99% of unculturable bacteria to be exposed to their natural environment as well as the lab agar in hopes that the bacteria will learn to thrive on the agar with the help of the environmental nutrients diffusing in and out of the iCHIP. 			If this technology worked the majority of the isolates pulled from the iCHIP would be novel and a very small percent would be known species (greater than 96% homology to known sequences based on 16S). The truth is it's quite the opposite. On average out of 1000 bacterial isolates from the iCHIP maybe around 10-20 looked interesting (less than 96% homology to known 16s sequences). As a control we also plated the same soil onto agar plates and picked similar amounts of colonies and saw similar data sets. On average out of 1000 colonies picked from traditional microbiology streaking techniques we saw about 10-20 interesting colonies (less than 96% 16s homology) which is the same as the iCHIP. Assuming this technology works you would expect two completely different data sets from the iCHIP and the normal plating procedures. The iCHIP would have a significant higher amount of bacteria with 16s homology less than 95%. 		To break it down even more if you ran a standard isolation experiment you'd expect out of 1,000 environmental bacterial cells only 10 to be able to grow in a lab setting (based on the great plate count anomaly of 1%). If you ran 16s across those 10 isolates that grew you'd more than likely find a very high percentage match in Genbank. If the iCHIP did indeed work  out of those same 1,000 environmental bacterial cells you'd expect greater than 1% to grow. For sake of argument let's just say 2%. So you'd have 20 isolates grown instead of 10 and out of those 20 isolates you'd expect at least 50% to be completely novel and unknown. If this happened they'd on a consistent basis they'd be publishing on a weekly basis and creating entirely new taxonomy branches on a weekly basis. The technology has been in place for close to 14 years with very few modifications. They've essentially been mining for bacteria and finally got lucky. 						The numbers generated in this example above increase the cultivable bacteria from 1% to 2%, imagine the results if it were even higher? [The company claims 50%!!!](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html#ref10) ("Diffusion of nutrients and growth factors through the chambers enables growth of uncultured bacteria in their natural environment. The growth recovery by this method approaches 50%, as compared to 1% of cells from soil that will grow on a nutrient Petri dish"). If 50% were true and we used our example above then 500 out of the 1,000 total environmental bacteria would be grown up in a lab in which only 10 would be known sequences and 490 would be completely novel. You'd literally be swimming in novel bacteria and it would be actually harder to find a known species than an unknown species. However they also show [this table](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849220/table/t1/) which lists the similarity % of the 16s across normal petri dishes vs. their iCHIP technology. The OTU's across each percentage similarity are not that far off especially considering the number of isolates tested from the iCHIP were double the petri dish. 					The theory behind the technology does sound impressive and logical but in practice it does not own up to it's claims. In fact, in one of their own papers in which they discovered a different novel compound isolated from a bacteria using this technology they even admit the bacteria is 98% related to a known species which really isn't all that significant in the bacterial world and routinely happens when you streak soil on an agar surface without the iCHIP. This "novel" bacteria could have just as easily been isolated using standard microbiology techniques. Hell [groups are even isolating novel bacteria from belly buttons](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/1-458-bacteria-species-new-to-science-found-in-our-belly-buttons/266360/).		I'm happy to see progress in this field and companies still working on this major problem. However the hype around this is nauseating as it's appearing across Nature, the New York Times, etc. The fact they even made it gimmicky by adding "i" at the beginning to copy Apple makes it even worse.  I wish the technology worked as well as it claims but unfortunately it doesn't. It's quite possible to find compounds to kill the nasty stuff (MRSA, TB, etc.) but they rarely make it to market. This compound has a LOONNGGG way to go but i have my fingers crossed that there is some clinical implication in the future whether it be this compound of a chemical derivative.  			TLDR: The results from the iCHIP technology are not much greater than traditional plating technology. They just tend to conveniently leave this out of the hype as they're a Biotech looking for funding.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bpesca","name":"t1_cnib3ju","parent_id":"t1_cnhsu1w","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420720823,"created_utc":1420720823}

{"body":"Hey, no problem. I'll answer as best I can, but a few caveats: I only have my bachelor's in biology, and this is a pretty complex question; also, theory is much different than reality.		That said, no. An individual cell might reverse the mutation. If, for instance, antibiotic resistance is conferred by a mutation that *adds* a function, such as a new metabolic pathway, then it's likely the cell could mutate back to normal because any random mutation could interrupt that new function, rendering it inert.		If, however, resistance is conferred by a mutation that *deletes* a function, such as a broken membrane transport protein or something, it's unlikely to revert back to normal, because the reverse mutation would have to occur at exactly the same place as the initial mutation, which is statistically improbable. 		More importantly, the mutation back to normal would have to have some kind of selective advantage in order to pass into the majority of a population. There's simply no advantage (usually) that comes with losing abx resistance, so even though a single cell could revert to normal, that mutation wouldn't spread.		If we could engineer that to happen, great. We could take a cell that had reverted to normal, engineer some kind of selective advantage into the cell (such as an increased rate of nutrient uptake) and allow that cell to become the primary strain. However, it would eventually gain resistance again, and we'd start the whole process over again.		Sorry, there's really not an easy solution.

If companies like Pfizer & Merck didn't make their R&D money back through new drugs, they would have to shut their doors in a few years. 		Resistance doesn't really work by forming to one drug at a time, either. Whenever bacteria began developing beta-lactamase (enzyme that cleaves the active part of drugs like penicillin), it rendered not just one drug ineffective, but most beta-lactam antibiotics (this includes penicillin, cephalexin, & some similar drugs). So, overnight these bacteria started popping up that were resistant to most of our first line antibiotics. Companies began developing more complex beta-lactams, or drugs like Augmentin (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid). Clavulanic acid breaks down that beta-lactamase enzyme, allowing amoxicillin to work whenever it was previously inactivated by the bacteria. 		Resistance can just pop up too, since it occurs by mutation. Drug-resistant strains of bacteria are commonly seen in countries where antibiotics are overprescribed, or where patient compliance is poor (a lot of new strains [come out of India](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/4/485.full)) because we're pretty much being social Darwinism at work.

[Here's](http://ge.tt/8NbwM982/v/0) the full article if you're interested, as my explanation was rather poor, in case you don't have access.		Edit: Here's a long quote from their discussion on resistance developing:		>This suggests that the producer does not employ an alternative path- way for cell wall synthesis that would protect it from teixobactin, and which other bacteria could borrow. Resistance could eventually emerge from horizontal transmission of a resistance mechanism from some soil bacterium, and given the highly conserved teixobactin binding motif, this would likely take the form of an antibiotic modifying enzyme. How- ever, although determinants coding for enzymes attacking frequently found antibiotics such as b-lactams or aminoglycosides are common, they are unknown for the rare vancomycin. The recently discovered teixobactin is even less common than vancomycin. After its introduc- tion into the clinic, it took 30 years for vancomycin resistance to appear29. The lipid II modification pathway resulting in vancomycin resistance probably originated in the producer of vancomycin, Amycolatopsis orientalis19. It will probably take even longer for resistance to the better-protected teixobactin to emerge. Teixobactin is the first mem- ber of a new class of lipid II binding antibiotics, structurally distinct from glycopeptides, lantibiotics30,31, and defensins32. The properties of teixobactin suggest that it evolved to minimize resistance development by target microorganisms. It is likely that additional natural compounds with similarly low susceptibility to resistance are present in nature and are waiting to be discovered.		Don't get me wrong either, it doesn't suggest that resistance will *never* develop, just seems like it may take longer. And what's more exciting, as has been pointed out in the thread, is the method. This is just one discovered compound from one bacteria (though they found 25 other compounds from other bacteria, this was just the most promising), so consequently it suggests we may be able to find lots more compounds which are just as efficacious if not more-so due to this new technique.

However, it is entirely possible that specific evolved defenses against it - as with Vancomycin - are out there.  This chemical arms race has been going on for a long time.  It may take a long while for any evolved resistance to pop up but IMO, it's a bit presumptuous of the authors to assume that something out there hasn't figured out a counter to this.  		Also, I would also counter their assertion that the teixobactin conserved binding motif is a guarantee against spontaneous resistance.  Chloramphenicol has a mode of action where it chemically modifies the 23S rRNA, inactivating it.  Spontaneous resistance isn't that uncommon despite the highly conserved nature of rRNA.

{"body":"You are right in that there have been a ton of derivative compounds made to combat resistance in the last 30 years, but in the last 20 there have only been 2 new drug classes that have actually been generated-daptomycin and linezolid.  Linezolid has a new structure but a tried and true mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis-which we know resistance to can evolve significantly.  			Daptomycin is a much more novel mechanism of action and has seen less resistance, although some has been noted.  So that is a new drug class with a pretty neat mechanism.			Teixobactin appears to be a Lipid II modification antagonist with no protein binding affinity.  It has a novel chemical architecture and a mechanism of action that is more difficult to grow resistance to (likely) than a proteib-based target.  Vancomycin is similar in many ways, and has taken 30 years before resistance really mounted against it so.  These lipid precursors to cell wall components are potentially exciting targets because unlike bacterial proteins, they can not be easily modified to develop resistance by a single or a few point mutations.  Likely, they would require modification of the metabolic pathways involved in the construction of the lipids and the cell wall-which requires more lucky jumps in evolution than modifications to a single enzyme.  So I at least think this drug class is kind of neat.			That being said, the impact of this paper likely won't be the teixobactin, it will likely instead be the ability to screen secondary metabolites from non-culturable bacterial to screen for drug potential in a meaningful way.  As it stands, this particular technology will have finite abilities in high-throughput screening, but now that it is published there will large modifications to the general protocol to improve the types of activities selected for as well as the microbe-samples tested.

The problem with isolating and producing them on a mass scale is that these chemical agents have existed in nature for a very long time, meaning some species have already grown adaptations to avoid or mitigate their effects.  Use one antibiotic too frequently and you just select for these resistant species to survive. 		You can modify and tweak the chemical structure of the antibiotic for efficacy, but this is only delaying the inevitable.  All of them will lose efficacy over time as evolution selects for more resistant pathogens.  These drugs aren't the drugs of the future, but a temporary stopgap measure until we can come up with something *really* effective.		Imagine friendly and harmless designer microbes that can reside in certain spaces of your body.  They're built from the ground up to be incredibly resistant to mutation (too much deviation in the genetic code and they kills themselves).

In short, *Staph aureus* was grown in media containing the drug over many days and never developed resistance.		The targeting of the cell wall is hard to develop resistance against because it's not a protein and thus not directly coded for in a gene. This means that a point mutation or two in a protein isn't likely to delete an active site, like it might if the drug targeted a protein.		Instead, bacteria will need to evolve a protein that attacks the antibiotic, like the bacterial enzyme Beta-lactamase attacks the chemical structure of penicillin-like antibiotics.

However I can't help feeling that trying to advance antibiotics is rooted in science that we are beginning to think much differently about.  I recently saw a talk on targeting essential pathways unique to C. diff, very similarly to how we use small molecules to selectively inhibit enzymes in certain types of cancer.  These approaches take advantage of selectivity and a low off-target profile (or so we think).  We have the know how and the power to design all sorts of selective molecules for different bacterial strains and their essential pathways, yet there's still focus on finding the antibiotic "panacea" for all bacterial infections.		The problem with this approach is that the natural microbiome, or the "good bacteria" that live in our bodies, are also susceptible to these sorts of antibiotics.  So therefore you have come in with a brute force approach (antibiotics) that don't discriminate between good and bad bacteria.  This is because a lot of these molecules work by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, or ribosomal protein translation.  Every bacteria gets killed to a certain extent and the balance of bacteria in the body is tilted.

{"body":"Medicine takes SERIOUS time to get real results. If someone has an idea for a new tablet interface- like when touch screens evolved practically overnight with fantastic technology- it didn't matter that the first generation of innovation wasn't perfect. Patches could be inserted in and the turnover of tech for a consumer is always crazy high.		In medicine it's way different. You have to identify a problem/pathway, figure out how to model a disease in culture or in some other way, maybe trial thousands of different drug structures in a computer bank, then see if they can be developed, then maybe test them in animal models, then people, etc. etc. 		There's also the major issue of many different labs operating relatively independently. Most stuff is grant based. Big pharm companies pump in money for more drugs to be milled out because that behooves them in the short run. Labs like this one had to fight for recognition then apply for grants to pursue this particular project. They probably were distracted by ten other projects while doing this because they have to keep their lab in the green. Plus, you don't want to/can't afford bringing in lots of other help or else you'll be scooped. And you're not worried about that for name recognition, you're worried about it most of all for job security.		It's really really stressful.		I also have the opinion that there is a serious disparity between the biological world and every other industry in terms of type of mentality. There was a really cool breakthrough in stem cells at almost the same time. One group did a brute force test that looked at basically every possible gene candidate while trying to figure out how to create stem cells. Another group just used a computer algorithm to narrow the pool down to 9 genes, and tested those. They came out with the same results.		Again, this part of my post is just opinion, but I feel like the grant funded (i.e., not privatized) basis of the industry along with the very biologically based way of schooling (I know many grad students in Neuro that don't know a lick of programming, which is weird to me), it's just apples and oranges when compared to any other field.
