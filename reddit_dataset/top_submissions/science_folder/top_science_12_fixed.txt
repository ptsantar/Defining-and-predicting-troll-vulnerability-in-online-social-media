I'm by no means an expert in this field, but IIRC, the chicken pox virus doesn't actually "go away." The body's immune system is able to suppress it into a dormant state, but it's still there. Whether the vaccine does this as well, I'm not sure.

So that does throw a wrench in things. You'd have to sum the duration of latency with the lifespan of an infected cell. You'd really need protection rates pretty much at 100% for it to work, including good thymus penetration, and then it'd be injections every thirty or so weeks until that summed duration had passed. I'm pretty sure that's how Harvoni cures Hep C (admittedly simpler not being a retrovirus), provide such comprehensive protection that after waiting it out for 12 weeks the thing is dead.		Might something similar work for HIV on a longer scale? 		Still, I don't think it would need to include bone marrow, as CD4+ doesn't occur until the thymus.

That's why people get a transitory flu-like illness, and then become better, they develop antibodies that keep the virus in check for a while; that's what stops it from progressing straight to AIDS. The problem is that HIV integrates into people's DNA, essentially sticking it there permanently, and the body can't clear the virus completely. Because the virus isn't fully eradicated, it can slowly infect more and more cells until it overwhelms the immune system, despite the antibodies that are present.		There's also an issue that it's really hard to make antibodies to HIV, because the outer part of HIV is highly variable and is really prone to mutations, so it's hard to develop a vaccine that will cover all variations of HIV. It's like why we have to get a flu shot every year, except the problem is even worse. People have been working on developing vaccines that try to stimulate broadly-neutralizing antibodies, some of which have been promising, but nothing overwhelmingly successful.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BCSteve","name":"t1_cop962p","parent_id":"t1_cop8lrl","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424272903,"created_utc":1424272903}

{"body":"> you can't do that with humans.		...yes you can. These monkeys were injected with adeno-associated virus (aav) into their muscles to express this antibody. AAV is a non-pathogenic virus that when designed as a delivery vector has a much reduced chance to integrate (wild type aav has a site specific integration point at chromosome 19, I believe, it's early). Although gene therapy treatment is still massively lagging behind mass acceptance, due to the death of Jesse gelsinger because a mistake by researchers, and issues with leukemic development in ADA-SCID patients, this treatment is totally viable. The issue would be, first cost. The one accepted AAV drug on the market, glybera, only licensed in the EU, costs $1.6 million for a one time dose.		Now, cost aside, the other issue is that HIV can use two Co-receptors for integration - ccr5 and cxcr4. Now, I've seen that ~50% off AIDS patients are ccr5 tropic, but if the virus mutated it could use the cxcr4 receptors. Blocking this receptor is more difficult since it is integral for hematopoetic stem cells. Also, this treatment only targets circulating virus, but latently infected cells, such as hematopoetic stem cells that aren't cycling wouldn't produce the virus and you would still have long-lived cells in your body. So this would serve as a functional cure, but not a sterilizing cure.		So, this idea is a good approach although it does have potential limitations.

With that said, with the understanding of reprogramming of cells, there is interest in developing gene therapy treatments for type 1 diabetics, hemophiliacs, etc. The field was really hampered by some of the early poor results with oncogene activation, but as our understanding has progressed we are able to make safer and better viral vectors for delivering the genes of interest. Ideally it would be a way of the future, allowing for your genetic defect to be cured (although since it would not correct your germline cells the mutations would still be passed on to your offspring). 		Right now, the rich only have access to this.

{"body":"Yes, but depends on the virus. You see, HIV is a retrovirus that is able to integrate into the genome of your cells. From there it can be replicated essentially indefinitely, if the virus doesn't strain the cell too much or if the immune system doesn't find out about it (both complex mechanisms). This also means, once these cells divide, the genome of the virus integrated into your cells genome will also be copied into the new cell, which is then "infected" right from the start. So in order to really get rid of the virus you'd have to eliminate all cells ever infected with it. Which is actually not really necessary, as long as only few cells are infected and your immune system can handle the resulting virus production. But still not an optimal situation, because every now and then your immune system might get compromised and weakened, and then an infection like this might fire up again to a point where your immune system can't help you anymore.		For other viruses that don't integrate into the cells genome it is much simpler. Vaccines work very well for that, because the particles can be recognized from the start by the immune system. Basically gives your immune system a better start to fight the infection. Even if they infect a cell, they won't be able to keep production up indefinitely and more important they will never get to be copied into a new cell after cell division.","depth":3,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OldManLaughingBull","name":"t1_cop7i22","parent_id":"t1_cop79ef","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424269509,"created_utc":1424269509}

And those virus are meant to replicate over and over and over again, just like AIDS. Aka, producing the antibody from inside you. So the vector virus is actually the genetically modified thing.		Now, even a patient already infected by HIV would benefit from such a tool. Why ? because HIV is also a self replicant virus that uses our own defensive cells as a benchwork to replicate itself and then blowing it up to dissmeniate its newly created HIV cells. SO in the end, what kills you and actually turns into AIDS it the fact that HIV has destroyed too many of your defensive (T4) cells.		Adding to already HIV+ patient that artificial antibody would equal to add a competition to our own T4 cells. From what i understand, the artificial Antibody is made so it is more attractive to HIV so in the end, even for HIV+ patients, it would allow a massive slow down, or even regression of the illness. As our body is constantly producing T4 cells, if somethign is there to prevent HIV from targetting them all the time, pretty much acting as a bait, then you'd see patients go back to perfectly normal T4 cell levels. Which would pretty much mean not being sick at all. Yes you'd still be contagious (and even that remains to be seen) and there are many kinks to rule out, and many testings to be done, but overall it's a very possible solution.		It doesnt kill the virus out of your body. it just traps it.

Further, the protein is a mimic of your own body rather than a target for HIV, so when the HIV mutates resistance to the drug - in the case of the protein, it will also mutate away its own virulance.  Whereas in the case of the small molecule it will mutate away from treatment.","depth":2,"score":21,"ups":21,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"randonymous","name":"t1_copd4p3","parent_id":"t1_cop8jbm","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424279536,"created_utc":1424279536}

Invest. 117, 3148???3154 (2007).		---		The tl;dr answer to your question is yes. In detail, the researchers did not attempt to vaccinate the Rhesus macaques against HIV-1 infection as usual. Here, they used a (non-HIV) viral vector to get the monkeys' bodies to start making a specific protein (the eCD4-Ig). IOW that protein was not a natural immune response - it was put there with intent. Once the animals were producing the protein, the researchers attempted to infect ('challenged') the animals with live HIV virus (a variant anyways) to see if the eCD4-Ig developed by their immune systems prevented infection. And it did!		The next logical question I suppose would be, why don't we start doing this with all people immediately? It's not really my area but essentially gene therapy which is very tricky. It's inefficient, unpredictable, and has several potentially fatal errors that can happen (like if your immune system reacts very badly to the vector itself, rather than staying quiet and letting the vector do its work).

{"body":"Hummm, from what i'm reading here,  i think there's a misconception on the concept of genetically modified monkeys in that cas. They werent actually modified but injected with a self replicant harmless virus that has in its genetic code the schematic for the artificial antibody. And those virus are meant to replicate over and over and over again. Aka, producing the antibody from inside you. So the vector virus is actually the genetically modified thing in order to turn it into a printer of the cure inside your body.		Now, even a patient already infected by HIV would benefit from such a tool. Why ? because HIV is also a self replicant virus that uses our own defensive cells as a benchwork to replicate itself and then blowing it up to dissmeniate its newly created HIV cells. SO in the end, what kills you and actually turns into AIDS it the fact that HIV has destroyed too many of your defensive cells. ( (T4 types which are actually key to your entire immune system) 		Adding to already HIV+ patient that artificial antibody would equal to add a competition to our own T4 cells. From what i understand, the artificial Antibody is made so it is more attractive to HIV so in the end, even for HIV+ patients, it would allow a massive slow down, or even regression of the illness. As our body is constantly producing T4 cells, if somethign is there to prevent HIV from targetting them all the time, pretty much acting as a bait, then you'd see patients go back to perfectly normal T4 cell levels. Which would pretty much mean not being sick at all. Yes you'd still be contagious (and even that remains to be seen) and there are many kinks to rule out, and many testings to be done, but overall it's a very possible solution.		It doesnt kill the virus out of your body. it just traps it. And you can use it at any age as the genetically modified part of it is actually the inoffensive virus that will function in you as a printing machine for the artificial antibody.

{"body":"HIV research scientist here...let me explain what's happening in this paper!		So how does HIV-1 work?  HIV-1 is a retrovirus that prefers to infect CD4 T cells.  It gets inside these cells by binding to a protein on the surface of the T cell called CD4.  Once the virus is attached to CD4 on the cell surface, it binds a second cell surface protein (either CXCR4 or CCR5).  Then the virus gets inside the cell and wreaks havoc.  		HIV-1 MUST bind the CD4 protein and either CCR5 or CXCR4 to infect a cell.  So it stands to reason that if you can block the virus from binding those proteins, you can stop the virus from infecting cells. (Important note:  for reasons not yet totally understood, when you contract HIV-1 from someone/something the incoming "founder virus" seems to always use CCR5 as the second protein).		So what do we do with this knowledge?  If we could block HIV-1 from binding to CD4 and CCR5, then we could prevent HIV-1 from infecting someone new.  The research team that did this study was trying to create a therapeutic that could block those binding events.		The "lab-molecule" described in this paper is a protein that was created by the research team made up of a portion of the CD4 cell surface protein and a small protein chunk that looks like the CCR5 protein (remember: these are the two key proteins HIV-1 needs to bind to infect someone new).  Let's called this protein the Infection Blocker Protein!  They then inserted the DNA sequence required to Infection Blocker Protein into an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV vector).  Think of this DNA sequence like a blue print, and the AAV as a mystical factory that takes the blueprint and cranks out huge amounts of product.  In this application, the product is Infection Blocker Protein.		So now what?  Well, it turns out we can pretty safely inject our engineered AAV vector into people (or monkeys) and it will go to work making the protein we programmed it to make. In this paper, they injected the AAV vector that makes Infection Blocker Protein into monkeys.  The AAV vector then did what it was created to do:  pumped out huge amounts of Infection Blocker Protein.  This protein entered the bloodstream and circulated around the monkey's body.  The research team then started trying to infect the monkeys with SHIV (a modified form of the monkey version of HIV-1 that looks a lot like HIV-1) to see if the Infection Blocker Protein could prevent the incoming virus from infecting any cells.		It appears that the Infection Blocker Protein did what it was designed to do and blocked SHIV from infecting these monkeys.  Is that exciting?  Yes!  Could this method be applied to humans?  Yes!  Will it totally work and should we all start celebrating?  We don't know yet...but this study suggests that we should think about giving it a try in people.  Lot's of promising science fails as we translate from the lab (or lab animal) to human trials.

{"body":"Making cells mass produce a certain protein isn't actually dangerous, since cells are constantly churning out new proteins all the time. If the protein being produced had cytotoxic effects, it could be a problem, but that isn't the issue here.		The vector they're using in this case is an adeno-associated virus that has had its ability to integrate into the host cell genome drastically reduced. Normally with AAV vectors, they deliver DNA to a cell's nucleus and it exists as extrachromosomal DNA (in episomal concatemers), and the lack of integration is meant to prevent the interruption of host cell genes which could prevent the development of a tumor, or cancer. These vectors do have a low amount of random integration however, but *hopefully* it isn't frequent enough to pose a risk. That is why more tests are required however.		Additionally, since the protein they are making has homology to host cell proteins, there is a chance that the body may recognize it as a foreign molecule and mount an immune response against it, leading to the development of autoimmunity, but AAV elicits very little immune response in humans, so this is an unlikely occurrence, but of course more tests are warranted.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kegnaught","name":"t1_cop9ig9","parent_id":"t1_cop86fx","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424273536,"created_utc":1424273536}

{"body":"That's an extremely childish and simplistic view of this issue.  There are not "utilitarian reasons" for testing on animals.  It's an absolute necessity if you want things like new drugs that save lives. Unless, of course,  you'd prefer hundreds of thousands of people dying a year because they've had drugs tested on them.		>especially considering the enormous harmful effects these tests could have on their wellbeing		Yes, that's the whole point!  We do these harmful things to animals so we don't have to do them to humans.  Is it a perfect solution? Of course not.  Nobody likes the idea of animals suffering through experiments.  Are we willing to accept it because it's the only way we can further medical science?  Anyone who isn't a complete moron would say, of course!","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"a_fonzerelli","name":"t1_coq0otq","parent_id":"t1_copqo44","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424318892,"created_utc":1424318892}

There are plenty of cases when animal testing is completely unnecessary (not all of them, of course) because the research is unnecessary or because there are other ways of answering their research question.
