{"body":"Love Canal, New York. Really interesting stuff.		TLDR: Groundwater was so contaminated that 50% of babies were born with major birth defects.		In the late 50's Hooker Chemical sold an area of land to a school board for $1, who purchased it so they could could build a new school. Hooker told the school board  that they had been dumping barrels of chemicals there for years, knew that it had potential to be really bad, and basically didn't want to be accused of trying to profit from it. 		It should be noted that Hooker had put in a clay lining in the soil to contain any chemicals that leaked out of the barrels.		The school was eventually built, and not too long after low income housing was built around near the school. 		When running water lines, sewer lines, etc. holes were poked in the clay lining, and these contaminants started to spread through the ground. 		People in the community started noticing that their water had a neon greenish hue, but no one listened for a while. Eventually a local newspaper picked up the story, but the mayor brushed it aside. 		In the 70's about half of the new born babies were born with birth defects. Like extra rows of teeth, missing limbs, etc. 		This was really the first time that people realized ground water (not to be confused with surface water) could be super polluted and unsafe to drink. 		Typically ground water is really pure because the water is drawn through sand aquifers which filter everything like bacteria and parasites out. However, toxins from Hooker chemicals (particularly dioxin which is super bad news because we still don't know how to break them down and dispose of them) dissolved in water therefore were not filtered out by the sand.","depth":1,"score":500,"ups":500,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"orangesbeforecarrots","name":"t1_cqtv8n6","parent_id":"t1_cqts1lo","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1430408515,"created_utc":1430404915}

Murray, told Murray that he and Ansley Wilcox, the Company's attorney, had talked several times with Superintendent Small and a representative of the City Planning Board for Niagara Falls about the Board's desire to build a school on or near the Love Canal property. After noting that he and Wilcox had initially opposed the idea, Klaussen wrote: "The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the proposition and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near vicinity of our property." Ex. 119.

{"body":"The [Dutch famine of 1944](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_famine_of_1944) provided researchers with a lot of interesting data, because it was one of the few famines in a developed country: 		> This famine was close to unique as it took place in a modern, developed and literate country, albeit suffering under the privations of occupation and war (other example: the famine during the siege of Leningrad). The well-documented experience has allowed scientists to measure the effects of famine on human health.		> The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study, carried out by the departments of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Gynecology and Obstetrics and Internal Medicine of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, in collaboration with the MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit of the University of Southampton in Britain, found that the children of pregnant women exposed to famine were more susceptible to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, microalbuminuria and other health problems.		> Moreover, the children of the women who were pregnant during the famine were smaller, as expected. However, surprisingly, when these children grew up and had children those children were thought to also be smaller than average. These data suggested that the famine experienced by the mothers caused some kind of epigenetic changes that were passed down to the next generation. Despite this, a subsequent study by the same author failed to find a correlation between maternal exposure to famine and birth weight of the next generation.		> The discovery of the cause of Coeliac disease may also be partly attributed to the Dutch famine. With wheat in very short supply there was an improvement at a children's ward of Coeliac patients. Stories tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse. Thus in the 1940s the Dutch paediatrician Dr. Willem Dicke was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat intake was aggravating Coeliac disease. Later Dicke went on to prove his theory.		> Audrey Hepburn spent her childhood in the Netherlands during the famine. She suffered from anemia, respiratory illnesses, and edema as a result. Also, her clinical depression later in life has been attributed to malnutrition.		> Subsequent academic research on the children who were affected in the second trimester of their mother's pregnancy, found an increased incidence of schizophrenia in these children.

{"body":"The Chinese have done extensive research on their energy and pollution challenges (e.g. [IET](http://english.iet.cas.cn/aboutus/overview/)) and National Bureau of Statistics.		In 2013, they consumed 22.4% (US 17.8%) of world total energy and produce 23.2% while emitting 27.1% of world CO2 emissions. Overall, it's low on a per capita basis (1/4 of US/Canada). From 1990 to 2013, energy consumption increased 3.8x or 6% annually.		Problem with their pollution: 		1. Highly dependent on coal (67%) vs US (20.1%) for energy production while US has much higher use of oil and gas. China has higher hydro production, but lower in nuclear until a dozen or so new reactors come online this year or next. Other renewables are negligible. Their domestic coal reserves are high, but have recently started importing. Their gas reserves are low and fracking has yet to begin due to the remoteness of their reserves and deeper locations (requiring more scarce water). 		2. Their industries are energy intensive and many have yet to be fully modern and more inefficient resulting in 30%-40% more energy use. They produce 48% of world cement, 49% of world crude steel, are #1 in many other energy intensive industries. These are low profit margin industries with high pollution (1 ton steel requires 600kg coal and 3-6 ton water for 60 cent USD profit in 2014). China's metals, oil and coal, minerals and chemicals contribute 9.6% of their GDP, but 52% of CO2 production.		3. They have made some headway. They put sulfur scrubbers on 90% of their plants (from 48% in 2007) with 14% reduction from 06 to 2010. NOx and COx are still problems, but NOx is declining since 2011. At Copenhagen, they made commitments to reduce CO2 intensity by 40-45% from 2010 levels by 2005. The three main factors to CO2 production are economic growth, carbon intensity (inefficiency) and industry structure in their economy. On Jan 1st, 2015, the [new Environmental Protection Law](http://www.acc.com/accdocket/onlineexclusives/prcnepl.cfm) give their EPA more power and greater enforcement abilities and a shitload more.

{"body":"As an American who has spent extensive time in China for work (~6 months total over the last 3 years), the pollution is pretty damn bad, to the point that it actually gave me bad headaches and mild nausea for the first couple days of my first two trips. This is not unique to me; I have a number of coworkers with similar experiences. I still cough up some shit for a couple days each time I return to the U.S. These experiences were in travels to Shanghai, Chongquing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Gaoyou, etc., all of which generally have markedly better air quality compared to Beijing. Hell, the air pollution index actually had to be expanded at one point because Beijing's numbers were literally off the scale! 		One of our vendors relayed a story to me of a European colleague his who moved to Beijing for work. This guy was an avid distance runner in his early 40s, never smoked, and who was the picture of health. He ran 10 kilometers a day in Europe, and he continued that routine in Beijing. He started not feeling right a little less than a year after moving to Beijing. He went to the doctor and found out he had terminal cancer that started out in his lungs. I don't remember how long he made it after the diagnosis, but I believe it was a matter of months as opposed to years. Yes, this is just one case, but that shit is scary shit. 		I'm not saying that people with little-to-no firsthand knowledge don't come on here and present their misconceptions as fact. I'm also not saying that the initial comment was entirely correct. Let's not, however, lose sight of the fact that air quality is still terrible in China. Yes, some steps have been implemented and there has been some degree of improvement, but the situation remains dire. I've actually worked with one of the guys who was a key figure in establishing China's emission reduction plan. He readily admitted to me that he is concerned about enforcement of the regulations. Chinese officials have a tendency to enforce regulations when the economy is doing well and they can afford to but look the other way whenever the economy hits a rough patch. I have seen examples of this firsthand. 		Again, you aren't wrong about misinformed commentary as steps have certainly been taken, but the environment is still getting bent over for the sake of China's economy.","depth":4,"score":78,"ups":78,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bailtail","name":"t1_cqtxv46","parent_id":"t1_cqtt2xt","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1430412724,"created_utc":1430409124}

Secondly, this study only pertains to a single type of particulate. It is an important category of particulate from a health standpoint, but there any many others that are also detrimental.

Over the past 30 years, China has flourished and the CCP has taken all the credit for China's successes. However, much hasn't changed politically during Mao's time, as the CCP has built itself on a singular idea: the CCP is the savior of the Chinese people against foreign aggression during Mao's time and the CCP is the savior of the Chinese people against poverty under the economic reform period. 		GDP growth and the CCP are so inextricably linked at present, that any change in the economic status of China might spell the demise of the Communist Party through "social instability" (rioting and demands from the populace). Why does the CCP care so much about being in power? Because the rampant corruption in the system in China ensures that [being in power is extremely lucrative.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-01/chinese-families-pay-16-000-for-kids-to-pass-army-entrance-exam)		Energy is the supplying force behind the entire socio-economic-political apparatus in China. In order for the top brass to continue lining their pockets, the CCP needs to stay in power. In order for the CCP to stay in power, GDP needs to grow. In order for GDP to grow, energy is required. Despite what Beijing says, China is not even considering reducing its energy consumption at present.","depth":2,"score":31,"ups":31,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"juzplanecrazie","name":"t1_cqtzbyi","parent_id":"t1_cqtrnj6","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1430414995,"created_utc":1430411395}

The effect of pollution on birth weight is higher for mothers with more education (They actually split out BAs and technical colleges), not the birth weight itself (well, it probably is, but that's not what they're reporting). There's a possibility that using some regression techniques they could be picking up on higher variation because the birth weights are higher to start with, but I doubt it (they're using local regression methods).

{"body":"Diff in diff is short for [Difference in differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_in_differences). The wikipedia article isn't too much help, but briefly it's a way of comparing the impact of some shock by measuring the before and after for people impacted against those who aren't, then subtracting the two. If that sounds really simple, it is!		For instance, if we wanted to look at the impact of raising the minimum wage (a la Card and Krueger, which is referenced in the WP article) we could look at employment before and after a wage increase both in the place where wages increased and where they didn't. This creates two basic problems:		* The two (or more) areas should be roughly comparable. Most non-statisticians get wrapped around the axle on this, but it's much easier to get around than the second problem. New Jersey and Pennsylvania might be slightly different in terms of policy, economic indicators etc. but you can get around that by looking at changes in similar counties or by developing a regression based measure of comparison, either looking at outcomes controlled for the same things or by picking comparable areas by matching other observables.		* The shock you're measuring may be (and often is) endogenous. For example, wages in one state may be raised because the voters feel that there is enough economic headroom to support the disemployment effect from wages. So if we just measure any old policy change we might be picking up some unobserved variable impacting both. We avoid this by using diff in diff in response to "natural experiments" (not always, but often), where something changes that probably isn't connected to likely unobserved variables. [This](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf) is a pretty canonical natural experiment. Not all natural experiments will use diff in diff and not all diff in diff is on natural experiments, but both are important for understanding how the other is used in practice.		There are a lot of other issues w/ the technique but there's also a pretty substantial literature on it, with good methods for avoiding a lot of them.

This post just makes it glaringly obvious and yet all we hear about is how America is the #1 suspect in global climate change.  Just because the communist Chinese don't report things correctly we allow ourselves to take most of the blame.  I'm not saying we don't need to clean up our act but I'm always amazed when I talk to people who swear that we are the worst because they read it somewhere and they don't even stop to think of what things in China are like.
