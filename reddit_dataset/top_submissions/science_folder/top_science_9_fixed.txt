{"body":"Hi Folks, I???m Chris Dove, one of the lead authors of this paper. [Proof](http://imgur.com/CX88Yce).  I???m normally not much of a redditor, but I thought I would step in and give my two cents on the discussion.  	Most of what the life scientists ITT have said about the paper is generally true (at the time that I???m writing).  They???ve correctly identified the primary strength of this paper being the use of ???primary??? cells.  These are cells that came right out of a cancer patient???s arm, and are about as close as we can get to real cancer.  I'm glad the paper has been generating some discussion, and wanted to give a (brief) author's perspective on some of the main questions.  		**Re: Is this something that we???ll never hear from again?**	Many ideas for cancer therapies fail ??? and they should.  We hope they fail sooner rather than later because that means fewer lives are put at risk and we don???t want to waste time and public money on therapies with limited potential.  Glancing through the science subreddit I see a lot of things that could be one-hit wonders, but many others with results that may be validated, expanded, and translated to the clinic.  It is my genuine hope that this study falls into the second category.  	**Re: Then what does this study mean?**	Take this study for what it is???preclinical data.  A layman???s one-sentence summary of the paper might read: ???We put signaling molecules on the outside of some leukemia cells, and this told the inside of the cell to stop behaving like cancer and start behaving like a useful immune cell.???  	If I had a drug that was able to replicate the reprogramming effect today (I don???t), we???re still years and years away from full approval by the FDA.  But that???s how science works.  Often discoveries that were made in the past only come to clinical fruition decades after their initial report.  I???d like to push this therapy as a real strategy, and we???ll see in the coming years whether I (and others) can generate the data to make that happen.  	To those of you who have been personally affected by cancer, my heart goes out to you.  Unfortunately we will never have a magic drug that cures all cancers, but we are whittling away every day.  This is, without a doubt, the most exciting time in history to be part of cancer therapy development, purely because we have more and more solutions to offer patients.

{"body":"Hi!  Sorry for the slow reply--lots of meetings today.  Your questions (all good ones): 	1) I'd be in favor of a small molecule that facilitates transition to a myeloid state, simply because it's a tried and true path.  Unfortunately, I can't say too much more beyond that, but you can probably take a guess at some of the pathways we'd target.  	2) Mouse models in B-ALL are tricky.  The spontaneous models of B-ALL aren't particularly representative of human disease (controversial point here), so we engraft human tumor cells in immunocompromised mice.  The question then is whether we can get these cells to transdifferentiate.  We're still working on this, but it's tough.  For example, the best way to deliver cytokines to the tumor cells is to go where the tumor cells live.  That means injecting cytokines into the marrow of (anesthetized) mice.  Not fun for the researcher, considerably less fun for the mouse.  	3) I wouldn't anticipate this being a problem.  First, these patients receive chemo that knocks out the vast majority of the tumor cells.  The problem is cleaning up the last bit of cells that will cause recurrence.  Second, although macrophages can be involved in autoimmune disease, I haven't read a lot about them actually mediating disease.  Usually that's a lymphocyte-driven phenomenon.

(Some things my professor mentioned were weak tumor antigens, antigen suppression by tumors, and overloading immune response by overly shedding antigens)		If this is the case, couldn't you take a piece of someone's cancerous cells and reform them into macrophages? Then these macrophages can detect cancerous cells, like some sort of super-macrophage. The super-macrophage could be re-injected back into the blood stream or at the site of the tumor, and then go and kill off the cancerous cells?		(Small clarification: not using a drug to create this response but taking cells out of someone's body to create reprogrammed cells tailored to that specific patient)		Would this actually work? Or are there just too many cells in the body to do this effectively? Would it create some sort of immune response that would require immunosuppresant drugs (and then consequently would this cause it not to be effective)?

Re: your idea-- Most of the time when people think about putting cells back into someone's body to fight cancer, the type of cells they use have greater specificity to the cancer cells than macrophages do.

The survival rate issue also depends on a lot of other factors though, most importantly chemo compliance. ALL treatment involves 2 full years of pretty much daily oral chemo, and a lot of that comes after patients are fully in remission and feel pretty much normal. You better believe that 6 year old Lil Johnny's loving, worried mother is going to make sure he gets every last dose of that chemo correctly. But you can also imagine that 26 year old John, who is responsible for his own medicine and lives on his own, is more likely to forget doses or blow off doctors orders and end up getting an incomplete course.

Since the survival rate is now so high, the newer, more radical treatments are limited to kids who have relapsed, maybe even more than once. Harsh chemo treatments must be replaced, but you can't give anyone a radical experimental treatment when the harsh chemo has been shown to save kids with the same prognosis.		Adults seem to have the attitude "I don't want anyone experimenting on me". The better survival rate of children has depended on parents saying, "My child is benefitting from the participation of other children in studies, therefore she should participate too." Also the kids in studies get very careful monitoring. Sometimes new monitoring tests have also been show to lead to a higher survival rate. For instance, the MRD test at 30 days started as a test to monitor kids on study, then it rapidly become part of the standard protocol when it was shown to predict who was going to relapse *before it would otherwise become apparent*. Doctors could divert the child into a stronger protocol.		If adults were equally willing to participate in studies, perhaps the mortality rate would show the some improvement.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"corinthian_llama","name":"t1_cpj0xau","parent_id":"t1_cpi84t6","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426707289,"created_utc":1426703689}

"to the masses" means that nearly everyone can afford it, so you pretty much defeated your own statement.			> Technological change is on an exponential acceleration curve.		Sort of. There is a limit to how fast things can change though, and there is a vast difference between theory, got it to work in a lab, and ready for primetime.		People were playing with Leyden Jars centuries before electricity changed everyone's lives. Programmable computers were described long before they were practical, and even if Babbage would have done a gangbusters business in 1837 with his difference engine, he couldn't have made more than a few dozen--hundred of them, and likely set up for very specific uses like tax bureaus.		Now we have institutional inertia to deal with as well. Once you start employing vast amounts of resources in a specific endeavor, competing systems become severely disadvantaged.		Look at internal combustion engines in North America vs Europe. Look at them vs electric vehicles. The only reason they have a shot today is because their underlying infrastructure happens to already exist for a different purpose, and there is still lots of resources.		Changing courses mid-stream is fairly hard, and while ideas for possible use come faster and faster all the time, our industrial capacity lags far behind, and our ability to assimilate them increases at an even slower pace than that.		On top of all that, there is "road not travelled" issues as well. We have had the capacity to start colonizing other stellar bodies for 50ish years. We aren't doing much of anything on that front, but man do we devote a vast chunk of resources to computer and network capacity and ability. This could easily have been flip flopped given a few critical choices in the mid 20th century, or not been so lopsided at least.		Will biotech prove to be the darling child of the 21st century? Nanotech?

{"body":"Sure! It's not that close to my field, so here are a few stray thoughts as I looked it over. It's worth noting that to really, truly appreciate a paper - its strengths, drawbacks, limitations, and exactly where it fits into its broader field - that requires more time than I have for this right now, but nevertheless here we go:		First up, damn. They submitted the paper in July of 2014, and it was accepted in February of 2015. That's 7 months, which is a good example of why so many scientists find the publication process frustrating. It probably includes an initial review, then getting the first reviews back to the scientists, then them having time to do more experiments to address the reviewers comments, which then has to get reviewed again but that's still a really long time.		Overall, it seems like a pretty cool paper to me. The top comment on this thread basically says it's "just another we killed cancer in a petri dish" study. Many times, that is a spot-on thing to say, but I think it sells the paper a little short in this case. One important experiment they did was that they took the reprogrammed cells, and did what's called a xenograft. That means they basically added those cells onto live mice, to see if it would turn cancerous. And the good news is that the mice generally didn't get and die of this particular leukemia, which is good! So, while that's not a purely "in vivo" result, it is a lot more "in vivo" than just doing cell culture in a petri dish.		Also, the general principle behind this finding is one worth paying attention to. Namely, it's the idea that transcription factors can be added to cells to re-program their identities. You might recall a couple years ago that Sinya Yamanaka won a Nobel Prize in medicine for converting mature cells into stem cells. In particular, he discovered that a cocktail of four transcription factors can turn mature cells into iPS cells - induced pluripotent stem cells.

There are tons of different kinds of cancers that require different approaches pharmaceutically, just the same as different subsets of the flu need different vaccines. Therefore the large workforce is divided across the many different cancer research projects. I'd say that the size of the workforce is not bottlenecking cancer research, except perhaps for the rarer forms.		B) Safety. A lot of the length of R&D is to establish the safety of the experimental drug. While cancer patients who are pretty much about to kick the bucket are allowed early access to new experimental drugs (their doctors can seek out a trial and have their patient enrolled), you cannot actually market a drug until it's proven safe. If they were to accelerate the development of such a drug, and then people who had a cancer diagnosis took the drug, were cured, but then 5 years down the road were developing another form of cancer at an unusually high rate, there would be lawsuits all around, the drug would be pulled, and all the efforts would be wasted.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GetOutOfBox","name":"t1_cphzzg0","parent_id":"t1_cphxhaw","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426625563,"created_utc":1426621963}

Cancer is really, really complicated.		There are a lot of really cool things being done in research right now. There is a company in CA that is doing genome sequencing on a persons specific cancer cells and then developing a targeted medicine to attack just those cells.

First of all this refers to a specific type of cancer, albeit one that is (relatively) common and has a very poor prognosis. B cell leukemia involves cancer of cells that are destined to become part of the immune system - they just had an error in the cell structure somewhere that prevented it from functioning correctly. 		I'm not sure how B lymphocytes and macrophages really are connected, its been a while. However:		???B-cell leukemia cells are in many ways progenitor cells that are forced to stay in an immature state,??? 		He doens't elaborate on teh pathway into forcing it into macrophages, which are a (related?) phagocytic cell that is part of the same hummoral immune system","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"akmalhot","name":"t1_cpi2q8j","parent_id":"t1_cpi2kfc","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426629775,"created_utc":1426626175}
