However, the chemical reactions we think give rise to life do not require gravity, they just require the chemicals are close enough together and have enough energy (almost certainly in the form of heat). That's part of why this moon is so great - it has thermal vents, which is to say it is leaking heat out of its core. It also has water, which necessary for life that is Earth-like, and water holds / moves the chemicals that give rise to life.  		One theory of life on Earth is that it came from an asteroid impact - something with very low gravity (because it would be relatively small) smashed into us, but was carrying the organic molecules that give rise to life on it.

{"body":"You know some of these answers are great! However they aren't really telling you much other then we have a probe with a camera since 2004. 		Did you ever wonder how we know what the Earth is made of? No really. We can't drill even 1/3rd through the crust of the Earth, the crust is thinner then the skin of an apple(If an apple was the size of the earth) and we can't get through that. Yet we KNOW what the Earth is made of. Not only that, we KNOW the Earth has a solid core made of iron.		Doesn't that just baffle your mind? Like how the fuck can we KNOW that.		Well many ways. We can build a model, and look for evidence that confirms the model.		We look at varying layers of rock, especially looking at stuff that used to be under the crust due to plate tectonics. This let's us know some of the composition of the Earth.		You know what's amazing though? Did you know you can tell if something is solid, liquid etc by sound? If an Earth Quake happens, if we know the strength it can literally ring the planet like a bell, sending a shock wave through the entire planet. This gives us a sound wave we can detect that tells us a lot of things. First Earthquakes aren't rare, so we get LOTS of data, we have good record keeping and timing so over a long time we could see the Earth has a solid plastic mantle, a solid iron core, and a liquid outer core. We then know the composition(Different percentages of elements) in the Earth and our data fits with models that show with our composition, size and density the Earth should of a solid iron core. We can demonstrate it!		What does this tell us about this moon though? Nothing I just wanted to tell you we don't need to "see" something to confirm it. In this case the probe orbiting it has instruments and cameras. Through those we can get data, and very clever people using the right models can infer and tell what's happening on a planet we aren't on if it can get enough data. We can look at the light and different colours can tell us exactly what elements are on the surface, we can get information on how things change on the planet indicating what's happening, hell we can even detect and see things being produced that can only be produced by X thing which fits the models perfectly.		We build a wall of evidence that fits the model and confirms the theory. We can do amazing things. It should blow your mind we know what the inside of the Earth looks like.

{"body":"Fire as we know it happens when a high concentration of a flammable substance sets off a chain reaction of oxidation.  Oxidation is when a substance combines with oxygen like from the ambient air.  Such a reaction releases a lot of heat energy.  The heat released by some of the material burning like this causes more nearby flammable material to oxidize as well.  And so on.  Heat released by burning causes more to burn, that's the "chain".		So much heat gets released in so short a time in such a chain reaction that the resultant oxidized gases ionize (atoms lose an electron, or have an electron excited to a higher quantum state by the heat) and then the atoms recombine with electrons again, releasing light, which we see as luminous flame.  These luminous ionized gases are also known as plasma.		Water itself does not burn, of course, because it is such a stable low energy molecule (the H's are already bonded with all the O's that they can handle).  		While flammable gasses and even oxygen can dissolve into water, water just can't carry enough of those gases for them to concentrate sufficiently to enable the chain reaction that we know as "fire".  		There have been accounts of "water burning" from a faucet near some fracking operations.  What's happening there is there is a lot of methane (natural gas) dissolved into the ground water.  When someone turns on the faucet, the water pours out, mixing with air bubbles and air in the room ... The methane releases from the water and can build up enough concentration near the sink that a fire can get set off.

One reason that Enceladus is interesting is that it's a lot easier to sample its geysers in a flyby than it would be to send a mission to Europa, melt through its ice crust with a nuclear reactor, and then explore its subsurface oceans with a nuclear submarine. (or whatever extremely sophisticated probe would have to be developed)  But the main interest in Enceladus is in looking for evidence of panspermia.

{"body":"> why this is true for some moons		Tidal forces (the gravitational squeezing effects) are caused by *changing* gravitational forces. There are two factors that determine how big this change is:		* the amount by which the distance between the moon and its planet varies over the moon's orbit, i.e. how non-circular its orbit is, a property known as eccentricity.	* how rapidly the gravitational field of the planet changes over distance, which is determined by the mass of the planet.		Enceladus' eccentricity is actually less than the Moon's, so the first effect can't explain the tidal heating.  	However, Saturn weighs about 100 times as much as the Earth, which means that the rate of change of its gravitational field strength is also 100 times greater. So Enceladus ends up experiencing a more than 100-fold greater variation in field strength (it's also closer to Saturn than the Moon is to us; the field strength changes more rapidly nearer the planet) and so it has more intense tidal heating.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nivlark","name":"t1_cpc0354","parent_id":"t1_cpbuycc","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426121284,"created_utc":1426117684}

{"body":"In the case of the earth there is energy transfer from the rotation of the earth to the moon, there is total conservation of energy in the system but individually the earth slows its rotation and so does the moon, at this point the moon is locked (energy minima), so to compensate and maintain conservation of angular momentum (of the system) the moon gets slightly farther away as it gets heated by the squishing effect of tidal forces. 		We are actually in a unique period of time where the moon is the same angular size as the sun, and being just a hair smaller allows for very intense solar eclipses with the coronal ejections visible. In a few hundred million years the moon will be too far away for total eclipses, the energy to push it out comes from the slowing of the earths rotation, but the reason it recedes rather than just heat up and melt is a result of conservation of angular momentum.		To demonstrate the significance of this effect, even though the moon has been tidally locked to the earth for a significant portion of its existence (evidence by the large disparity in the number of craters between the "day"/"dark" sides). It has moved almost twice as far as it originally was and the earth's day has lengthened to almost twice as long as it was when life first appeared (evidenced by fossilized ancient coral growth rings shows day cycles as short as 12 hours in the early earth).

{"body":"Just to clarify on tidal forces:		"Tidal forces" are caused by a gradient in the gravitational field. The part of Enceladus that is closer to Saturn (facing it), for example, is pulled more strongly toward Saturn than the side facing away, and this is due to the fact that the magnitude of gravitational force decreases as a square of your distance from the object of interest. This difference in gravitational forces causes there to be an overall net force on the otherwise freely-falling body which 'squeezes' it.		This gravitational gradient is not steep enough to be felt by a human. Only objects that are sizeable - *not necessarily* massive, as u/kenshinmoe says - feel large tidal forces.		It is not outside of the realm of possibilities for a human to feel tidal forces in some place in the universe. Near small black holes, for instance, the gravitational gradient is so steep that you would be ripped apart ('spaghettified' is a commonly used term among black hole researchers and theorists) before you reached the event horizon.

{"body":"Well, the gravity of both Jupiter and Saturn is so immense that it actually tugs on their moons while they are orbiting the gas giants. The orbits of these moons aren't exactly circular, either, leading to tidal gravitational effects on the surface and interior of the moons. Basically, during a normal orbital period of the moons the gravity of Saturn tugs the material in the interior Enceladus, causing motions in the tidal bulges that heat the interior of the moon via friction. Think of it like squishing a giant racquetball in space. As you compress the ball the atoms are smashed closer together and as you release pressure they rebound back, resulting in atomic motion or more specifically, heat. Over a large enough scale this can melt water ice near the core of the moon and a thick ice exterior insulates the interior rather well. In short, gravity from Saturn stretches and compresses the interior of Enceladus which heats it up enough for liquid water to persist. The outer ice shell protects the water from evaporating into space and insulates it so the heat isn't precipitously lost, either. 		Water buoyancy is great for ameliorating gravitational stresses, too. Think of blue whales here on Earth. Their mass makes it difficult for them to expand their lungs out of the water because they are not buoyant in air, but in the ocean they do just fine. Any potential native life would be well adapted to life under the ice sheets of Enceladus. It wouldn't be a nice place for us, however (either massive doses of radiation on the space side of the ice or crushing pressures on the underside).		This is from my own cursory understanding, though. I'm a molecular biologist so I don't think I have a complete understanding of the underlying phenomenon.

I'm no scientitian, but I expect that if the reactor was close enough to do any good, it's also close enough to do plenty of bad, too. The only reason we get away with orbiting the Sun as we do is that we have a robust atmosphere and magnetosphere to take the hard edge off. Enceladus has no such protection.		Nevertheless, assuming there's no life there and you're ready to do some terraformin', a sizeable reactor using the world ocean (or any body of water) for cooling could warm the place up some.		What you'll almost certainly never get to do, though, is traipse around on the surface like you could on the earth, and not just because of the comically low gravity. (Remember that a human only weighs about 1 kg on this world. The good news is that it's still big enough that you can't accidentally jump into orbit.) The world is not big enough to hold any kind of real atmosphere, and even if it could, you'd be subjected to radiation from all directions, without protection.

I read a [fascinating Panspermia paper](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/513781/moores-law-and-the-origin-of-life/) that examined the rate of increase of complexity on DNA.  It is an exponential value, with the number of *distinct* genes to doubling roughly every 376 million years.  Run the timeline backwards and it suggests the first DNA strands were created around 10 billion years ago to a simple enough molecule that it wasn't "life" at all.   They could have even formed in early nebula long before the cell wall was evolved.  If that's true then nearly every living thing we ever meet will almost certainly be from the same seed content and if it takes 10 billion years to reach where we are today there's a decent chance that no other aliens would have more than a few million year head start on us.		edit:  The full paper is linked in the article.","depth":2,"score":18,"ups":18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Pendaelose","name":"t1_cpbsr8n","parent_id":"t1_cpbr9c8","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426109071,"created_utc":1426105471}

I'm still not clear on the science myself, but as best I believe I understand it, simple life is thought to be easy, but complex life is not. Assuming that transition occurred at some point at least a billion years ago, I think there could well be complex life there.		What form it would take, though, is anyone's guess. All organisms are obviously bound by the same natural laws, so things like flagella, legs, and such are more or less obvious, given a need and adequate resources. At the same time, there's no solar energy inside this world, the only place that anything could live. There is only thermal energy, and maybe some chemical energy available depending on what's there.

{"body":""Sean Hsu, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder who helped to lead the team behind this new discovery, says the discovery happened in what was perhaps a counterintuitive way. He and his colleagues estimated the temperature, salinity, and approximate pH of Enceladus's ocean by studying the dust in Saturn's outermost ring. Really.		"We've known from quite early on that Enceladus was the source of the material in Saturn's [outermost] ring??? based on the ring's composition" Hsu says, "although we didn't know the exact mechanism for the material transfer." But the 2005 discovery of 125-mile-high icy geysers shouted out to scientists how Enceladus flung material skyward."  		Hsu and his team analyzed a class of dust nanoparticles in this outermost ring. Using Cassini's mass spectrometer tool, they showed that these dust particles were made mostly of silica, and that they were the skeletons of evaporated geyser-flung saltwater. These particles point toward warm waters on Enceladus.		How? It turns out that the exact size range and makeup of the silicate particles gives the researchers a stunningly accurate blueprint of the conditions that forged them. For example, if Enceladus's ocean were really salty (say, over 4 percent, which is a bit more than Earth's oceans) then the silicate particles would have chemically clumped together, former bigger lumps than were found.		Yeah, I don't buy it.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpbxsjj","parent_id":"t3_2ypaa7","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426116616,"created_utc":1426113016}
