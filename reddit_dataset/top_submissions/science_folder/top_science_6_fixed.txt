{"body":"Well lets put it this way, your are changing our immune systems from being natural to putting our immune systems/evolution into the hands of a private company for one. For example, the best form of immunity was for the mother to catch a disease and then pass it through breast feeding ( I get that nowadays catching things isn't practical because it may be fatal but naturally after decades our bodies would become immune to it and they wouldn't be fatal, just like parents used to want their children to catch measles at an early age as they wouldn't get it later on it life) but yes breast feeding, now 1. I would say 50% of parents DO NOT breast feed nowadays and 2. artificial immunity (vaccines) can not be passed on, this means every generation we are becoming more reliant on vaccines and naturally less immune. 		Another point, our bodies are fresh out the womb, less than a month old we instantly inject our newborns with chemicals such and mercury etc. these are known to be toxic and poisonous so even a little amount could affect a child's health. The one thing I say is for example, say 5 years down the line a child gets cancer, is it a freak of nature or is it their diet, is it vaccines. We do not know because when a study takes place they do not take into consideration, the long term effects. This is a big question I ask and point out to people... How reliable are these studies.		Also courts have issued parents with millions of dollars/pounds worth of compensation to vaccines damaged children, so their must be truth in this massive debate at both ends.

{"body":"Let me be frank (because Paul doesn't like me using his name); immunity doesn't work that way, especially with childhood illnesses such as polio and measles.  These types of diseases hit children hardest because their immune systems are naturally weaker than an adults.  Further more, measles was never something parents would want their kids to catch as the younger the patient, the more serious the disease can be.  Measles can cause life threatening complications as well as serious longterm problems such as blindness.  What you are thinking of is chickenpox, and that's a one hit wonder that has comparatively mild symptoms and little danger of killing/maiming you.		I'd like to see a citation for the idea that we are becoming naturally less immune given the fact that vaccines typically target life threatening diseases that are contagious enough that we never became naturally immune (I.e. small pox, polio, or more recently Ebola).		Further more, the types of preservatives and chemicals in vaccines are almost entirely safe unless you're one of the unlucky few who have an allergic reaction.  The mercury in vaccines is not elemental mercury (which is highly toxic), it's [http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal](Thiomersal) which, while mercury "based" is entirely incapable of giving you mercury poisoning as it has radically different chemical properties.		And in terms of the reliability of studies on the matter, this is much like climate change; every biologist, chemist and physician who works in the field agrees that vaccines have no link to disorders such as autism, nor are they markedly carcinogenic.  There is no debate. The experts have weighed in and found the evidence overwhelmingly on support of vaccines being safe.		As far as court cases go, that says more about the efficacy of lawyers and the fallibility of juries, to whit:		From Wikipedia:	"Vaccine court??is the popular term which refers to the Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which administers a??no-fault system??for litigating vaccine injury??claims. These claims against vaccine??manufacturers cannot normally be filed in state or federal civil courts, but instead must be heard in the Court of Claims, sitting without a jury. The program was established by the 1986??National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act??(NCVIA), passed by the??United States Congress??in response to a threat to the vaccine supply due to a 1980s scare over the DPT vaccine. Despite the belief of most public health officials that claims of side effects were unfounded, large jury awards had been given to some plaintiffs, most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production, and officials feared the loss of??herd immunity.[1]"","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"VariableCausality","name":"t1_cqkrtry","parent_id":"t1_cqkokqe","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1429713052,"created_utc":1429709452}

{"body":"As someone who is Autistic i've been waiting for the blind to be convinced that vaccines have no relation to the condition so that we can stop wasting time and learn more about us. I strongly believe that there is a way to help the lower functioning Autistics and i felt we have wasted a lot of time on this issue. 		Imagine feeling that you genuinely don't belong on this planet, you can't relate to any of the humans on it, and they refuse to help you understand yourself. It sucks. 		**Response to threaded questions:**		Male aged 26, Born in the United States. Due to a troubled childhood i only received what the hospital gave me at birth and what was required by the State of Wyoming. I never received follow up vaccinations or boosters until the age of 19 where i was required to get Tuberculoses Shots and a few others for leaving the country. My vaccinations in short, are terribly outdated. As a Graduate student of Microbiology i would encourage everyone to get their children vaccinated. 		As for those curious to the condition i would be happy to elaborate. As i was also a victim of child abuse and unfortunate circumstance, my experience will differ than that of a loving family. (Separation of Autism and PTSD) I must however express my distaste of most Autistic/Aspergers communities as they focus primarily on the family of those with the condition, and often misunderstand my people and focus on us as a second interest. 			In short its a battle of self awareness and something about those of us you call "higher" functioning is the key here, something in us is different than our lower functioning kind. I don't know what it is but its been too long that we have wasted recourses bickering about ways to eradicate my species and prevent our existence. I think its time we put forth effort into understanding and helping those who need help. Its hard to live in this world for anybody, we try but i don't know if we belong here. Many of us if given the chance and correct environment could contribute to humanity in great ways, but often we are left to waste away in overloaded and uncontrolled states of what is debatably "consciousness". 		For parents. A few basic milestone dates may be of interest to you. 		- Vocal at age 4. No prior attempts at language. Dissociated conversations. No baby talk. Started reading at 5 with high level of comprehension which helped me become very articulate for my age. Mispronunciations of certain words persist to this day but its a limited list which i work on. By age 9 i could hide any difficulties. Age 14 began studying undergraduate texts. 		- Coordination inapt. Walking was difficult as i can recall with precision to the age of 3. I could walk at age 3, however i couldn't mimic humans well enough. Walked much like a penguin until age of 7. I have several issues with my right leg due to not walking properly but i train in submission grappling and play several instruments. 		- I understood that humans were living conscious entities much like myself at age 14. It was quite an experience. Before that its hard to explain what i thought people were, i just felt that i was the only one alive. It could be an enhanced awareness of my developing brain that allowed me to be conscious of the changes. I would however think that children normaly become aware of this much sooner. Before that humans were apart of the pattern, i made calculations about future events and responded to them in a manner that my goals could be achieved. 		- My mind is never off. I currently use Cannabis to elevate this and can elaborate on request. I can recall the times faintly before i awoke. Its hard to explain. Its a deep pit of chaos from sensory stimulation and over anxiety to the point of non communication. In that place we are not human. My mind glitches when i try to remember what it was like and how i came out of it. This is often referred to as being "overloaded". I get overloaded from time to time and i have identified causes and created systems to avoid it. It must be said that another state exists that to me was the great dark, i feel that many lower functioning Autists are trapped in this place. Its pure hell. I have often wondered if a loving home can fix the dark, as i was forced to learn mimicry in order to survive. In that place its hard to achieve consciousness, its as if you are trapped in a tempest with only moments to realize you exist only to pulled back under into the obscurity of thoughts and calculation. I have seen it in the eyes of children with autism and you can see it in earlier photographs of myself. Its a battle of regression and progression and circular thought.  		- I stopped yelping at high frequency noises at the age of 12		- I stopped snapping my teeth together at age 14 but did so again from 17-19. (I have a canine bite)		- I stopped clawing my arms and legs at age 9		- I stopped hearing radio voices also at age 9		- When i first received prescription eyeware at 14 i went into a deep depression. The world was too much and i often refused to wear them. I now wear them while awake and can carry on normal activities. 		- My chameleon effect is mostly automatic now whereas in my childhood it took great personal perseverance and couscous effort to maintain the facade. A side effect is however i always wear a mask and i do not know what is underneath. Underneath is the great dark and i refuse to venture there. (This is how we mimic humans).		- Showing empathy is still hard for me to do. I started smiling Naturally (or it became an automatic process) at age 14 with great practice with a mirror. I can understand how others feel by observing the micro expressions in their face or subtle fluctuations in the voice but its problematic because most humans are not aware they are doing it which leads to conversations they are not ready for because they don't realize their own emotions. I am married which has put this to test. 		- I am extremely loyal to the few i keep close. Its always been that way. 		- I must be in control of the schedule and am most comfortable with planned activities. If its short notice or if a sudden change happens or if someone new becomes apart of it, i tend to overload.  Communication is key for any autist. 		- Sleep and anorexia: I managed to sleep a full 8 hours a day at age 18, i overcame anorexia during ages 18-21.	Sleep is very difficult. I sleep at 65 degrees and utilize a system of fans and ice packs to achieve this year around. I can't currently afford a weighted adult blanket so i use several thick blankets and my lovely wife holds me. I have found that pressure at the shoulders and feet/legs is the best. The fan is mostly to create a white noise so that the pattern of stimulation is constant and i can achieve sleep. I have found that stability of senses while sleeping is the best approach. 		- Becoming stuck in circular thought for hours is very common to this day, in comparison to the days spent in endless repeats as a child. 		- Bright lights no longer turn my brain off. 		- Info dumping is very common. I use learning as a coping tool and must teach myself something fairly constantly throughout the day. 	 	- Never the eyes. Its too much. I can force it now but it will **NEVER**  be natural to me. 		Here is an excerpt of my answer to ~~a previous~~  many questions about the eyes:	> Well to me eyes speak. They deliver concentrated information that is unbearable. The countless computations that glitch my mind when i look into someone's eyes makes me tremble is if at a great height. A high pitch that you can ignore deafens my mind with its intensity. I feel as if i can fall over with the weight of it. Eyes are windows to a person, i don't understand humans and there is too much unknown information being relayed and processed. Even now just thinking about it my brain starts to form circles. The intensity of emotion that is portrayed is too much at once for my mind to keep up with the chameleon. If i look into eyes my mask melts and i can't remain functional. 		Here is an excerpt of my answer to questions regarding the thought cycles:	>It took years of self observation to even realize the loops existed, as a part of a theory i had on why i annoyed people. I eventually learned with great effort to stop it for the first time 3 years ago. I struggle with this daily and i've never mastered control but i can say that i am now aware that it exists. A large contributor to the cycles is my analytical nature founded on early independence. I was forced to observe and understand humans so that i wouldn't die. Because of this i repeat every permutation of possibility that i can imagine to calculate the best decision for me to make. Sometimes there is no clear answer, or several viable options and so the cycle repeats, over and over with the same results. At times its simply too much possibility for me to handle and so in ignorance my mind repeats previous conclusions.		Here is an excerpt of my answer regarding questions of  self identity:	> I have no self. The self that i think i am is merely a construct of the various masks coming together. Much like how people act differently in varying situations i too change from place to place but its not superficial. There is a being under all of it that controls and maintains a line of structure but i can't express that being, i can only express the manifestations it creates to exist in a stable format. That lack of self expression is what makes me endlessly lost. I am not who i am.		To elaborate on my understanding of humans as living entities: See my reply to this comment.

I read your post to her as she is incredibly knowledgable and passionate about helping children with autism. She said you have gone into incredible detail in way you tell your story and life experiences. She wanted to know if you have ever considered writing a book about your life? Her other question before I even finished reading through your comment here was if you were an aspie. (No offense meant here by the way)		In talking about this article, I asked her what she thought caused autism, and like you said in comments below, she believes it has to be genetics. I cannot say I come close to the knowledge and experience my wife has, but I remember going to a conference with my wife a few years ago where the keynote speaker was Temple Grandin. Much of what she explained about how her mind works is what you wrote about above, but (I feel anyway) you've gone into even greater detail about the struggles within your own mind and what you do to cope with it on a daily basis. The way you describe it is rather easy for someone like me to understand as I have no idea what you or others like you go through with on a daily basis. But let me tell you that based on what my wife has told me, incredibly intelligent people like yourself are an amazing addition to our society. Don't be discouraged by the idiots that are out there or those unwilling to take a few moments to try to understand the struggles people like you go through. You may feel like you are alone in this world, but we are all still human beings, and while you may be different, we still need to be on the same page here when helping the fight for autism research.

I eventually learned with great effort to stop it for the first time 3 years ago. I struggle with this daily and i've never mastered control but i can say that i am now aware that it exists. A large contributor to the cycles is my analytical nature founded on early independence. I was forced to observe and understand humans so that i wouldn't die. Because of this i repeat every permutation of possibility that i can imagine to calculate the best decision for me to make. Sometimes there is no clear answer, or several viable options and so the cycle repeats, over and over with the same results. At times its simply too much possibility for me to handle and so in ignorance my mind repeats previous conclusions.		In short i become an unaware prisoner of my own decision making processes, where as you may be able to lose your train of thought or come to a conclusion that there is no conclusion, my mind races on. Its exhausting and hard to escape. 		Not circular logic, but yes to the latter. At times it can be the former. 		> Do you see yourself as kind of computer-ish, then?		Yes. Without calculation and protocols i can not function. Even trivial things took years of practice to become somewhat automatic. I often refer to myself as "the machine" in several of my artistic works. 		> What do you think makes it "human" that you don't normally have?		Several factors contribute to this:		-  The apparent lack of forethought and effort on the part of the human to experience and express emotions that are tied from one living entity to another. It seems "natural" to them. 		- Identify of self. I have no self. The self that i think i am is merely a construct of the various masks coming together. Much like how people act differently in varying situations i too change from place to place but its not superficial. There is a being under all of it that controls and maintains a line of structure but i can't express that being, i can only express the manifestations it creates to exist in a stable format. That lack of self expression is what makes me endlessly lost. I am not who i am. 		In regards to physical contact:		I never got the primal urges that other males experience during adolescence but rather i made it an elaborate experiment to understand the humans more. I was curious about sex. I tried it and decided it was pleasurable. Touch is something very difficult for me, i never honestly reached out to touch someone until i was 14 or 15 years old (around the time i realized they were real and alive). I get sexually aroused and i find women attractive and i fortunately find my wife attractive. However, this is only during times in which i am not overloaded. If i am overloaded i can go months without human interaction of any physical nature and experience zero wanting of it. Bear in mind i was heavily abused as a child and its difficult to separate the two causes of my behavior on this subject. You may find it of interest that i can't hold hands or kiss on the lips. Its too much. I must sleep with my hands wrapped in the blankets to prevent anything from touching them.

{"body":"> Are you saying that considering the totality of who you are and that emotional complexity is so overwhelming that it can overload you so much you risk going into that deep dark state?		Speaking for myself, it's more like I'm fully aware that I can't comprehend myself. If I was simple enough that I could understand myself, I wouldn't complex enough to be able to understand myself. The system is just too complicated to grasp in its entirity, even if given time to work through.		Normal Humans seem to delude themselves into believing that they *are* able to fully comprehend themselves. That seems a bit arrogant from where I stand, but I've often been accused of arrogance myself so I'm probably not the best judge there.		---		As for the Deep Dark, a term I am going to shamelessly copy for future use, that's... not a fun place to be in.		It's not Overload, though. That I can understand. I *know* what the things I'm experiencing in Overload are. I just can't process them fast enough, and my brain is *incapable* of not processing something. If any sensory data hits me, I can't ignore it. It is processed, and filed away in the proper place. So when too much comes in at once, or when I'm disoriented and have to play catch-up, there's a sort of pressure buildup. It can render me nonfunctional, for awhile. I don't exactly black out... but my brain just turns off all the inputs until I'm done processing. I've come out of it to people physically shaking me to get my attention, before. I think I *may* have nearly inspired a playground monitor to call an ambulance once, because she thought I had fainted. I recovered soon enough that she decided it was unnecessary. 		I've got a list of things to avoid, since they seem to contribute to a trip to Overload more than usual stimuli. High pitched noises are *by far* the worst, unexpected ones have sent me into Overload on their own before. Loud noises in general are also unpleasant, but I can cope with those if I know they're coming. Unexpected physical contact is bad as well, and touching in general tends to panic me. 		That touching thing might be from an prolonged case of harassment that involved an inordinate amount of groping in middle-school, which I don't care to go into further detail on.		Anyway, I spend a lot of time on stress and stimuli-management to cope with that. I can function. I just have to plan my day, and contingencies for any plausible events that might throw my day off. Unexpected situations cause an inordinate amount of processing lag, while my brain scrambles to put together a new plan without time or proper resources. 		---		The Deep Dark is more like a state where I'm not present at all. When I'm in overload, I'm still here. I'm just buried under a pile of tasks that need to be resolved. I eventually manage to crawl out from under all the things I need to process, but there isn't a gap in there I can't account for.		When I'm in the Deep Dark... I'm not anywhere. It's like I'm empty. There's no light, no sound, no touch, no smell. Just... nothing. There some *substance* to it, but I can't really find words that describe what it's like.

As a 21 year old male diagnosed with asperger's syndrome I have to say my immediate reaction was that my experience is so different to yours as to cause me to question the whole diagnoses.		Having read though some of your comments and thought over my past I think I recognize myself as having very very mild versions of a handful of what you mention. 	Loyalty to those close (I call it my kin group, though it's not just blood relations), Anxiety, Info-dumping (usually when I want to talk to someone about a topic and have already thought though a fair bit and want to bring them up to where I am), process-based thinking (first this, then this, then this, done) and overloads (though yours are far longer and more severe). I don't remember my childhood that well but I think I may have had more circular thinking when I was younger. I'm guessing this mainly because I have very strong termination responses to such thinking nowdays that forces me to *do* something rather than sit. 		The big base differences, which cause such huge experiential differences I don't think I can really explain how odd your experience seems to me, seem to be;		I was not abused.

My brain has an "idle" state where I will either blank out and not remember thinking about anything or more commonly slip into narrative patterns. (Like I will imagine myself as a fantasy hero or as a a wolf and try and experiences all the sensations in my head, kinda waking dreams but less vivid). I read a lot as a kid.		These days I tend to operate by trying to spend a great deal of time immersed with people I enjoy being around/seeking out novel experiences. This was a conscious effort against my own nature because of how much I enjoyed being active and how anxious I got when I spent to long alone. I tend to fill up a week with activities and then take time off to shut off from people as much as possible for somewhere between half a day to a day. (Alone in my room).

Abstract:	> The dismissive attitude of intellectuals toward conspiracy theorists is considered and given some justification. It is argued that intellectuals are entitled to an attitude of prima facie skepticism toward the theories propounded by conspiracy theorists, because conspiracy theorists have an irrational tendency to continue to believe in conspiracy theories, even when these take on the appearance of forming the core of degenerating research program. It is further argued that the pervasive effect of the ???fundamental attribution error??? can explain the behavior of such conspiracy theorists.

The major difference lies in how strong the emotional connections to the belief are. Imagine back for example to a time during which you still believed that electrons circle around their atom *like planets around our sun*. When you later got the information that this was merely a "lie for kids" you can most likely understand the process and move on to the next model without making a big deal out of it.		The other side of the coin would be akin to instead of just treating "like planets around our sun" as a piece of information associating that piece with strong emotions and an overall coherent view. e.g. "I *believe* that all physics professors are liars because *insert favorite conspiracy theory here*, I cannot imagine electrons being little clouds and considering so would mean refuting *see above*, also look at all these people smarter than me bringing solid evidence for my claim (*lack of competence in the field*).		If in such a case you aim to change the persons "belief" when it comes to how electrons revolve around an atom you can present all the facts, concepts and ideas you want: They will be blocked based on implying that an overarching, emotionally loaded belief that is essentially to the persons identity could be wrong. It's quite literally impossible to fight such an emotional topic with logic because of these connections.

Perktv is an app that pays you to watch game, app, movie trailers and various youtube shows. People started to believe so strongly that you would get banned for only watching the app trailers(because they tend to be short and you make more), that it was put in the faq. The only proof they had is some people who had only watched them and got banned for vague violations of the TOS.		It humored me that people thought people would get banned for using their service as intended. 		I used to see similar in gamblers who had systems versus video poker machines. it doesnt matter how many times they are wrong, once they have their system. And they figured out the "secret code" to winning at video poker without even a spread sheet of past hands. 		its similar to the autism thing, they witnessed one thing happening before another and it becomes a cause in their minds.

Since 1990, VAERS has received more than 200,000 reports, most of which describe mild side effects such as fever. Very rarely, people experience serious adverse events. By monitoring these events, VAERS helps identify new safety concerns, and helps make sure the benefits of vaccines continue to be far greater than the risks. VAERS data are monitored to-		Detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events		Monitor increases in known adverse events		Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events		Identify vaccine lots with increased numbers or types of reported adverse events		Assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines"*		And commission a study to do what?  Gather data on the possible adverse effects of vaccinations?  They did, it's called VAERS.  And how can you say the CDC has zero evidence that there isn't a cumulative adverse health effect?  That's not even a concern!  since there is zero evidence that there *is* a cumulative adverse health effect, they haven't (and rightly so) commissioned a study to study something that isn't worth studying.  The two major concerns of the anti-vax movement is 1) link to autism and 2) health effects of the preservatives used.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kaizen-rai","name":"t1_cqk5olb","parent_id":"t1_cqk4tik","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1429659181,"created_utc":1429655581}

A common misconception was (and still is), that all mercury is the same, but it's not:	???Methylmercury is formed in the environment when mercury metal is present. If this material is found in the body, it is usually the result of eating some types of fish or other food. High amounts of methylmercury can harm the nervous system. This has been found in studies of some populations that have long-term exposure to methylmercury in foods at levels that are far higher than the U.S. population. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury. 	???Ethylmercury is formed when the body breaks down thimerosal. The body uses ethylmercury differently than methylmercury; ethylmercury is broken down and clears out of the blood more quickly.  Low-level ethylmercury exposures from vaccines are very different from long-term methylmercury exposures, since the ethylmercury does not stay in the body.		[Source](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html)		The amount of aluminum in the preservatives is also negligible, even if administered all at once.  Our bodies have become quite adept at filtering out harmful bits of metal and chemicals it comes in contact with, with the obvious exception of high quantities.

The earliest signs were present in my daughter within the first couple of months, with gross motor skills delays within the first year. Unfortunately, many children are not diagnosed until preschool age or later.

{"body":"Allow me to play devil's advocate here for a moment, but let me begin with saying that I in no way believe or even fantasize that vaccines could or ever did cause autism.		During my undergrad coursework where I got my psych degree, I took a course specifically on Developmental Disabilities. The professor of this course had a strong stance that autism was not caused by vaccines in any way, but gave us a valuable lesson from the mother of a child she tutored. See, she works specifically with kids that have down syndrome or autism, teaching them basic life skills so they aren't so dependent on caretakers.		The mother of this child had a strong stance that vaccines did cause autism, and one night took the time to sit and explain it to my professor: This woman had three children, all three of which had autism with varying severity on the spectrum. You see, the main reason most people believe vaccines cause autism is that the red flags of developmental disabilities start appearing fairly close to the age which children are given their various vaccines. 	This woman in particular had all three of her children start to develop early signs of autism (not responding to their name, avoiding eye contact, becoming extremely interested in only one toy/activity) where they had none before. 		After her first child, she even took the precaution of having her second child vaccinated one immunity at a time; although it is more expensive, it is possible to vaccinate for measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, etc. separately. After his third vaccine, he began to develop early symptoms as well. She was crushed.	From this woman's point of view, both of her children only developed symptoms after she'd had vaccines, and neither her nor her husband had anyone in their bloodline on the spectrum.		So she'd had enough; she read some crackpot theory about vaccinating her child later, when the body was more prepared for the barrage of vaccinations, but continuing to breastfeed the child until they were three or so years old so that they had the immunities necessary to combat any of the diseases. She waited until this child was three years old, long past the due date for vaccines, breast feeding him every day until they had him vaccinated. She claimed that within hours she could tell it was happening again; he'd developed a fever, wasn't responding to his name, wasn't making eye contact, when he had been a loving and happy boy before.		For her, it was very clear that the vaccines are what caused her children to develop autism, and she told her story all over the states to try and garner support to have vaccines redeveloped in some way to lower the risk for others. Most anti-vaxxers have 0 reason to actually believe in the whole flub, but this woman practically did a science experiment to save her children the life-altering disease and still came up short. I feel bad for the poor woman, and it is probably the only instance I've ever heard where I actually thought, well, maybe?","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheDVant","name":"t1_cqk46o8","parent_id":"t3_33czht","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1429656618,"created_utc":1429653018}

{"body":"Let???s talk about Aluminum		Why? Aluminum is used an adjuvant whose job is to create a long lasting immune response to spark the creation of antibodies.  It is present in 23 different vaccines according to the CDC???s vaccine ingredient list. Among those are DTAP, Hep B, Hep A, HPV, and Tdap. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf?utm_source=wordtwit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wordtwit		What is Aluminum? Aluminum is classified as a highly reactive neurotoxin that has been shown in published scholarly research to cause cellular apoptosis or programmed cell death and is associated with neurological complications.		What is the concern? One needs to consider the adverse effects Aluminum may be having on the infant???s brain as it???s classified as a neurotoxin and has been shown to cause cellular death and neurological dysfunction.		???Let???s talk science??? Where is the evidence?		According to Current Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 18, Number 17, June 2011, pp. 2630-2637(8), ???Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated.???		According to the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry Volume 103, Issue 11, November 2009, Pages 1555???1562 on The Eighth Keele Meeting on Aluminium, the researchers examined the potential toxicity of aluminum hydroxide mice. After sacrifice, spinal cord and motor cortex samples were examined and the Aluminum-treated mice showed significantly increased apoptosis (cellular death) of motor neurons and increases in reactive astrocytes and microglial proliferation within the spinal cord and cortex. Morin stain detected the presence of aluminum in the cytoplasm of motor neurons with some neurons also testing positive for a hallmark of various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer???s disease and frontotemporal dementia. A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide which revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity. The demonstrated neurotoxicity of aluminum hydroxide and its relative ubiquity as an adjuvant in vaccines suggest that greater scrutiny by the scientific community is needed.		Current Inorganic Chemistry, Volume 2, Number 1, March 2012, pp. 46-53(8), found that ???A great deal has been learned about the neurotoxicity of aluminum over the past two decades in terms of its ability to disrupt cellular function. A large number of studies suggest that excitotoxicity plays a significant role in the neurotoxic action of a number of metals, including aluminum. Recently, researchers have found that while most of the chronic neurodegenerative effects of these metals are secondary to prolonged inflammation, it is the enhancement of excitotoxicity by the immune mediators that is responsible for most of the metal???s toxicity.  The author coined the name immunoexcitotoxicity to describe this process. This paper reviews the evidence linking immunoexcitotoxicity to aluminum's neurotoxic effects. ???		Immunologic Research, July 2013, Volume 56, Issue 2-3, pp 304-316, found that ???In young children, a highly significant correlation exists between the number of pediatric aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines administered and the rate of autism spectrum disorders. Many of the features of aluminum-induced neurotoxicity may arise, in part, from autoimmune reactions.??? A statistically significant correlation is seen when comparing data when the CDC started using vaccinations with aluminum adjuvants and when there was an observable change in autism rates. The countries with the highest level of aluminum adjuvants in their vaccines also have the highest rates of autism. This published article says there is a correlation based on their findings. And is it surprising given the results aluminum has on causing cellular disruption?		The Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry Volume 103, Issue 11, November 2009, Pages 1571???1578, found that ???Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is an emerging condition characterized by specific muscle lesions assessing long-term persistence of aluminum hydroxide within macrophages at the site of previous immunization.??? Long-term persistence of vaccine-derived aluminum hydroxide within the body assessed by MMF is associated with cognitive dysfunction and bone pain. The MMF lesion is secondary to intramuscular injection of aluminium hydroxide-containing vaccines, shows both long-term persistence of aluminium hydroxide and an ongoing local immune reaction, and is detected in patients with systemic symptoms which appeared subsequently to vaccination.			Well what about when we take in aluminum via our diet on a daily basis?		The delivery mechanism is completely different when ingested compared to injected.  When ingesting aluminum the digestive process and kidneys are able to filter out nearly all of the neurotoxin.  And the body expends a large amount of energy doing so.  An aside is, why is the body spending a large amount of energy making sure this gets expelled as quickly as possible? Anyways, after moving through the kidneys and digestive process the aluminum is eliminated after about 3 days. When injected as an adjuvant, who's job is to create a long lasting immune response, the aluminum does not pass through the kidneys and digestive process where it goes unfiltered straight past the blood barrier to the brain. The exact place a neurotoxin should stay out of.  As an adjuvant's job is to crate a long lasting immune response the aluminum is there to stay.  After all, the point of the adjuvant is to create a long lasting immune response and the aluminum being filtered and expelled wouldn't exactly be doing it's job would it?		Experts reply, there is a safe level of aluminum in the shots so there's nothing to worry about. I look at the information provided above and the countless other articles saying the same thing and I argue there is no safe level of aluminum adjuvants based on the findings above. I am not against vaccines; I am against injecting neurotoxins into our babies that clearly show adverse effects.		This evidence based research provided shows a clear indication of the dangers of Aluminum. It is a neurotoxin that does not belong in our children yet is recommended on a routine basis through the course of the current vaccine schedule.		Citations :	1.

A decent opinion, though it is important to note that the Wakefield Lancelot paper (the major paper that started the Anti-vax movement) focused exclusively on MMR, so if you're going to throw out this study, you need to throw that one to the wind as well.		If you really want to poke holes in this paper, the best way would be to say that it is too large. A sample of 95,000 could easily wipe out various sub-samples where an effect could have been seen. We don't have any information on how different sub-groups performed (or at least none at first glance). There's also a bias towards including more white children in the study (sample was only 3% black). Could this effect the results?

I would say 50% of parents DO NOT breast feed nowadays and 2. artificial immunity (vaccines) can not be passed on, this means every generation we are becoming more reliant on vaccines and naturally less immune. 		Another point, our bodies are fresh out the womb, less than a month old we instantly inject our newborns with chemicals such and mercury etc. these are known to be toxic and poisonous so even a little amount could affect a child's health.

As far as a child getting cancer, there is little to no way that you could do a study large enough and long enough to find that correlation, only because there are so many things that cause cancer in the first place.

Disproving theories is the basis of science.  The fact we continue to focus on this one regurgitated theory is because people still believe and don't vaccinate.  We're 100% certain that leads to more children dying and contracting serious illnesses.  So what would be "helpful" is if people would stop doing that.		>I'm pretty neutral about all this.

{"body":"Maybe I can help. There is no amount of research, studies, big name endorsements, shaming, ridicule, or threats that will sway some people as concerns vaccines. The reason for this has nothing to do with beliefs or prejudices.

It is, although it will come as a surprise to many, entirely possible to live a moral and healthy life without access to the results of mufti-million dollar studies and agency mandates. This is obvious by the fact that billions have done so to this point. It is not necessary to have a scientific study to tell people that standing in a bonfire is detrimental to one??s health. Nor is it necessary to have an expert to tell you that an enraged grizzly bear is probably left best with a wide berth. TO many, what is necessary and beneficial are things which can be learned from simple observation and the help and teachings of trusted family and neighbors.

If my neighbor has a refrigerator and I can see that his vegetables and meat stay fresh longer in the fridge than mine on the counter, I don??t need Sanjay Gupta to tell me that. If melting a couple different ore materials together yields a stronger weapon, no amount of ridicule or shaming will deter me at battle time. 		The point is that if the benefits of vaccines were even slightly obviously better than the alternative, there would be no argument. Do you remember when the government and movie stars had to shame and punish people into using cars instead of horse and buggy? How about the same for indoor plumbing and running water? Remember the days of the resistance to air travel? Nope. Me neither.		Every individual on this planet has their own will and knowledge. Not all knowledge is equal for all people. If you need to force or ridicule yours on someone else as opposed to simple reason and easily observable example, you may not be as correct as you think you are.

{"body":"My question would be why? Why do you think like that? Take the time and look where the original information came from. Autism caused by vaccines? Where did that come from? Let me tell you.		It came from a doctor by the name of dr wakefield. he did a study in the 1990s using a sample size of 12. TWELVE. Not only that, the specific study in question wasn't even about autism and vaccines. He simply 'correlated' the two together. As we all know, correlation does not mean causation. Dr. Wakefield, not only got that study retracted (an extremely rare occurrence) , he lost his license to practice and research medicine.		Here we have a sample size of 95,000. Its peer reviewed. Its telling you that vaccines dont cause autism.		I'm not telling you to blindly follow what any one says. Think it out on your own, figure out why you're blindly following a pulled research article not even about autism, just because some celebrities on TV said theyre not vaxing.		If that doesn't change your mind then look up the diseases vaccines are trying to prevent. Polio, Measles, Pnumonia, hepatitis. Would you want to risk your kids getting these horrible diseases when they can be prevented easily with vaccinations?
