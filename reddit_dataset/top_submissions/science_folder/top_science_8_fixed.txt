{"body":"I am the postdoc on this work and would be happy to answer any questions you may have.		[Proof](http://imgur.com/ZZsAqaF)		**EDIT:** thanks so much for the [gold](https://youtu.be/ntG50eXbBtc?t=45s). I will try to answer as many questions as I can. We are currently discussing whether to do an official science AMA in the future as well!		**EDIT2:** So excited this work is providing so much discussion. I will keep trying to answer as many questions as I can. Hopefully a full AMA can be arranged for this topic and a more general overview of our work at OSU.		**EDIT3:** Anyone know where to put reddit front page on an academic CV?		**EDIT4:** Thanks for all the questions. I'm going to break for dinner but will be back later this evening.		**EDIT5:** I had a lot of fun answering your questions. I will check back tomorrow morning to see if there are any more topics that have yet to be covered. Hopefully a full AMA on this and related research from our group can be arranged soon.

{"body":"The great thing about this kind of separator is that is repels the oil from the oil-water mixture so unlike other technologies used that tend to absorb the oil it won't require much cleaning. This is a continuous separator, oil rolls off the top of the mesh, water is collected under the mesh. This kind of setup could be useful for future spills.		Another advantage is that you can apply it to different materials like meshes or filters and that will help determine what size of oil droplet you can remove from the water. For bulk cleanup like at an oil spill, you can image a coarse separators to remove the vast majority of the oil, then finer filters to remove smaller oil contaminants.","depth":2,"score":1199,"ups":1199,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brit_chem_imagineer","name":"t1_cqddnog","parent_id":"t1_cqdd7p4","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1429124800,"created_utc":1429121200}

Money-making happens in one of two ways - either the IP is sold or licenced to another existing company, or the researchers / university people can start a spinoff company to commercialize it themselves.

Equilibration of the high oil contact angle (hexadecane = 80??) and low water contact angle (<10??) values occurs within 10 s of droplet impact. These optically transparent surfaces display excellent antifogging and self-cleaning properties. The magnitude of oleophobic???hydrophilic switching can be further enhanced by the incorporation of surface roughness to an extent that it reaches a sufficiently high level (water contact angle <10?? and hexadecane contact angle >110??), which, when combined with the inherent ultrafast switching speed, yields oil???water mixture separation efficiencies exceeding 98%.		So they added the nano-particulate silica to increase the surface roughness as previously suggested.
