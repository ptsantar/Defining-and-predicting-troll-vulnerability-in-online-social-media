Artificial selection is an evolutionary mechanic in that it is a driving force behind the evolution of different traits in certain circumstances. Such as calmer, stupider sheep and cattle.		However, what you seem to believe 'natural selection' is is the vertical transfer of genetic material from parent to offspring, which isn't the case. 		Natural selection is instead any natural pressure that causes certain genetic traits to be selected for. These traits can come about from natural point mutations (think single nucleotide changes in the DNA), larger genomic mutations (think translocation or duplication of large sections of DNA), or horizontal gene transfer (sharing genetic information between organisms, usually observed at the microbial level).

{"body":"Yup, and this is potentially an important factor in the establishment of permanent endosymbioses. You have a system that starts out with redundancies -- both organisms can function entirely on their own, and many metabolites, for example, could work for either one. Redundancy is not generally evolutionarily stable, since organisms that lose some of it through mutational damage are at no particular disadvantage to those who have the redundancy, so mutational damage persists to fixation. Your endosymbiont loses a couple pathways, your host loses a couple pathways... and voil?? -- you have mutual dependency, without even requiring an overall selective advantage in the process. 		We're starting to find more and more random bacterial endosymbionts in various protists. There's even intraspecific variation -- some populations within a species can have symbionts, others don't -- and some weird stuff ensures that those who do have symbionts can't easily lose them: as in the case of "killer" Paramecia (ciliates). The killer bacterial symbionts somehow render their hosts toxic to Paramecia who don't have those symbionts -- you can imagine how a population very quickly becomes exclusively symbiont-bearing. There's a very sharp short-term adaptive advantage to having those killers, even if they're not actually helping the host in the long run. If you lose those killers, you die. If this situation persists long enough, the killers can't live easily outside their host either. Paramecia tend to have fragmented populations, and the geography of this killer phenomenon is not understood -- but it arose many times independently, in different Paramecium species and with different bacterial phyla. But here's an example of how endosymbiosis can become fixed without even conferring an obvious long-term advantage to the host like photosynthesis would.		Also, note: traditionally, 'symbiosis' means just a close interaction between two organisms. 'mutualism' is what people usually mean by 'symbiosis' nowdays. By 'endosymbiont', I just mean 'one thing inside another' -- since the nature of many of these relationships is poorly understood, it can mean anything from rosey mutualistic friendship to vicious parasitism by one party of the other.

EDIT: From that Wikipedia article:  	  	>* Analysis of DNA sequences suggests that horizontal gene transfer has occurred within eukaryotes from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to the nuclear genome. As stated in the endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts and mitochondria probably originated as bacterial endosymbionts of a progenitor to the eukaryotic cell.[37]  		>* Horizontal transfer occurs from bacteria to some fungi, especially the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[38]	>* The adzuki bean beetle has acquired genetic material from its (non-beneficial) endosymbiont Wolbachia.[39] New examples have recently been reported demonstrating that Wolbachia bacteria represent an important potential source of genetic material in arthropods and filarial nematodes.[40]	>* Mitochondrial genes moved to parasites of the Rafflesiaceae plant family from their hosts.[41][42] from chloroplasts of a not-yet-identified plant to the mitochondria of the bean Phaseolus,[43] and from a heterokont alga to its predator, the sea slug Elysia chlorotica.[44]	>* Striga hermonthica, a eudicot, has received a gene from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) to its nuclear genome.[45] The gene is of unknown functionality.	>* Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) contain multiple genes from fungi.[46][47] Plants, fungi and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene made by pea aphids is the only carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom.[46]	>* The malaria pathogen Plasmodium vivax acquired genetic material from humans that might help facilitate its long stay in the body.[48]	>* A bacteriophage-mediated mechanism transfers genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nuclear localization signals in bacteriophage terminal proteins (TP) prime DNA replication and become covalently linked to the viral genome. The role of virus and bacteriophages in HGT in bacteria, suggests that TP-containing genomes could be a vehicle of inter-kingdom genetic information transference all throughout evolution.[49]	>* HhMAN1 is a gene in the genome of the coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) that resembles bacterial genes, and is thought to be transferred from bacteria in the beetle's gut.[50][51]	>* A gene that allowed ferns to survive in dark forests came from the hornwort, which grows in mats on streambanks or trees.

CRISPR provides a basic bacterial "immune" system by incorporating genetic information from previously encountered phages and using that information to produce templates that will allow special proteins to recognize that viral sequence and destroy it. We can take advantage of this process.			>Since 2013, the CRISPR/Cas system has been used for gene editing (adding, disrupting or changing the sequence of specific genes) and gene regulation in species throughout the tree of life.[7] By delivering the Cas9 protein and appropriate guide RNAs into a cell, the organism's genome can be cut at any desired location.		>It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[8]  	  	and  	  	>Editas Medicine, a $43 million startup, aims to develop treatments that employ CRISPR/Cas to make edits to single base pairs and larger stretches of DNA.

The "corrected" gene remains in its normal location on its chromosome, which preserves the way the cell normally activates and/or inhibits its expression.[100]		>After harvesting blood cell precursors called hematopoietic stem cells from a patient's bone marrow, CRISPR gene surgery would correct the defective gene. Then the gene-corrected stem cells would be returned to the patient's marrow, which would then produce healthy red blood cells. Replacing 70% of the sickle cells would produce a cure.[27]		>Other pathologies potentially treatable by CRISPR include Huntington???s disease, aging, schizophrenia and autism, not to mention modifying DNA in living embryos.[27]		>Improved targeting is required before CRISPR can be used in medical applications. Current guide RNAs may target sequences that differ by multiple base pairs from the intended sequence.[16]		>In 2014, UCSF researchers used CRISPR to create disease-free versions of induced pluripotent stem cells of beta thalassemia patients.[101]  	  	This is really, really important technology.","depth":3,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"supermegaultrajeremy","name":"t1_coaipp5","parent_id":"t1_coai94x","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1423018375,"created_utc":1423018375}

{"body":"Not at all.		What happened here is called horizontal gene transfer. Which means that a gene has passed from one species to another without sex. 		It is frighteningly common among bacteria, who actually have specialized chunks of DNA called plasmids that they can exchange with each other. This is a very real concern when dealing with antibiotic resistant bacteria.		Hospitals are constantly battling bacteria that have built up resistance to different types of antibiotics. If multiple species of resistant bacteria come into contact with each other, then there's a chance that one of them will receive resistance genes from the other, resulting in a new strain that is resistant to both antibiotics.		This has occurred multiple times in hospitals around the world and now we're dealing with superbugs like Totally Drug-Resistant tuberculosis.		Among more complex organisms, HGT is much rarer but it does still happen. Most often it's caused by viruses. You probably understand the basics of how viruses work, they incorporate their DNA into the host cell's DNA. The viral DNA takes over the cell and forces it to construct more viruses to infect more cells.		Sometimes though, bits of host DNA gets mixed up in the new viruses. Additionally, sometimes when a virus inserts it's DNA into the host cell something goes wrong and it doesn't make new viruses. When these happen together, that's horizontal gene transfer.		Some bacteria are known to cause HGT as well. [Agrobacterium tumefaciens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrobacterium_tumefaciens) is one that is very frequently used in making genetically modified plants.		Some species can even preform HGT all on their own. [Bdelloid rotifers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotifer) are small organisms that commonly live in puddles. They have the ability to survive being dried out thanks to enzymes that reassemble their DNA upon rehydration. These enzymes sometimes pick up random bits and pieces of DNA from the environment. This trait has let them survive even though they lost the ability to sexually reproduce millions of years ago. By picking up random bits of DNA they're able to continue evolving even though they only reproduce asexually.		And that's just a few examples of HGT, which is just one particular evolutionary mechanism. An even faster and more common (in plants at least) mechanism is whole genome duplication.		If you cross two plant species, one of which has 10 chromosomes and the other with 12, you'll get a hybrid offspring with 11 chromosomes. This odd number can't pair off in meiosis and so the plant is sterile. To fix this, the plant will simply double it's genome and end up with 22 chromosomes.		This new plant is usually unable to reproduce with either of the parent species, so it instantly becomes a new species.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"blacksheep998","name":"t1_coaeqh9","parent_id":"t1_coadbmw","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1423011180,"created_utc":1423011180}

Keep in mind that just because these proteins are not living does not mean that natural selection did not apply. Early cells would develop the ability to synthesis energy from light, and produce oxygen gas (!!!) which is lethal to most proteins (think oxidation), which selected protein structures that could resist these effects, usually through the development of protective shells and essentially becoming bigger proteins, which would eventually create the first predators, simple cells that were diverse enough, and large enough to engulf other cells, deriving energy by using the photosynthetic properties of the engulfed cell. This benefits the organism by making it harder to kill/starve and allowed engulfed cells to function in a (relatively) stable environment.
