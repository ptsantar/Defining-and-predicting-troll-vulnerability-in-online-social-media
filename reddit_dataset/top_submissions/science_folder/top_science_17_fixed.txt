{"body":"It's a lot less bleak than us being able to do nothing and just watch people die... aka [the alternative medicinal approach to cancer.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Death)		EDIT: I am so sad to hear of the stories below. I really think, like most things, anti-western approaches to cancer treatment come from an ignorance of what the disease actually is. People think that cancer is some unnatural result of our modern world (which in some cases, and some ways, is true). But cancer has existed as long as there has been biological organisms. Cancer is an extremely *natural* disease. It is our own body, our own cells essentially getting bad instructions or confused signals and thus grow in ways that damage the functional and important parts of our body through inflammation or the blockage of important functions. It is a change of the cell types, and thus losing their proper function. Everybody gets cancer all the time, it's just that our body is prepared (999 times out of a 1000) to catch it and deal with it without our knowing or intervention. It's just that sometimes, in some people, with some bad luck things get out of hand... and the cancer grows too powerfully to be stopped by the body's immune system alone. The cancerous cells break off and get into the bloodstream or lymph stream and spread to the rest of the body (metastasis, stage 4 cancers) and spread all over the body to grow in places they shouldn't, further causing countless problems until we die.		Understanding all this allows one to fully understand how and why we western doctors use the drugs/chemo/radiation therapies we use. Antibiotics have little side effects because they can specifically target things in bacteria that do not even exist in the human body, because we are evolutionarily so different. But cancers are our OWN cells... so how can you design a drug to kill a cancer cell that doesn't kill the rest of our good cells? That's the challenge of the oncologist, and all the pharmaceutical researchers who spend their entire careers trying to come up with better and more specific treatments. And you know what? They've been incredibly successful in the last half a century. Drugs *are* becoming more specific, more targeted to individual cancer types. We're a long way from having side-effect-free cancer treatments (and honestly, that's probably never a possibility given the nature of the disease), but we've made great strides. Cancers that used to kill 80-90% of people who got them, are being caught earlier with good screening in high-risk populations and are being treated successfully. There are many cancers that used to be a death sentence that are not routinely stopped in their tracks. Unfortunately, again, we still have a long way to go, but the future is bright. Medical research needs more funding. And not just the big names like breast cancer, but also prostate cancer and stomach cancer, etc. It *all* deserves funding and smart, passionate people who can creatively come up with new ways to tackle these problems. 		What it *doesn't* need is more ignorance, more disdain for the medical professionals who spend decades studying these things to save people's lives who don't *have* to study any of it in order to receive the benefits of such hard work. We don't need more naturopaths, or acupuncturists, or chiropractors claiming that chemo is "all bad, unnatural poisons", or that they have any kind of treatment that is effective. What are their methods? They don't study shit about cancer, except for traditional quackery not backed by any significant research. (I'm only speaking to their approach to cancer, right now, I'm NOT saying we don't need alternative medicine... don't misquote me or misunderstand me)		/rant","depth":8,"score":208,"ups":208,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"losangelesgeek88","name":"t1_cofc9dn","parent_id":"t1_cofbzah","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1423432899,"created_utc":1423432899}

{"body":"One was a "Tibetan Doctor," whose qualifications stemmed from that he worked extensively with natural remedies back in Tibet as a village medicine man.  Long story short, a lady I networked with regarding bladder cancer, since both our parents had it, was trying HARD to convince her father NOT to see this man.  Her father's cancer was aggressive, but early stage.  The best option he had was to have his bladder surgically removed, cutting the cancer off from spreading outside of the organ.  He was vehemently opposed to that idea and claimed the oncologist didn't have his best interests at heart.  So her father sought the Tibetan doctor who offers his services from a hotel room in Brooklyn.  The guy literally has a line out of the door composed of people that shared her father's opinion about modern medicine.  And the way the story ends, the Tibetan doctor put her father on vitamin therapy, her father's cancer eventually spread, and he died a painful death as the disease attacked his kidneys and bones.			The other guy was a "healer" who touted apricot seeds as a way to treat cancer, since they contain cyanide.  With enough cyanide in the body, the cancer would die.  He's now showing signs of his cancer returning in the worst way possible and refuses to believe otherwise.		The Tibetan guy claims to be a doctor back in his country, but outside of that, I have not heard of people pressing him for credentials.  He doesn't stay in one location for too long.  He'll be in point A for a month and then fly out to point B, returning back to point A later to refill prescriptions for the dedicated nuts he services.		Are these men doctors?

{"body":"I'm watching this play out in my SO's family right now.  Paternal grandmother passed away a year ago of cancer, paternal grandfather is diagnosed a year later, and the two of them were long-time proponents of alternative medicine.  		Grandmother chose alternative meds and passed away in incredible discomfort, and only went to a western doc after several weeks of agony thinking it would just be acid reflux.  Even after diagnosis, she disregarded the docs' advice in favor of whatever her herbalist sage recommended, and maybe made it another two months.		Grandfather's diagnosis is recent (a couple months at most), and it's not clear what he'll do yet.  I already know SO's dad is a fan of alternative medicine... I listened to a 1/2 hr. treatise on how all of life's woes can be salved by picking the right plant, that it's all right there and we're ignoring it because of the words of some self-proclaimed medical experts.		On the maternal side of the family, the daughter of SO's cousin had serious cancer as a toddler and shook it, and though they accepted the chemo and everything the doc suggested they also credit their behind-doc's-back use of alternative meds with the child's recovery.

{"body":"Cancer stem cells. 		The (very) basic idea is that there is a population of one to a few cells that are actually responsible for tumorigenesis and that these cells are actually stem cells.  Well, we have had a solid model describing the first part of that statement for a while: one cell acquires several mutations that allow it to rapidly divide when it shouldn't, resist cell death when it shouldn't, and other other sneaky things that ultimately leads to tumor formation.  All of the cells that make up the tumor therefore should be "clones" of the original bad guy (though this isn't the whole story, for the sake of simplicity I'll leave it at that).  		So, conventional therapy involves targeting specific elements of these clones. The most commonly targeted aspect is rapid cell division. But there are many problems with this strategy.  For our purposes, the main problem is that these tumors come back, even if treatment appeared to kill all the clones.  So someone had the bright idea that maybe there was another population of cells in the tumor that wasn't rapidly dividing but could still make a whole tumor in the short time span that we see relapses in these patients.  		But that's a paradox: how can a population of cells that is too small to detect form millions of tumor cells without rapidly dividing? Well, the only thing we know that can do that is a stem cell, which divides asymmetrically.  This means that every time a stem cell divides, it produces one cell identical to itself, and one daughter cell that is different that can go on to eventually become a totally different cell or several totally different cells.  This solves our paradox, as the stem cell does not divide rapidly but the daughter cells can.		The proof for this phenomenon is actually fairly strong.  If we take a solid tumor and pick out the stem cells, these cells can form tumors when injected into a mouse.  In fact, sometimes only 5-10 of these cells are required to form the tumor.  On the other hand, if we take all the cells that are not stem cells and inject them into a mouse, tumors will not form even if we injected 100,000 of these non stem cells.		Make sense?		Full disclosure: I am not a csc guy nor do I fully buy this theory.  The truth, I think, lies somewhere in between the two models I described. Also, Cancer is super general term so what may be true for cancer A may not be true for cancer B.

{"body":"Oversimplified: the mitochondria in a cancer cell have been compromised and so allow the cell to use glucose for fuel, which in turn feeds pathogens. 		In a normal cell the mitochondria - rather like a gatekeeper - are what determine the cell will use oxygen. 		About 100 years ago, Dr. Otto Warburg (Nobel Prize winner) discovered that cancer is anaerobic - it does not like oxygen. When we say that this or that virus can cause cancer we're pointing in the right direction. A virus can normally be destroyed by our immune system using oxygen - first there is detection of the antigen, then the pathogen is surrounded by neutrophils as though it were being eaten by a blob. There is a Russian doll sort of action that comes next - the neutrophil engulfs the invader with hypochlorous acid which in turn releases nascent oxygen, which blows the virus to smithereens by tearing it apart at the electron level. 		This shows why oxygen is death to a cancer cell. If a cell pulls in oxygen as fuel, any indwelling virus will be destroyed and the cell will return to it's normal schedule.		Doing pretty much opposite of what this study suggest is actually a proven therapy.  If you either have brand new mitochondria forming, or if you restore the existing mitochondria to a normal state, a compromised cell will stop using glucose as fuel. Any internal pathogen will then die and the cell will basically return to normal - dying if it was supposed to have died. That is where the interest in therapies involving mitochondrial repair come from. Strange that a lot of this stems from 100 year old studies.

Otto, back in 1923, thought that tumorigenesis was caused by a complete shutdown of mitochondrial activity (and oxidative phosphorylation), but that has been shown to not be the case. As a consequence, cancer cells predominately rely on glycolysis for their energy production (ATP). This conveys a variety of protective effects to cancer cells, including helping them protect themselves from apoptosis (programmed cell death). 		This effect was capitalized on for the development of FDG-PET scanning for tumor imaging, but has more recently been identified for the creation of a therapeutic window. If you can shut down glycolysis, for example, healthy cells will rely on OXPHOS, but cancer cells won't be able to.		I'm currently in a lab that specializes in this research.

An analogy would be a weeding technique that is evaluated based on how low it can chop the weed stalks???but no matter how low the weeks are cut, if the roots aren???t taken out, the weeds will just grow back."

Dogs were supposed to get chew toys and stuff but it didn't seem like anybody was actually really in charge of that so it didn't happen much.  I did raise a bit of a stink about it once and they ordered like $2000 worth of toys though.   		Rabbits got toys to play with.  Oddly enough, they would be given metal rings, like the screw on lid part of a mason jar (minus the inner part).  The rabbits really did seem to like to play with those things.  		Some individuals would give some animals attention sometimes, if they really wanted to and they had time.  Most didn't want to, as it would make it extremely difficult to do your job if you bonded with the animals.   Secondly, they were often busy as hell and just didn't have time.   		Some of the more experienced monkey researchers were pretty good about it.  		I liked to pet the dogs when I could.  I'd try to play with them sometimes while 'exercising' but they didn't want to spend their precious time on or with me once they got out.   Except this one dog.  I picked him up and put him in my lap.  Every other time I'd ever tried that they would be cool with it for about 3 seconds then want to go play.  I didn't blame them.   Except one dog, he stayed right there and didn't want to go anywhere and then fell asleep in my lap.

{"body":"Dear lord, this article reads as if it was written by an eight year old! There are tons of problems with this paper, not the least of which is that they don't even show that the antibiotics they test actually affect cancer stem cells. They only use standard cultured cancer cell lines. And importantly, they are not even measuring viability of these cells in the presence of antibiotics, just tumor sphere formation. Then they don't even check whether normal sphere formation for certain non-malignant cell types is unaffected, (i.e. human ES cells). So it's completely comparing apples to oranges. 		It's important to mention as well that there isn't 100% agreement that cancer stem cells even exist. And if they do exist, whether they are present in all malignancies, and what characteristics define them. Not to mention, antibiotics in culture can affect cell line growth, that is why a lot of researchers try not to consistently use them in culturing human cells. Many stem cell lines aren't even supposed to be cultured in the presence of antibiotics. I don't know what the circulating levels of antibiotics in the body are for the ones they tested, but they may be much, much lower than what they can dump in a dish of cells. 		There also isn't complete evidence that all types of cancer cells have high levels of mitochondrial biogenesis. And they haven't shown that "biogenesis" (which is itself a fairly vague term) is being affected in the cell lines they're using. Plenty of cancer cells within tumors (which a low oxygen environment) may downregulate aerobic respiration. 		Now there may be tractable anti-cancer targets with regards to mitochondria, and there's plenty of cool cancer mitochondrial biology work being done, but I am hugely skeptical that anything has actually been proven in this paper.

There won't be one cure or one treatment. Treatments in the future will be tailored.

The general jist is that all cancer treatments(chemo, antibodies, etc) have detrimental side effects and are far too blunt.

The reason people use these treatments is that they're better than the alternative of keeping the cancer.

{"body":"I've been trying to come up with an answer to this for over an hour now. I'm sorry but I don't think I can give you a good enough answer. There's just too much that I don't know.		I do know that cancer cells grow very quick, and use up a lot of energy, which is provided by the mitochondria. This treatment is supposed to affect cancer cells because of their high energy demand. 	Cells have ways of destroying mitochondria and making new ones, because mitochondria are sometimes damaged. So this treatment is likely to affect this process.		I don't know for example how long a neuron could survive without being able to make new mitochondria, but I imagine it can't be too long. 	I think for this treatment to work without leaving permanent side effects you'd have to get treated just long enough so that the cancer cells get damaged beyond repair, without damaging your neurons.		I did come up with an analogy though...	Imagine you have 20 healthy adults. 10 of these are cancer cells, 10 are your neurons/ muscle cells. You make everyone stop eating at the same time. You tell the neurons/muscles to run at 50% of their max speed, and then tell the cancer cells to run at 100% speed (so they're using more energy). After a couple days of just running with no food, you might have some dead cancer cells, but you might also have some dead neurons/muscle cells. 		TL;DR: I don't know.

{"body":"One thing to note here is that they were targeting cancer STEM CELLS, not cancer cells. There is a slight difference. Cancer stem cells are stem cells (e.g. stem cells in the skin, intestine, testes, bone marrow, etc) that have become cancerous and are thought to initiate recurrent cancers. Our current chemo options target cells that divide very quickly, but cancer stem cells divide very slowly (the cells they turn into after division would be more like traditional cancer cells and divide quickly). This means that traditional chemos kill the "offspring cells" of cancer stem cells, but not the actual source of them (the stem cells). This would lead to recurrence of the cancer pretty quickly b/c the source is still alive and well. If this therapy works, this would be a great way to go right to the source of these cancer cells.		However, the idea that these cancerous stem cells could contribute to cancer is pretty new, and right now is frankly just a hypothesis. Right now scientists are still gathering evidence that they even exist (which is pretty convincing evidence, btw). It's thought that a very low number of cancers would be caused by cancer stem cells, but the ones they do cause would be very difficult to fully treat and likely to recur.

{"body":"Cancer is rapid unchecked cell multiplication. A tumor is just a bunch of cells growing without organization basically.		For a cell to grow and multiple, it uses a lot of energy.		Mitochondria is the organelle of a cell that is the cells "energy source". It basically converts food energy into cell energy that the cell can use to perform functions, such as growing and multiplying.		Since cancer is unchecked growth of cells, it's likely that something that cancers have in common is increased mitochondria usage.		Antibiotics as far as I know are drugs that target a specific cell mechanism that causes the cell to be unable to grow and multiply. For example, penicillin blocks an essential part of bacteria that is required for successfully splitting one cell into two. This part is not found in human cells so the antibiotic prevents the bacterial cell from splitting but (ideally) has no effect on the human.		So this article describes an antibiotic that specifically targets mitochondria. Because cancer growth may be connected to high mitochondria usage, such an antibiotic would target cancer cells more than the rest of our cells. This would cause cancer cells to be unable to grow and multiply. This would prevent tumors.		This, however, would likely still target a lot of our other cells, likely resulting in bad side effects, but hopefully not as bad as the cancer cells.		I'm not a cancer researcher.

This is achievable because some types of cancer are related to increasing energy production through very active mitochondria, which is then more susceptible to antibiotics compared to the normal cell.

{"body":"You are not quite correct. Fresh Neonates and babies in the womb have 'embryonic' stem cells which can quite literally become any cell type. For a long time scientists didn't quite know that the human body actually possess multiple types of stem cells. Today, we are aware of many types of stem cells, some of which can become many different types of cells, even in adults! Of course, they aren't as easy to manipulate and it has taken decades of research for us to get to the point where we can treat these progenitor stem cells with various growth factors and chemicals to influence them to become other cell lines. Yet in the human body, even as adults, we have several different types of stem cells that are able to further differentiate into a variety of useful tissues. For example, satellite cells in muscle tissue are activated after injury or during muscle building to become muscle fibres. 		In the context of cancer, it was recently found that mutations in the genes of these otherwise differentiated stem cells could cause them to express genes that are usually deactivated, thus making them totipotent and sometimes cancerous. These stem cells could potentially be the start of a tumor and, due to their ability of act like many cell types at once, they could nest all around your body. It is also thought that cancer stem cells are the basis of a lot of tumors and, if not killed or removed with surgery, will survive to continue causing cancer in an individual. They are a widely debated topic but at this point it is accepted that they do exist and contribute to cancer in some way.		TL;DR: You are not right.
