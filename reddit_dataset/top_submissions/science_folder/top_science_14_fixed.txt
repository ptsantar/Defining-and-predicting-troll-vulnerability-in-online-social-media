{"body":"Yes, your logic is accurate; however, one of your assumptions is false and the term 'occasionally' is too subjective. I would also argue that the hypothetical posed by Felix (formation of life being a common occurrence in the right conditions) is unlikely and not an assumption we should make if you want an honest scientific discussion. 		First, the conditions that spawned the origin of life do not exist anymore on this planet. It has been a very long time since the existence of the common ancestor that all life on Earth shares. It has been observed that this life-form existed at least 3.5 billion years ago, as we have found [stromatolites](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/origsoflife_02) indicating a relative timeline of microbial life. Regarding the atmosphere at the time, if I can quote [Dannel Yeo and Thomas Drage](http://draget.net/hoe/index.php?p=p3), about whom I know nothing, 		>"[a]t 4.0 billion [years ago] H2O, CO2, and nitrogen (N) were the dominant chemicals. Cooling of the atmosphere causes precipitation and the development of the oceans. By 3.0 billion CO2, H2O, N2 are the dominant chemicals. O2 begins to accumulate." 		Today, the atmosphere is ~78% Nitrogen and ~20% oxygen, with plenty of other gases filling the remaining 2%. Although life has thrived alongside the development of the Oxygen in our atmosphere, we have not seen any evidence that it would be helpful in spawning brand new forms of microbial life.		My second point would be that new life may still 'occasionally' spawn on Earth, however, we are dealing with a very sparse set of events on a large-scale timeline, and these occasions would be unlikely to occur during humanity's reign, and even less so during our era of understanding. Add on to that the the most likely places for this to occur could very well be at the bottom of the oceans, a place that we are still unable to adequately observe, and it starts to seem very unlikely that we would notice a new Domain* of life unless it were to thrive for millenia alongside us. Of course, it is also possible that this process has been occurring in the background, and we may be on the verge of making such a significant observation. I vaguely remember a story a few years back of scientists who believed they had found a silicone-based life-form (as opposed to Carbon), and the entire scientific community was excited for the possible ramifications before it was proven false.		It is certainly possible that new life could spawn on a planet it must share with an already dominant species, however, I do not think making a valid observation by this point in our evolution is a fair expectation","depth":8,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bidofatick","name":"t1_cq65ugq","parent_id":"t1_cq63l6d","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428553266,"created_utc":1428549666}

In other words: no oceans.","depth":11,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Alpha_Catch","name":"t1_cq68rlo","parent_id":"t1_cq67pps","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428559133,"created_utc":1428555533}

{"body":"The interesting thing about all the Earth-life we've genetically sequenced thus far, is that we all share a common ancestor. That can mean that panspermia isn't as robust a method of interstellar transportation as we suspect, or it could imply that any life left behind via panspermia is already extinct, or maybe it means that we were already related to any extra-terrestrial life that could have traveled here.		It didn't take very long for life to appear after the surface of the Earth solidified. We continue to find new evidence that liquid water and complex organic molecules are abundant all throughout the universe. I believe this points to life as being a fundamental aspect of nature. I personally believe that the universe is rife with life. Though complex forms of life  like humans may be somewhat of a rarity, due to the very particular environment needed to sustain such beings.

{"body":"Basically, Amino acids on their own mean nothing in terms of "Could there be life?". This is an old theory that Miller-Urey adhered to when they began their (really just Miller's) experiment. Proteins are awesome. They're great catalyzers, they have 20 (21) subunits and can be folded into all sorts of things. The problem is they carry no information. Some AAs take 3 or more different codes to attach them to the protein when they're being translated. So how can you create DNA/RNA from that? You have no idea which code to use. But if we back up to DNA, the king of information storage, you can't do anything with it because you need DNA polymerase (a protein) to duplicate it, and you need peptidyl transferase activity to create those proteins at all. This leaves RNA. RNA can be both a catalyst and it holds information. Modern theory is on RNA folding itself into RNA polymerase and self duplicating. I believe it was Tom Cech who discovered the first ribozyme (RNA with catalytic activity). He also discovered sequences of RNA which perform RNA polymerase and he tore apart a ribosome (confirmed by others later with x-Ray crystallography) that the portion of a ribosome that performs peptidyl transferase is entirely RNA. This is such strong evidence because RNA sucks at being an enzyme. So why use it? Because it's what developed first and it's so crucial to life that nothing can replace it because while it's betting replaced the organism would die (Imagine trying to fix a plane mid flight. Your wings may be made of shit steel and you have a much better quality steel to replace it with, but you're going to crash as soon as you take off those shit wings).","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"versusChou","name":"t1_cq83ws9","parent_id":"t1_cq7gfzu","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428700044,"created_utc":1428696444}

The distinction along the original lines was a spurious one. That said, there were still defining characteristics of the two fields and a better definition formed to differentiate them. Essentially, the presence of carbon makes something organic and the lack of carbon doesn't.		 As I've said, however, it's not hard and fast. Surface scientists and physicists study graphene, for example. My research supervisor is examining hybrid perovskites (containing organic compounds on some of the sites) despite being the Prof of Inorganic Chemistry.   Chemistry doesn't divide down along neat lines like we'd wish. 			All that said, you can't do carbon chemistry without carbon being present. Using the most widely accepted definition of organic v inorganic today, what the original guy said is wrong. Inorganic compounds were not converted to an organic compound. They started out organic.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ggow","name":"t1_cq5yc0v","parent_id":"t1_cq5xi87","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428540554,"created_utc":1428536954}

You see DNA is stable enough that it can't fold like a protein to do things. But RNA. RNA is unstable but can carry information. It's also flexible enough to fold and be a catalyst.

{"body":"Basically imagine a world with random molecules floating around. As soon as nucleic acids form that bond, they're going to. So now you have random strands of RNA floating around. There is no competition from anything. Imagine a world of unlimited food and no animals. No matter how shit of an animal comes into that world, it's going to succeed because there's no competition. So you have strands of RNA floating around. They're breathing apart and rebonding all the time until one happens to make the shape that makes it attach itself to other RNA and duplicate it. Now you have an RNA floating around duplicating RNA. Eventually you'll get another confirmation that can perform RNA polymerase. They don't have to be the exact same, it just needs to have chemical properties that make it fold in a way that works like RNA polymerase. Now there are two. Now you have RNA replicating each other. With reproduction there is evolution. One might perform polymerase better than the other. It'll begin to outcompete the other because it'll be reproducing faster than the other. There is now variation and continued variation from mutation. So there is pressure for the best variant to continue. Now as soon as you find an RNA that can perform peptidial transferase to make proteins you can make proteins which do better than RNA ever did. From here you can imagine eventually a protein could be made that is better at RNA polymerase. It'll perhaps copy the RNA that made it and you end up with RNA floating around creating a protein that replicates it. Now maybe this RNA bonds with RNA that happens to make proteins that do other things. I'm on mobile so it's a little long writing all this out, but I think I got most of your first part. The odds aren't really that bad especially if you concentrate it as certain porous rocks can do. With a supply of elements from thermal vents and a proton gradient capable of generating energy, you can see why life arose so early in Earth's history. The instructions don't really come from anywhere. It's just that because of evolution and natural selection one it's created at all it goes crazy. But that only happens because there's no competition. This is why life isn't always popping up.

Eliminating sources of error in a real-world spectrum is outside the scope of that particular project.  The end users of the fitting tool (astronomers) are expected to remove noise from their data and correct for red-shift, systematic effects in their instruments, etc. before uploading a spectrum.

{"body":"Is this true? From what I know about a group working in the mm and  sub-mm wave region (Ziurys group), even expensive *ab initio* constants are hardly ever as helpful at finding the rotational spectrum of a small molecule as constants you can get from a rotationally resolved electronic spectrum (with comparatively large linewidths). 		As far as atmospheric modeling goes, I'm not sure. But in terms of atmospheric measurement, things like SCISAT compare measured spectra to other measured spectra (not theoretical line predictions).

{"body":"I think it all depends on the context here, I may be a bit biased towards theoretical spectroscopy as its where my experience mostly lies. There are of course studies where theoretical calculations are largely superfluous, like you describe.		Where ever possible line positions should of course be quoted from experimental data, provided that we can trust the accuracy. The benefit of theoretical calculations is that they can usually give a line position to many more decimal places, which is often difficult to do with experimental apparatus and their resolving powers, or lack thereof. It is arguable though that this higher precision of theoretical data could be meaningless, but it can shed light on ambiguous transition data, quantum numbers etc. Both the theory and experiment compliment each other immensely.		As an aside, the reliance on theoretical data extends to temperature dependence. Line positions are all well and good, but without line strengths they may not be all that meaningful. The benefit of theoretical study is that you can extrapolate your synthetic spectra to higher temperatures, transition strengths/Einstein coefficients and partition functions can be calculated to emulate transition intensities at temperatures that may not be reproducible in the lab.	Also, even if these temperatures are producible, the assignments of transitions may become even harder when temperature/pressure broadening comes into play.

{"body":"Molecules are completely reliable. They'll always tell you their secrets, and the secret of one molecule of a certain compound are the same as all the other molecules of that compound (in this case, isotopic composition counts too); there aren't any sources of error in that part. As the other commenter (sort of) indicated, the error  comes in when identifying a single molecule in an observation that may contain spectra of many, and accounting for how fast the molecules are moving away from us.		It turns out that if we were relying on just one line, it is easy to have misidentifications, as occasionally two different compounds will have lines close enough to overlap in a radio telescope observation. It is even possible for molecules to have more than one line close to each other. But it is really unlikely that molecules will have their entire set of transitions overlapping. Astronomers look for unique lines in that overall pattern to positively ID molecules. It's pretty effective.		The fact that multiple molecules are emitting out in space actually helps know what part of the spectrum you're looking at. The best surefire way to calibrate a spectrum is to simultaneously record known transitions, so certain transitions from ubiquitous molecules are used for just this. 		Since molecules are identified by their pattern and any error in the measurement of redshift would affect the entire pattern, an error in the measurement of the redshift would only give you the wrong distance to the molecules, not the wrong identity of the molecules.		As for corroboration, we've never gone to most of these places to sample their compositions, but as I said before, the molecules want to tell you their secrets. If you require that sort of direct conformation, you're never going to be satisfied. We have to trust that molecules lightyears away behave the way that they do on earth, and that's easy once you try to come up with a reason why they wouldn't.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"grimmra2","name":"t1_cq6eh8c","parent_id":"t1_cq61bwe","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428580101,"created_utc":1428576501}

{"body":"I think the question you're asking is: can we use knowledge of the basic building blocks of the universe (chemicals) and build up to fully understanding how we work? Like analyzing the metal and plastic put into a car to figure out how it works?		Theoretically yes, with enough understanding and insight we could take the information about how elements and compounds react and build up into predicting and understanding how all life works but realistically it's not possible. The best way I can relate it is this - for basic math, you know the numbers 0 through 9 and the four basic operations. When you understand that, you can use that system to predict values for numbers that no human has added together before. What you're implying is essentially taking the knowledge of basic arithmetic and asking is it possible to use that to understand quantum physics. 		Anyway, going from basic chemistry to complex psychological and social ideas takes a LOT of jumps and we can't even accurately describe or predict the phenomena so it'd essentially be impossible at our current level of understanding.		And I disagree about carbon somehow tinting the way which we act because of its chemical properties. In the most literal sense, it does - as we're made of carbon, or hormones are made of carbon it obviously influences how we act. But it's not like we have the spirit of carbon making us social or bond. And if you're getting technical - we're mostly made up of oxygen. If you weigh 70kg (~155lb), then about 43kg (95lb!) is oxygen where only 35lb of your weight is carbon. Oxygen isn't particularly social - it's interesting but it binds weird to a lot of shit (with only two bonds being able to form) and doesn't have easily romanticized characteristics.

{"body":"Of course a lot of these discussions always assume "interstellar" is a goal of all intelligent species... Some may be content to watch and listen, or be xenophobic, or have senses that allow them to develop high intelligence but not see light,..etc.. etc..		So many of the "Why would they, Why wouldn't they" things depend on the assumption that any intelligent being is somewhat remotely close to what we can expect/plan out.		The Amgdravinians, for example... Developed on a world with very bright localized star/moon configurations. That combined with their genetic "slouch" and a socially ingrained reflex to not look up (for fear of the mighty Targoon-Sah who lived slightly higher than the sky and visited a genital pox lasting no less than 3 years upon anyone looking up and meeting his gaze) kept them from ever caring about anything outside their planets surface.  	 It wasn't until they had developed quantum teleportation to get from the dry arid wastes of the shahaad desert, to the persistantly monsoon plagued burnatta zone, (essentially using the two for eco-friendly washing and drying) that they thought,.. "Hey, we could hop BEHIND the head of Targoon-Sah, thus avoiding his gaze and the ensuing embarrassment that has plagued us all at one time or another!" (The genital pox of the Amgdravinians was distinctive in it's regular erruptions of a purple fog that smelled vaguely of earth cabbage)   		20 Amgdravinians died before they thought to send a camera, 20 more (trying to retrieve the camera) before they thought to send a torgle flea, 20 more trying to retrieve the torgle flea, and finally one Amgdravinian decided to build a box with a shuttered window on it. (For surely all the others had appeared, Targoon-Sah had turned his gaze on them, and from that distance, the punishment would surely be a million genital poxi and would thusly result in death). The shuttered window would allow enough time to see Targoon-Sah, and close it quickly before he could swing his gaze to the pod, then a return trip and report could be made. Luckily  Amgdravinian construction techniques were quite advanced. They had been working with Amgdra sub-nanotube construction for some time and nearly everything was built with this material. In essence the pod was a *mostly* air tight indestructible shell. The *mostly* was more than "none at all" and so this particular Amgdravinian had enough time to make a return trip to tell of experience of appearing, Targoon-Sah making him feel light as a torgle flea hatchling, and then violently trying to suck the air from his room.   		Thus space being, and additionally being a vacuum was discovered but wasn't interpreted as such. The Amgdravinians discussed it for some time and finally decided that considering their near immortal lifespans, 60 Amgdravinians dead was 59 too many (No one liked Pretesh the umbrella vendor) and they simply gave up trying to get one over on ol Targoon-Sah. Any radio transmissions they received after this were simply interpreted as Targoon-Sah trying to lure them back to to his domain to steal the breath from their lungs which it was decided was like candy to him.   		In apology for their transgressions a monthly hunting party would risk further wrath looking up long enough to capture several of the highbeters (basically giant floating air filled jellyfish) to teleport into space for Targoon-Sah to suck the breath from. While this pleased the Amgdravinians and greatly confused the highbeters, it also had the unfortunate side effect of thinning the highbeter populations. As a communal creature their newfound confusion, decreased numbers and the occasional feeling that somewhere far away someone was doing very un-natural things to them, eventually caused their extinction. As the highbeters were one of the keystone species that maintained the atmospheric cycle, their abrupt absence caused global warming to occur. (Not like Earth global warming which any child knows can manifest in many things other than actual temperature increase, but rather a literal and drastic rising of temperatures planetwide.)	   	Within 30 years all the Amgdravinians were either dead or dying. Towards the end they no longer gave two squirts of purple fog what Tagoon-Sah had to say anymore so they frequently donned several layers of their best reflecto-glass, and stared out into the sky. Had all life not been eradicated within the several months that followed, it is assured that they would have looked for ways to teleport to their moons, and eventually to other worlds that they would have identified as habitable for Amgdravinians. Earth (though in relatively close proximity) wouldn't even have made the list.   	  	So you see,.. there's a LOT more variables to take into account beyond "advanced civilization".","depth":4,"score":29,"ups":29,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hatelabs","name":"t1_cq60sr5","parent_id":"t1_cq5xncu","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428544691,"created_utc":1428541091}

One of those computers (probably a lot more) will have the Game of Thrones series just based on chance. With there being such a huge number of planets, stars, galaxies and maybe even parallel universes, maybe we just happen to be that really lucky string of amino acids that developed into replicating and self-questioning organisms.  		I just think we need to be more careful assuming either end of the spectrum based on our perceptions of the scale of the universe.  We could be underestimating the probability of life, but we could also be underestimating the sheer vastness of space, time and matter.		Someone mentioned elsewhere in this thread that some evidence exists that life arose in different parts of the earth separately. And even though technically, what I said earlier could still be true (maybe we really, really, really got lucky with life springing up twice), if what they said is true, that would give good argument that life is very probable.

{"body":"For life, those building blocks (RNA/DNA or whatever other protein encoding mechanism) have to be arranged in a particular order in order to successfully replicate. That is no small feat... Many proteins necessary for life take 1000 base pairs to encode. By random chance, that would mean a probability of 1 out of 10 to the power of 600 for such a thing to occur (calculating this based on 4 nucleotides). Considering there's only approximately 10 to the 82 atoms in the observable universe, that's a very minuscule amount. But if the universe is significantly enough larger than the observable universe and we have many others parallel universes like in the many worlds quantum theory, even this small probability is reachable.		It's also entirely possible that those initial steps weren't entirely random, and therefore the probability is somewhat less than the calculation of the number of combos of 1000 base 4 nucleotides. Or maybe for life to have begun, we only needed a single protein encoded by a few base pairs... But I don't know if we know these answers yet.		I'm not debating we are the only intelligent species or even life in the universe. I'm just saying we can't determine the probability of life based off of one occurrence (ourselves), one way or the other. It would be a statistical fallacy.

{"body":"Irrelevant aside: Mass spectroscopy is a little different. You ionise the sample and send it through a magnetic field, your spectrum in that case is the ratio of mass to charge rather than wavelength of light emitted.		Regarding margin of error, there are a bunch of downsides. You can't excite the cloud with your choice of radiation so you have to take either what's behind it (a star) or look at something hot.		 Secondly, it's really hard to separate light from things closer than a billion kilometers away from each other  at that distance (a few telescopes can, but usually only a smallish band of wavelengths). You have to look at all of the stuff together. You also can't really use tricks like diffraction to get the shapes of molecules (at least i don't think so)		We know a fair bit about what light will come from a star or something being hot, so you can account for the differences in your source. It then becomes a puzzle to separate out the different elements. This purple line that far from a red line means lots of hydrogen, subtract the whole hydrogen spectrum, etc. Then you work out that some line in infrared means H-C bonds, then a even more subtle change to the spectrum from an isolated H-C bond means the C is attached to something else and so on and so on.		There's no real problem introduced to the data from the distances involved other than reducing the total amount of light you see (and thus the signal to noise ratio), and making this puzzle involve a whole solar system full of dust. The first can be solved by sampling light for a long time with a big telescope, and the second is why it's a hard research problem.

For example, our weather men of this day and age can predict what the weather and temperature will likely be, yet not even that long ago it was more of a pseudo-science than anything.		It's additionally interesting to consider that the common reason why there is so little interaction with a religion's deity and human life in comparison to the religion's holy works that claim there was more interaction early-on.  As mankind grew in size, so did the variability of possible events.  Basically, you take the butterfly effect theory, limit the scope to human actions which have the most variability compared to natural events, then adjust the variable for amount of humans.

{"body":"I don't see a religion vs science debate. At least, not with Christianity. Christianity and science are perfectly compatible, and there are a lot of logical arguments to be made from higher scientific concepts (like M-theory) that favor the existence of a god. 		What I see as a large problem in today's world is the elevation of science to a dogma. Science is a powerful tool, and it's very handy in that it can be proven even to very small and simple minds, due to it's reliance upon observational and reproducible experimentation. It is *not*, however, an omnipotent multi-tool, and there are many worthwhile intellectual endeavors to which it cannot be practically applied. Issues of ethics, philosophy, morality, purpose, etc are all very important to humanity as a whole, and utterly untouchable by the scientific system. Science is a superior tool for dealing with the material, *and that is all*. Abstract logical concepts require different tools, and due to the deification of this ideal of a "science supreme", people all-too-readily discard important concepts because they are "un-scientific". Logic and rationality are not equivalent with science; science is a subset of logic and rationality. There are other subsets and other tools within that box that people need to be made aware of and learn to use.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mordrimbor","name":"t1_cq6gnl7","parent_id":"t1_cq6e91k","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428587186,"created_utc":1428583586}
