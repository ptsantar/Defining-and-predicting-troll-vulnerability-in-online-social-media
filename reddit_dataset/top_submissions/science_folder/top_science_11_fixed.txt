{"body":"Thanks!  Yessir the large one is jupiter.  If you're curious, this was just a regular old digital camera and $200 telephoto lens in the heavily light-polluted city of Toronto, no telescope involved here:		This final image has been enlarged 150% using Photoshop's bicubic smoothing enlarger.  This was taken in RAW format on a Sony A55v SLT-type camera, with an f/5.6 280mm zoom lens (420mm in 35mm equiv) at ISO 1600 and 1/3sec.  Original photograph had the left side of Jupiter's glow completely blue, I assumed it was chromatic aberration and used Photoshop's automatic blue aberration remover on it, and then tweaked the RAW file's white balance settings to get the colours close to grayscale without actually desaturating to grayscale.

A few things that helped to get this photograph were: Jupiter was almost at the zenith of the sky, so the atmosphere and pollution between me and jupiter was the absolute thinnest it could have been; I had to bracket the focus, because it turns out that "infinity" on my zoom lens is actually *beyond* infinity, so I had to keep taking pictures to figure out when the moons were actually focused;  And a much faster exposure than I expected - Over-expose, and they just look like any other star in the sky.

That's because that image is not to scale at all. It isn't useful in this context at all. Please see my edits to my previous comment for a better image and more explanation. 		>I've never seen a picture of a crescent *anything* taken from earth, other than our own Moon.		If you understand the geometries involved, you'll know that only objects orbiting closer to the Sun than the Earth can be seen as crescents. 		Here's just one example of a crescent Venus taken from Earth: http://space.com/24446-venus-mercury-rare-daytime-photos.html		Mercury is possible but not as practical because of its apparent closeness to the Sun from our perspective making it more difficult to get a good view of, especially during a crescent phase where it will be even more apparently closer.

The tough part is finding life that we could recognise as being alive and for this the biology comes to a point where things are just easier or make more sense if it's water.		The proteins that build life, as we could recognise it, have to be able to easily move around and morph into surrounding shapes. Solids can't do this and gases are too far apart. Liquid has always been seen as the only option. 		While historically, biologists have agreed that we would require water molecules for life, there has recently been a new theory proposing methane based life as the lakes in Titan are made up of methane and not water.

{"body":"We have the technology, government space agencies have been [landing rovers on other planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_landings_on_extraterrestrial_bodies) since the 1970s. The tech is even better now: for example, here are some recent oriters + landers at Mars and Saturn:		* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter	* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory	* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens	* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_(spacecraft)		We just need to decide to use our resources to fund these and similar missions.		In the USA, [only about 0.5% of our federal tax money is allocated to NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA), and [not all of that is spent on planetary science](http://regmedia.co.uk/2014/03/04/budget_large.jpg) (there's other interesting stuff like telescopes and astrophysics too). Commercial space flight is similarly limited, not by technology, but by funding.		The bottom line is that most people do not expect to see a return on the billion-dollar investment necessary to get probes to other planets. So now we have a [map of Mars](http://www.google.com/mars/) or even with this story, now that we know Ganymede has liquid water on it. Ask yourself: so what? How does knowing this affect you, or the millions of other people who paid for it with their taxes? Those who are interested or in the field might find it worthwhile to study science or explore space as their own ends but most people don't see the benefit.		In actuality, many of the innovations in space flight find applications in more familiar earth-bound settings. It just takes a long time for them to pay off. You know how when you rotate your iPhone and the screen also rotates so it's right-side up? It can detect its own orientation because it has a [MEMS accelerometer](http://www.memsjournal.com/2010/12/motion-sensing-in-the-iphone-4-mems-accelerometer.html) in it, a sensor that can "feel" which way is down.		It's probably easy for you, in 2015, to believe that the technology for that sensor is "[directly traceable to the miniature accelerometers NASA developed in the 1970s to measure changes in speed during human and robotic space flight](http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/54862main_benefits.pdf)". But how many people paying their taxes in the 1970s were even thinking that they were funding research on a vertical video detector that they'd carry around in their pocket in 40 years? Or more seriously that they were contributing to new technology that would boost the American economy?

I'd guess that the gas giants' moons held on to water better than Mars even though they are less massive because they weren't heated by the sun as much.
