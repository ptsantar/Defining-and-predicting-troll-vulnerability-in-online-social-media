{"body":"Back in November I was nearly killed by a drunk driver while riding my motorcycle. I was in the hospital for a month and I had 3 surgeries to save my leg in that time, with one more so far sense I was discharged. I live in California and have fairly good insurance. Regardless , I get a letter after I was home from my insurer saying I had exceeded my limit by $200,000 and that they where entitled to any money I received from the responsible party. Plus there are several medicines and doctors that apparently were not in my "network" therefor are not covered. I'm just finding out about this now. My layers are cutting a deal with my insurer but they're still getting a 3rd. (The person who hit me was minimally insured and quite poor). Having to deal with this is totally overwhelming and it makes me so mad I don't like to think about it. The system is so broken and I really feel sorry for anyone who has to go through it.

Here in Canada, it costs less in taxes than what we would pay in insurance in the US, it's a lot less stressful when you need healthcare, and if you're poor or making a low income, you pay very little tax and don't get financially ruined by going to the hospital. So yes the rich are paying for the poor, but they're still paying as much or less than they would in a private insurer system. Isn't it what matters?		  In the end, the mere fact of not being stressed by financial worries when going to the hospital and already being stressed about being sick or injured is worth having universal healthcare.

I don't *necessarily* agree with you either insofar as private insurers not being able to make profit.  The whole idea of insurance is risk-spreading, both temporally and socially.  A firm may have a few years in the clear and then have to pay out a lot another because of a disaster.		**That being said** that profit motive obviously tends to come into conflict with the stated mission of insurers, and consequently lowers payouts unethically.

{"body":"Here's how things currently work in Australia (we have a corporate sycophant Government at the moment, who make your Republicans look apologist, so things are changing for the worse, which is read, "becoming more like the USA").		You, the provider of drugs, can only sell your drug in Australia if other companies are allowed to make generic versions. So you make a brand of paracetamol tablet called "Panadol", other companies get to make generic paracetamol tablets too.		The government dictates the value of the generic brand. I think they have a say in the value of the brand name preparations too. This is through a program called the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, where every available medication is listed and given a value. This value shows the price that the drug will be sold for (with special considerations for pensioners) and then there's the "safety net" which means you won't spend more than a certain amount per year on prescription medicines.		Along with the PBS is a similar scheme for medical procedures. Once a procedure is listed, it is covered by medicare and the Government will pay a certain amount for that procedure. You as a practitioner are allowed to charge what you want, but if your fees are higher than what medicare will cover, you will find that your clientele is limited. For some doctors who service the super-rich, this doesn't matter. For everyone outside North Shore (the richer parts of Sydney), it certainly matters. The difference between Medicare and the practitioner's rates is called the "gap", and is what people will pay using private health insurance.		Similar systems are available in the UK and France.		The main benefit to the average citizen of a single payer system is that prices don't spiral out of control. You can find a surgeon or a hospital or a GP who "bulk bills" which means they treat you, then directly bill Medicare so you don't have to pay anything out of pocket. In more affluent areas bulk billing is rarer and you will typically end up paying, say, $70 for a consultation with a GP when the Medicare schedule only pays $50.		In addition, thanks to the PBS we don't end up paying $2000 a dose for life-saving medications except where it's not scheduled. If a drug is on the PBS schedule, the price is known and the chances are there's a generic available. Drug companies can still make profits by selling brand name drugs to rich people who have the money to pay for "better" preparations (e.g.: sugar or salt to make the pill taste nicer, gel caps instead of pressed pills, coloured to improve customer reception).		Watch the Michael Moore flick "Sicko" for more information. He sensationalises a bit of stuff, but his claims about how the health system works are pretty much spot on.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MaraRinn","name":"t1_cs12fg7","parent_id":"t1_cs10avu","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433889705,"created_utc":1433886105}

{"body":"There are many permutations of "single payer".  A common system is where the government is liable to pay healthcare costs for every citizen (or at least a large part of them).  It's basically like government-run insurance that is paid with taxes instead of premiums.  Most countries with a single payer system don't necessarily have a *compulsory* single payer system.  If you want to opt for private insurance you still can.  You generally get better/speedier service at a private (i.e. user pays) hospital than a purely public hospital.		There are also more inclusive systems, like the Accident Compensation Corporation that my country, New Zealand, has.  ACC is a compulsory scheme that covers almost all forms of physical injury.  It's a no-fault, no questions asked (in theory) program that is focused on allowing people to recover rather than assigning blame.  You could be hit by a drunk driver, through no fault of your own, or doing intentionally shoot yourself in the foot.  Either way, you're getting the same treatment and payment through ACC.  The other part of ACC which is unique is that you are not allowed to bring personal injury claims through the court system for anything that ACC covers (almost everything.)		This has many benefits:		* You don't need to sue someone for your medical bills - it's already paid out by ACC and you don't have to pay lawyer's fees.	* You don't have to pay out for someone else's recovery if you accidentally injure someone - you can still get punished under other safety legislation, but you can't be forced to pay someone else's hospital bill.	* No ambulance chasing - lawyers don't get involved, personal injury cases don't clog up the court system.		What ACC doesn't cover is diseases that accumulate over time and elective procedures.  Those can still be obtained through the public health system (i.e. still single payer).  		The system is funded through taxation on income and fuel (since road accidents are a big part of injuries).  Your employer pays about NZ$0.90 on every NZ$100 they pay in wages/salary for ACC Levy while you pay about NZ$1.26 per $100 on your income.  About NZ$190 is paid in car registration per car/per year.  [Source](http://www.acc.co.nz/about-acc/levies/current-years-levy-rates/).  I don't know how much the average person pays for comprehensive accident cover in the US is, but I'm inclined to think that it probably amounts to more than 2% of income for most people.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"disguise117","name":"t1_cs1eplr","parent_id":"t1_cs100ti","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433911086,"created_utc":1433907486}

{"body":"I work for a Medicare Advantage customer service call center. Even Medicare isn't perfect for protecting members. Yes there is the Medicare Allowed Fee which prevents you from being billed more than your copay/coinsurance/deductible on a covered service from a participating provider, but let's look at the example above. If he was in the hospital for that long, with that many surgeries, there were probably dozens of individual doctors who 'worked' on him. I put that in quotes because there is absolutely nothing preventing any random doctor working at that hospital from stopping by, taking one look at  his chart, asking how he feels, then turning around and billing $500 to his insurance. If that doctor happens to be out of your network, guess who's footing the bill on that claim. I've seen a lot of Medicare members in similar situations getting absolutely screwed over because of these kinds of situations.		Everyone expects the insurance companies to be the bad guys here. But in my experience, hospitals and other medical providers can be far more worse, if for no other reason than because nobody expects it from them.		Bottom line is, always go into ANY medical provider knowing as much as you possibly can beforehand to avoid these kinds of situations. No, you won't be able to know everything, but you can at least call your insurance and get a paper trail started with cost estimates. Always get a reference number for your call to support you if you need to later file an appeal, and for the love of God, if the provider tells you to sign a contract saying you'll pay what insurance doesn't throw that crap in their face and find another provider a little less on the Lawful Evil side of alignment.

{"body":"Because the system has evolved with bizarre cost and payment pressure and where the consumer of the services is not the major payer.		Let us start with Medicare. Medicare is the most standard. There is a value assigned to each and every procedure code, called a [relative value unit (RVU)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_value_unit). Each RVU is assigned a dollar amount. Multiple the number of RVUs you get for a procedure by the value of the RVU and that is what you get paid for a Medicare patient. The value of an RVU has some regional adjustments for malpractice risk and cost of living. So the amount a hospital will get paid in one part of the country is different than in an other, but it is similar.		Now take Medicaid. Medicaid is state specific. It is paid for partially by the Feds and partially locally. All 50 states make up their own fee schedules. Some are quite generous, others are quite stingy. At least in each state, theoretically, everyone is getting paid the same.		Then you throw in the private insurance market...this is a free for all. These rates are all negotiated. Do you as insurance company want to offer an unlimited product that offers choice and ease for the consumer? That is going to have to be more expensive and pay more, since you can't guarantee business. Is the plan cheaper and more limiting? You can pay less to doctors/hospitals with the promise that your customers will have to go to them. Your customers demand access to the big Ivory Tower of Medicine or they will switch plans? ITM demands to be paid more for the same procedure than Small Private Hospital, even though outcomes are same, because they know consumers prefer the name. Hospitals may be willing to take a little be less for certain services, with the expectation of building brand loyalty (for example charge less for OB services and then making it up on oncology). There are countless variations and will vary by area and available providers.		All that assumes a straight fee for service. What about other payment models like capitation (we pay you $X for all the care for our patients, regardless of what happens)? There are other models and hybrids of models. Different insurers may also bundle different things into payment and may be willing to pay for certain billing codes that others won't.

{"body":"The timeliness of this in my personal life is insane. What I am dealing with right now is hospitals that use contracted doctors. The hospital is in network, but the doctor is not and you are captive so you have no choice. 		There is a huge problem where doctors are tired of getting the short end of the insurance stick so they are in no insurance company networks. That way the insurance company pays the agreed out of network amount, 80% of the "expected cost" in my case, and the patient is on the hook for the difference...the entire difference.		In my example, a family member went into the ER at a local hospital and was admitted and released a day later. A month after that the bills started coming in. The hospital was in network so most of that was covered and my portion was quite small. Then I get a bill for the ER doctor who was a contractor, but in network my portion was $100 against an $800 bill, Lastly, I get a bill from the medical group which were the doctors on contract to work in the hospital and my portion was $850 against a $1000 bill because that medical group was out of network.		When I contacted the hospital they said I was notified and signed a paper agreeing to using contracted doctors, signed at admission during a very intense ER visit. When I contacted the medical group they said they were out of network and the insurance company should be paying more and I should appeal the claim. When I contacted the insurance company they said because the medical group was out of network they paid what was customary. When I asked about an appeal they said all appeals have to be submitted in writing with all supporting documentation.		It is insane that in this enlightened age we do not have single payer healthcare. Profit is the only motivator. I can't believe I have to consider if I should get treatment for myself or my family based on financial criteria. It sickens me, but I can't go to the doctor because it will cost too much.","depth":0,"score":107,"ups":107,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"imdickie","name":"t1_cs0qjt5","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433871742,"created_utc":1433868142}

{"body":"Hospital billing is out of control, I've had "issues" on several occasions with a particular hospital's billing being outright fraudulent.  		On the first occasion was my dying grandmother in law, who was unable to eat for days preceding her death.    The hospital tried to charge something like 20 or 30  per meal for "ensure type" drinks.  Now, her room had family in it constantly, saying goodbye, and not a one of them recalls a single drink being delivered to her room.		On the second occasion I had gone to the emergency room for stiches, and months later received a bill for some thousand dollars.  The odd thing that made me notice, and not simply right a check, is that under my insurance plan (which is an incredibly generous one) covers 100% of ER visits.   When I complained, I had to speak to three separate people and the last one simply told me that "my insurance didn't pay ENOUGH". The tone was aggressive from them, and at not point reflected that the hospital has an agreed upon amount that they will charge for a service, and that from that agreed total I cover a portion (0%) and my insurance company covers a portion (100%).   I had to actually get my insurance company to send over a copy of their negotiated contracts (not my coverage) with the hospital, or at least that's the story the billing office pushed on me.  		TLDR:  Billing office charged ME more than my insurance had negotiated them to charge, and then tried to bully me into paying more.","depth":0,"score":182,"ups":182,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BoobootheDude","name":"t1_cs0reb9","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433873006,"created_utc":1433869406}

A few months later I had a collector hounding me for something ridiculously small like $140. I was confused, but it turned out the hospital had charged me a 'physician fee' or some such. Since it was so small and already in collections I just paid it off, but learned to not ignore follow up mail from the hospital.

Most health systems would be better off if medics could treat and release, like give someone an asthma treatment and leave them if their condition allows. This can ease the burden on EDs and EMS and could pave the way for community paramedicine.

{"body":">They do all the time		No, they don't. Not if they take insurance. They may negotiate after an initial bill is sent, but they if they charged two seperate prices, insurance companies would be all over them. Insurance companies negotiate a discount off of "usual and customary rates" (UCR) which is essentially the rack rate. If you have a discounted rate for self pay patients, the insurance company is going to cry foul and argue that the self pay rate is the UCR. Their position is that they are negotiating a discount by offering volume (patients) but it's not a discount if self-pay patients are paying less. There are a few instances where limited discounts can be offered, but no hospital is ever going to negotiate to a rate lower than what medicare reimburses up front. Never. 		>Giving an individual a huge bill than a cash discount is arbitrary in relation to just giving them a reasonable bill.

Like I said the insurance companies negotiate discounts off the rack rates.

There are tons of customers out there...far more than the capacity to treat them. The insurance firm's aren't completely running the show and forcing hospitals to rip off individuals.		The vast majority of hospital's income comes from Medicare and private insurance reimbursements. I don't know the exact number off hand, but it's >85%. The demand is there but even when prices reflect actual costs, the average american doesn't have the resources to pay for moderate to extensive medical treatment.

Most hospitals run on such thin margins that if you take that huge bill to them, they'll take pennies on the dollar and they'll even let you pay it at $10 a month for the rest of your life rather than send you to collections. 		Edit: the vast majority of noninsured patients either just don't pay the bill or they pay a vastly reduced version of it.

Right.  The whole thing is a mess.  An individual can't find out what something costs so shopping around is impossible.

You're right, insurance companies aren't stupid. They negotiate a discount off the UCR and will pay up to a maxiumum allowable rate for any given fee. The thing is, private insurers don't tell hospitals what the maxiumum allowable fee is and it varies by insurer and region and it can change at any given moment. I suppose that, theoretically with enough time and bills, hospitals could work out the maximum allowable charge for each individual company, for each CPT code, professional fee, facility fee, medication cost etc, but the would be extremely resource instensive and they'd lose money every time time they underbilled. It's much, much easier to bill an arbitratily high amount they *know* is higher than the maximum allowable reimbursement, to ensure they get they most money back. Insurance companies know they do this and that's why they audit billing because if the hospital is charging self-pay patients *less* than the maximum allowable charge, the insurance company is rightly going to be angry that they're paying more. Like I said, it's a system with extremely perverse incentives for everyone involved. The hospital doesn't know how much the insurer is willing to pay so they make up a high number to get the maximum payment back, the insurer has no idea what the real cost of anything is because hospitals charge everyone the same thing intially, which they do because in order to stay open they need the insurers (including Medicare) to help subsidize the cost of self-pay patients who can't or won't pay, even when the bill reflects actual cost and the hospital can't turn them away because of laws like EMTALA *and* they have to make up the difference when maximum allowable charges don't cover real costs (this happens a lot with Medicare). It's a vicious cycle that involves everyone, so you can't say the insurance companies have no bearing on the billing practices of hospitals. 		>Appreciate you're going through this. I'm obviously missing something.		No worries, believe it or not, this is the really simplified version of how all these interactions work. I've been lucky enough to work in what is essentially a single payer system for the last few years, and while it has it's own drawbacks, I truly think not worrying about the financial aspect removes a huge portion of stress for the patients and allows them to make better choices about their care.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Freckled_daywalker","name":"t1_cs1oyuw","parent_id":"t1_cs18tu7","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433942912,"created_utc":1433939312}

I would argue that it is working exactly how it was intended, it just is the people who set it up lied about what they set up would do.		As a larger question, why the system is 'dysfunctional' as it is stems not from greedy actors as much as it is a unwillingness to hold those poor actors accountable. The system is designed to dampen outbursts and people don't have the stamina to wait 6 years to fully purge the system. They vote once every 4 years, or once every two years if we are lucky. Even then, you get the equally monumental task of getting enough of those people to agree to any given thing. It should really be no surprise that oligarchical influences reign supreme, all other forces tend to get crushed much like wind and water can grind mountains to dust. 		So what is the real solution and can you get to it within the preexisting framework? I am not sure a better solution is possible, as long as we are constrained by reality someone will always be livid about something. Perhaps then the only thing that truly matters isn't giving people what they want. Maybe instead it is giving people a system they can generate their own fate with, for better or worse.

{"body":"What you are referring to are the wage controls put in place during WWII. Health insurance was around LONG before this happened. This is when employers started offering health insurance as a benefit. 		It wasn't because of high tax rates, as you claim, but because the government had wage controls in place for most manufacturing markets. The reason was because the US was purchasing a ton of products from private manufacturers for the war effort, not because of high taxes. They wanted to control the costs of these products. If they allowed companies to increase wages to a high rate, they would have been paying far more for products than they should have. Basically, the controls were in place so private manufacturers couldn't fleece the government as they do today.		Health insurance dates back way further than that. The original insurance market was created around the 1850s and was offered for railroad and steamboat accidents. Had single-payer been implemented day one, we wouldn't have had this issue.

{"body":"This thread has so. much. confusion.		Source: Was an EDI programmer for a health insurance company, specializing in ANSI 835 claim payments.		Your insurance company is Acme Insurance. Your hospital system is Seattle Grace. These two parties negotiate rates for individual procedures. Every medical procedure is coded as a numeric **procedure code**. There are thousands of procedure codes. The collection of procedure codes and prices are a fee schedule.		For example, code 47.01 represents a laparoscopic appendectomy. Acme Insurance agrees to pay Seattle Grace up to $5,000 for this procedure if a patient sees them.		Your appendix hurts like a little bitch. You are covered by Acme Insurance and you go to Seattle Grace for a laparoscopic appendectomy. You are saved from mortal danger and you have minimal scarring.		Time to settle up. **As a courtesy** and to avoid issuing a refund later, Seattle Grace bills Acme Insurance before you. Seattle Grace can bill for any amount on this procedure, but if it is over the contract rate, it will be discounted. Since you are covered by Acme Insurance, the amount eligible for payment is **the lesser of the billed amount and the contract rate**. The system just does this:		    eligible amount = min(billed amount, contract rate)	The "discount" is the difference of the billed amount and the eligible amount:		    discount = eligible amount - billed amount	The "discount" is **not** a percentage of the billed amount.		For example, Seattle Grace bills $30,000.		    Eligible amount = min($30,000, $5,000) = $5,000	    Discount = $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000		Another example, Seattle Grace bills $30.		    Eligible amount = min($30, $5,000) = $30	    Discount = $30 - $30 = $0		Seattle Grace wants the most money it can possibly get. The easiest way to do this is to bill for an amount that is so high that it will be well above each insurance company rate for the foreseeable future. In the second example, Seattle Grace could have received an additional $4,970, but they did not bill that much.		Once the eligible amount is determined, then Acme Insurance runs this through your benefits to see how much they will pay Seattle Grace. The difference goes to you.		If you don't have insurance, there is no negotiated rate in place, so you receive the outrageous price. Sometimes Seattle Grace will be benevolent and adjust for this with a cash price.		Both Acme Insurance and Seattle Grace have access to their fee schedule. Theoretically, if you give a procedure code to either of them, they could tell you the price. Your insurance company probably has a feature on their website where you can estimate the costs by selecting a procedure and provider.		Personally, I hate this system. The federal government should set the rates for all procedures.","depth":0,"score":95,"ups":95,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CraftyClint","name":"t1_cs0yths","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433884138,"created_utc":1433880538}

Payment recovery. We paid you too much on a claim from a few months ago. All of these other payments are going into the same bank account, so we are **recovering** the payment. Oh, and the amount of the recovery is more than the amount of the payment for all of the other claims. This payment is just an FYI that you owe us money.		The particular insurance company that I worked for was unethical when this was in reverse. When the company discovered that they didn't pay the provider enough, they wouldn't send payment immediately. They would wait for the provider to ask about it.		That, along with the mind numbing nature of the job and the lecherous business model of the insurance industry in general are why I quit.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CraftyClint","name":"t1_cs26qad","parent_id":"t1_cs25vbo","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433971279,"created_utc":1433967679}

{"body":"Lawyer here.		This is less about "overcharging" and more about transferring costs.  Two factors are in play here: (1) the arms race between hospitals/providers and insurers/Medicare/Medicaid and (2) lawsuits.		Say you're an indigent wage laborer with no insurance and no assets.  You're on the way to your minimum wage job and you get hit on the highway.  You're going to need to go to the E/R just like someone who has insurance.  At the E/R you are just like any other patient in one important respect: you can sue a hospital or doctor who fails to provide you with adequate care *even if you have no assets and no insurance.*		The hospital, fearful of lawsuits, is going to go ahead and give you an MRI, a series of x-rays, maybe a CT scan, to rule out spinal cord injury or broken bones.  If you happen to have a herniated disk in your back or actual broken bones, the hospital will offer you care, possibly including fixation surgeries, in order to avoid any malpractice claims. 		Now in the scenario above, you can't pay the hospital back, but there's a good chance you'll have a lawsuit against the person who hit you.  The hospital knows that if you ever get paid on that suit, it would have to pursue collections actions against you for your outstanding bills owed to them.  In any collections action they are going to incur costs and likely settle the claim for less than the outstanding bill.  What actually ends up happening most of the time is that the plaintiff's lawyer for the injured person clears medical bills and liens by settling out with the providers, *for a discount* out of the settlement funds paid by the at-fault party's insurance company.		Hospitals thus know that they are going to get whacked on their bill no matter what: either the indigent person stiffs them outright, or the bill gets paid at a discount settlement via a collections action, or the bill gets paid again at a discount out of the proceeds of any potential settlement.  For every ten indigents to whom the hospitals provide care, the hospital might recover payment (usually via the third option above) one time.  They are typically not allowed (by law) to deny care to people who walk in, although they might try to ship them off somewhere else.  Ultimately someone is going to provide that care.		This is simple math.  If you only get paid one out of ten times, functionally, then you need to charge 10X the normal rate in order to break even.  You need to charge ALL TEN people 10X the normal rate, because you're only going to get paid once, and you need that one payment to make up for all the other non-payors.		All of this adds up to a great argument for some kind of blanket health insurance.  I don't care if it's government supplied, mandated through private insurers (which is Obamacare), or some kind of hybrid.  As long as every person who walks through the doors of the E/R has some financial backing and means to pay, then the hospitals can stop playing this shell game and begin to charge each individual 100% of what they owe instead of 1000%.		Now that we are making baby steps towards universal insurance coverage, the next step is to begin putting pressure on the hospitals to change their billing systems to reflect their actual payment rates.  Over time, in theory, we should see charges begin to drop as the rate of recovery for outstanding bills improves as more and more people are covered by some form of insurance.  There are a lot of ways to bring that pressure (including, in my profession, allowing defense lawyers to discuss insurance coverage and fair market value with juries, which is currently outlawed by something called the collateral source rule in many jurisdictions, thereby bringing down overall lawsuit values and relieving runaway verdict pressures on the insurance system).		Tl;dr: 1000% charges are a symptom of hospitals getting paid 1 time out of 10 and the solution to this shell game is some form of universal insurance coverage.","depth":0,"score":202,"ups":202,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ZachMatthews","name":"t1_cs0pnsa","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433870393,"created_utc":1433866793}
{"body":"Maryland solved this problem very well through their hospital rate regulation system.		All hospital services have their prices set by the State, and the State controls how much profit each hospital is allowed to earn. In order to even the costs out to stop hospitals in poor areas from having to gouge their customers because of the low collection rates, the State Health Services Cost Review Commission calculates the annual cost of providing "uncompensated care" for each hospital then calculates a statewide average. Any hospitals with less than the average have to contribute an equivalent amount of their revenues into an uncompensated care fund to bring them up to the average cost, and any hospitals with more than average uncompensated care costs receive money from the fund to being them down to the average cost.		Add to that the fact that the same Commission closely monitors hospital billing to ensure that hospitals don't discriminate based on who is paying for care (Medicare, private insurance, no insurance all MUST be billed the exact same amount or hospitals have profits seized) and it means that you don't get one or two high-risk groups having to bear the total burden of healthcare. The risk gets evenly distributed across all patients statewide.		The other nice thing that Maryland does is when they set the allowable profits for each hospital, they build in incentives like reducing readmission and offering higher levels of charity care (forgiving the fees of low-income patients), so that hospitals are permitted to be more profitable if they meet certain performance goals.","depth":1,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"APugDog","name":"t1_cs10v03","parent_id":"t1_cs0pnsa","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433887212,"created_utc":1433883612}

{"body":"You should reconsider your argument. 		The cost of uncompensated care in the US: $84 Billion  	Total US medical care expenses: $3.8 Trillion		So the uninsured make up about 2% of the overall revenue of health care in the US. Therefore, needing to raise costs on everyone (or the uninsured) by 10x, to cover the costs of the uninsured, is an argument that isn't supported by the evidence.		In my opinion, the true cause of the medical crisis however is that the hospitals get to unilaterally decide the supply to the consumers. *No consumer gets a say*. We just buy insurance and indirectly pay for *all of it* --  whatever the hospitals decide to build or buy or whomever they decide to hire.		So a small town hospital can hire 100 new doctors. Nobody has to ask for the doctors. Nobody has to approve it. They can just do it. Their costs go up. They pass the costs to the insurance company. And the insurance companies bundles up the costs for all hospitals and charges us all for the action. (Indirectly)		The hospital can look at its books and go, "Oh no, guys! The cost of medicine has gone up, AGAIN! Oh, shucks. I guess we'll have to increase the amount we bill insurance by another 1000%!"		The only thing that stops them from doing this is that if only one hospital does it at a time, that hospital might go bankrupt, because insurance won't reimburse the full amount to cover an outrageous increase in expense that much. But if all the hospitals are generally being irresponsible with what they buy and where they spend the money, then the cost of medicine is just assumed to be increasing at a basal level. Insurance charges more. Then we pay more.		The hospital is NEVER forced to make financially responsible decisions directly. They are only indirectly pressured by the insurance companies to not do anything too crazy, from year to year. But over a number of years, they can pressure the system to buy anything they want. And we pay for all of it, whether anyone likes it or not.

{"body":"You may have missed the point.  The cost of care is not related to defensive medicine per se, but rather, the hospital's statutory duties *as well as* their desire to avoid being sued for malpractice together result in indigents receiving effectively free care.  Those indigents do get billed, but the bills are essentially Monopoly money until one of those indigents happens to have a lawsuit and thus an "account receivable" from which to draw.  Then that indigent finds himself able to pay, and the bill he is quoted is wildly expensive because the hospital is trying to make good on its losses for all those other indigents who got free care and did not have lawsuits with which to pay.		My assertion based on uninsureds being charged 1000% of normal is that approximately 1 in 10 of those uninsureds winds up being able to pay (or perhaps less than that since even that one person who can pay will typically discount the payment by perhaps 40-60%).  The hospital thus starts at 10X real costs on its bill in order to have negotiating room down to its real operational cost, but the expectation is still that the one indigent who winds up having means with which to pay will assist in paying down the hospital's other losses.		Of course this also bleeds over into costs of care for ordinary patients who ARE insured.

Now, usually minus ambulance transport (which was invariably part of the scenario),  the cost at the hospital was around 1200$.  While I've avoided all debt in my life,  this is one I didn't do to well in avoiding.  I owe a WHOLE lot of medical costs.   But never was the charge some ridiculous amount as 15k for what you've listed,  although I've never actually been given pain meds in the hospital,  I can't imagine its much more costly than insulin, D50%,  D10%,  or the multiple bags of saline they dump into me,  often bilat,or the infusion sets used to administer any of it, while I'm there for the 5-6 hours they want me to stay.     		Now I'd say the average is around $1200 per visit if I deduct the ambulance road wherever.  Those vary depending on their charge,  non-emergency or emergency transport,  that can run between $125 to $650.      If it actually was billed as such,  you had a lot more done than you've stated.   I've been in hospitals in Atlanta,  Chicago, all through  Alabama and Louisiana, and once in Orlando when I was at Disney World.  While I don't enjoy that,  it did give me insight into the cost of emergency care outside of my home city.    		Now this was a recent visit to the hospital.  I had two lines,  one in my wrist one in my other arm.  I was given over 12 units of D10%.   I was transported by ambulance,  and was in the ER for 6 hours.   		http://i.imgur.com/hbQm640.png  This was the total cost,  what my insurance paid,  and what they made me pay (the exclusion)  because the services exceeded the set limit for emergency care.   		Now,  if we look at big cities,  like UCLA Santa Monica,  you can look at the charges for their individual care actions.  They don't itemize costs in the sense that you'd see a charge for each infusion set.   Though locally,  the ER doesn't do that here,  though they do appear on the EMS transport bill since the ambulance sticks them in,   they're about $15.  My transport for this trip was $74,  which I'm guessing included the two over the non-emergency transport (not lights and sirens going in),  here's their IV infusion charges at UCLA:Santa Monica:  http://i.imgur.com/9MPAtA8.png 		So clearly it wasn't the bilat that ran you that high.  I imagine that morphine costs are fairly average around the nation though I've only been given IV pain relievers the two or three times I chewed my tongue up into hamburger,but  looking at UCLA:SM again,  we see http://i.imgur.com/U89nn8v.png  8$ a pop for most,  whether injected solution or tablet.   		While the costs can vary a bit,  it isn't too much in the extreme.  The only extreme I've experienced truly is when I was  CT'd when I decided I wouldn't wake up when I should after stabilizing my glucose,  and that,  that's really expensive,  like $9,000.  That was my most expensive visit. 		I find this is representative of about the costs I've experienced everywhere I've had the misfortune of being hypoglycemia unaware and not remaining particularly conscious.  			As for you never seeing a doctor,  ERs are pretty spread thin,  always.  If your case was pretty cut and dry there is no need for the doctor to come talk to you about anything,   he looks at the chart,  rx's the needed meds,  and moves on to people who need more attention.   For all this though, I'm still very skeptical of 15,000$ for what you've described here,  there's something missing, and I'm definitely not going to believe that the intravenous infusion sets cost $1k  that's clearly untrue.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"robeph","name":"t1_cs0zg5d","parent_id":"t1_cs0r3hd","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433885075,"created_utc":1433881475}

{"body":"It's a lot more than 50, and it depends on how you define overcharging. 		Here is how it works. 		The hospital gets the majority of it's payments processed through the major insurance companies. Part of this process means the hospital or doctor, negotiates with the insurance companies and agrees upon how much certain procedures will cost, how much the insurance company will be billed, etc, and it's laid out and followed. 		So a patient comes in, has insurance, the insurance company keeps the hospital, labs, doctors, etc from charging too much (although they still charge an insane amount). If the doctor/hospital/lab wants to charge more for the procedure, they are no longer 'in network' and the insurance company cuts them off. So it is in their best interest to negotiate with the insurance companies and take a small cut in profits, for the steady and repeat business and on time payments. 			Now lets say you go to the hospital, and you don't have insurance. The doctor, hospital, lab, etc, are under no obligation to negotiate for lower prices, and they can charge you whatever they want because you're always free to go to another hospital (in principal at least). So if they want to charge you a million gagillion dollars for a few sutures, it's you VS them and you're probably not going to be able to negotiate a better deal. The patient can negotiate with the hospital to pay less than the initial amount, kind of like haggling, but this is usually only done if the patient would not otherwise be able to pay. IE They will take slightly less money (but still way more than it would cost in Europe or the rest of the world) because if they tried to take more, they wouldn't get any at all. 		So It's not exactly that the hospitals are overcharging, it's that they are under no obligations to negotiate a more reasonable cost for a procedure with an individual. So if you don't have insurance, you don't have a big multi billion dollar conglomerate batting on your behalf for a more reasonable (but still extortionate) price for services rendered. 		And on a related tangent, one of the reasons why health care is so expensive, is that you are paying for other peoples health care whether you want to or not. I always laugh a little when I hear people complain about not wanting public health care because they don't want their tax dollars going to pay for some deadbeats health insurance. The thing is, you already do pay for indigent and poor peoples health coverage. 		An indigent person has a heart attack, they have no money, the hospital must take them in and render aid. The hospital saves the persons life and they are released. There are limited measures the hospital and doctors can take to try to sue or collect their money from the person. At the end of the day, the person has no money, so there is nothing to take. But the hospital is a business, and the doctor doesn't do heart surgery out of the goodness of their heart, so since they lose X amount of dollars helping people who can't pay, they in turn must charge more money to those that can pay, otherwise they couldn't stay in business. 		Even better, if it's a county hospital, then your tax dollars from housing etc, go to subsidize the hospital and so you're paying for indigent peoples health care from your housing and sales tax. 		So if you ask me, what's better, having a collective public health care that includes preventative medicine so that the indigent person never suffers the heart attack in the first place, or leaving them uninsured until something that could have been prevented comes along and then costs even more money, I'd say it makes more sense to have everyone insured because over all it will result in less expense. 		You're already paying for indigent peoples health care, and you're paying a lot more for emergency health care, than you would for preventative.

If a patient has Insurance A, the dental practice will accept the maximum $200 they pay out, and writes off the rest. And if you're uninsured, well you're charged the whole $1000. 		So basically their entire pricing system was based off whatever the highest the practice thought it could get from insurance companies (or sometimes a bit higher to be "safe"), and if you're uninsured you're stuck paying those same rates.		I'm sure there's other factors involved too, such as the obscene cost of drugs, or malpractice insurance, but this is probably a big part of it for many hospitals too.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rachel53461","name":"t1_cs0v3uv","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433878532,"created_utc":1433874932}

"Usual and customary" for a basic cleaning is currently $93 so that is what you would be charged if you didn't have dental insurance. So, if you have dental insurance and we are "in network," the insurance company will give us a "fee schedule" which is the contracted negotiated rate which means we can't charge any more than that and we have to write off the difference if we charged too much.

Since the ACA (aka Obamacare) passed there are several new improvements that apply to all policies, whether they were purchased through an ACA exchange or not. First off, pre-existing conditions are no longer an issue, they don't even ask about them when you apply. There are no longer annual or lifetime caps on benefits, which is amazingly helpful if you have a serious, life-threatening condition or accident. Preventative care is covered completely, with no co-payments. While the ACA falls well short of the healthcare reform we need, it's certainly a helpful step in the right direction.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BlindLemonLars","name":"t1_cs1ktuc","parent_id":"t1_cs18dd6","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433927067,"created_utc":1433923467}

I've just read the entire thing - and I doubt every much that many other people have done so.		The study design is misleading at best. The authors use the markup on the medicare charge list as a surrogate for how much hospitals actually charge people. This may or may not be the case. A little background: every hospital has a master charge list. This is what they use to say to payors (government and private) essentially, "this is how much I think it costs to do procedure X at this institution given my total overhead, patient mix, necessary supplies, etc." This is generated at each place, and it can vary for a multitude of reasons: departments negotiate with supply companies so the hospital's cost is different at different places, overhead may be more in better staffed institutions (hey, more RNs = better right! nice hospital! well that costs money), etc. Additionally, different patient populations will require different levels of care for the same procedure. Someone who may be able to tolerate a procedure with just conscious sedation because he or she is otherwise healthy will cost less than a super-sick patient requiring general anesthesia for the same procedure. So if you take care of an overall sicker patient population, that also costs more for those sorts of reasons. 		All this is to say, the charge list is going to vary from place to place. Here's the rub, however, and the thing most ignored by everyone in this thread because of ignorant populist rage. I'm not even going to paraphrase it, I'm going to quote directly from the article:		>**Except in a few situations, hospital markups (ratios of charges over Medicare-allowable costs) do not have an effect on the amounts publicly insured patients pay because Medicare and Medicaid determine their own rules for paying hospitals.**		They *also* go on to state that, costs probably aren't this outrageous for the vast majority of people who have private insurance, either, because large payors negotiate rates with providers on a regular basis. There are many caveats to this statement, and it cuts both ways (large hospitals will negotiate better rates from payors which may cause higher premiums for people in that network, for instance). But overall the *vast* majority of people are not actually paying 1000% above what medicare pays. That idea, at best, is extraordinarily misleading.			----------			Which brings us to the real people who end up getting screwed by hospitals: the uninsured. I have no defense for the healthcare system on this point. It borders in the criminally negligent that we haven't figured out how to take care of the most vulnerable segment of our population. Medicaid is an atrocious piece of shit from figuratively everyone's point of view: the feds hate it because it's a huge cost for them. States hate it because it's a huge cost for them **and** they have to deal with the federal government fucking around with the amount they're willing to give the states year to year. Providers hate it because it pays so poorly that it doesn't even cover the cost of our work. Patients hate it because it has more holes than Swiss cheese and doesn't cover nearly enough of what it needs to cover.			Finally, I'll just briefly mention something that people don't seem to understand: hospitals will work with you if you're truly financially destitute - but you have to ask. From their perspective, the uninsured are bad debt and they expect to get almost nothing. Most rational people, when given the choice between zero dollars or literally any amount above that will take what they can get (FYI, the insured subsidize these patients - it's part of why our costs are higher than they need to be).","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Iatros","name":"t1_cs13kf6","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433891598,"created_utc":1433887998}

You can blame the lack of a government run health care alternative in the ACA for this. The ACA is a terrible piece of legislation that was written by insurance companies explicitly to their benefit. I think that we need at least *the option* of letting people into Medicare at any age. You'd have to increase the taxes for make up for the (almost assuredly) massive influx you'd see. Plus it would force the private companies to compete against a system with trivial overhead compared to the shit-show that is billing and coding in the modern healthcare world.

My apologies. However, I think my overall sentiment is correct. Ever read the posts about how a bag of saline costs $0.44 to create so that's exactly what inpatients should be charged (who cares about sterilization, standardization, regulation, storage, provider oversight, IV access, etc). Somehow, the fact that administering tylenol costs $6 in the hospital is a reflection of the prescribing physician's greed and the insane margins that hospital administration can yield. Because, as we all know, everybody pays their bills and those costs are in no way related to high human resource costs, liability, regulation, and displaced reimbursement for services rendered below cost. 		> The other part would be what? Greed and power.		Nothing so cynical, I'm afraid. At least not for those of us "on the ground:" the nurses, technologists, physicians, ancillary staff, and everyone who's trying to do what's right for the patient. The system sucks and is in dire need of overhaul, but to answer your implicit question, the problem is insurance companies and patient expectations. Let me address the former, then the latter.		Overhead on insurance runs something like 20%. Medicare's overhead used to be about 1-2% until they let private insurers sell "medicare advantage" plans, and the overhead on those is somewhere in the ballpark of 20%. Our highly complicated private insurance market is a huge driver of this, because it will always be in the insurance company's best interest to deny as many claims as possible. So hospitals and physician practice groups have to employ people just to submit bills for the care they provide. It's absolute insanity. 		As to my second point - patients have unrealistic expectations at almost every level of the healthcare system. It should be both extremely good *and* extremely cheap. All of our diagnostic tests should be 100% sensitive and specific. All of our treatments should be 100% efficacious and have no side-effects. All procedures should carry no risk. Those insanely high expectations are a **huge** driver of cost - we do tons of unnecessary testing and find things we never needed to find all because patients expect it, and providers are terrified of being sued off their ass if they miss anything. There are HUGE downsides in doing unnecessary tests. In addition to their direct cost, there's the issue of finding what we call "incidentalomas" - findings which would have never become clinically apparent or every affected the patient, but since now we have the data point of, say, 2mm lung nodule, that has to be worked up (for even more money). But when you have some patient come in and demand a scan, many doctors do it anyway because they're worried that the "patient satisfaction" score will be too low and they'll get dinged by the hospital and the insurance company.		Lastly, we defer far too much to what medically ignorant (and I mean that in a non-pejorative way) families want for their very obviously terminally ill family member. We spend something in the neighborhood of 25% of a given Medicare beneficiary's total cost in the last year of life. The goal of care in people who are clearly dying and have less than 1 year of life expectancy should be when the focus should be palliation, comfort, and dignity - not in an ICU with 5 tubes and lines on a ventilator. We defer far too much to what the family wants rather than only offering what is appropriate.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Iatros","name":"t1_cs17bke","parent_id":"t1_cs16pa8","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433898249,"created_utc":1433894649}

That's now how overcharges are calculated in a hospital/insurer litigation matter and, obviously, while academic researchers don't have access to data from hospitals/insurers directly very often, that should *at the very least* be acknowledged.

{"body":"**Let's talk about insurance/physician contracts.** (Since no one has brought it up, yet.)		*preemptive disclaimer: I worked as an insurance analyst in a nonprofit hospital for a number of years after college. I didn't work in the contracts department though. I have a base knowledge and rudimentary understanding of how the contracts work. I'm sure there's someone, who will read this, that knows a lot more that I do. Feel free to correct me if I give misleading information.*		OK. If you have insurance, then you know there are "network" facilities and staff as well as "non-network" facilities and staff. The difference in the two is a contract that has been written between the two with a very detailed agreement about allowable fees as well as services. 		Determining Allowable Services: Basically, if you don't have a certain diagnosis on your medical claim when it is filed to the insurance for a specific procedure then it will deny. (example: You cant bill for an appendectomy without a diagnosis of appendicitis.) 		If you're seeing a doctor who is in your network, s/he knows what procedures are allowable. If it's not an allowed procedure or doctor, then they have to have a letter of authorization from the payer or they will not be getting paid. MOST contracts have a clause that states the physician can NOT bill the patient for unauthorized services without a patient liability waiver being signed. 		Determining Chargeable Fees: These contracts also set a guideline for fee schedule. BUT I don't believe these are set prices. Generally, an insurance company will allow a percentage of a charge. (The hospital I worked for had set fees for everything. I can't say they all work like that for certain)		Now. Let's say Dr. Smith wants to make $100 for each visit. Dr. Smith also wants to be a network doctor for Cigna. Cigna pays at a 50% rate for their patients. If Dr Smith wants to make $100, he now has to charge $200!		"Well, can't Dr Smith charge the uninsured patients less and the insured patients more?" No. That is insurance fraud. BUT! Some hospitals and physicians will offer a discount to patients to offset this. Most state hospitals/nonprofit hospitals offer discounts upto 100% depending on income. (Something to think about if you're not insured and aren't loaded) 		So, the hospitals who are charging uninsured patients more could be doing it because the person writing this article didn't understand insurance contracts, or they're just mega scumbags who have a special place in hell. *shrug*","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrossEyed-FishFace","name":"t1_cs0lsbf","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433864377,"created_utc":1433860777}

{"body":"Not to be a pain, but I work for one of these corporations.  The article, at the bottom, says this:  "It makes little economic sense to ???mark something up 10 times what it actually costs and then give a discount,??? Anderson said. ???Clearly they expect someone to pay these inflated prices.???		I do not understand how this Anderson is a Professor of Health at Johns Hopkins.  This entire article is misleading in its tone, information, and assumptions.  He should know that this is NOT how charges work, nor will they ever.  Do you want to know how hospital charges work?		Charge amounts are made and agreed upon based upon agreements between Medicare, Commercial payors, Government, Workers Comp, and other insurors.  Let's look at Medicare.		In Medicare's instance, claim are entered using DRGs, APCs, or other such codes. Each code represents a certain ailment - 088 for concussion,459 for spinal susion, etc.  These codes, when entered, give a charge amount that is then adjusted, per hospital by numerous factors (Wage Index, COLA, VBP Adjustment Factor, Readmission Adjustments, Cost-to-Charge ratios, SSI%, education programs, etc.).  Each of these charges is pre-set, as are these adjustments.  Adjustments to charges are called "Contractual Adjustments" because, per a contract, the high charges are adjusted down to what the actual expected payment is supposed to be.  The payment is the Gross Revenue that we could expect.  So, a DRG has a charge of $1,000.  The contractual adjustment is 80%, meaning $800.  The hospital can expected a $200 payment, which is $200 in revenue.  However, as part of that $200, we must also include your co-pay, deductible, or co-insurance.  So, if you owe $100 for this visit, the insurance company really owes us only $100.		The last bit here.  Even before you see a discount program, and even before you see any charity amounts to lessen your bill, your bill has already been adjusted down to normal levels.  The levels you are expected to pay are compared and tested against other patients, with all other insurance types, to see what the normal amount is that the other companies are paying.  Discounts can then be offered on everyone who asks, basically, and additional charity care amounts are available for those who ask for the charity forms.  		Finally, the Affordable Card Act has a clause which prohibits what this article is saying the hospitals have done.		Take it from a guy who works in this area of the hospital industry.  This whole article is crap.  Hospitals make money, yes, but they lose a lot, too.  Hospitals lose so much money on the uninsured patients that there are local, county, state, AND federal-level programs intended to offset these amounts.  Each hospital spends time every year making a cost report that takes well over 400 hours, depending on size, and not including the government audits that can follow for a decade to come.  Every single cost report is audited - EVERY SINGLE ONE - and hospitals that do what this article states are hit.  Hard.  		TL;DR - This article is crap, and the Professor's statements show that he has not ever been a revenue manager in a hospital organization.

{"body":"So many factors go into this. One is that people go in with life-threatening injuries and cannot pay for the services. So, that bill never gets paid. So, they overcharge the next customer to make up for it.		Then insurance companies have contracts with the facilities. By accepting these contracts, the facilities get more customers plus a guaranteed way of getting paid (i.e. through the insurance company). A little bit of profit from the insurance company is better than nothing from the uninsured or an out-of-network customer.		When I had an epidural for my first pregnancy, the anesthesiology dept did not have my updated health insurance information. So, they sent me a bill for over $8000. For an epidural that barely worked. I sent them my new information, which was similar to my old health insurance and they still sent me the same bill. I then sent them the info again along with a letter (basically a "how-to") that said what had changed. Then I received a bill for $200. The health insurance company was charged $1000. I mean, I knew that insurance companies made deals with doctors and facilities but $8000 vs $1000? That right there tells me how much profit they are making. If they can make money off of $1000, I can't imagine what kind of money they are making with charging $8000. 		Even with paying a premium every paycheck, we still have to pay co-pays and deductibles. It's so ridiculous. It's not just that people need to be covered, they need decent plans. When Obamacare was going through the motions initially, all I was thinking was "insurance isn't all it's cracked up to be." 		Another problem: out-of-network. My husband did his due diligence to find an in-network doctor to get back surgery. Come to find out that the assistant doctor was out-of-network. So, we had to pay for this "assistant doctor" that was probably just standing in the room observing. I was so upset over that. Why is it my job to research every single person in the facility to find out if they are in-network? Especially when you are talking about something that is planned in advance (not an emergency). It should be the facility's job to contact the insurance provider and find out if every single person in the building is in-network. If they aren't, provide that info ahead of time to the patient. If the patient doesn't want to pay for the out-of-network employee, keep them out of the room or find another facility to get the job done.		There are some employers that provide a service to help you find medical providers, but it costs money. Comparing providers should be free or a minimal cost for everyone. Medical procedures should only be in a free market if the information is easily accessible. But, in most cases, most patients don't even know what they are paying until the procedure is over. And if there is only one ER within driving distance of your home, it needs to be regulated. If there is no competition, they can gouge your eyes out and then sew them back together and charge you for it.		Malpractice lawsuits are ridiculous too. Yes, there are some instances when doctors have been negligent, but the erroneous lawsuits do not help. The whole system in general needs to be revamped. And I really don't even know how something so vast and intricate can be done.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sarcazm","name":"t1_cs0mtw9","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433866055,"created_utc":1433862455}

{"body":"A lot of the comments here are anecdotes about a personal experience with US healthcare or another country's.  I think the easiest way to think of it by considering 3 parties: you, me, and an insurance company over a 1 year period.  Only a handful events can happen each year to you and me: neither of us, both of us, or one of us uses the insurance money.  Therefore, the insurance company either makes money (insurance cost), makes less money (insurance cost - healthcare cost) or loses money.  If you think of it in this way, it's not crazy to hear the hospital is overcharging the uninsured 10-fold.  Guess what? The uninsured have already driven up the insureds' insurance costs and regardless, how many do you think pay the bill anyway?  I think 1 in 10, or the hospital recouping 10% of an uninsured person's bill is optimistic.  When you pay into the system and everyone else is contributing money, why is it a headline that we penalize those who don't? (Again it ultimately won't be a monetary penalty because they overwhelmingly just won't pay).   It is easier to write a headline calling out 50 hospitals, than to pick apart 100,000 Americans' overuse of the system (Ms. Jones was too cautious about gas pains and got a cardiac work-up, Mr. Smith had an unrelenting migraine and wanted a CT for reassurance, etc etc).

About thirty minutes later we were discharged without ever going past the waiting room.		Now, the bills. First from the ER. There were charges for fixing the dislocation and for the ER visit itself. I called the hospital to ask about the charges and naturally nobody in the billing department could tell me what the charges meant or what I was paying for. I then got a bill from the ER group (which is separate from the hospital) for an evaluation and the dislocation. After speaking to a friend, who happens to run the ER group, he indicated if there was no dislocation to fix, I shouldn't be charged for a dislocation. I disputed that charge and the ER group elected to bill me for the item which was the least out of pocket for me, which happens to be the dislocation. Now the hospital refuses to adjust the fees because they still see a dislocation code on the chart. How much you might ask is the hospital charging me? $1553, of which I'm responsible for $1034 after insurance negotiated rates. The absurdity is they automatically bill based upon whatever codes the doctor enters.

I can't access the actual paper at the moment so I'm going by the abstract.		As far as I can tell there is no data in this study that actually includes uninsured patients.  They looked at Medicare data to make these conclusions.  Medicare data includes two values for cost (it actually includes four or five but only two are relevant here): Charge and Payment.  Charge is the amount that the hospital billed to Medicare, and Payment is the amount that Medicare actually paid to the hospital.		First, assuming that the amount that Medicare pays to the hospital is equal to the actual cost isn't very reasonable.  I'm more familiar with Medicaid and it is well documented that Medicaid pays less for care than it costs to give.  That's why it can be so difficult to find a doctor that accepts Medicaid.  I don't think Medicare is much different in that respect.		Second, there is no penalty for over-billing Medicare.  You get in big trouble if you just make stuff up (yes, that happens), but you can charge them whatever you want.  It doesn't matter.  Medicare will pay you what they want to pay you.  Thus, lots of hospitals charge insane prices to Medicare/Medicaid just to make sure they get the maximum payment back.  I don't think it's valid to assume that these are the same charges levied against uninsured patients.		Uninsured patients do indeed receive insane medical bills.

{"body":"Let me give the prospective from a doctor.  Medicine used to be all about the relationship between the doctor and the patient.  Now there are hundreds of other companies involved - each and every one is making money off of what once was a much more simple relationship.  These include the for profit hospitals with their huge administrations all looking to maximize profits.		Dont be mistaken - this article makes it sounds like insurance companies are there for you - negotiating your rates.  They are not.  They are trying to protect themselves by paying out less $ and maximizing their profits.  You dont see them lowering your health insurance rates do you?   		I completely agree healthcare reform really needs to take place.  I dont think a national system of healthcare is the solution for many reasons that I'm not going to get into or it would hijack this thread.  I do think there is a lot of need for reform: new rules and regulations to prevent price gouging by everyone involved in healthcare.  It starts from the very beginning:		1. vendors - if it says "medical" they will charge 100-1000 Xs the price of the same product for general use.  This would be hard to regulate but the doctors don't pay for this.  ALL the extra cost is tacked onto your bill.  The prices charged to the hospital/doctors would need to be regulated to stay within reason.  Who determines what is reasonable?  Thats the problem.  Big Pharma has big money to lobby...		2. insurance companies - Their goal is to NOT pay out.  They make money the less they insure you.  Its generally a type of scam.  I would make it a requirement that everyone have a safety net with catastrophic insurance coverage and then the rest should be paid for through a private health fund.  Why is this not a norm in this country?  No one saves $$ anymore - especially for health care.  Imagine if you had a safety net policy for cheap.. and the rest of the $ went into a cash health fund.  I NEVER have medical expenses yet I pay $1400 a month for my family-every month.  Taking some out for catastrophic insurance, in a year I could have $10K, 2 years $20k, etc...		3. Malpractice limits - insurance and lawyers; a great combination.   Malpractice limits would help to reduce malpractice insurance and lawyer retention fees that hospitals and doctors have to pay to protect themselves.  Along with this - bad doctors need to be held accountable and licenses suspended/revoked for malpractice.  Protect the public by filtering out the bad ones.  Mistakes happen and a doctor shouldnt be scared to provide care.		4. Pricing limits for procedures.  There should be a regulated fee for everyone.  The pricing should be the same across the board - insured or not insured, give them the best rate possible.  Stop playing this game of it will be $1000 unless you pay cash or get a lawyer then its $600.  Again who decides the rates?		5. A public safety net - the uninsured need somewhere to go for healthcare.  We need to have clinics setup to provide services for them at lower costs.  The ER should be for extreme situations - not headaches or small burns/lacerations, etc.  If you are not insured or cannot pay for services then you can go to these clinics.  Would they be the same level of care?  Probably not - hospitals and top notch care is crazy expensive.		These are all suggestions -  not perfect but our current system is just not working.  Its too expensive for those that do have insurance and for those that do not have insurance they are either a drain on the system or they put themselves in a life altering financial hole.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rathemon","name":"t1_cs0wgae","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433880555,"created_utc":1433876955}

This is kind of like how they do it in [Singapore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore):		> Singapore has a non-modified universal healthcare system where the government ensures affordability of healthcare within the public health system, largely through a system of **compulsory savings, subsidies, and price controls**. Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions to provide subsidies within a nationalised health insurance plan known as Medisave.		Singaporeans can choose between three levels of subsidy at the time of a healthcare event, with different levels of service. For example at the lowest level, you'd be in a dorm, while at the highest level you'd have a private room.

So if the "cost" for an X-ray is $1000, they might make a deal with Medicaid where Medicaid will pay 50% of the cost of an X-ray for their beneficiary, United health might pay the hospital 55% of the cost, etc. so what ends up happening is, hospitals increase their book value "costs" for a procedure so that, while the percentage of the cost that a payer will pay is the same, the income that the hospital will get for the service is more. 			What ends up happening is that when someone ends up paying for a service out of pocket, they pay the FULL inflated book value cost of a service. They're the only ones paying 100% - as we've shown, Medicare, etc pays less. So what's needed is payment reform, so that the book value or "sticker price" of services is their real cost. Then paying out of pocket will be more reasonable. One way to do this is by having every payer pay the same rate.

This hospital is the only level 1 trauma center in the region and the area it is located in is not the best part of town. Florida has one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation, couple that with the area this hospital is located and you can imagine we see TONS of uninsured patients. 		Do you think we'll ever be able to actually make that money? Do you really think all of them pay their bills? We get patients coming in just to seek pain pills or be able to rest in a bed of the weather for a few hours. Can they be turned away? No, not if they come in with a "legitimate reason."		If you consider the fact that we treat loads and loads of patients for care we never see a dime for, a large quantity of medicare/medicaid patients which is underfunded as it is and only a small percentage of our patient population has private insurance it's a miracle we're even able to stay afloat. In fact, the hospital was losing money every single year up until a couple of years ago, now we're barely over the black line. 		While I don't agree with overcharging patients so big wigs in for-profit organizations can see 7-figure salaries, I can see why it is necessary in other areas. 		Also, most, if not all, hospitals will discount a bill if you are not insured. They will also work with you on the total and a no interest payment plan that is affordable to you.

{"body":"Horrible, misleading title. Please read the entire article before commenting, and, if possible, understand how hospital pricing works.		> Using data for all Medicare-certified hospitals between May 2012 and April 30, 2013, researchers tallied up total charges, then divided them by the patient care costs, which they defined as total costs Medicare agrees to pay.		Medicare has significantly lower reimbursement rates than private insurers, so this is not an accurate reflection of actual hospital prices. Of course, researchers need access to something, and private insurers do not hand out their reimbursements rates (they differ by hospital and have a lot to do with bargaining leverage), but still, this is an essential point that cannot be overlooked.		I also really would love more insight into methodology here. How did they determine which patients were uninsured? They also mention that competition is a key factor, any evidence for this? It's too bad, because market concentration is consistently shown to be positively correlated with hospital pricing, yet they don't offer any specific figures.		The uncompensated care is another important piece, it's well known that hospitals (both for and non-profit) provide a lot of uncompensated care. Simply, you can't refuse treatment and people often cannot pay. Yet, we don't get many details here either.		In short, I don't doubt that some hospitals are exploiting their market positions to overcharge (this is why we see renewed reinforcement from the FTC/DOJ around hospital mergers, because they result in higher prices - although that mechanism has more to do with bargaining leverage with insurers and those prices being passed on to consumers via higher premiums), but there are few actual facts in this article and it's just reinforcing an already uninformed debate on healthcare in this country.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fightONstate","name":"t1_cs1a8jm","parent_id":"t3_395fj3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1433903535,"created_utc":1433899935}
