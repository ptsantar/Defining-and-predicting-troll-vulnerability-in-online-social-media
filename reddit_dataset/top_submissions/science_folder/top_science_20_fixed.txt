{"body":"You're right about the mismatched skull thing. For a long time, a skull similar to that of Camarasaurus was incorrectly set at the end of Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus. This was mainly because the skull is generally the first thing to detach and and get destroyed after a vertebrate dies, so you usually don't find big skeletons with skulls attached. Generally you can tell the difference by the more elongated skulls of Apatosaurus which contrast the more bull-dog like Camarasaurus. However, this actually doesn't bear directly on the controversy around the name of the animal.		The Apato/Bonto naming thing actually stems from an unfortunate (but now relatively obsolete) convention in the practice of naming animals. Historically, the first person to name an animal generally got "priority". So even if Joe Schmoe discovered a crappy fossil in his back yard and published it in a journal no one has heard of, his name would still be the preferred one, even if later someone gave a much more comprehensive discussion of the same animal (being unaware of Joe Schmoe) and provided a different name that was widely accepted.		This has been particularly troublesome with dinosuars, and something exactly like his happend with Apato/Brontosaurus. The discovery of apatosaurus was based on a really crummy fossil published in an obscure journal that no one read (in fact, the name, meaning "deceptive lizard" ~~refers to the poor quality of the type specimen~~[my bad, /u/LoyalGarlic is right on that one]). On the other hand Brontosaurus was a truly magnificent find, one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered at the time, and remarkably well preserved. It made a splash and people latched on to it.		It was only later that someone discovered that it was actually the same thing as Apatosaurus and given the rule of priority, they deferred to Apatosaurus.		Fortunately the rule of "priority" is much less strict now, and an exception would probably have been made in the case of Brontosaurus. If you want the full story though, I highly recommend an excellent essay by Stephen Jay Gould called "Bully for Brontosaurus".		What these guys are saying is basically "we looked into it really closely and we think Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus really are different animals that should have different names". I should caution that it'll take a while for the rest of the paleo community to digest these results and they may not end up buying them anyway...such is science.

{"body":"There's another great story about name confusion and dinosaurs.  In 1892 E D Cope discovered a single vertebrate and used it to describe a new species of ceratopsian he called Manospondylus gigas.  Fast forward 100 years and some scientists find his vertebrate in a museum and reanalyze it.  They find that it actually belongs to another already named species: Tyrannosaurus rex.  Now Tyrannosaurus rex was originally conceived as two genera, the other being Dynamosaurus imperiosis.  Only because Barnum Brown happened to use the name T. rex earlier in his paper than D. imperiosis did that name become standard.  Now it appeared that M. gigas was the real official name of T. rex, and that Tyrannosaurus would go the way of Brontosaurus (until today apparently).		So the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature had to do something, because they'd already killed Brontosaurus, there would be riots in the street if T. rex was announced invalid as well.  So they made up some new rules that allowed for an exception.  The rules were that a name that had been accepted as official for 100 years, and had been referenced 25 in peer reviewed papers by 10 different authors, would be considered valid over the original name.		And thus did Tyrannosaurus rex narrowly avoid being renamed Manospondylus gigas, which to be fair isn't a terrible name.  It just isn't suitable for the Tyrant King.  They really should recycle it for another genus.

{"body":"Well... you are right		I wouldn't say the rules are less strict, just that this is a case of a name regaining validity.		Technically Brontosaurus never stopped being used, it was just Apatosaurus was the accepted name for both specimens because the name was determined first and described both specimens until someone came by and said "wait, these are different animals!".  Once that was determined, you actually can't rename it because it already has been given a name and credit is returned to the orginal namer.  Or something along those lines, systematic nomenclature is much more structured just around the determining names, and has nothing to do with cladistics or quality.		It doesn't matter if someone found a better specimen later and decided to name it something new.  If someone named it first it goes by that name.  However, that doesn't mean the new name is wrong, and as the debate goes on the name Brontosaurus can be removed or recovered.  But at the end of the day, no one can come in and change the name that describes an Apatossaurs or a Brontosaurus.  Those names are set in stone and both can never be truly replaced.		[Check it](http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp), Nomenclature is a tricky beast but it is there for the protection of a scientist and literature.  It doesn't really have a bias and that's why we use it.

{"body":"The main Sauropod group (Neosauropoda) is divided in two big sub-families, Macronaria and Diplodocoidea. Diplodociodea includes Diplodocus and it's close relatives, the "Diplodocidae" (like Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus) as well as some more obscure groups like Rebbachisauridae. Macronaria includes everything else, Brachiosaurids and Titanosaurids. In comparison Diplodicids are very slender, while Macronarians were generally far more robust. Brachiosaurus was the heaviest animal in it's environment, which it shared with Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus.	tl;dr: Brachiosaurus is a huge, enormous mountain of flesh		Now to the Apatosuaurs/Brontosaurus question: Both were described during the "Bone Wars", a feud between the palaeontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Onothial Charles March. Many, many new genera and species were described, like Allosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and as we know today even Tyrannosaurus (from an isolated tooth, dubbed Manospondylus gigas). Apatosaurus is a relative of Diplodocus, but much more heavily built.		Apatosaurus was described by March in 1877, Brontosaurus in 1879. Now, the problem with the "Bone Wars" is that both contestants often valued one-upmanship over scientific accuracy. Relatively quickly Brontosaurus was deemed to be just another specimen of Apatosaurus, belonging to a new species, *Apatosaurus excelsus*, and as the older name takes priority we call the animal Apatosaurus instead of Brontosaurus. The new study now argues that the new material actually belongs to a seperate genus, although one very closely related to Apatosaurus, which would make the name Brontosaurus valid again, as *Brontosaurus excelsus*.		NOW ACTUAL ELI5:		Both Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are genera (basically one step above a species) describes in the late 19th century. Quickly people pointed out the Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus looked quite similar, and eventually *Brontosaurus excelsus* was deemed to be a variant of Apatosaurus, and thus *Apatosaurus excelsus* was born. Now, about a century later, we can look much better at bones and found that Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus might indeed be separate **genera**. So Apatosaurus would lose the *excelsus* species, which would become *Brontosaurus excelsus* again.		Brachiosaurus is not very closely related to Apatosaurus, but shared a habitat with it.","depth":1,"score":134,"ups":134,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KlingonAdmiral","name":"t1_cq42tvk","parent_id":"t1_cq421rz","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428417654,"created_utc":1428414054}

{"body":"It's not particularly novel, but a good application. Because most fossil species are only known from a single specimen in much of vertebrate paleontology, this opportunity doesn't show up too often. There's been many fragmentary remains recovered from dinosaurs of this group (which has historically resulted in the naming of new species which probably shouldn't have been named as separate, as they were based on very scant remains). So, they wanted to use this method to incorporate that material into the analysis; ideally, if two specimens are the same species, the analysis won't recognize a difference between them (called a 'polytomy' in these studies).		It's tough to say about the validity of this new naming procedure; I'm a vertebrate paleontologist but I don't work much with sauropods so I can't say how most workers in the field will take this. I've heard about this coming for a few years now, so I can't say this will be surprising to anyone.		I do know a bit about naming and taxonomic procedure in general, though, and it has little to do with phylogenetic analysis. A name is based on a 'holotype' or 'definition' specimen, which has certain diagnostic characters that are used to refer other specimens to that name. Because Brontosaurus is a name that refers to a holotype that does not exist in real life (the wrong head on a body), as I understand it that name could never be used unless we (impossibly) found a dinosaur with that head/body combination, as that specific morphology is what the name refers to.

{"body":"They've found proto-feathers/quill-like filaments on ornithischians, namely *[Tianyulong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianyulong)* and *[Psittacosaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacosaurus)*. The former is a heterodontosaurid, which are rather basal ornithischians (although this specimen from the Cretaceous, this type of ornithischian is rather basal to the group as a whole), and the latter is a ceratopisian. There's been a finding in Russia in 2014 (*Kulindadromeus*) which I believe is phylogenetically between heterodontosaurids and the more derived ceratopsians,		It is unclear if these are homologous, and even less so that these are homologous to the proto-feathers on theropods, and it's possible these lineages evolved analogously. But they absolutely could be, and the argument has been made, since the *Tianyulong* discovery bridged some of the cerotopsian/theropod gap. 		It's worth noting that theropods basal to coelurosaurs, namely *Sciurumimus* described in 2012, also has evidence of fuzziness, bridging the gap a bit as well.		Anyway, if we find fossils from earlier strata with preserved filamentous integument that bridges the ornithischian/saurischian gap further, then it's likely sauropods are either secondarily featherless or preserved something similar that have not been preserved in specimens using phylogenetic bracketing.			Indeed, it we ever find such evidence, it will support the hypothesis that proto-feather-like filamentous structures are basal to all dinosaurs. And if that's ever the case, I think we'll start seeing musings of feather like structures being basal to all avemetarsalia (that's everything more closely related to birds than crocodiles, including pterosaurs), since it's clear that pterosaurs had a filamentous fuzz called pycnofibers, covering their bodies. Indeed, [here's an article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/did-all-dinosaurs-have-feathers-719742/?no-ist) written by Brian Switek discussing just this topic.		So while we lack evidence right now, it's not unreasonable that sauropods might have had something filamentous going on somewhere, at least at some ontogenetic stage.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kaisuteknon","name":"t1_cq4962c","parent_id":"t1_cq41knk","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1428428076,"created_utc":1428424476}

{"body":"What happened with the head is a seperate issue (TL:DR for that: real head wasn't found for a while, and they modeled it off of known sauropod heads that turned out to not resemble the real head at all).		Basically, fragmentary remains were named Apatosaurus ajax. Several years later, a partial skeleton was named Brontosaurus excelsus. Decades later, after two more species of Apatosaurus had been named based on better skeletal material, some researchers noticed how extremely similar the Apatosaurus species were to Brontosaurus; they proposed that both belonged to a single genus and most paleontologists agreed. 		Fast forward to today. Some scientists decided to use new tools to test whether Apatosaurus excelsus was truly an Apatosaur, and found that it was distinct from the other three species of Apatosaurus in many ways.

As your other replier stated, the head is different. Basically, what we colloquially  know as *Apatosaurus* was named first. The scientific name is *Apatosaurus ajax.*  Some years later, the same guy (Marsh, btw, a well known paleontologist who named lots of dinosaurs, including stegosaurus and triceratops), named another species, *Brontosaurus excelsus.* A handful of years later, another scientist grouped these two species in the same genus, since the first specimen was not fully grown, they were found in the same fossil bed, among other things. In taxonomy, names are  given priority based on age???that is, the oldest assigned name has precedence over later names in cases of conflict. Thus *Apatosaurus* subsumes *Brontosaurus*.
