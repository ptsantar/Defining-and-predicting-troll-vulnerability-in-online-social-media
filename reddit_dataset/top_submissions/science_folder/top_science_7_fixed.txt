Do you live with anyone else (other than a partner)? How often do you come into contact with their blood? Having (non-anal) sex with someone who is HIV positive, while being a risk, is an order of magnitude less risky than anal sex. 		Also, HIV tests are not 100% accurate and may not always detect the virus in the first year of infection. This, combined with the extremely high (relative to the general population) incidence of HIV among MSM and the high transmission rates of anal sex is why all MSM are deferred.","depth":6,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Qel_Hoth","name":"t1_cqv03zb","parent_id":"t1_cquyzl9","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1430493070,"created_utc":1430489470}

{"body":"You seem to be speaking from a place of genuine curiosity, so I'll try to help you understand the problem with Voter ID laws.		How much actual fraud would be prevented? One estimate (one of the more generous I've seen, and I taught this in a political science class) says that over the past 3 presidential elections, there have been around 30 cases of voter fraud. That's over the course of 8 years, around 300 million votes, and all 50 states. This is also the count of voter fraud cases, not voter ID fraud. Many/most of these cases were voter REGISTRATION fraud, which wouldn't affect the actual votes on election day at all.		Regarding the expense of state IDs, we see two major issues. First, due to the long history of poll taxes and other racially-biased disenfranchisement efforts, the courts have ruled that we cannot require people to pay money in order to vote. Requiring a state ID at least indirectly serves as a poll tax, no matter how small it may be. Second, you may not be aware of the availability of DMV offices. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of counties with no DMV whatsoever. Many other counties have DMVs with ridiculously short operating hours or no weekend coverage. Even if the IDs are free, getting one can be nearly impossible for the working poor or the elderly (which makes up pretty much the entire population of people without IDs).		I know that you can't see why a person wouldn't want/need an ID, but there are literally millions of people without a driver's license. If you don't drive, you often don't have a driver's license. If you're retired, you don't need one to get hired somewhere. If you've been working at the same job for 30 years, you may not have been asked for your ID in ages. There are a plethora of lifestyles in which a state-issued ID simply isn't necessary.

So the compromise that I would propose, is that you could apply for a free, non-expiring ID at your polling place on voting day, with evidence such as birth certificate that it's really you.

After the limit is reached, we monitor the recipient for donor antibodies. If we can detect them, then we have to weigh the risk of popping the patient's own cells versus giving more blood.

{"body":"Exactly. The ABO system antibodies are what we call natural antibodies, so you make them from a young age without ever having been exposed to ABO antigens. This is why you an O person can't receive A or B blood. This enzyme aims to remove the A and B antigens from donated blood. 		BUT, blood banking is more complicated. There are many more antigens on red cells, and patients do make antibodies against these too, but only after exposure to the antigen. This is why we give Rh(D) neg mothers Rhogam. Since they are D neg they can make anti-D if exposed to D antigens on the fetus. Once they do, their anti-D antibodies can kill their next child. Rhogam blocks the production of anti-D. 		So a chronically transfused patient who has made clinically significant antibodies against red cell antigens not in the ABO family like anti-K, or anti-e, for example, can only receive blood that is negative for those antigens. These are protein antigens that this new enzyme doesn't treat for, so we'd still have to screen donor blood and crossmatch it the old fashioned way.

Therefore, the antibodies are not required for a successful transfusion, only the absence of antigens.

{"body":"Go back and read my comment again. :) Your right antibodies aren't part of a successful transfusion, but they are part of unsuccessful ones. 		I am talking about **patient** antibodies. There are a lot more antigens on red cells than just A and B. When patients make antibodies against these antigens we can't give them blood that has the corresponding antigens. Bad things can happen if we do. So we have to screen our donor units. 		This means I can't just give out O blood willy nilly, there is no truly universal blood! Yes, if the patient has never received blood before (or been pregnant) O shouldn't be an issue, but if they have, they've been exposed to all sorts of red cell antigens we don't naturally make antibodies to. Antigens that this new enzyme treatment does not destroy. 		This is why we always type and screen our patients. That means an ABO type and a screen for clinically significant antibodies. If the patient is making any antibody we care about we have to test donor units to find ones negative for those antigens, AND test some the patient's serum with the potential units just to be safe. This can get tough in chronically transfused patients who make a ton of antibodies. 		The only time we technically don't do this is in emergency uncrossmatched transfusions, but even then we run a screen on the patient ASAP and switch their units to crossmatched ones as soon as we can.		This new enzyme treatment won't change this. It will give us a larger pool of O blood, but we will still have to screen our patients and crossmatch them.
