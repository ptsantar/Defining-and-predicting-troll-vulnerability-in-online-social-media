{"body":"The problem with Venus isn't the pressure. We can deal with the pressure just fine, 90 atmospheres is a lot, but we can build things that withstand a lot more.		The problem is the heat. Venus has a surface temperature around 460 celsius. This easily cooks any electronics you put on your spacecraft. So you need to isolate your spacecraft to prevent the electronics from melting. But electronics produce heat themselves as well and there's nowhere to lose that heat since the outside is even hotter. So spaceships on the surface of venus are limited by their thermal mass. Since thermal mass scales with actual mass and spaceflight is all about minimizing mass, our probes don't last long.		Longest we had a probe on the surface was the russian Vega 2 probe, which lasted about an hour. If you want longer duration missions you need some elaborate refrigeration system. This refridgeration system would draw a lot of power, so you need a big powersource. And this big powersource doesn't really work on Venus because almost all our powersources run on temperature gradients. You can see where this is going.

{"body":"First off you're asking the wrong person.  I'm a NAUI certified diver of the lowest level.  The deepest I've gone on scuba gear was 60 feet, and that was 20 ft below my certification level.  My experience with submersibles is zilch, never been in one.  I do know that we have vessels capable of diving to incredible depths.  I believe James Cameron (movie director) went down into the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest (or damn close) spot in the ocean.  		However life support is a huge issue, at that depth you have limited time to spend looking around.  You have to keep in mind that you still have to ascend 20,000 feet of ocean, and you can't do that quickly.  So most of your air supply is spent on the descent and ascent, what little remains allows you to explore at the desired depth.		As someone who's space expertise begins and ends at space camp in 5th grade....we can get a ship to Venus.  I believe we have sent unmaned vessels already.  The issue is in getting a manned spacecraft there.  Again the biggest issue is life support, you need to supply a steady amount of oxygen (obviously) to keep a human being alive.  		The next constraint would be fuel to get there.  It takes a lot of fuel to move and control a spacecraft quickly.  Which is a necessity if a human being is on board, because the longer the trip takes the more oxygen, food and water need to be supplied.  		If you remove the human being from the ship then you can use an engine like the Voyager spacecraft did.  Which is a nuclear engine that produces very little thrust, but has a long life time.  I believe one of the Voyager craft is now reaching the edge of our solar system.  Which is a crazy distance to travel, it's absolutely amazing the distance it has traveled...however it's taken forty years because it's moving so slow across such great distances.		Personally I think if we're going to make long distance manned missions a possibility we need to accept they're going to be a one way trip.  I'm confident we could get a person to Mars.  We could land them on Mars.  They could survive for awhile and transmit back observations and data...but they would die there.  Getting them back is currently unrealistic.   However there are more than enough trained people who are willing to make that journey, they've stated as such.  I'm personally for it, as morbid as it is to send a volunteer to their certain death it would advance our scientific capabilities.

Specifically, the afferent and efferent arteries of each individual fila- ment are closely coupled (Fig. 2E) and stacked in an alternating pattern within the arch (Fig. 2, C and D) so that the cold oxygenated blood of each efferent vessel (returning from the respi- ratory exchange surfaces) should be warmed by the conduction of heat from the warm de- oxygenated blood in the afferent filament ar- teries on either side (which are carrying blood to the gas exchange surfaces).

Others have told you that's impossible, but I think that's actually a good question if you rephrase it a little bit. Anyway there's a half-answer that can be found in bacteria. If you rephrase it a bit, what you're asking is, "How do we determine taxonomy for an organism that has parents from two divergent groups?"		In Bacteria, this happens all the time. While Bacteria don't have "parent**s**" since they are asexual, horizontal gene transfer happens constantly. We see Bacteria with *archaeal* genes - horizontal gene transfer across *domains*. So if we were to find (or create!) some organism where half of its genome is from an alphaproteobacterium and half of its genes are from an actinobacterium, where does it belong? That's the same as asking, "if we created an organism that's half cat and half turnip, is it a cat or a turnip?"		The answer is to give up and concede that our current taxonomic system is inadequate. there is no good way to classify something like that.

I don't think there's going to be one. In my mind, ecological questions (what you're trying to answer via cladistics) are better when focused on genes rather than species.
