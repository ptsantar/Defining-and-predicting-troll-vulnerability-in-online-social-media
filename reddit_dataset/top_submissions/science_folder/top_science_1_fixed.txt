It is not easily broken down in the environment or in your body, but it can find its way to the proteins and DNA and interfere with them.		Proteins and DNA (and RNA) all depend on their shape for their functionality. Their shape is dependent on the balance between hydrophobic forces within the molecule and hydrophilic forces between the molecule and the surrounding water. When you put a hydrophobic solvent into the mix (like benzene) that balance is disrupted, and as a result, the proteins/DNA/RNA can change shape. Sometimes that has no effect, sometimes it messes up DNA replication and gives you cancer.		So, benzene is "bad" because it persists in organisms and the environment (although it's not as bad in that sense as a lot of chemicals) and it can give you cancer (although as far as carcinogens go, it's not real high up on the list)","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"6thReplacementMonkey","name":"t1_cmym5ey","parent_id":"t1_cmy9xnc","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1418916173,"created_utc":1418916173}

{"body":"Should they apply to extraterrestrials? Yes, of course. Will they? A far more interesting question.		I think it depends on how possible and beneficial trade is compared to the cost and benefit of conquering a world, as well as the question of if we need the same *types* of world as other races and also whether we've managed to significantly improve humanity's thinking over the intervening years. 		There is a way of answering questions about what an entity will do called the outside view. What you do is you assume they'll do now what they have done in the past in similar situations. Lets look at what countries have done in the past as a proxy for what planets may do in the future. For example, in the past when capturing a country was relatively easy and the rewards large we got colonialism. All the advanced countries used their technology to take control of all of the rest of the countries, with plenty of atrocities on the side. People managed to deionise and dehumanise the enemy for having the wrong skin colour or religion or anything really, which was successful to the point that the people doing the slaughter probably thought it was the right thing to do and the people *voting* for the the slaughter thought it was a fantastic idea. Imagine to what extent an alien species could be dehumanised, I'm sure they'd have something that could be used. Maybe they look like insects, maybe their life cycle involves birthing 50 children with the expectation that 5 survive to adulthood, whatever. 		Now in the current age we have a global economy, and that is in large part because in the vast majority of cases trading with a country gets your country more benefits than invading a country. What do you get from invading a country these days? Very little really, it takes decades before the rebels die down (if at all) and the guerillas can bomb people using IED's without much risk. Meanwhile you're spending huge piles of money to keep your forces there. Back in the old days a small country like the UK could invade and capture a third of the world [one country after another](http://yis7ahum.wikispaces.com/Growth+and+Change+in+the+Borders+of+the+British+Empire). Nowadays it takes the largest superpowers decades to kinda-sorta hold onto a country, and it's only really worth it to deter other countries from trying anything. Trade is much simpler and more rewarding.		So if we get to the stars with our thinking much the same as it is now, then the thing determining how the treat the aliens is trade vs conquest. If trade is lots more beneficial, then we will likely trade and atrocities will be kept to a minimum. If conquest is easy and rewarding, then we'll capture worlds for fun and profit. I'm sure we'll even convince ourselves that it's for the alien's own good. After all, they don't understand the true meaning of friendship (or whatever emotion/value we have that they don't which we consider important). Clearly the thing to do is implant them all with friendship chips so that they can better understand the important things in life and to do that we just have to invade them by jove. After all, it's for their own good.

Humans have a developed frontal lobe which allows us to experience time in a way that many other sentient beings cannot. You'll create more suffering by locking up a human being than any other animal because on top of being restricted to move freely, the human also suffers by having his or her long term ambitions frustrated.  		That's not because we're more intelligent though. An equally intelligent being without time perception (like severe alzheimers) would suffer less from being locked up than a healthy person. Obviously we give the same rights to both human beings but it fits the example here.  		So when you say a sentience greater than humanity combined then you've got a sentience that's as sensitive as 7 billion people together.

{"body":"In regards to anaerobic bacteria, they generally follow a pretty characterized redox cascade when oxygen is no longer available (function of their respective free energy for the reactions). If you base it solely on major metabolic respiration reactions... the general cascade you would observe in, say, deep ocean sediments (presuming availability of all oxidants for each reaction to occur) would be as follows:		*Denitrification (deltaG ~ -2660, compared to oxygen's -2820); requires nitrate; yields nitrogen gas, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and water. 		*Manganese reduction (deltaG ~ -2380); requires carbon dioxide, water, and a specific form of manganese oxide (can't remember off the top of my head what it is). Yields manganese and bicarbonate.		*Iron reduction (deltaG ~-790); requires carbon dioxide and ferric hydroxide. Yields ferric iron, bicarbonate, and water.		*Sulfate reduction (deltaG ~-450); requires sulfate. Yields hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonate. 		*Methanogenesis (deltaG ~-300); is directly inhibited by the presence of oxygen. Can either have the breakdown of organic matter OR the reaction between hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide which yields methane and water. 		All of these reactions require some sort of reductant; in the case of diagenesis in oceanic sediments, which is my frame of reference, the most notably reductant would be organic matter. In any event, there is preferential bias towards oxidants that have more energetically favorable reactions (which is why aerobic respiration is ubiquitous when O2 is available on both land and in the ocean). Sediment methanogenesis, at least in ocean sediments, is extremely important for 'recycling' carbon; otherwise, without methanogenesis, you would have a net accumulation of carbon in deeper sediments (below sulfidic layers where your only electron acceptor is your carbon source). 		A big question here is how 'closed' is the Martian system? What kind of redox reactions are favorable given conditions on Mars (i.e., iron-dominated reduction due to the absence of more favorable oxidants)? And, simply put, is it actually applicable to consider anaerobic respiration (not saying it's impossible, but rather there may be an abiotic methanogenic mechanism at play as opposed to biogenic)? 		Note: there have been numerous studies looking at abiotic methanogenesis and the potential does exist...

{"body":"Wait, what are you saying? The jump to unicellular life? Are you talking about abiogenesis happening more than once? Because /u/Pointsouturflaws was talking about the jump from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Finding prokaryotes on Mars wouldn't rule that out.		 And, just so you know, our sun is going to burn the planet to shreds in a billion years, which means the potential time frame for intelligent life to evolve was pretty short. We got lucky and were able to evolve in that time frame, but remember that the jump from prokaryotes to eukaryotes took 2.5-3 billion years. If conditions on the Earth had remained the same, we wouldn't have evolved before the sun burnt out the possibility of complex life at all.		Personally, I'm of the opinion that extraterrestrial prokaryotish (or pre-prokaryotish) life will be found at some point. But eukaryotish life will be very rare. 		Did you know that conditions on Venus and Mars were ripe for life in the early ages of our Solar System? I'm not sure when the boundary was, but obviously they're not still that suitable today. This could be another bottleneck (or Great Filter). 		Honestly, I think this whole "Great Filter" thing is deeply flawed. There are a lot of bottlenecks involved in getting to intelligent life. One does not have to be so huge that the others don't matter. I feel like this article disregards the Drake equation, and the fact that each one of those probabilities consists of a large number of sub-probabilities.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheSOB88","name":"t1_cmyrr46","parent_id":"t1_cmyqh7r","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1418926786,"created_utc":1418926786}

However, we don't see signs of intelligent life having colonized the galaxy, even though there was ample time for it. Therefore, there must be something stopping it from happening. 		Here's the part I don't agree with: They suggest that if there was life on Mars, then life in the universe is plentiful. They then make the jump that intelligent life must be plentiful, and the "Great Filter" stopping it from happening is something between evolving intelligent life and getting to a Type III civilization.

{"body":"As far as I can tell, there are three different results here. Finding old water, finding momentary increases in methane, and finding some mix of organic molecules.		* Old water - Finding water on mars isn't new. But the water found within this rock is the opposite of new... it's old. This water is a snapshot of what the water used to look like a long time ago. This is a first step in building a picture of Mars's water history. So, as far as excitement, we'll put it at the first paintbrush stroke on a painting... but we don't yet know if it's the Mona Lisa or your kids' refrigerator art. But it's still better than no painting at all.		* Increase in methane. They'd been able to detect methane already, but what was detects was a short term burst of a ten-fold increase in the amount of methane they were measuring. This suggests pockets where methane is collected. Methane is often produced from biological processes, but it can also be produced through other non-biological processes as well. Still, it's weird for the amount of methane not to be constant. I personally don't know what could cause these pockets of methane, but it's worth looking for the source of the methane.		* Organic molecules. Some people in this thread are getting the methane result and the organic molecules result mixed up, but those are separate measurements. The problem is, what organic compounds? Well, we don't know, because there are also perchlorate minerals which apparently messes up the measurements that tell us *which* compounds they were.		So, overall it's not a Holy-Shit.

The 2100 answer is for Exoplanets, life as we know it changes the atmosphere of his host planet, and that change can be detected fairly easily with spectrographs, the issue we have now is that the spectrographs we have in existence are not sensitive enough to be used on planets, the bright of their host stars is just too much compared to the very small amount of reflected light coming from the small orbiting planets, James Webb *should* be powerful enough to detect the oxygen/water/wherever's on the planets atmospheres which will allow us to know the atmospheres of known candidate planets (Thank you Kepler!) and that way know if said planets host multicellular life like the one we have here on earth.

{"body":"I'm going to try and summarise the main findings- Im not an expert but im studying Geochemistry at uni so Ill give it a shot.		Here are the three main interesting Martian geochemistry papers released this year:		[1. Mineralogy of Gale crater mudstone](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1243480.abstract)		[2. More geochemistry of the mudstones](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1245267)		[3. Looking at water found in clay minerals - the one released recently that this article is based on](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/12/15/science.1260291.abstract)		Sooo the water found is not a liquid it is bound up in minerals - which make up the martian rocks. This isn't like a sponge holding water, the water molecule actually forms part of the mineral. Here's [Gypsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsum) one of the suspected minerals. You can see H2O makes up part of the chemical formula. These minerals in most cases require liquid water to form so the fact they exist suggests that liquid water was present at some point.		Now onto the organics. The finding of organics, particularly methane, is potentially exciting but we should hold back for a second. Methane can be produced by abiotic (meaning not-living) processes and the word 'organic' just means that it contains carbon chains. 		Organic molecules can be found within 'space-dust' and meteorites (known geologically as chondrites). Lab studies have shown that ultraviolet light can cause the release methane from this space dust and the meteorites([4.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7401/full/nature11203.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120607)).

{"body":"That's a better question and I don't think I have the background to give you a comprehensive answer.		Until someone arrives who does, I can say that generally we find any extraterrestrial organic compounds significant because *from our experience*, organic complexity (carbon molecules doing increasingly complicated stuff) was one of several early steps toward life.		We don't know if all types of life require organic complexity, or if *most* types of life tend to come from carbon based structures or... well we only have one data point, so we don't even know what we know and what we don't know.

But according to statistical mechanics, the molecules will have a range of speeds -- some travelling very quickly, some traveling very slowly -- and it will approximately be the average of those speeds that corresponds to what we call the temperature. The ones that are travelling very fast will occasionally have so much speed that they can just shoot right out of the atmosphere -- Mars' gravity cannot hold it there. This process will keep going, the fastest molecules being ejected each time.		The important point here is that strictly speaking in this scenario, Mars never had the gravity to hold it all in to begin with, and that is not what changed. It is just that this slow escape of fast molecules can be such a slow process that the gas Mars originally formed with took many millions of years to eventually escape.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dark_magnetar","name":"t1_cmyottm","parent_id":"t1_cmyhddt","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1418921459,"created_utc":1418921459}

It's not like Plutonium or some other such element is responsible for the formation of organic molecules.			If life started somewhere (here) and it relied on a set of volatile circumstances and what amounts to the top row of the periodic table, it's pretty likely that life could form elsewhere, possibly every where.  It just so happens that Earth had a set of circumstances that followed the formation of basic organic molecules (we're really talking amino acids here) that was conducive to the formation of cells.  Then as the environment changed over time, those changes were in one way or another beneficial or at the very least non-detrimental to the continuation of life.  			If that happened elsewhere or not is yet to be determined but I would hazard a guess it's not as uncommon as we keep trying to tell ourselves.  Feeling special, getting in the way of science.

It is important not to unintentionally conflate simple with something we can easily replicate in a lab. For example, in the clay replicator scenario, the clay can be something that is chemically very simple. The catch is that it only works on large length scales and long time scales, because that is what is necessary for clays to meaningfully influence their environment. Or, in the case of experiments like Miller-Urey, maybe they had the right idea, and they just needed a larger vat or a longer time to do the experiment. I don't think we have enough experimental data yet to conclude that we *haven't* yet found the "easy" candidate -- it is just that easy needs to be interpreted on dimensions that are unfamiliar to the typical laboratory experiment.		> But even something like Spiegelman's Monster LOST complexity through selection rather than gained.

I believe calculations have been done which suggest that this scenario is unlikely even on billion-year timescales, but I don't recall where I read that. Part of the problem is that just forming a molecule like this by chance isn't enough, since it has to be able to live long enough to come into contact with the other necessary components.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dark_magnetar","name":"t1_cmz58wu","parent_id":"t1_cmyu3my","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1418951681,"created_utc":1418951681}
