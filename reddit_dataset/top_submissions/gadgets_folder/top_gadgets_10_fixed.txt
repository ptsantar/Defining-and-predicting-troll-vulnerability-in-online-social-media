I have a few "friends" really into music and movies and at some point when I actually feel like fulfilling  social obligations, we meet up, one of us ends up bringing our portable hard drives to the others house to trade shit we downloaded.  I end up getting a lot of shit that wouldve taken me hours to download, plus, this was my generations version of burning CDs fo eachother.		So one time I was high as balls with such a friend, we were talking about how crazy it was what we were doing, wonders of technology,  trading libraries of information in the time span of a short visit, blah, blah, blah.... but also how it was also such a bummer that i couldnt bring my computer (which had more stuff and is also *an actual computer*) with me cos its too big, but i also didnt want to bring my laptop cause it came with all this redundant crap that he also had at his house (tv/display but way bigger, a mouse, keyboard) and I suddenly realized, than in the near future we we might see a change in desktop computers that are as small as portable harddrives, so they can be taken everywhere. All youll need is a monitor a keyboard and a mouse.  And those 3 things will become staples in the home, and maybe even hotels, like a telephone or VHS player was. And it will just be a normal and feesable to bring your entire desktop computer with you. I also see this working well in settings where colleagues have to trade loads of information - like two scientists wanting to compare notes but having way more than just a few dozen files to exchange, or heavy data or data that require specfic software. Or people who need to bring their work home. It wont replace a laptop but it would extend the conveniences of a desktop. 		So anyways.... TL;DR I definitely  see the benefits or portability in a desktop computer, even in mouse form, especially for people who download lots of shit. Of course I also see how cloud storage  and laptops serve this need, but I still think reducing desktop size would also supplement it.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"T0Boddah","name":"t1_cq0dv2c","parent_id":"t1_cnvsqex","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1428101165,"created_utc":1428097565}

{"body":"I probably should see a doctor when my situation is more improved and probably for quite a few things. 		But it actually seems like it's more related to a blood oxygen problem and such since I show other symptoms that relate to that family and nothing I can readily identify from compression tests for carpal and such. My wrists and hands mostly feel fine and I don't get the numb or tingling without the accompanying ice cold hand. But since I also show signs of mild cyanosis, having had lifelong purple fingernails since I was a child (I didn't even realize other peoples fingernails weren't like that until someone asked me if I painted my nails and I was confused since as far as I knew that's what color nails were supposed to be and I never really looked at peoples hands. I vaguely recall a parent who I later found out has iron deficiency issues having purple nails too when I was a kid but I didn't think anything of it really) I'd wager it's closer and potentially heritable along with other related issues like the painful as fuck possible IBS which is really the thing I should see a doctor about if anything. 		Short of the story, something to keep my hand warm would largely be more appreciated since it's my body that will sweat slightly under stress and heat and almost never my hands. I rarely but less commonly get it while using a controller on my lap too, so I'm not even certain the slight elevation with the mouse is entirely the reason though it probably doesn't help.

So either this thing has to have a battery or you have a minimum of two cables plugged into it, PLUS a keyboard.		2) That ARM core is already obsolete. If you want to pass something off as a PC, you better be using an Intel Cherry Trail SoC.
