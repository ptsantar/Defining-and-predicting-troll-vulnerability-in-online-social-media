As soon as completed, it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than all of this, however, will be the transmission of power, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction. These few indications will be sufficient to show that the wireless art offers greater possibilities than any invention or discovery heretofore made, and if the conditions are favorable, we can expect with certitude that in the next few years wonders will be wrought by its application."","depth":2,"score":37,"ups":37,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ManiyaNights","name":"t1_cstv400","parent_id":"t1_cstun60","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1436199490,"created_utc":1436195890}

{"body":"In his masterful article The Problem of Increasing Human Energy, first published in Century Illustrated Magazine in June 1900, Tesla discusses the ???energy situation??? like never before. After discussing every known method of gathering energy from the Natural World, Tesla departs into the unknown. His first discussion is about a machine that can gather heat from the ambient air. He calls it a ???Self-acting Engine??? since it could run indefinitely from the solar energy stored in the air. He called it ???the ideal way of obtaining motive power???.  			Tesla worked for years trying to solve all of the technical issues presented by the idea. His work with liquified air, his discovery of super-conductivity at ultra-low temperatures, his bladeless turbine and mechanical oscillator were all spin-offs from his work on the ambient air engine. He was convinced the system could work and that it was absolutely the best way to harness solar energy.  			On a world that is warming up, tapping ambient sources of heat in the air, water and ground are the most important technologies to develop at this time.  			But Nikola Tesla???s most famous attempt to provide everyone in the world with free energy was his World Power System, a method of broadcasting electrical energy without wires, through the ground. His Wardenclyffe Tower,  was never finished, but his dream of providing energy to all points on the globe is still alive today.

I doubt that Tesla was referring to "appearance" in the black-box sense. I think he quite sincerely believed it would be "simpler" in terms of actual mechanism (i.e. a matter of antenna wires pulling down some analog signal via tuned crystals).		While Tesla was undoubtedly a genius in terms of electricity and electromagnetic phenom of all sorts, he had ZERO conceptual understanding of what we think of as "digital" processing... the thought of some computational machine really hadn't even crossed his mind. (This despite the fact that he had in fact worked to create something akin to a relay or logic gate that could be triggered via radio waves -- he filed a patent application on that, and from that some claim that he envisioned "computers" -- but that's a facetious notion, akin to saying the inventor of the perfume atomizer is the inventor of an internal combustion engine; there is simply zero evidence that Tesla ever took it beyond the idea of some *single* "switch" that would be flipped remotely, in other words he never conceived of a series of gates operating in a complex "computational" fashion.)","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LWRellim","name":"t1_csuud7c","parent_id":"t1_csuibh6","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1436270220,"created_utc":1436266620}

{"body":"He was wrong about how wireless would be realized, but realizing the possibility of sending images although possibly only still images, together with audio and text, and claiming it could be miniaturized to the scale of a small mobile phone, is 6 or 7 decades ahead of when Moore theorized in the mid 1960's what today is known as Moore's law.			If Tesla hadn't failed in early attempts, the technology might have been useful already a century ago, it's a big if, but the basis of an 8Hz electric resonance was confirmed in the 50's, Teslas near field wireless power transfer worked up to 100 feet, he claimed he could achieve long distance even global, and that the technology was proven, but it wasn't proven like with schematics for a reproducible setup, and when he died he was bankrupt, with his lab dismantled for a long time, and his notes were confiscated by the government.			IDK if those notes could have been useful for someone who understood what Tesla worked on, because he was a bit crazy and towards the end maybe even insane, but he was also insanely brilliant brilliant.			For instance AC generators existed before Tesla was born, but among the problems with AC was that nobody could make a motor that worked with it. It may seem like a silly tiny thing, that is pretty obvious to solve today, but many had tried and failed for years, and Tesla was the first to make a working AC motor.			Teslas near field wireless electricity is the basis for modern wireless power transfer, and was just recently "rediscovered". It builds on a principle of resonance, which Tesla correctly measured for the earth, and is rumored to have caused a minor earthquake when working on.			Regarding reliable information, it's very hard to dig up links for you, what I've learned has come from digging around to try to see how well documented the claims are. And then plot the line between what is known and what is merely claimed, and see how well they match up. The claim that Tesla wirelessly powered light bulbs over a distance of 26 miles using resonant inductive coupling is unconfirmed, and so remains merely a claim, but considering the amount of firsts he made in areas other people had worked for much longer, and some of which were confirmed at the time, but yet took half a century to reproduce. I'm saying even some of the weirder claims or exaggerated rumors, might have some degree of truth.			Maybe Tesla understood something better than anybody else at his time, but unlike Einstein who worked collaboratively with other scientists which resulted in the theory of general relativity, Tesla worked in an economically hostile environment, making it more beneficial to keep the details for himself until the concepts were good enough for patenting. He was absolutely the more insightful inventor compared to Edison, but he didn't have an interest or the skill for business, and despite that he was an Einstein of practical implementation of electricity, claims without proof remain merely claims. Except personally I sometimes grant him some benefit of his known achievements, and the failure of others to also do what was claimed he had done, is not so strange when you begin to notice how much they also failed in what is proven that he did.

It initially sought to unite the religions and science into a greater unified cultural force for peace and understanding, however as Theosophy's mystical influences ran into conflict with the prevailing positivist view of science a rift formed and theosophy started putting more value on intuition and mystical connections.  Still because of its goals of peace, the cultural zeitgeist of Spiritualism, and that it opened up lots of new ways of thinking beyond the imperial cultural norm, it was very influential in intellectual and creative circles.  As a result of this, Theosophy's influences can be seen all over contemporary culture even as Theosophy is no longer a household name. 		So because Tesla was influenced by Theosophy, which pushed him to think and say things that sound pseudo-scientistic and spiritually idealistic, and New Age thinking is the natural successor of mainstream Theosophy you see this unconscious connection.

For instance, Edison killed cats and dogs, but Tesla loved animals and had a cat as a child. Originally Tesla wanted to be a poet, but after getting zapped by static electricity from his kitty he was inspired to study the effects of electricity. One could vaguely construe that Tesla's cat was responsible for the second industrial revolution, which arguably makes it the most awesome cat who ever lived. 	Edison believed that fossil fuels were the future and that there were enough resources in South America to provide for the next 50,000 years. Tesla believed that renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power were the future. This is remarkable because in the 1890s there was no such thing as "going green," so Tesla's ideas on conservation were very forward-thinking at the time."","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ScientiaMagus","name":"t1_csujc7n","parent_id":"t1_csuj720","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1436239181,"created_utc":1436235581}
