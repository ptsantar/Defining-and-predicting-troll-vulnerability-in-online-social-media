Most of the third party apps by Rudy Huyn are genuinely, GENUINELY better than the official apps on iOS and Android (Google even tried to hire him to stop him developing for WP for what that's worth if that means anything to you).		Readit is also the best reddit client on any platform, and a complete overhauled is being released this month.		As for the quality of the apps, having a genuinely consistent design language makes android app design an android dealbreaker for me. Every option and task HAS to be as an icon at the bottom centre of the screen if it is available, and if you don't know what it does, there is ALWAYS three dots just to the side; pressing it will display what each icon does, and reveal more menu options. On android (and it's sadly an inherent flaw of Android being as open and widespread as it is) apps will have different design languages from a range of years, different buttons in different places, and little consistency with each other. Heck, there are even inconsistencies in Google's apps with the material update.		On one phone new message is at the top right, another the top left, another on a different screen, another tucked away under a different UI tree. On Windows Phone it is the same on everything, the end.		For people starting out on smartphones with little experience and don't actually know/feel comfortable micro-managing apps to squeeze out battery life (which the OS should be doing anyway), the uniformity of iOS and WP are just so much better.

For both Android and iOS, if I need to know how to do something there are generally multiple ways to do it and I can figure it out rather quickly even coming in "cold" (first time use). I did not have that experience with WP. I really enjoy the level of customization that I have on Android, and find the app stores to be very good for both Android and iOS. The Windows app store has always been underwhelming and a bit...sketchy.		Also, some colleagues that I have talked to who use WP regularly say that they frequently need to restart their phones (about once per week), and that their corporate WP representative (it was a MS sponsored switch in their company) said that it is recommended to restart your WP at about that interval for "optimum performance". There are a bunch of other UI issues that I have with it as well, which are largely preferential.		Regarding your comments about battery life and camera, I too am very happy with those on my non-WP.

{"body":"The surface can do most of what I said, I was just highlighting the bits I liked about my transformer. My point is the price didn't justify the value in my experience.		First of all, in my opinion neither the surface nor the transformer is "portable". My cut off for portability is around 7" diag. Any larger and I have to do something special like carry a bag or make sure I put on the jacket with a large pocket. 1 pound or 5 pounds... 0.3" or 0.6" thick... the annoyance is carrying something extra, size/weight doesn't matter much. Double thickness is not double inconvenience.		Plus I've always found traditional tablet form factors to be pretty useless. The 12" SP3 is borderline acceptable but 10" too tiny to multi-task, but just large enough that the space is wasted on anything more than games or passive entertainment. And typing... ugh, laptop keyboards set a low bar but somehow surface managed to underwhelm me.		And again, the surface isn't mod-able. Surface has a 64GB internal SSD for higher cost than my tablet (w/ 1TB), and you're right that mine isn't an SSD. But I can swap mine for an SSD easily. Or a hybrid drive. Or add a second drive.		Plus I had nothing but complaints about the SP3 performance, despite that i7. Some kind of throttling issue to keep the device cool? I don't know but I can fix that myself on my transformer.

They're a large organisation, so naturally one of their largest goals is to produce a large turnover. 		Too many people have already expressed their distaste and will refuse to switch to Windows 8. Whether they add in a Start Menu makes no difference, the damage is done and people will not be switch to Windows 8 regardless of whether or not they add a start menu.		Microsoft is also aware of the fact that Windows 7 is aging. Now when they release Windows 10 - Pretty much a more 7-like Windows 8.1 many more people will be making the shift. In fact, I believe Windows 10 may be one of the most successful operating systems since many iterations ago. 		Those still running 7 will upgrade for the performance improvements.		Those running 8.1 who do not like it too much will upgrade for the UI improvements.		Those running 8.1 who *do* like the operating system will upgrade because Windows 10 will already be hailed so well it will seem well worth the upgrade.		So basically, the reason why Microsoft won't add a start menu is money. They're hardly going to earn any more money by adding it in, because most people at this point already have their computer and either have upgraded or will not upgrade at all.

My PC boots straight to desktop mode and I didn't install anything special. I thought that with 8.1 that was the default action if the OS detected that it wasn't running on a touch device.

Honestly I find navigating the Explorer on Win8.1 much easier as a lot of the hidden things, like the option to view hidden files, are now easily visible in the ribbon menus rather than nested down in a drop down menu, in a pop up window, down a scrolling list, to a small radio button control.

If you haven't used it much the search function on Win8 you should try it out, it is very fast and useful.

{"body":"Sorry, but I'm calling BS on your statement. The number 1 battery draws in mobile devices are the screen and radios. Whenever the screen is on, the battery quickly drains. Whenever the radio ON the battery drains. Period. This is, worse when the radio is in use, worse yet when the radio is in use but the signal is poor, and best when the radio has great signal and is sitting idle, waking up minimally to check network status. This is as much true with today's smartphones as it was with the flip phones and candybar phones we had in the late 90s.		The only way to achieve the standby time listed on products is to keep the phone in airplane mode and never turn on the screen. The fastest way to drain the battery without turning on the screen is to leave the radio on and put the device in an area without cellular coverage or on the edge of cellular coverage. In this case the radio stays spooled up and is constantly searching for a carrier. This is an intensive process just slightly less power hungry than transmitting.		Do rural parts of Africa, China, and India have better cellular coverage than where you live? Probably not.		And while I used the Note 3 as an example of "it's hard to find a device with less than 20 days of standby time, 29 isn't impressive" merely because I could find its stats readily, there are plenty of cheap devices that tout 20+ day standby time. 30 days probably isn't even the upper bound.

{"body":">This phone only has a 2G radio and small screen as well as the LED flashlight. So yes it will get near the actual promised rates because Nokia actually has a good track record on these things.		Did you own a phone in the pre-smartphone days? I owned several Nokia phones since the mid 90s before I switched to android devices. These were 1G and 2G devices and still didn't get the standby time unless the device was in airplane mode. 		Manufacturers determine the standby time by placing a device in airplane mode, leaving the screen off, and measuring the current draw. 		All of the comments I made in my above post were just as true for the flip phone and candybar devices I owned as they are for modern android devices with touch screens. The 2 biggest battery drains on a flip phone are the screen and radios and the radio works really hard when it's in an area with weak or no cellular coverage. The easiest way to quickly drain a flip phone battery is to go to an area with very weak cellular coverage and wait. When I did construction in the late 90s, I would often have to put my phone in airplane mode when working in basements or the phone would die in a matter of hours. Normally that phone would get over a week between charges and advertised something like 40 days standby.		So again, to summarize:		* Users never receive anything remotely near standby time on devices. Never have, never will. This is because users use their phones.	* Weak signal kills batteries. Doesn't matter if it's weak wifi, weak LTE, or weak 2G. This is just as true today as it was with early cellphones.	* 3rd world countries probably have spottier cellular coverage than where you live. This means *this device in the article* will probably have better battery life if you owned it than if someone in Africa owned it, *unless that individual was cognizant to switch to airplane mode when leaving areas of cellular coverage*.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bobpaul","name":"t1_cnjkcbo","parent_id":"t1_cnijodh","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1420820508,"created_utc":1420820508}
