To address someone else's comments, we do use the Ubiquiti M900 as a component of the base station ('NIC').  Great tool, but a minority of the bigger picture here.		Speed for Proxyham is dependent on a number of things, like all things wireless.  If you find yourself on the roof with a hi-gain directional antenna, clear skies, and pin-point accuracy (as with my sexified, photogenic WIRED photo....) its AWESOME.  Realistically, no less throughput than you'll find with most broadband offerings.  15 - 19mpbs.  Frankly, I'm surprised myself.		If you're in a dense, urban environment things are more complex.  I wish I could say it's a solid X mbps, but where I'm from (Seattle) is hilly, just outside downtown, and got a number of 900Mhz devices in the same range, which *do* have an impact on data throughput and packet loss.		To give a simple answer to a complex question, you're looking at 2-5Mbps.  Sorry if you're disappointed, but I've tried to reiterate this is for paranoids and those concerned about their national governments (not the public at large).

By going from 2.4Ghz to 900Mhz, we're going from a (theoretical) speed of 54Mbps to a (practical) range of ~10Mbps.  That also means more distance though, being able to go from a couple dozen feet (very close) to upwards of two miles in a good environment (much further).  Again, there's a lot more to it than that, but that's the short verion.		Aside from pure hardware, the devil's in the (soft) details.  Proxyham has the capability to self-destruct when tampered with, using accelerometers to know when things are moving or being 'attacked'.  It can use frequency hopping to avoid simple scanners and channel sniffing.  It utilizes IPSec to coomunicate transparently from the node (workstation) to the Proxyham itself.

Why should we expect that as a condition for a rather meager income when we don't expect it from people making much larger incomes off the backs of others? 		For example, as my other comment was specifically about large chains and Wal-Mart in particular, why do have a higher standard for people in poverty who are reliant on social safety nets to supplement the income which they are not paid enough of to survive than we do the organization and owners of Wal-Mart who also directly benefit from those services in the form of not needing to pay so much in wages and benefits to the same employees?		Personally, I'd much rather that people make a living wage doing what makes them happy than spend their lives slaving away in shitty jobs. With the rise of automation, this all but becomes a necessity as worker pay stagnates, jobs are not created, and those with the most capital are able to multiply it without having to distribute to others (as automation systems are owned, comparable to slavery in the notion that they perform work for free after the initial investment  rather than paying a worker a yearly salary).		In my opinion, this system ends in one of two ways.

{"body":"It's a question of what part of the FCC rules you are operating under.  If you are operating as an amateur radio operator, then you have to follow the Part 97 rules, which among other things say no encryption and you have to broadcast your callsign in some way.  Generally the way people comply with this is they use an open network with the SSID set to their callsign.  But in return, you can use very high power levels (up to like 2kw IIRC but only as necessary to accomplish what you need to do).		If you are operating as Joe Citizen, then you are covered by Part 15 rules, which specify a very low maximum power, and you're at the bottom of the priority in terms of who gets to interfere with whom.  It depends on the band but is generally 1W EIRP (which isn't the same as 1W of RF from the amplifier), I believe.  Although I think they may have created [some new exceptions for directional antennas](http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1428941) allowing higher power levels. (Seems like you are allowed 4W EIRP if the antenna has at least 6dB of gain, which is 1W at the feedline.) 		Honestly I can't see the benefit in going beyond the Part 15 limits if you are trying to talk to consumer equipment at the far end of the link, because overpowering the signal in one direction is stupid when the goal is bidirectional communication.  If your laptop can 'hear' your AP from 2 miles away, that doesn't do you much good when it's 250mW antenna doesn't get close to getting a signal back the other direction.

{"body":"The company I have been working for has sold 900MHz Ethernet radios for a few years now. They're pretty cool devices, however there is a huge trade off happening because of your 900MHz frequency use. Because it's a longer wavelength, you have less data that can be communicated per second, which means a greatly reduced throughput. I've connected to a 900MHz radio before over my computer, and it's quite a long time to even load webpages. Good luck downloading items in any reasonable amount of time. You would be lucky to have 500kbps.		Typical WiFi lives on 2.4 or 5 GHz frequency, which travels shorter distances but allows for greater data throughput. The reason we have 3G or 4G on our phones is because those cell towers have a license to use very high powered antennas. The FCC Part 15 regulations limit the antenna system gain for a 100mW unlicensed 2.4 GHz radio system to 16dBi.		Sorry to bash, just being realistic of this device.
