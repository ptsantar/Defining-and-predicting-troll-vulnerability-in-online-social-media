{"body":"yup. I work at a supermarket and all day you hear customers say "Only $5 a pound for cheese? That's cheap!" all the while the price is $5.99. 		The supermarket gets people to pay an extra dollar without noticing. Another reason why you get up to the checkout and think the bill is a lot higher than you thought it would be.

{"body":"Yep, I'm pretty sure the 99 cents thing is really intended to make you not notice the added cost if you're trying to evaluate the price of multiple things at once, rather than just a single item, like the one in the OP.		I work at a restaurant that does quite a bit of take-out, and customers guess wrong on the price all the time. They'll get done ordering and I'll say something along the lines of, "Your total is $18.89", they'll reach for their wallet or purse or something and then say, "... actually, how much is this cookie/bag of chips". (Off the top of my head, chips are like $1.25, and cookies are $1.75). I tell them the price, but I always have to make sure to say "your new total is..." because they very often just hand me a $20 bill thinking that has them covered.		When they asked for the price of the chips/cookies/whatever, they had to do some quick mental math, and rounded that $18.89 down to just $18. When I told them $1.25 they rounded that down to just $1, and thought the total would be a little north of $19, and so a $20 would be enough. 		This happens all the time too. It's not that you're stupid if you do this, it's just most people can't keep track of too many numbers in their head, and doing the mental math is a lot easier if you round off. Unfortunately sometimes people have the tendency to round everything down if they aren't paying too much attention.","depth":6,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheWingedPig","name":"t1_crsoeeq","parent_id":"t1_crslxd5","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433223590,"created_utc":1433219990}

If a car is $40,000, our brain breaks into 10000, or 1000 denominations, and thinks "Oh that's quite a round number, perhaps it cost them $30,000 to make, and they're taking a $10k profit".

{"body":"Because taxes are not charged by manufacturers, suppliers, or retailers. They are charged by the government at the point of sale. It has to do with how goods are taxed at different levels of the manufacturing process. Those producing the goods you buy are showing you how much they are selling you a product for. Also, as sales tax varies from state to state, and the way it is applied also differs, it just makes pricing products easier. You are paying the government, not the grocery store. For example, when you sell a car, you list the price you are willing to sell the car for. When someone buys it for you, they don't pay taxes to *you*, they pay them to the government when they register the car. So why would you include the sales tax in your sale price?

{"body":"Because the store does not pay all of its sales taxes in one lump sum each year. Therefore, it makes more sense to itemize it. Adding tax to the price tag also overcomplicates some things. For example, some items may have one or more taxes that apply, while others may have none. It's much easier just to add the applicable tax at the point of sale. It's also important to note that there are many organizations (such as churches and non-profits, and people on food stamps/WIC) that are exempt from paying sales tax altogether, further complicating the situation.		So, generally speaking, it may seem counterintuitive, but it's easier to just have everything at base price on the shelf, then figure out the sales tax at the register. 		Someone could probably explain all this better, but all said, the difference comes down to who the tax is being paid to. Why would the retailer show the total amount with tax when they aren't paying the sales tax? They sell you their goods at a price they set, then you pay a tax to the government based on a percentage of that purchase.

{"body":"Believe it or not there is plenty of market research to support selling things for $0.01 below a big, round number works.		>Psychological pricing (also price ending, charm pricing) is a pricing/marketing strategy based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. Retail prices are often expressed as "odd prices": a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or ??2.98. Consumers tend to perceive ???odd prices??? as being significantly lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that lower pricing such as this institutes greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of price points.

When it comes to official pricing from a company, street price is largely irrelevant. They're not claiming that the $/GB of their 64GB SSD will be comparable to the $/GB of of the MSRP of an 8TB HDD.

However, you can already get ~256GB SSDs in the <$90 range.		One thing to remember is that they're not marketed to consumers, so the pricing would not be comparable to consumer products.

And you wouldn't need to have dedicated RAM, you could share that out with the same memory you were using as your solid state drive.		As to whether or not that happens in the future is impossible to predict. It *could* happen if there are massive concrete advantages to disk access at such a high rate for services the average person might use. If there's some advantage to having the absolute fastest storage access available, then that storage will by default be made out of what amounts to 'RAM,' and could very well end up shared dynamically by the system as both storage and dynamic memory.

{"body":"yeah, we got her an drive. Another issue was backup, as having all your pics on 1 external drive hanging off a laptop, with kids around, is just asking for trouble.		Bought her an external drive, bought her a CrashPlan subscription... but she kept closing her laptop and putting it to sleep, so her backups would never finish. That was a bust.		Before this she had pictures local, but would use Time Machine to backup... but she'd have to remember to hook up the drive to run the backup every so often.... didn't do it. She had a major crash and her backup was 1 year old... that is an entire kid's life. Luckily I was able to save it.		For a while I had the photo library on a desktop that was backing up to CrashPlan and the library would be accessed remotely on the laptop. The desktop was sitting on a flimsy card table in a kids play area.. just asking for trouble. I think all the computers were generally too old and slow to run the setup well... and she had all her stuff in iPhoto, which really wasn't designed for that.		So I'm at a loss now. Apple came out with Photos which has an optional cloud component, so I could just tell her to let Apple deal with it.... but I don't think it's in her budget to pay for the extra storage she'd need... at least 500Gb and I'm sure that would turn into 1TB soon, which is $10-20/month. Considering she wasn't willing to pay the $5/month for CrashPlan.		Other things have been brought up like Flickr, Google, or Amazon which offer massive storage space for photos... video is still an issue though. I think Apple covers both with their pricing. She showed little drive to set that up. At the end of the day she needs something that requires literally 0 thought that is 100% integrated into the stuff she already has and uses... and that is Apple's Photos app with iCould Drive... but that convenience comes at a price.		I've already put in at least 20 hours of my time... probably more like 50-80 hours. As well as probably $200. It's no skin off my back if she loses all her kid's baby photos, but I don't want to deal with that call when it happens. I really fucking don't. She has called me crying many times related to computer issues.... issues I warned her were coming a year in advance. I have a lot of trouble taking risks with more time or more money for more solutions that aren't going to stick.. and I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $240/year for someone else when they can't see the value themselves.		Part of me is just giving up. At some point she needs to decide what is important and what those pictures are worth to her. It may be that she can't assign a dollar value until she actually loses them... and she will be devastated when that happens. I don't know for sure, but I'm almost certain they put more than enough to cover some iCloud Drive space into the collection basket at church every week... what's more important.. your kid's photos and your sanity... or the mega church adding another wing or buying yet another bus?		I think she keeps hoping someone with set the magic bullet in front of her, but the fact is that it requires at least some effort or some money.... one or the other. A little of both is optimal. I'm not going to pretend I know what it is like to deal with the stuff in her life, but I also can't continue to make this my problem. I think I've tried pretty hard to find a solution that works and have presented a lot of options over the last couple years. When it comes down to it I don't think I can, or should, care more than the person impacted by the actual situation. I think she likes the idea of having a lot of pictures, but not the reality of actually dealing with them.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NeptLudi","name":"t1_crts05s","parent_id":"t1_crtadxq","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433305123,"created_utc":1433301523}

{"body":"There are two basic ways to make larger SSDs. Use more memory chips or increase the density of the memory chips.		There is a finite amount of space in a 2.5" drive. Manufacturers will design for a large capacity, say 1TB. They'll then remove half of the chips and sell it as 512GB, remove another half and sell it as 256GB, etc. (Some do use different size chips, too)		Next they'll increase the density of the memory chips. One way to do this is to use a smaller transistor size. If they move from a 32nm process to a 14nm process, they can 'fit' more memory into the same physical size. That 512GB drive can now be a 1TB drive.		The problem with a smaller process size is that yields can end up being notably lower. As we get smaller and smaller, you're more and more likely to have small flaws that cause a chip to fail and get rejected. Each time a company wants to shrink the process size, they'll need to spend billions of dollars. We're at 14nm sizes now, which means a single transistor is going to be roughly **56** atoms wide.		The next trick they're doing now is changing how the memory chip is made. They're creating a "3D"-like structure for the memory. Think of it like a skyscraper where a normal memory chip is a 1-story building. The process for creating these is notably more complex than the traditional chips are made, so yields are lower. They're also going to be paying down the lord-knows-how-much R&D costs for a while.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"newloginisnew","name":"t1_crsn6k1","parent_id":"t1_crsjqhl","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433220963,"created_utc":1433217363}

{"body":"The industry has largely moved/is moving to 2.5" as being the form factor for storage for consumer devices. 		One reason that would stop a 3.5" form factor drive is the thickness of conventional 3.5" drives. They would need to fill the extra "thickness" of the drive with non-functional material. There would be issues with a multi-board device if you wanted to fill the extra space with functional material. Some computers could have mechanical problems mounting 3.5" drives that are thinner than the standard ~25mm.		The extra width/length probably wouldn't gain that much more room for extra memory chips to make it worthwhile.		With SSDs getting into the 1TB+ range, they're reaching the point of being more than sufficient for most consumers. For the enterprise market, the 2.5" form form factor already dominates when speed is needed. For areas where mass storage is needed, speed is not needed, so there isn't much need for an SSD over a HDD.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"newloginisnew","name":"t1_crspl2q","parent_id":"t1_crsnlzz","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433226607,"created_utc":1433223007}
