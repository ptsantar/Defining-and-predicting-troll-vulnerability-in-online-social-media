What I am going to point out is that Im well aware of what goes into manufacturing and all of the costs included. What makes me wonder about cheap products (whether its headphones or cellphones or anything else) is that it seems you are putting an awful lot of money in making a nice package and flashy advertisement, to promote an inferior product.		Why not use all that money to make a solid product thats not going to fall apart after using it for a few months? Is it because its a new business mentality to make something that falls apart, so that they are forced to buy another one of your products?		From a business standpoint its great. You make shit, sell it as if it were gold, and make money. From a consumer standpoint, its deceptive and deplorable.

I have tried a few different pairs of beats and (at least IMO) they aren't very good - sounded a bit dull, and the mid-range wasn't that great almost as if they were intended to be for rap or something relying on a heavy beat. I'm not a proper audiophile, but the set i use most, an urbanears pair, sound better and are probably around $50-60 in US to buy. So accounting for sales taxes, distribution, etc plus a cut for the retailer, I reckon a decent set of headphones could still be produced en masse for not too much more, say $25 dollars.		A lot of the cost in these is as you note is R&D and marketing so it may even be the case that production costs aren't steep once you have exact specs to build to from making prototypes.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"-NFM-","name":"t1_cse5p9s","parent_id":"t1_cse45w0","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434926813,"created_utc":1434923213}

{"body":"Like it or not, packaging is part of the buying experience - how it looks sitting on the shelf affects which one you purchase (if you are purchasing them in a physical store). How it presents itself to you when you first get the product and open it is also a big part. I buy an iPhone sight-unseen (as do most people buying iPhones) but they come in a cool box for a very real and measurable reason - it affects how you see the product. It sets the mood for your opinion of the product. 		And the people they are targeting with Beats are buying them partly as a fashion accessory. And the buying of fashion accessories is greatly affected by the purchasing experience. 		Computing Technology (or electronics in general) is slowly going to become just another thing inside of everything, including fashion. My wife's shoes are inferior in every possible way to my [Tactical Research TR660 boots](http://www.bellevilleboot.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;amp;p=68) - they are built better, have better heel and arch support, a full laced upper, insulation from the heat in the soles, full toe cover, have good tread, and are really light for a boot - and cost 160 bucks. My wife's ??3000 ($30) sandals suck at being a boot, but do a good job with fulfilling **the job they were hired to do** - though both are "shoes". The same is true with Beats.  		Imagine reviewing a pair of 5 dollar crocs knockoffs or a 5000 buck pair of Italian leather shoes on a pro hiking boot site. They both just don't do the same jobs, and are hired by different people to different Jobs. 		The pros have to accept that mass consumption of a technically inferior product at inflated prices might be because it is hired to do a different kind of job than the pro equipment - even if that is just "looking good". 		And for fashion, the BOM or the quality is almost never linked to the price. And that is acceptable for a fashion product. So its acceptable for Beats.

{"body":"Thanks. It is heavily influenced from the "jobs to be done" line of thinking that has been talked about by Horace Deidu  at asymco.com		ie: two products that look similar are purchased by different people for different reasons - and understanding the reasons that people buy them lets you design a better product along the lines they are hired for. This is beyond personal taste (i like chocolate better than vanilla).		Sinckers and a Milky Way bar are both chocolatey snacks. But sinkers are often bought by people in america as a quick meal replacement, when they are hungry and no time for food. People often buy a milky way bar as a personal reward for themselves (i worked hard today!) So both are chocolate snacks, but are purchased by different people at different times of day for different reasons. 		Beats come in a trillion colors for a reason - they are fashion accessories. And sold as accessories. And bought by peole who view them as "really awesome" fashion accessories. 		So lets say Tim Cook and Dr Dre read about the audiophile complaints and decide they are gonna "fix" the Beats cans. They get their kick-ass audio team to design a new driver (because Apple sure as shit has amazing audio / speaker engineers there who could make a driver to rival anyone else's) and they end up making a speaker that sounds way better for like a $50 BOM.  Its still not as good as the awesome cans or in-ears mentioned here in this thread, but not shit either. 		Does that affect their sales? 		Probably not. 		The same people interested in Beats before will buy them.  And the same people interested in the pro cans will still buy the pro cans. 		So apple/beats increased their quality in a dimension that the customer didn't hire them for. 		But if Beats makes a cool new edition that Taylor Swift is wearing - half my middle school students will be interested in them. And buying Taylor Swift's endorsement is expensive. 		And that is an improvement along the lines that their current and possible customers are interested in. 		Why beat them up for not actually being top-notch cans? Why beat up a Hello Kitty toaster for not being the best toaster? Its clearly not aimed at professional cooks at restaurants, though it does have that high "Hello Kitty" toaster price. But it completely satisfies the customers desire for more Hello Kitty Goods, so the customer is throughly happy!		To each their own - even if we don't understand why the other people desire a objectively inferior product - they might be subjectively better at at doing a job we don't need to have done (like be a fashion item).		Ie: "Who gives a shit how good they make a PS4 - I cant play Halo on it" 		These pro cans are subjectively inferior at being fashion accessories. They may be great cans or be a badge to show you are a member of an in-group (when you see those cans hanging next to the shelf system, you know he's a member of the audiophile club) - but that is not what Beats customers are trying to signal, so the pro cans are inferior to beats in this regard. 		It isn't that Beats are marketing crap - its peoples demand of fashion that shapes Beats decisions. 		And people buying pro gear for pro jobs in a pro environment rarely deal with functionally inferior products, whereas a guy waiting at the bus stop has much different demands for his things - especially if it is a product that is worn in his body.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Javbw","name":"t1_csegtza","parent_id":"t1_csef8bf","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434950769,"created_utc":1434947169}

For some, its a great improvement. For others, a neutral item, and for others, a perceived downside. 		Apple balances this (somewhat) as their practice of building smaller and smaller devices will enable them to eventually make tiny watches, wearables, and full Macs inside an iPad sized tablet - so they are pushing toward a goal they see farther away and more important than the gripes of some power users in order to keep surprising the masses writing cool but useful stuff.

And most modern CE technology and most fashion products are not very durable, because they become obsolete or out of fashion - a hand-me-down 8-track player - which is still working in my garage as a radio - is not really something to be a hand-me-down.

I have a 2002 ibook im going to refurbish and let a middle school student load linux on rather than toss it - but it is still a heap of shit now.

Are they being purchased to listen to audio in the most accurate way possible for audio production or listening to high quality audio from a receiver? Are they an audiophile's badge of honor?

{"body":"the iPhone in particular is the exact opposite of the Beats headphones. 		There is arguably no better overall smartphone you can buy. There are some with some better speeds and feeds, but the iPhone as a set of features is by far the premium product in the category, is priced as a permium product, and has pushed Apple to the most valuable company int he world for a reason. It is awesome. and it's growth curve is a constant match to the growth curve of smartphones worldwide because it is the best - and that constant and easily predicted future growth is why the stock market suddenly likes Apple now. 		I would suggest reading "the innovator's stopwatch" part one and two to understand the smartphone market currently a bit better. it is about 6 months old, but shit - it is a really good read. It is not about phones, but the markets they are sold into. 		http://www.asymco.com/2014/12/10/the-innovators-stopwatch-part-1/	http://www.asymco.com/2014/12/17/the-innovators-stopwatch-part-2/			In many cases - especially all the "growth numbers" Google touts - it is the "cheap as free" commodity white label phones doing all the work and pale in features and performance to an iPhone or other "flagship" google devices - which make up a small percentage of android growth at the moment. How many Samsung Galaxy phones are being sold lately? a tiny fraction of the amount of white label phones. 		Considering the iPhone maintains it's (HUGE) majority market share of people who value a better experience of ownership, device quality, and and value the operation of the device enough to actually buy a premium device - literally the best device made in category - I fail to see your connection to Beats. Apple "lost share" then "regained it" as a ton of Android users tried out the Samsung phones and a large percentage went to Apple for their next phone. 		Apple competes on device build quality, usability, and app store selection. They are workign hard on other key areas they have problems - like cloud services.		The fight is currently still against non-consumption - so the number of smartphone users is growing - but in some saturated markets Apple is gaining share, and in some it is losing it - but where people can afford an iPhone or a MacBook, they buy a lot of iPhones and MacBooks. 		This battle against non-consumption means share numbers are not as useful as growth numbers. and when the growth stops, the market will change, and Apple does well in saturated markets, because it's the only one not making a commodity product. 		MacBooks are - literally - the best potable computer you can buy. 		Beats' parts are similar to a 400 dollar HP commodity laptop that is put together haphazardly because it's only job is to last 18 months of playing minecraft, sold at 4% margin. 		but since HP laptops are not a fashion item, and beats are, they get much higher margins.		Beats is an odd fit for Apple - it loves music. It's huge in Music, and bring Iovine and Dre to Apple for the Apple Music push is huge. 		The headphones currently do not fit Apple's business model of making beautiful, thoughtfully engineered devices that run awesome software.   beats does have experience in mass production of multiple line interactions at scale (all the colors is a huge pain!) - but the production of Apple's products - down to the mice & keyboards - are vastly superior to Beats products. my $70 Apple keyboard probably has a higher BOM than the Beats headphones discussed here - and considering it's laser cut from a solid piece of aluminum, it truly is made of necessary metal components (not cast, not stamped, but laser cut and milled). 		To me - and this is where Apple could have some fun with Beats - is to have apple bring their manufacturing prowess to Beats products.  Apple could bring a better fit and finish to the Beats products, while using beat's customization system to still offer many choices. 		But apple is hugely busy. And they bought Beats for the streaming music and the staff (dre and Iovine). They didn't buy it for headphones. This is just not important currently - with the watch and all. Maybe in 1-3 years you'll see Apple bring some truly well made cans with decent (but would still considered overpriced) drivers to Beats if the apple Music with Beats1 goes well.","depth":5,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Javbw","name":"t1_cseosav","parent_id":"t1_cseo0iy","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434979821,"created_utc":1434976221}

After some EQ-ing and notch filtering, like fixing the hump in the midbass, boosting sub-bass levels (like 20-50 Hz) to account for the bass rolloff, and smoothing out the mids and highs to get them more natural sounding, honestly I like how they sound. 		The built-in amplifier can power them very loud without distortion, and usable bass extends down to ~25 Hz. Dipping the emphasis on midbass with the EQ allows deep, clear bass to shine through and also lets the mids sound more natural without being muddied up. 		The Solos in the teardown sounded like absolute shit, though. Beats has come a long way since those old cans, but first impressions are powerful...","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"frickingphil","name":"t1_csht4u9","parent_id":"t1_csdzz59","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1435202437,"created_utc":1435198837}

If you want science sources, I can scrounge em up, but here is the breakdown without needing science: any headphones that claim "big bass" or "thumping mid range" is giving you the run around. If you REALLY want to listen to music, you want TRANSPARENT listening equipment. The guy who mixed the music already made the Bass exactly as loud as it should be, and he gave the vocal all the EQ and effects he thought it needed; who is Dr. Dre to decide to boost the shit out of the low mids for every song you listen to?		Yes, they also introduce other EQ and dynamic anomalies because of poor build quality and material selection. As it turns out, acoustic transparency is an art, and it's expensive to do it well. That said, Beats (and most consumer headphones) bank on consumer ignorance because..... It's no more expensive than what you'd pay for Beats! Grado, Audio Technica, Denon, and many more make incredible headphones for under $500. Go find some. Enjoy. 		Listen in a quiet room to your favorite album at a medium volume the first time you put them on. Notice how you can hear that guy talking in the background. Notice that the guitar you always heard is actually coming from the left side, but you hear it echo in the right. Notice that you hear the singer make a weird mouth noise at 30s in. Then put the beats back on. Notice that the bass is really loud. Notice that you can't hear anything but the bass. Notice that the bass isn't even "bassy", it's just loud.

{"body":"Gaming mechanicals are always weird, and I personally hate gaming switches for regular typing. My personal favorite are older ALPS switches, and I still use an old beige mech that's loud as fuck and probably pisses off everyone close to me. For newer switches though, there's Cherry MX and its clones (Kailh, etc.). Logitech and Razer have switched to clones of Cherry MX rather than the real thing. On-Ron in Logitech, Kailh in Razer. 		Cherry MX Blues are louder and tactile bump-y, and very very clicky. They're pretty light and great to type with, my favorite in the Cherry MX keys.		Cherry MX Browns are like Blues, except slightly lighter (require less force to press) and quieter. By slightly lighter, it's a neglible difference. Both of those are special in that you don't need to bottom out to reach activation, but gamers may not like it due to doubletaps being harder as a result of activation and release being at different heights in the press.		Cherry MX Reds seem to be the most popular for gaming - they're really really light, easy to bottom out, and are completely linear. Pretty loud, though. I can't stand these for typing - ALPS are firm and I cannot get used to these.		Cherry MX Blacks are stiffer Reds, or vice versa. Older points of sale used to use these for the crazy longevity.		https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Mechanical_keyboards is a pretty good guide. 		I love my keyboard for the consistency over time, the crisp clicks (rubbers are mushy tbh), and the fact that they stay and feel the same for long times. My MacBook has a great keyboard but some keys are getting mushy over three years, but my beige has been in use for decades (was my dad's before) and still keeps on keeping on, y'know? Also, that noise <3 		Some great keyboards would be CoolerMaster Storm (CM Storm Quickfire TK) for cheapness, Ducky for solid quality and backlight, das for just a good keyboard overall that isn't flashy, pok3r/shine mini for the tiny tiny form factor, and the flea market/estate sales for beige mechs.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fade_0","name":"t1_cse3jtm","parent_id":"t1_cse1vof","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434922503,"created_utc":1434918903}

The beats frequency response is often boosted bass and treble (though not always, sometimes just boosted bass), but both of these are popular frequency responses for headphones, beats often just take it to a greater extreme than most. Perfectly neutral is often very boring to people, and just because something is neutral doesn't mean it will sound good at all. Often the problem with beats (and cheap headphones) is how it reproduces notes, especially in the time domain and distortion levels. It would take me forever to fully explain it, though.

{"body":"I buy Beats.  Truth be told, I don't give a shit about fashion and don't care too much about sound quality.  What I do care about is loudness.  Nothing pisses me off more than when I'm at the gym or on a plane and I can't hear what's in my headphones because everything else is so loud.		I bought a pair of ear buds from Best Buy about 5 years ago.  I was going on my first interview post college and had to take a 3 hour flight.  My head phones at the time were too bulky to fit into my briefcase/laptop bag, so I needed ear buds.  Everyone said Beats are garbage blah blah blah.  So I ended up spending $80 on a pair that in terms of sound quality were ok-ish, definitely better than the super cheapo $10 ones, but not worth $80.  Maybe $30-$40 at best.  		So I just assumed I'd need to spend $300+ on really good ear-buds; or at least what in my mind was a really good set.  A couple years later I got a HTC Rezound which came with a set of Beats.  Since they're were "junk owned by Monster" I never bothered using them.  I had a business trip and my buds I had bought earlier were shredded up by my cat.  I picked up the Beats and wow, they sounded pretty good!		They were loud, I could hear all the notes, I could not hear anything around me. Why was everyone shitting all over these?  Were they the greatest ear buds EVER?  Probably not.  Were they better than anything I'd previously owned?  Beyond a shadow of a doubt.		A couple years later, I forgot to pack away my Beats and my cat got to them again.  After reading all the hate on Beats, I decided to look elsewhere.  I found a set that everyone recommended that were available at Best Buy.  They cost about $130, $30 more than the Beats.  They sucked.		The volume was low, I could barely hear certain notes (especially the bass notes) and they had no weight to them.  I exchanged them for a couple of different pairs that were similarly priced and had an almost identical experience.  So finally I picked up another set of Beats ear buds, and sure enough they were again much better.  Not marginally better, much better.  If my cat gets to these, guess what brand I'm buying again?		Do I claim they're the greatest? No.  But for the price, they're definitely the best I've found.  Maybe if I would have ordered from Amazon I'd have been able to find better ones, but these are good enough at the price point. Additionally, I know a lot of people prefer home delivery, but to me, being able to exchange on the same day is very valuable, especially for something I might want to return.

{"body":"Audio Technica ATH-M50 are $150 and not exactly pleb tier. [Here is a review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krdb8lceRoI) and they are considered pretty decent bang for the buck. 		They are "Studio Monitor Headphones" in that they have a very flat/neutral frequency response meaning sounds comes out like it's intended.		One of the main differences with beats is that they basically bass boost the audio so everything comes through with more bass and other frequencies come through weaker so the sound isn't "true".		Here is a [frequency response graph](http://i.imgur.com/uPbFWTG.jpg) for beats and [here is one](http://i.imgur.com/TY7DyZL.jpg) for the ATH-M50. 		This is why audiophiles don't like beats headphones. I should also point out Beats headphones were actually created by the guys from [Monster Cables](http://gizmodo.com/5981823/beat-by-dre-the-inside-story-of-how-monster-lost-the-world) and Dre was brought in to market them but given pretty much all the rights in the process. Originally they were manufactured by Monster cables but Dre's legal team included a clause that allowed them to have anyone manufacture the headphones so they had someone else start making them. It would be a tragedy if everyone didn't already hate Monster for making overpriced HDMI cables that are no better than cheap ones.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BICEP2","name":"t1_cse6u0s","parent_id":"t1_cse18tr","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434929160,"created_utc":1434925560}

{"body":"The problem is that you're not explaining which pair of Beats you listened to, I've found that most people end up being bought or buying the cheaper Solos which really do sound mediocre.  But the new Studios actually sound pretty good, and they offer active noise cancellation.  You can also get wireless and active noise cancellation which means the only comparable headphones are all $400+ and from companies like Bose or Parrot.  Sennheiser used to make one but IIRC they discontinued their wireless noise cancelling headphone since it was crazy bulky.  		And how good a pair of headphones is isn't just about sound quality.  You also need to take into account comfort, convenience, battery life (for active noise cancellation or wireless sets) and build quality.  The Beats Studio Wireless for example, has better battery life than the Parrot Zik that competes with it.  It also uses buttons for music control whereas the parrot uses a touch interface, etc.		Despite it's crazy high price the Studio Wireless actually gets pretty great reviews on Amazon and I ended up buying a pair and I honestly love them.  Mind you, the price is awful, and I'm pretty sure Dr Dre must have personally made $80 on them, but I love how they work overall.  If you only care about the best possible sound quality in a quiet listening environment they're the wrong headphones to get, but they're great for traveling and rail commuting, or even just linking it to my computer via bluetooth to use wirelessly.  And I own better sounding headphones, my Beyerdynamic DT880's sound better when I'm in a quiet room.  But in real life my room is pretty noisy from my air conditioner in the summer (i.e. now), I used to run a bunch of computer hardware that had a ton of fan noise, etc. so in non-optimal listening environments the advantage the beyerdynamics have goes away pretty quickly.

Some people have issues with the ear cups being too small, but I believe they released a version with larger ear pads if you have big ears. Personally they were a little small on me at first, and got uncomfortable in just about an hour of use, but over the past two years or so of use they've stretched out and softened up a bit, and now couldn't be much more comfortable.

{"body":"There's two different factors here: subjective clarity, and actual driver accuracy.  There's a series of fairly standard measurements that are used to assess headphones.  I'd advise opening the graphs in different tabs to flip between them.  here's two examples of excellent headphones, the [Stax SR-009](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/StaxSR009.pdf) and the [Sennheiser HD800](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/SennheiserHD800.pdf).  Note the fairly even frequency response (except treble, for a variety of reasons), the quick, clean decay of the impulse response, the well-defined shape of the square wave responses (except for 30hZ in the HD800, because of dynamic drivers' limitations), and the low distortion (always below 1%).  These are two of the best-measuring headphones in existence, at $1500 for the Sennheisers and $5000 + a $1000min electrostatic amp for the Stax.		Some headphones can sound subjectively clear and accurate, but actually perform quite poorly.  For instance, Grado headphones have very spikey, uneven treble response, poor impulse response, high distortion, and very little low bass.  [The SR60i, for example](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/GradoSR60i.pdf).  However, this particular bright, harsh, woefully under-engineered sound can seem clear and accurate to some people, because of the treble emphasis.		In contrast, the Audeze LCD-3 rev. 2 ($2000) sounds dark and even muddy to some people, in fact some may even consider the $100 Grados to sound more accurate, because of the rolled-off treble response of the Audeze.  But as you can see, the LCD-3 is far, far more [accurate](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/AudezeLCD3Rev2sn2613375circa2012.pdf).		Now, for Beats: here's the [original Solo](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/MonsterBeatsSolo.pdf).  Yes, the frequency response is appallingly bass-heavy, but that's not the problem.  Take a look at the [Shure SE215 in-ear monitors](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/ShureSE215.pdf), which has a similar frequency response and sounds pretty decent.  The problem with the Solo is both the uneven nature of the frequency response (take a look at the appalling dip in the midrange at 300-400hZ) and square wave responses.  At 30hZ, both the Shures and the Beats have some significant ringing (the "convex" shape of the square wave), which is to be expected at this sub-$300 pricepoint, but take a look at the midrange square wave response (300hZ).  The Beats, jesus.  It'd be hard to make a headphone this bad if you tried.  The mids are going to sound completely muddy and indistinct.  Flip back to the HD800's graph and you'll see what the problem is.		In contrast, the Solo II is actually a great example of a cheap headphone that has significant bass emphasis without compromising clarity[ take a look](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/BeatsSoloII2014.pdf).  Yeah, the mids are going to sound pretty recessed, but if you're going for overwhelming bass, it's a pretty decent option to do so while still having pretty acceptable clarity in the rest of the frequency response.		TL;Dr, bass-heavy headphones can sound "thick" or unclear for psycho-acoustic reasons, because the midrange and treble are effectively "hidden" by bass.  However, there are excellent bass-heavy headphones that, technically speaking, have good time-domain accuracy (which is perceived as clarity), if that's your taste (with the ultimate being in-ears like the Noble 5C, 1964ears V8, Shure SE846, etc.).  Likewise, there are some neutral and bass-light headphones that are terribly muddy.

{"body":"Sure, "Plugged" encapsulates the act and experience of listening to music both literally and metaphorically and is a well understood English word in many major non English-speaking markets, especially China and India. In thinking about how highly today's consumer values constant connectivity to music and also how powerful music is as a force for encouraging connections amongst us, "Plugged" was the obvious choice as a banner under which to do meaningful work. As a business, meaning isn't the only consideration and "Plugged" scores well in key areas, especially memorability and visualization. 		"Crown" comes from looking at a lot of old guard companies in the space and their approach to naming products as meaningless strings of letters and numbers. We saw that doing so is a missed opportunity to say something about our product. "Crown" works great with associations both to where it's worn (on the head) and what it represents (the highest or best). Crown is without a doubt the best value in headphones. Considering design, construction, brand experience, price and most importantly sound, me and my team stand firmly behind the assertion that Crown rises to the top. Frankly, Crown is a beautiful thing that sounds incredible and is a steal at $99. We're gunning for the top spot in this category and the name "Crown" let's our target market know we're serious.

{"body":"Honestly we didn't rate phonetic attractiveness especially highly in considering names, mostly because it so incredibly subjective. There are sounds in German and Portuguese, both languages with which English shares roots, that might sound completely cacophonous to an English speaker - and while that may give one consumer pause, it could be exactly the oddity that causes another consumer to remember the name. There are just too many ways it could go. 		That's not to say everything was on the table however. We weren't really going to consider something nonsensical the way Internet companies often do because we thought meaning mattered and we also didn't see a pattern of usage where names of hardware companies become verbs (google it, tweet it...sennheiser it?) so accounting for that wasn't a big concern either. Some have gone for shock value or niche specific terminology - we thought the former cheap and the latter shortsighted. 		In the long term, the attractiveness of "Plugged" is going to depend  on what it comes to represent. If our products and message don't resonate with consumers, no name would bridge that shortfall.

And, in my opinion, Beats look WAYYY better than ANY other over-ear headphones, by a huge amount.

Still, those are some margins that even Apple has to be impressed with.		great article otherwise, but I am sick of people pointing out the BOM (bill of materials) of products. It doesn't provide enough information to make the point. The BOM is not the "cost of getting it to the customer", or "cost of sale". The BOM doesn't even include the energy cost of putting those materials together. The real cost of sale includes all that marketing they're talking about, as well as warehousing, shipping, salaries, and even time spent nurturing communities on social media.

{"body":"First of all, audio quality comes from a number of factors.. the speakers, where its coming from(cd player\computer\phone\etc..), the source of the audio(a cd/youtube video/mp3 download/etc..), amplifiers/power source.. There's a number of factors involved. So judging a set of speakers starts with what they're playing from. For a quick example of the difference in sound quality coming from an app just google search "pandora sound quality." You very well may not understand what you're reading, exactly but it shows a variable in the quality of the audio being streamed. To top things off, great speakers will allow you to hear poor audio more clearly, thus making something sound worse in general. All in all, audio is very much so a sum of all parts.		So, Beats.. well, personally I think they're a decent set of headphones as far as sound quality and looks are concerned. Would I recommend them to anyone? Absolutely not and not by a long shot. IMO Beats are a $100ish set of headpones at best(My frame of reference here is a $265 pair of Beats the my younger brother got for a birthday present). They are not nearly as impressive as the price tag.		Source: I work around car/home/portable audio a lot the past few years.	 	Side note, if you're looking for a recommendation outside of Beats, check out Digital Designs. Good, valuable stuff there.

{"body":"I have to admit I've never actually listened to Beats headphones, but I think it's generally true that the most popular product for any category is hardly ever the best bang for the buck. That marketing budget doesn't come out of thin air.		I currently have three pairs of open ear headphones -- Samson SR850's ($40-50 on Amazon), Philips SPH9500 (They retail for $150, but they're easy to find under $100), and Sennheiser HD600 (I believe they retail at $399, but are fairly easy find for under $300 at least). Of course my Sennheisers are the best of the bunch, but for someone who may just be starting to look at audio equipment -- the Samson's are a great bang for the buck. I don't really notice much difference between the Samsons and the Philips, and it seems the general consensus seems to be they sound every bit as good as most headphones $100 more than them. I really haven't used either of them that much since getting my Sennheisers a few months ago.		The one potential drawback of the Sennheisers is they have significantly higher impedance than the other pairs. This basically means they're harder for to drive without a dedicated amp. You CAN use HD600's without an amp just plugged into your onboard sound, but if your source material was mastered even at a somewhat low volume, good luck getting a good volume even with it maxed. I ended up buying a relatively entry level DAC/Amp combo when I bought my HD600's, so my $250 headphone purchase ended up becoming closer to $600 than $250. Still feel like it was worth it for my audio experience, even if it wasn't THAT large of a jump in audio quality from my SR850 to the HD600 + amp.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kagayaki","name":"t1_csdycb2","parent_id":"t1_csdvxin","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434912079,"created_utc":1434908479}
{"body":"Depends on your budget. Here's a list of models I would personally recommend at various budgets:		First, keep in mind that price points are not super accurate depending on sales, regional differences, etc. If you are outside the US, add an extra 30-50% to the price (esp. for my Canadian comrades). If you are patient and willing to wait for sales, subtract 30-50%, etc. (Hopefully my price knowledge isn't terribly out of date... haven't checked up on a lot of these for a while).		$30: Superlux HD-681 EVO: Lively, sounds good, and more comfortable than anything you can get under $50. Semi-open headphones.		$70: Takkstar 2050 or Pioneer SE-A1000: Neutral sound, comfortable.		$100: T50RP: Closed headphones, very lively, extremely comfortable. It has good drivers but otherwise fairly cheap parts. This is **the** headphone of choice for a lot of modders - with some work you can make these sound a lot better. Even just stock, a great choice for the $100 price tag.		$110: Audio-Technica AD700: Open headphones, circumaural, **extremely** comfortable and insane sound stage. Bass is almost non existent (sounds like rolling bass, and not "pounding" bass), but good mids and highs. Highly recommended for gamers due to the sound stage and comfort levels. (These are my personal favorite headphones. Might be a bit difficult to find these days. Seems to have been discontinued in favor of the new AT AD700x series - which is basically the same thing with a different paint job and a higher price tag...)		$130: Sennheiser 558: Probably the most comfortable headphones you'll find sub $200. Open and great sound stage. Neutral sound. Ergonomically shaped which is the main reason for the comfort. Also great for gaming. Has slightly better bass than the AT AD700 mentioned above.		$160: Beyerdynamic DT990 250 Pro: Open, slightly less comfortable than Sennheiser 558. Has a stronger bass profile. You will feel discomfort on your ears if you wear for longer than 6 hours a day (suggest either Sennheiser 558 or AT AD700 if you plan to do that).		$200: DT770 250 Pro: Lively and closed. Good balanced sound profile. Probably best closed headphones you can get at 200 dollar range.		$200-250: Phillips Fidelio X1. Open, and light as air. Really, really comfortable. Really good sound stage and amazing treble + midrange. Booming bass. These have been really popular in the mid-fi world. Definitely recommended if you are willing to spend this much. These are AWFUL to find in Canada! Only places I've seen them for sale go upwards $450-500 CAD (which unfortunately makes these not practical since you can get better at that price...). If anyone can find these for cheaper in Canada please let me know. In the States, these have been on sale for as low as $150 sometimes. If you find the price tag to be over $200, might consider looking into the upgraded X2 model instead.		$400: Sennheiser HD600: More neutral sound, open. This is an introductory set into hi-fi for most people.		Regarding Grados: I don't personally have a lot of experience with these because I don't like how uncomfortable they are. They give extremely clear sound and are probably the best choice in the price range for rock/metal music. If you're interested, look into SR60i model. 		Unfortunately I have no experience with anything more expensive beyond that (I'm not made of money :( ), would like to hear from someone else if they have some insight.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BlueLociz","name":"t1_cse1b1j","parent_id":"t1_csdvxin","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434918004,"created_utc":1434914404}

The Momentums weigh less and they clamp a lot less but both are still very comfortable. I have small ears so any discomfort from the drivers touching my ears don't occur but you can replace the pads with something larger if you need. 		If you just want something for home use, I would reccomend open back headphones. Something like a Q701, K712, or a HE-400.			Real shit though, listen to the Beats and if you really like the sound, no problem in buying them. Buy what you like. Focus too much on the likes of others and you'll never be satisfied. If you can listen to other headphones, that would be prefferable. Best Buy last I was in one had a few headphones on display to try. Guitar Centers usually have a good selection of headphones to try. I had a Frys Electronics near me that had the Sennheiser Momentums on display for testing before I bought them. There are a lot of people that also buy from Amazon and test them and return them using that as a demo until they find what they like.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MythicalBacon","name":"t1_cse32w2","parent_id":"t1_csdvxin","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434921581,"created_utc":1434917981}

Beats are created for a certain type of person with a certain type of personallity. They want to be important but they really are not. They have boom to spare but would the world be better without them. Yeah, probably! The really good quality headphones don't need to stand out cause they have diamonds on them and you can hear what the guy across the room is listening to. They stand out cause your buddy all your buddies tell you they sound great. 		Don't be that chevy caprice! There are waaaay too many of those in the world.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Masaphotog","name":"t1_cse2cpz","parent_id":"t3_3alsth","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1434920118,"created_utc":1434916518}
