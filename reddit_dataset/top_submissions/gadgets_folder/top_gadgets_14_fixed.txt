It's been my experience that magnets aren't terribly effective when sliding things off them, as opposed to pulling directly against the magnet. I'd personally be kind of annoyed if my TV gradually migrated down my wall. Or just sort of tilted off angle. Even moreso if the whole wall weren't magnetic and it worked its way off the magnetic portion and fell off the wall entirely.

This really kicks in when working with multiple display setup as angling monitors and positioning yourself may become pain in the ass.		Some might argue that curved displays appear distorted from extreme angles, but you wont sit playing games with tv turned sideways. And i doubt you will ever have a party when you have more than six people watching. So this shouldnt be a problem.		Also, curved displays open a lot of new possibilities. Seen apple watch?

Plus they don't talk at all about where the wires go. How do you plug stuff into a 1mm thick TV?

Also the title is misleading because refrigerator magnets don't stick to walls. How about 'mounts to your wall using a single magnet.' Oh, and what is the resolution? 1080 or 4k?
