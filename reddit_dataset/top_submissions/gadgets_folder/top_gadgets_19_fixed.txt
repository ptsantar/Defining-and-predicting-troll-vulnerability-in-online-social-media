The SmartBoy was actually announced a few days before April 1st, and April 1st is the day they announced that it was originally planned as a joke but now wasn???t a joke. Minor inconsistency.	The Major inconsistency here is the description of the Retron5, which is just incorrect. The Retron5 does not store the ROM locally on the console: games do not run on the system unless the cartridge is plugged in. It temporarily copies the cartridge to RAM but if the cartridge is removed the game stops being playable.	While this piece suggests there is no advantage to using the Retron5 over original hardware, that???s actually not true. As an all digital solution, the Retron5 gives the TV a clean HDMI signal ??? I???ve actually noticed art elements in some games that were unclear on my old TV / original hardware or HDTV using analog video output. It looks better. A recent update also gives it more options: you can now use IPS patches with real cartridges, allowing folks who own a Japanese RPG, for instnace, to apply a translation patch and play that game in english legally. It???s reasonable to assume similar features will come to the SmatBoy ??? in addition to a backlight screen (your phone) and other features the original game boy systems were incapable of.	THat???s not to argue that Hyperkin is good. They software stealing issue is absolutely real, and the controller that comes with the Retron5 is absolute shit. Like, ABSOLUTE shit, the worst game controller I???ve ever used ??? but those statements made it pretty clear that the author has no fucking idea what they???re talking about here.

I was not arguing the advantages of using it vs a PC. Even if I was, the points I was making clearly didn't sink in with you. Let's pretend I was making that argument for a second and address your counterpoint:		A PC is not a valid option for some users of the Retron 5. 		The reason can be nabbed directly from my original comment: 	>you can now use IPS patches with real cartridges, allowing folks who own a Japanese RPG, for instance, to apply a translation patch and play that game in english legally.		Some folks, myself included, choose not to download and use ROMs, but I do love the advantages of emulators. Once upon a time, there was a company that made USB cartridge adapters for PC, but they were very expensive and are no longer in production. If I want to play a game directly from my old cartridge--with my old save files from when I was a kid--I simply can't do that on the PC. I can do that on the Retron 5. It also allows me to "legally" play my old games without downloading a ROM. 		"Just use a PC" isn't a valid counterargument to the point I wasn't making. 		Other reasons to use the Retron 5 over a PC:	The PC doesn't support the original console's controllers	It's more work to output your PC to TV, start the emulator through Windows and make it a native experience	You can't export your old saves from the cartridge to your PC	You can't upload new saves from your PC to your cartridge		There are lots of good reasons to use a PC as well.
