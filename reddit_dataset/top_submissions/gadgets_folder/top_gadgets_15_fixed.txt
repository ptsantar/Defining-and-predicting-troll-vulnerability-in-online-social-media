A case could be made (and often is) that the US doesn't need them at all and we would all be fine. The system of capitalism is essentially saying "it's inefficient for us to make our own food. This should be offloaded elsewhere and our labor is best used elsewhere." As a matter of fact this is already happening. We import tons of food, and we export it as well.

At least the "artificial entity" (or as Mitt Romney called it, "person") has an interest in its own long-term survival.		Who would you want the duty running to:		a)  A day trader who bought the stock 3 hours ago and is going to sell it in another hour after a new product is announced?		b)  A private equity firm who is trying to buy enough stock so that they can break the company up, rake in millions of dollars in management fees, run up millions of dollars in debt, and then sell remains piecemeal for profit?		c)  An activist investor like Carl Icahn, who doesn't understand the long term strategy of the firm but understands that he can demand larger dividends or even that the company sell off huge chunks of the company for short-term profit, while crippling the long-term plans?		d)  A long-term investor like Warren Buffet who bought into the company because it is profitable, has solid fundamentals and can continue to generate dividends for the foreseeable future?		All of those people are shareholders.  All of them have different interests in the company.  If you ask each of them what is in their fiduciary interest and where the duty lies they would give you a different answer.  The notion that there ever could be a single fiduciary duty in these circumstances is a joke, and anyone claiming otherwise hasn't thought about it.		Being a shareholder in a company has changed a lot in the past 30-40 years.  For most of our country's history people bought stock in companies that were successful, that paid dividends, and that had long term prospects.  They bought stock because they expect that when they eventually sold the stock or left it to their family that it would not only have increased in value, but that it would have also paid out significant money in dividends over the course of the years that they owned it.  They bought stock to own a piece of the company's success, and they made money based on the success of the company.		Nowdays it is a different ball of wax.  Instead of people buying stock to own a piece of a company, they are buying so that they can flip it for a profit.  Most of the people making millions on the stock market (or billions) aren't doing it by investing in companies, they are doing it by betting for or against the rising or lowering of share prices.  The value that the company itself provides has become completely secondary to the legalized gambling that is the stock market.		So who should the duty flow to?  The company, or the person who has no interest in the company?","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"notwhoithink","name":"t1_cr2pp94","parent_id":"t1_cr2nrub","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1431108831,"created_utc":1431105231}

{"body":"I question how biodegradable these cups are.  What works in a lab might not work when buried in a landfill.		But waste isn't the only issue.  It takes energy and resources to manufacture the cups, plus fuel to ship them.  Buying coffee in a standard container has less packaging per serving and can be packed more densely on trucks.  		To me, these cups, whether from Keurig or another brand, epitomize the half-assed approach Americans take toward the environment.  It's undeniably worse for the environment to use these cups over standard packaged coffee (note I specifically don't say it's "better" for the environment to use standard packaged coffee because it doesn't help the environment, it's just less worse), yet because it's slightly more convenient, people use them.  How will we ever be able to deal with an issue like climate change if necessary action causes even more than a slight inconvenience?  Most people can't be bothered to turn the lights off when they're not in a room, go without air conditioning in the summer, or combine trips to reduce car use.  Money seems to be the only true motivator, so a greenhouse gas tax is probably the only way to get results.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"belandil","name":"t1_cr2jafb","parent_id":"t1_cr2epfe","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1431098080,"created_utc":1431094480}
