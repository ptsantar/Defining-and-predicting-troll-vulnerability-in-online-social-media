{"body":"Funny you should mention that.  My first mock-up worked that way.  Yes, it is a bit easier to use that way.  Plus you only have to actively be applying force for a shorter time, just when you apply the iron rather than during the entire time you pull it through your hair, as it is now.  On the other hand, the current design is more fail-safe: If you stop doing stuff to it, it releases whatever it's clamping.  The other method clamps down on whatever is between the plates.  For example, if someone got a cramp in their arm and yanked it out of the harness while in the midst of a pull, in the current design the jaws open up and it falls to the floor.  The other way could leave the jaws clamped on the hair, and if the cramp kept you from recovering quickly, could singe or burn the hair.  		All that said, there are benefits to both methods, and I may even build one of each and let get Rachelle's input.","depth":4,"score":31,"ups":31,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"I_Lase_You","name":"t1_crs8fpp","parent_id":"t1_crs7qqx","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433194834,"created_utc":1433191234}
