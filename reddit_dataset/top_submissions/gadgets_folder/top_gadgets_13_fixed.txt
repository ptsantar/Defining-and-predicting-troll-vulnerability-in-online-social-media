{"body":"Okay, since I have a few minutes.		Solid state storage is storage that does not physically move. This includes all forms of flash storage, both NAND and NOR, because the bits are held on non-moving media. Interestingly, core memory would also be considered solid state storage. In general, solid state devices are analogs of other devices, except they don't move. For example, a relay physically moves pieces of metal to form a connection; a solid state relay is more like a big fat transistor. RAM is a form of solid state storage; unlike flash memory, it is volatile. (Unless you talk about MRAM which is not.)		Therefore, flash memory, whether you're talking about a flash drive, an SD card or microSD card, a CF card, an SSD, is solid state.		Flash storage is flash storage and is all based on the same technology. The differences are in the implementation of that technology - you can have more density, higher reliability, higher speed, better retention, better read-write cycle count. As you might imagine, the actual flash chips that end up in $1000 enterprise SSDs is different from the ones that end up in $5 flash drives. However, in many cases, a single flash storage chip model will end up in many devices across the spectrum. A 128 gbit chip can be used for a 16GB flash drive, or ten of them in a 160 GB SSD.		Of course, there's a lot more to it: you have, in short, controllers that are used to access the storage for both read/writing, as well as the robustness of the rest of the circuit ($2 low-ESR aluminum capacitors versus $0.02 crappy ceramics.) The controller is what implements various protocols: that's why the same flash goes into devices that work through USB, or the SD card interface, or the IDE CF card interface, or SATA (various versions), or PCI (various versions). Controllers also do wear leveling; if you only have 100k write cycles **per cell** then your controller will use different cell lines in a more or less round robin fashion to make sure things wear at approximately the same rate.		So now, the write cycle issue. 100k write cycles may not sound like a lot, but the truth is, modern flash devices with proper controllers will not wear out. It is that simple. You will, in almost all cases, throw it out for being too old and shitty well before you start seeing performance degradation. Not only that, but each flash device has extra unused space, so if a line needs to be poisoned, instead of having less space, the controller now uses one of the extra lines. Not only that, but when devices start failing, they become read-only - so your data is still recoverable, you just lose the ability to write more data.		The difference between HDD and SSD performance is massive. Both read and write speeds are much better with SSDs, and power consumption is less, noise is nearly non-existent. It is far more reliable, since there is nothing moving; you won't kill a flash drive by dropping it unless you're very unlucky (how many times have you dropped your phone?).		As you might also imagine, flash storage is far cheaper than HDD for small amounts of space. For 2 TB, HDD is cheaper. For 32 GB, you won't even find a hard drive that small. Of _course_ it uses flash memory, which is solid state, not an HDD.		The vents are for the heat from the CPU, chipset, and all the other components. I would imagine the TDP of this thing is in the range of 3-5W, and can peak at over 5W for short periods of time. That does not sound like a lot but believe me when I say you need cooling. Since this goes behind a TV, instead of a robust thin design using the case as a heatsink, it's much easier to just make it a bit fat and bulky with vent holes.		Also, tons of people use SSDs for their computers. Nobody really has issues with it. My OS boots off an SSD, no issues.

{"body":"I am not going to downvote you, but I will answer your question.		I would buy one of these because as of yet, no company makes the perfect "smart stick" that works with everything. If I choose Android, I am limited to the apps that any service provider offers. If I choose Roku, I maybe cannot get HBO Go because Comcast or similar.		I am sick and tired of being jerked around by content distribution companies playing favorites with platforms.		Just about every major service is available through a web browser. And most companies are willing to support Internet Explorer on Windows. It basically makes a Windows device the perfect platform for all your media services being supported, various video games working with a wide range of controllers, and if I want to hand these things out to my employees, it really is "Windows to Go".		We actually had a very compelling use case for something like this for our employees who would travel to China. We did not want to give them a full blown laptop that could be subject to inspection, but something like this looks like a USB stick, and using remote VPN, desktop or Citrix remote access allows our employees to work while we maintain control of our data.		So, as you can see , there are a lot of reasons. There are likely to be disagreements based on platform allegiance, or other factors, but I have been playing around with trying to get my favorite services, video game emulators, and players to work on a portable device, and so far Windows has been the most capable.		We'll have to see how the interface pans out in a device like this, but I can say that Microsoft has made some real progress in the touchscreen interface, and right now, it is my preference over Android, iOS, and Chromebooks.

As an example, I mainly use it as a Plex server for a catalog of about 900 media files on a NAS.  It can transcode (yes, transcode, not stream) 3 files if they are below 1gb each, 2 if they are around 3gb each or one is larger and the other a small file, it will handle one really large MKV transcode.
