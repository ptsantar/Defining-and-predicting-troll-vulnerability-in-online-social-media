{"body":"It depends on what you are doing with that much space. Generally a 16-24 bay rack server with a decent SAS controller or two and back plane is 'only' 4 or 5 grand. equal too or less than the estimated cost of just 1 of these drives. Add in random seek times, and more importantly provisioning and failure/replacement costs. I doubt most enterprise solutions are going to jump at this.		If I'm managing a "cloud fabric", do I really want 120 50GB VM instances on a single drive as a single point of failure? What about shuttling the data around? The storage and the processing power are going to be mostly separate in our "cloud fabric" scenario so we have to assume we will need some sort of SAN technology. That brings its own bottlenecks depending on how much of the storage you need to utilize at any one time. Consolidating 6 16 TB SAN boxes with a single 96 TB SAN box isn't going to do you any favors. Directly attach all 96 TB to a hypervisor? There is another entire post about why that would suck.		Also at these sizes, RAID5/6 can fuck right off with the time it will take to rebuild the set from a parity disk. Assuming an amazing controller and completely "As advertised" sustained sequential write speeds it would take 3+ hours to rebuild a disk in a RAID5/6. Realistically I expect you would be lucky to get half that so closer to 6+ hours your entire RAID is down because 1 disk died. Also any other RAIDs on the same controller are slowed while the downed RAID rebuilds.

{"body":"One large reason (summarized in a simple way): Everytime a flash cell is written, electrons are thrown into a jar. Depending upon how full that jar is, that jar will represent one bit (i.e. 0-30% full = 0, 70-100% full = 1). Note: higher density NAND can split that jar up into smaller levels; allowing for 2, 3 + bits per "jar".		Anyway everytime these jars are filled with electrons (written to),  some of those electrons get stuck in there for good. Eventually, a jar might be emptied out to represent "empty", but 60% of its capacity is electrons that have become stuck from past write.		So, in short - the more you write a cell,.the quicker it will wear out. So many SSD's capacities will actually shrink over time. the user may not see this within their warranty period  (2-5 years) bc they are typically over provisioned  by a significant percentage (i.e. an 800GB ssd may actually have 1TB of total capacity, but that extra 224GB  is to account for the cells that eventually get "thrown out"). there are many other ways SSD's try to keep the capacity from shrinking  (i.e. writing to every cell proportionally, etc), but this is the main way.		Anyway, i think that should help explain one reason why SSD's still suck for long term, reliable storage.		Side note: HDD's are a long way from dead still. International storage demand is vastly outpacing the world's ability to provide NAND. There just aren't enough NAND fabs yet and they are so so so expensive to build.

The main usage for hard drives going forward is going to be for archiving large amounts of data, and that is moving quickly to online storage for the average user.		Except for power-users who need to store large amounts of data cheaply, I predict that within five years, there will be almost no usage of hard drives in new products aimed at home consumers.  		Within about 10 years, I suspect we will hit and perhaps exceed price-parity, so that hard drives will actually cost more per byte than SSDs.		My opinion is that the hard drive is going to be almost completely dead within a decade.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_Wisenheimer","name":"t1_cr4k06e","parent_id":"t1_cr4ckgb","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1431276290,"created_utc":1431272690}

{"body":"They still have some lesser-known hurdles to overcome, most consumer drives have a relatively low data retention period of ~3 months. What is a "data retention period" for SSDs? It's the length of time the manufacture claims you can have an SSD powered off before it'll begin to lose data.		Unlike mechanical magnetic hard-drives, today's SSDs need to be periodically powered on or else they will begin to lose data. I don't think many people realize this, even those using them in enterprise solutions. So mechanical hard drives won't be able to be replaced by SSDs at the consumer level for all scenarios, until consumer SSDs data retention rates improve, even if SSDs are eventually cheaper. For this reason, we probably won't be seeing any trustworthy external backup drives using SSDs for a long while.","depth":2,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ShadowHandler","name":"t1_cr4cun3","parent_id":"t1_cr4ba9p","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1431251276,"created_utc":1431247676}

The possible exceptions are high-end multimedia users like video editors who read and write data constantly, but those users will need the larger capacities of hard drives anyway.
