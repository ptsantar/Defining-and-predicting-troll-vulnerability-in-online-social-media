And thats on the low end of what alienware offers, and the best stuff mac can make. The simple fact is macs sacrifice everything for battery life because they have convinced people that it is the only important thing. Performance matters. A lot. Apple has proven for 20 years it cant do performance, and when it tries it still lags behind the competion and costs 2-3 times as much. Macs exist for the same niche they have always existed for, people who have more money than sense and know absolutely nothing whatsoever about computers. That is the entire foundation of mac OS. 			Dont even get me started on how mac wants you to not be able to interact with your laptop in anyway beyond keyboard and trackpad. Look at the new macbook. Lets pretend macs are fast enough to play actual video games for this one. You go buy a game from walmart, pull out the disk, tough shit better return it. You want to put your screen up onto your tv with hdmi, tough shit better buy some more apple stuff for that. You want to use a flash drive to give your buddy these files you have, tough shit it only has a usb port nothing else uses and isnt compatible with any other usb port. You want a better internet connection than wireless can provide? Tough shit. You wanna put pictures from your camera onto your computer? Tough shit. You want to print something with your printer? Tough. Shit. Better go buy a wifi printer. Point is, to have basic computer functions from apple you have to get (still far below industry standards) the even more expensive versions.

Next monday he finds out that his employer has fired him (because of the picture).		The story gets spun around a few times, sides are picked ("father of three fired over joke"). At one point the story gets picked up by certain message boards (4chan I believe, maybe some others too), and they decide this isn't fair to the dude, and decide to play their own judge. They harrass the woman, contact the dude that got fired, and DDOS the website of the woman's employer, asking for the woman to be fired, or they will continue to harrass the company. Now the woman gets fired as well.		The woman turns out to be quite the lunatic in the end (I read an interview with her and the dude some time ago on reddit), blaming the patriarchy and everything for what has happened to her.

But then again you don't need them on Linux for them to learn Python or for them to learn any programming language.		I feel like there is this sentiment that using Linux = learning Bash.  And as powerful and awesome as bash is people want to be able to say they're learning a "real" language so they will brag about how using Linux helped them to learn Perl or Python.  But someone developing for Linux is probably writing in C or C++, not slapping together Perl scripts.		And Windows has its own fully-featured scripting language--it's called Powershell, and through it your scripts can use the entire world of .NET classes.  I'm not sure if .NET will be a "thing" by the time your kids grow up and become devs but Powershell is a pretty great gateway drug to .NET.

From a hardware perspective, I think you're 100% right.

Really?  So, she can install Compiz and other eye candy, sure.  Show me an example of "being able to get the computer to do something you want" that is not predicated on developing your own applications but solely on installing something.		> Compare that to most children who don't realize that it's possible to put something other than Windows on a non-Apple PC or OS X on a Mac.		Whether or not your kids realize it has to do with what you teach them though.

{"body":"Skip the 3D stuff for use as a monitor. If the TV says that it does anything "Dynamic" skip it. It usually means that the TV is trying to do something predictive or reactive based on the input to the screen. While if you're using it as a monitor you want to have it display exactly what your PC is sending over the wire, not alter it in any way. If you can turn it off, then it's probably OK, but the cheaper TVs won't include the feature, so you can save money that way. (In particular avoid dynamic up-scaling. This will cause you grief when you play a full screen game that causes the resolution to change.)		Don't get anything that's interlaced. 1080i is interlaced, you want 1080p. (Progressive.) Don't get anything less than 1080p (which is 1920x1080) don't get anything that says "extra wide format" or something like that, because they will stretch the image on cheaper TVs. (Though some more expensive ones will have a wider number of pixels than 1920 and allow for a true wide format.) For most people 60 hertz is an OK refresh rate. If you play video games then 60 hertz is probably the lowest refresh rate that you want since if you play FPS the higher the refresh rate the better you will perform in game. If you're a hardcore FPS gamer, look for a 120 hertz refresh rate or higher.		I've found that when there's an advertised special they will sell a cheap TV with lots of features, but they will be out of stock when you get there. They will try to drive you towards a more expensive one, but they usually also have a pile of TVs that are only a little more expensive than the one on special, but they are stripped of features. Those are the ones you want, as long as they are 1080p.		The only real down side to these TVs is that they rarely include external switches, so you always need to keep the remote nearby to turn it on, and it usually takes 5 to 15 seconds for them to warm up and turn on after you push the power button. So you need to watch for the power indicator LED and wait for it to turn on.		The up side is that you get built in speakers (which are usually not too great, but for most people, OK) and you can flip over to watch digital TV without needing an adapter. Also you can get a much bigger screen for way less money than a monitor. (Think about how far away from the TV you will sit. Simulate that by facing the screen in the store from the same distance. If you can't see both sides on the monitor without turning your head. (i.e. just moving your eyes a little) then it's too big to use as a monitor. Unless you're getting 4K, then you can open a window only in part of the screen and look just at that while the rest of the screen shows your desktop or other apps.)		Monitors tend to have better power management features and work with your computer to turn off the screen when the input goes dormant. While TVs will display a blue screen for hours until they turn off. Actual monitors will also turn on way faster, react faster to resolution changes, and you can get higher resolutions in general.  However, at least for me as I'm old and decrepit 1080p is good enough, and maybe some day I'll get 4K, but I have to move close to the monitor and squint to see individual pixels at 1080p. There's a world of difference between the 1024x768 19 inch CRT I had in 2002 and the 32 inch 1920x1080 TV I got in 2010. On the CRT I could see the individual pixels without too much trouble, while the TV I have to get really close.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"wormspeaker","name":"t1_cpju7jr","parent_id":"t1_cpjkz3x","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1426775360,"created_utc":1426771760}

{"body":"I really wish they'd stop being so horrible with specs. I have one of the early Windows tablets with the full windows 8.1, 2GB RAM, and a dualcore Atom 1.3ghz. It was great for climbing up into ceilings to do my work when I was doing on-site calls. Unfortunately, it's so unbelievably slow after the third tab is open in Chrome or more than JUST ONE instance of Word open. Really, devices with this little RAM can't run normally. It really takes around 5 seconds for Chrome to just open to a blank page with no add-ons. I've wiped and started fresh with no change.		The reality is they can't keep pumping out shit machines built to last 1 year. This lead to the entire issue of "Windows is SLOW!" from users running Windows Me on a $300 Sears catalog PC. That same person would wonder why his friend's $2000 PC was light speed in comparison.		Oh, and 16GB of storage means you have around 3GB of storage left after Windows is done eating the rest.

{"body":"This seems to be very similar to the many Android HDMI-sticks out there. Those usually use a Mediatek SoC and come with WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity and a USB host port.  	  	Since Intel makes mobile x86 and x64 SoCs (used in tablets, phones and the new macbook) I assume it will use a similar SoC. It will be able to run 'full' x86 (maybe also x64) programs because it also runs a x86 (or x64) version of Windows, not the less capable Windows RT for ARM.  	But those Intel SoC are low power and low performance. Coupled with only 1-2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and a mobile GPU, you don't want to use heavy programs, like Photoshop, video editing tools, 3D tools (CAD, 3D modelling) or a big IDE (eclipse or so). They might run, but performance will be bad.  	  	Those devices are suitable for web browsing, some office stuff and light programs. I think you could do some simple programming on them (Javascript and html), maybe even some simple graphic editing/design. They might be able to run lighter games (2D games or old 3D games), but nothing new and fancy. There are capable emulators (SNES, N64, PS1, PS2...) for Android (and mobile SoC), so those devices might be powerful enough to run an emulator for an older gaming console.  	  	I think those devices are useful either as some kind of smart TV device or when, for example, visiting your parents and you know you have work to do on a computer, but you don't need to bring a laptop and you don't want/can use your parent's computer for it. Of course you still need a monitor and mouse and keyboard, but any monitor/TV with HDMI will do.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rob3110","name":"t1_cpioz4c","parent_id":"t3_2zg598","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1426685936,"created_utc":1426682336}

But since it is a mobile SoC (ultra low power and low performance), it has only 1-2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, performance of 'heavy' programs like Photoshop, video editing tools, 3D tools (CAD, 3D modelling), big IDEs or modern video games won't be very good.
