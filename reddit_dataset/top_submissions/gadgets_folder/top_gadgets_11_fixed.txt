Some wiseguy decided that number was a bit ugly and decided it was close enough to 1000 bytes that it could simply be abbreviated with "kilo". He was wrong, but it caught on, and when we got to millions of bytes, someone decided to extend it by doing the same thing with 1024 KB = 1 MB, which also happened to work nicely with powers of 2 (which are still used and probably will be for as long as our computers work in binary). It has become a standard so ingrained in computing that it will probably never go away at this point, hence the attempt to retroactively rename it to Kibi/Mebi/Gibibytes etc. 		1024 bytes is simply NOT a kilobyte, no matter how long it has been misused for. Kilo is metric, and it very authoritatively means 1000 bytes, no more no less. And likewise, a megabyte should be exactly 1,000,000 bytes.

{"body":"> you can't store 1 bit.		BULLSHIT. UTTER AND COMPLETE BULLSHIT.		> In the earliest non-electronic information processing devices, such as Jacquard's loom or Babbage's Analytical Engine, a bit was often stored as the position of a mechanical lever or gear, or the presence or absence of a hole at a specific point of a paper card or tape. The first electrical devices for discrete logic (such as elevator and traffic light control circuits, telephone switches, and Konrad Zuse's computer) represented bits as the states of electrical relays which could be either "open" or "closed". When relays were replaced by vacuum tubes, starting in the 1940s, computer builders experimented with a variety of storage methods, such as pressure pulses traveling down a mercury delay line, charges stored on the inside surface of a cathode-ray tube, or opaque spots printed on glass discs by photolithographic techniques.		> In the 1950s and 1960s, these methods were largely supplanted by magnetic storage devices such as magnetic core memory, magnetic tapes, drums, and disks, where a bit was represented by the polarity of magnetization of a certain area of a ferromagnetic film, or by a change in polarity from one direction to the other. The same principle was later used in the magnetic bubble memory developed in the 1980s, and is still found in various magnetic strip items such as metro tickets and some credit cards.		> In modern semiconductor memory, such as dynamic random access memory or flash memory, the two values of a bit may be represented by two levels of electric charge stored in a capacitor. In programmable logic arrays and certain types of read-only memory, a bit may be represented by the presence or absence of a conducting path at a certain point of a circuit. In optical discs, a bit is encoded as the presence or absence of a microscopic pit on a reflective surface. In one-dimensional bar codes, bits are encoded as the thickness of alternating black and white lines.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit#Storage","depth":18,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alexanderpas","name":"t1_cptbro0","parent_id":"t1_cptbkik","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1427523697,"created_utc":1427520097}

Let's assume people aren't going to start building living rooms around TV technology, so viewing distance will remain the same. That's like 10 - 12 ft for a lot of rooms. 4K only starts to really matter if you want a 85 - 90+ inch TV.		Conversely, let's say you want a 4k computer monitor, about 3 ft viewing distance. You're looking at 35 - 40+ inch monitors.

Of course, you could recopy it from the original blu-ray (or re-download it) or whatever if you wanted to--to refresh it back to the maximum viewing quality.  Of course it could be a potentially annoying feature if not properly implemented, but what do you think of it?  Could it work?  How useful would it be?  The OS would probably have to have a tagging feature that tracked the extent of the video file's auto-compression, and it should be an opt-in feature of course.

{"body":"So glad I chose a video card over an SSD. I wouldn't have minded paying ~$250 for a ~500GB SSD, though.		But I can't help, when seeing things like this, and especially advances in medicine, that announcements to the future of the industry will not reach consumers (patients) anywhere near the time allowed. Of course, the pharmaceutical industry, it's widely known, profits on treatments, and cures threaten their bottom line. Tech has a similar dynamic called Apple, but they're really only conservative on phones (2014 iPhone 6 ~= 2012 Nexus 4); the Mac Pro is nothing to joke about and has a PCIe SSD. Though they only refresh that every few years, I think, we should be at least two years into the "Trashcan" model (which, despite my anti-Apple bias, I really admire). So hopefully the next Mac Pro takes advantage of this stuff. Of course most people can't afford a Mac Pro, but those who can will pay the early adopter tax and lead the tech into mass production ??? maybe.
