{"body":"That's the beautiful thing; the whole time we'd been expecting the rise of a tyrannical, oppressive, monolithic, megacorporation. As if Big Brother Inc didn't have a PR team, or a profit incentive. It makes *way* more sense for the dystopian, omnipresent, all-powerful, state-eclipsing megacorporations to be warm, friendly, affable, relatable, down-to-earth, wholesome entities. Google didn't coil it's tendrils around all of our personal information with jackboots and truncheons, they did it with our trust, and neat, free* services.		Transposed into a cyberpunk narrative, a megacorporation of this sort commands imposing brand power. Gone is the karmic parable of rag-tag digital dissident underdogs facing against the interests of a faceless, sociopathic machine. Anyone who took action against Google would be despised as a radical vandal, breaching something we all trust, the common good, *our* personal data (for which Google merely acts as a caretaker) - who would celebrate the cracking of encrypted Google servers?		From a narrative perspective, though, I think this is actually better. It's more cyberpunk to free the notion of opposing the system from any perceived heroic pretenses. Not because the masses are two-dimensional, mindless wageslaves (not overtly) but because they rationally and reasonably subscribed to a reality where the corporations *really are* their best friend. Life as a compulsory consumerist *is* wonderful, if you play ball. 		Instead of the classic image of a sullen-faced, fearful, suit looking upon a radically dressed, dangerously free, digital anarchist with fear and wonder -  what about a young, happy, attractive, sharply dressed, urban professional, armed with a dazzling array of friction-blasting tools and services, looking down their nose with confusion and disdain at a neckbeard keyboard warrior, whackjob crank, dangerous and unstable radical. Think of how the general public views Chelsea Manning - a sad, gender-confused, justly jailed, whackjob. That's a real cyberpunk hero, right there. Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, forced to take refuge under the wing of one oppressive regime from the talons of another, widely derided and mocked for doing so - that's the moral compromise we'd expect from cyberpunk protagonists.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Arch-duke","name":"t1_cp2u88o","parent_id":"t1_cp28pjd","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1425384366,"created_utc":1425384366}

Also SD card access is less restricted and far more open on the Android operating system. It's just not as safe, period.	2. When you remove an App it cleans up after it's self. It needs android's operating system and garbage collecting to do this effectively. What if your app on your SD card saved files that you can't see and don't have access to on your phone?

That application remains the core component of what eventually became Google???s search service. Brin and Page had performed their work with funding from the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), a multi-agency programme of the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA and DARPA.	But that???s just one side of the story.	Throughout the development of the search engine, Sergey Brin reported regularly and directly to two people who were not Stanford faculty at all: Dr. Bhavani Thuraisingham and Dr. Rick Steinheiser. Both were representatives of a sensitive US intelligence community research programme on information security and data-mining."

Still I think Google might get a dish of hubris here when they realize that expanding into other markets is very difficult and networks are very complex.

Your ISP isn't is probably awful. I agree. It's not because the people there are idiots and the management are evil.
