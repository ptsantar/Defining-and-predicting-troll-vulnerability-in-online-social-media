{"body":"UK Cop here - my shift have 24 body cameras. We've had body-worn cameras for about 3 years now, but are bringing more in to try and get every single patrol to at least have one on them.		Primarily these cameras are used for domestic violence incidents, as it is *incredibly* hard to get concrete evidence for these. Sure, we can take statements, say what we saw, make arrests, get witness statements etc. but the British justice system is so fucking screwy that when the victim retracts, its *so fucking hard* to pursue a victimless prosecution, and the offender nearly always gets away with it. Not our fault, the courts!		So, to combat this, we started using these cameras. Nicknamed 'DV Cams' (Domestic Violence Cameras) we activated these the moment we left the car to approach a domestic incident. Bam. Victimless prosecution success rates sky rocketed.		Then, we started using them for other incidents such as public order, especially during 'night time economy' - when we're on foot outside the pubs and clubs. The footage gained here allowed us to a) collect evidence of offences, b) show drunk people what they're really like when they're sober enough to realise how stupid they are, and c) use them for licensing purposes to show councils which bars / clubs are where most of the bother is.		Then we started to use them for just anything that officers felt needed that extra bit of evidence, and its been fan-bloody-tastic. The cameras protect us cops because when a complaint comes in we just play the tape back and show that we're doing our job, or we play the tape back and realise one of our colleagues could perhaps do with some extra training / a disciplinary / dismissal. So it protects the good cops from bad people, and keeps the good cops in the job and outs the bad.		This is also why those who have been in the job since the 80s / 90s *hate* these cameras. It stops them from doing the 'old school' style of policing - which we all know does *not* work in modern Britain!			...

There are (from what i've heard) pretty sophisticated CCTV systems at airports, train stations and the like which track and analyse the behaviour of people incase its suspicious (leaving a bag unattended for instance).  The UK was (and more or less still is) developing and implementing such systems because of the IRA threat in the 80s and 90s.  After 9/11 the systems were expanded but the development work was already there.		The one aspect where the UK does 'lead the world' (if you want to use that phrase for automated surveillance systems) is in tracking car movement.  [Automatic number plate recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number_plate_recognition#United_Kingdom) in the UK is on a different level to any other industrialised nation.  Its like something out of Hollywood.  MI5 can more or less track any car anywhere in the country in real time and the data is subsequently stored for *two years*.		It means they can build up very very sophisticated models to predict behaviour in anyone they're tracking.  The public don't really get to upset about those cameras as they have been very effective at catching tax dodgers for [15 years](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359107/Mobile-road-cameras-to-catch-tax-dodgers.html).		It's possible that the tech used on roads could be extended to public areas people walk in but then the government are likely to meet a massive backlash and difficulty in enforcing such measures in private areas (shopping malls etc).","depth":3,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"qoztoo","name":"t1_crugbz0","parent_id":"t1_cruakus","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433361392,"created_utc":1433357792}

{"body":"According to [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+many+cctv+cameras+in+uk), there are up to 6m CCTV cameras in the UK.  How much would it cost to replace them?  Not all of them, but enough to make a significant impact on crime?  In London alone, there are more than 20,000 CCTV cameras that could be replaced and the overwhelming majority of them likely go unmonitored 99% of the time, with footage only being checked after a crime has been committed.		In city centres where crime is more of a problem, higher quality cameras that can rotate, zoom and capture audio are already installed, at least in many places.  And in other areas?  Well, I suspect that the value that such a dense CCTV camera network offers isn't through suspect identification based on image alone, but by providing CCTV operators and the police the ability to follow the suspect.  Where they went next, which house the entered, what car they climbed into, etc.  These cameras are place on poles several metres above our heads, pointed down long streets.  The resolution required to be able to make out details on the faces of every person in their field of view would be immense, along with the cost of storing all of the data, even temporarily.		Putting the cameras on police will ensure that the footage captured always pertains to the crime being committed.  In this case, when you know that the camera is going to be solely used to capture crimes as they are in action, the apprehension of suspects, general interactions with the public, etc., the extra expense makes sense.		On an aside, that 6m figure includes cameras rigged up to the UK's national ANPR (automatic number-plate recognition) system, which covers the majority of the UK, including every motorway and major road in the UK, cross-checking scanned number-plates with records in police databases.  While I can't find the source, I seem to remember reading that the system leads to around 10k arrests ever year (this was several years ago and the ANPR system has been expanded since).  While you don't need a particularly high quality camera to make out a number-plate, this example does show the value of overall CCTV coverage over individual image quality.","depth":5,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"omnomcocknomom","name":"t1_crucdof","parent_id":"t1_cruaz0h","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433355491,"created_utc":1433351891}

If there is a threat of litigation that could be damaging to the funding of the police force and to the city's finances, then the city would provide the body cams to avoid harmful litigation.

They also need to retest often to keep up standards, if a AFO is seen to have a health or fitness issue after wards during reassessment they can be suspended from firearms duties. Firearms are seen as a volunteered privilege rather than a right of all officers.		They carry Glocks and have access to MP5's in their vehicles, which are [specifically marked with orange](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Co19.jpg)		They also act as rapid response to stabbing and shooting trauma if they're on scene before paramedics and generally only respond to reports of violent crimes involving weapons such as knifes or firearms.		The next step up is to Specialist officers (SFO's) that are AFO's who have been once again applied for extended training in the use of entry and negotiation, basically UK SWAT.		As a side note all firearms use in the UK has to be authorized by the crown.

Sadly, that's something that I can't say overall about American police.		I am not anti-gun, but perhaps if there were less citizens with weapons, less police here would feel the need to use deadly force. I know many of the recent stories have been unarmed citizens being killed some way or another, but the point stands that if an officer doesn't know what to expect, they might act in an unexpected manner when the situation is unclear.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RocketPropelledHate","name":"t1_cruwj7r","parent_id":"t1_cru9xa7","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433388508,"created_utc":1433384908}

However, cops are the same everywhere: they involve terrorism laws to do what they want.
