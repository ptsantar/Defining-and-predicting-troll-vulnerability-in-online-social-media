It has also been characterized as a measure of the [space-filling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve) capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space) it is embedded in; a fractal dimension does not have to be an integer.   		>The essential idea of "fractured" [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) has a long history in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot) based on his 1967 paper on [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity) in which he discussed *fractional dimensions*.  In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by [Lewis Fry Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson) describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick.  There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.		>====		>[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/LXUYK43.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:32_segment_fractal.jpg)		---		^Interesting: [^Fractal ^dimension ^on ^networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension_on_networks) ^| [^List ^of ^fractals ^by ^Hausdorff ^dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension) ^| [^Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) ^| [^Fractal ^analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_analysis) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjeoqi5) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjeoqi5)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","depth":7,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autowikibot","name":"t1_cjeoqi5","parent_id":"t1_cjeoqe4","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406961536,"created_utc":1406957936}

{"body":"Beverage containers are typically made of PETE, while PLA and ABS are the two most common plastics for fused deposition printing.	You can't just throw any random plastic into a printer and expect it to come out well. The plastic needs to have good layer-to-layer bond strength, favorable melt properties (flows well out the nozzle, solidifies as quickly as possible afterwards) and minimal shrinkage as it cools (so the part doesn't come out warped). PLA tends to best fit these requirements, while higher temperature tolerance and slight flexibility (impact resistance) gives ABS its uses.		That aside, yes recycling plastics has been thought of. [Finished products](http://www.filastruder.com) are even available if you don't want to engineer your own extruder.	From what I've read, the recycling process isn't perfect. If you toss a junk 3D print back through the system, the print quality isn't as nice as fresh filament. That makes some sense to me, as the plastics have an odor when they're being printed... Something is evaporating from the hot plastic during printing. When you crush scrap prints and put them back in filament form, you don't get that whatever-it-was chemical content back.		You can however purchase bulk plastic pellets (the sort manufacturing plants use for feed stock) and feed those through your own filament extruder for a significant cost savings. That way your filament is as fresh as you would get from a retailer, but you're not paying for their overhead.		Recyclers often go for something in between: mostly fresh pellets, with some smaller portion of recycled material.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iksbob","name":"t1_cjeidzt","parent_id":"t1_cjeeyoj","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406945291,"created_utc":1406941691}

The second I was working with a guy doing a start up. He bought the complete kit for $700. I spent most of my time fixing it. The company owed me some money ($400) and they didn't want to part with cash, so I asked for the printer.		The third printer was from Blue Eagle Labs. The printer can print in a much larger space, at a higher resolution, and has a better quality. It cost $700.		I feel that the RepRaps are not the best bang for their buck. I do feel the Blue Eagle is better bang for buck. Also, now that I have access to a laser cutter and other tools, I could make my own for ~$500 if I was dead set on doing it. I know one person who spent a lot of time and work and made one for $200, but he made his own motor drivers.		I think it is a case of printers can print off other printers, but sometimes purchasing parts off the shelf or laser cutting out parts can produce a better quality and price. I think that is the future of the RepRap designs.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BlenderGuy","name":"t1_cjgy6fm","parent_id":"t1_cjgi60f","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1407193175,"created_utc":1407189575}

{"body":">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:76369 (60,000 rpm turbine)		I would not trust that turbine for anything and I meant anything. I went to the makerbot store in NYC to check it out. I was wondering if I could polish the plastic pieces to a fine glossy finish (using 2000 grit+ and above wet sanding) and the worker wanted to know as well and gave me a few crocodiles and trinkets they made and gave to everyone else as well. The problem is that once you sand the top layer, I found the inner layers full of bubbles or holes and not in fact solid.		I was later told by someone higher at makerbot that that probably was not tuned to do fine finish but to make it as fast as possible. But here is the thing if I am unsure of the stability of the product and want to spin a turbine at 60,000 rpm I would not dare unless I want broken pieces flying and potentially fouling everything up.		I say this because I am into model r/c airplanes and they have EDF electric ducted fans that spin at that level and no one but the cheapest models use plastic fan blades as at that speed the plastic tends to deform and smack into the side and ruin the housing.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChickenPotPi","name":"t1_cjemy4b","parent_id":"t1_cjeiem8","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406956425,"created_utc":1406952825}

{"body":"If you were looking for 10M units you wouldn't use 3D printing- you would just contract out for an injection molding run.  I'm not exactly sure what your point is here.  		Economies of scale always apply.  Even if it was with regards to 3d printing- lets say you were trying to build a part that could ONLY be built using a 3D print process, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak03wmi-3FE)- it could still benefit from economies of scale, it's just the scale might be a little higher.  Allow me to demonstrate with an approximate example:		1 piece: $50 ($50/pc)- $1 in materials, $9 in labor and $40 in 3D printer time.  		10 pieces: $490 ($49/pc)- $10 in materials, $80 in labor (because you're probably more efficient at doing a run of 10 than a run of 1), and $400 in 3D printer time.		100 pieces: $4600 ($46/pc)- $100 in materials, $800 in labor (same reason as before) and $3,700 in 3D printer time because you bought 2 extra printers so you've gained shop capacity in exchange for the funding advance.		1000 pieces: $42,000 ($42/pc) - $900 in materials (because now the plastic producer is giving you a discount), $8000 in labor, and $33,100 in 3D printing time (same reason as before, except now you have 20 printers at your disposal and can sell off time to other users to make additional profit, you pass on this savings to your customer).		10,000 pieces: $358,000 ($35.80/pc) - $8,000 in materials (because now you're fully into the EOS curve on the traditional plastic extrusion end of the business), $100,000 in labor because now you need additional people to assist in managing and putting together your array of 3D printers, and $250,000 in 3D printers.  The discount on printers comes from the fact that with an order of >100 extra 3D printers you now begin to see the EOS discounts on the *3D printer parts themselves* (after all, screws are screws and heating elements are heating elements) and the benefits from vertically integrating the 3D printer *manufacturing* into your own business (eg. it is cheaper to buy 3D printer kits than fully assembled printers).  		My point is- there will always be EOS because there will always be some low level component that needs manufacturing by conventional means.
