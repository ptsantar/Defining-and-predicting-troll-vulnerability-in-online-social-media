I would go so far as to say that the ending is much more ethically horrifying than White Bear.		SPOILERS BELOW HERE		The commercialization of dissent they show is both terrifyingly realistic and arresting. It's counterculture packaged for consumption and the implication is that you can never win against consumerism - the more effective your protest, the better a product it becomes.		And there's the boy who appears throughout it - who cries when the girl sings and who enjoys shopping for his avatar and who happily outfits his avatar with the glass shard at the end. It's easy to read him as not having authentic experiences, but I think it's more complicated than that. He really is having authentic experiences - the media is really having an emotional impact on him and it isn't entirely cheap bullshit like the guy watching porn and stupid gameshows, but he's nonetheless being shamelessly exploited. It's hard to know how to feel about him.		It's hard to know how to feel about a lot of it, which was what I liked so much.

{"body":"It's not recommended to sleep with anything in your ears, and while most people fall asleep with earphones in and suffer no effect, it can happen.		On a rare occasion I find that I have fallen asleep with hearing-aids in, and wake up the next morning with them still in. Because of the way they are moulded to the shape of your ear, they go deep down the canal, unlike most ear phones.		This causes two things to happen; it will get pressed harder into my sleep, and I am not allowing my ears to recover with air from a day of wearing them.  	This usually leads to pain and itchyness, and due to my requirement I don't usually have the choice to "go without" for a day to make-up for the night of sleeping with them in, and so it usually leads to further complication such as a minor ear infection or lasting irritation.		If you used these *only* in the circumstance that you described - working at the hospital when you need to wake up immediately to only the sound of pager - then you may not notice any of the effects I mentioned.		If you wear them all day long to block out certain sounds, then boost it at night to block out more ambient noises, you would likely start to suffer from the effects, some of which (ear infections) can lead to permanent and irreversible damage.		I'm just hugely concerned that without proper education on these devices, we'll see a sharp increase in the number of people suffering from hearing-loss.		Many people have "experienced" what it's like to be deaf by putting in ear plugs, or something similar.

Thus, to translate the spanish to a natural sounding english, it needs to wait until the whole phrase is done, and *then* say "red house".

Etymotic Research makes [ER20](http://www.etymotic.com/consumer/hearing-protection/er20.html) filters and they have a much flatter frequency response curve than the DUBS, meaning volume will be reduced more evenly across the frequency spectrum.

{"body":"What they intend to do is apply noise cancelling (in the same physical way it's applied in noise cancelling headphones and earbuds), selectively at the frequency range of a crying baby. This is the breakthrough - it's an intelligent, [I presume] responsive, equalisation curve. 		Normal noise cancellation works by taking the background sound that's arriving to the ear, and playing the opposite of that out of a loudspeaker, so that the wave gets cancelled out at the ear drum.		This isn't perfect (there are differences in speaker/microphone/eardrum positions, sound coming through your skull, around the earphone/bud, etc) so the cancellation can never be physically perfect, and so noise comes remains audible to an extent.		These guys are applying a filter to the loudspeaker signal so that only certain sounds get cancelled out at the eardrum (say, 1-5kHz).		The way to look at this device is: It's noise cancelling headphones that allow you to not necessarily turn down all of the elements of the background noise if you don't want to.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"f10101","name":"t1_csxq9il","parent_id":"t1_csxplg0","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1436472526,"created_utc":1436468926}

{"body":"So, the exact same technology as hearing aids? Only now marketed to normal-hearing people. I don't want to sound like a Luddite, but I think this is a horrible idea. This will likely be buried, but let me try to explain why...		The human auditory system is an exquisitely-tuned machine with enormous dynamic range, fantastic sensitivity, superb automatic gain control, incredible speed, and tremendous bandwidth. And you want to give people the ability to mess with that when there's nothing wrong? I'm sure there's *nothing* that can go wrong with that. 		Top of the line hearing aids can amplify sounds *maybe* up to 10 kHz. This is a limitation imposed not only by the acoustics but also processing speed. If you have normal hearing, that's going to leave out a wide range of frequencies that, while not necessary for basic speech understanding, nevertheless contribute greatly to overall sound quality. You would be shooting yourself in the foot if you listen to music with these. Hearing aids can somewhat get around this with complicated frequency-shifting algorithms, but this requires you to constantly wear the hearing aid to get the full benefit, so your brain can "relearn" how to make sense of the incoming sound. That's plasticity for you. Feel like wearing these earbuds for the rest of your life?		Now let's talk about noise. It's pretty much the number one complaint for hearing aid users, that it's difficult to hear in noisy environments. Part of this may be undiagnosed types of hearing loss that I don't want to get into; regardless, hearing aid companies do extensive R&D into sophisticated noise reduction algorithms, often involving directional microphone arrays. You think these cheap earbuds will be able to do that? Hell no. It looks like all you'll be able to do is extremely coarse equalization. Turning down the "highs" is not going get rid of the construction noise outside your window. And how about in a bar, when you want to filter out people talking in order to better hear other people talking? Your brain took years of development to be able to do this and now you want to screw with the input it normally gets.		Both of these arguments focused on frequency range aspect. I can make similar ones for timing, dynamic range, etc. "Bionic hearing" may be a heck of a lot closer than it was 50 years ago, but we're not there yet.

I can hear the tires well enough, but the bulk of the noise seems to be from the side mirror area - or the frame between the windshield and door window - i've tricked myself plenty of times thinking the window was open when it wasn't.		My going theory is that this is more related to hearing loss at certain freqs - in the same situation my wife can hear the radio well enough to hear the lyrics. She agrees there's road noise, but doesn't feel like she's doing extra work to hear the radio like I do. 		If I turn the radio up to where I can hear the lyrics, it's pretty loud, and then she's complaining. I don't generally think about myself as a person with hearing loss - pretty much just in this situation.		*googles his car and road noise*		I found a review that said "Wind and road noise are well muted on the highway"... yeah, not my experience with that car.

{"body":"> He has no fucking clue.		Sadly, Skintwo, whilst I'm generally incredibly sceptical of generalist doctors (see below), he may well be right. 		Absolutely, get a second opinion from a tinnitus specialist, but generally there really is little that can be done yet. 		There are promising technologies down the road, and in early trials, but literally, there is nothing proven. It's a neurological issue - a problem in the system of the delicate little hairs in your inner ear and the brain. So it can't be fixed directly nor acoustically, short of theoretically using stem cells to somehow regrow the hair cells.		**There are a few things that exacerbate it that you *can* look at:**		* Hydration, blood-pressure, and general health. 		The goal is to make sure the the healthy cells in your ears are working as well as possible.		Anyone who's been severely under the weather, drunk, or anyone who's almost passed out from standing up too quickly knows your ears start ringing. This is the blood rushing from your ears, either because the brain's pulling it from your extremities to keep your core functioning, or gravity's pulled it down. You can expect a similar small impact if your body's under general stress.		So, if you can, try get your life as healthy as you can achieve. I'd absolutely drop smoking (that's not going to help bloodflow), get as much exercise as possible, etc. 		It won't be a cure, but you may be able to get a few percent improvement doing this.		* Medications you're taking/have taken.		Tinnitus is a side effect of many drugs. Many extremely common drugs like acne antibiotics, and I believe, aspirin. [I wanted to strangle the doctor who tried to give me one of those antibiotics for acne I didn't have, AFTER I told her I was a sound engineer. I still can't believe someone can be so stupid and have people's live in their hands.] So have a look at the labels, and online, and see if it's mentioned.		Weed induces tinnitus in many people. It's temporary, but if you're a habitual smoker, perhaps it could be something to consider - maybe you haven't realised it's causing it. Some people say it eases it after an initial spike of making it worse. YMMV.		Then the usual things like caffeine or way too much alcohol. (Ease caffeine down gradually, obviously)		* Meditation.		There are some particular styles of meditation that a colleague of mine uses to deal with tinnitus. The goal is to effectively no longer notice, or at least, no longer care about the ringing. He found it a very effective approach, and works very happily as a sound engineer to this day, in spite of a very severe case of tinnitus. 		* General mental well-being		People suffering from stress and depression experience more tinnitus, statistically. This may well be down to the fact that people are more likely to dwell on the ringing: they can't distract themselves from it no matter how they try. So in this sense, treating the depression and stress can have a positive impact: The tinnitus itself might be at the same level, but it causes much less of a problem to the person.			**So coming back to OP's article**		Even if it won't cure things for you, could this be of benefit? 		Maaybe. *I would highly recommend you speak to an audiologist who specialises in tinnitus, and is up to date with all the modern research.*		If you were to boost the ambient sounds in your environment, the level of your tinnitus will drop. If you boost the background noise by 10dB, your tinnitus will be less noticeable by 10dB, if they both occur in the same frequency range. 		What you need to be careful of, however, is that you don't boost sound too much and cause further damage to your ears. This is where a specialist with cutting edge knowledge comes in. 			All the best, hope you find some improvement.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"f10101","name":"t1_csxozui","parent_id":"t1_csxl8me","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1436470573,"created_utc":1436466973}

Ok, I know, they added some special effects beyond making them user tunable hearing aids. Reverb, flanging, wow. Now we are really into the novelty stuff.
