{"body":"But to make gold look like proper rose gold, the amount of copper isn't insignificant - it affects the karat value, because that's a measurement of how much of the alloy is pure gold. It is misleading because if someone doesn't understand that and they're looking between a vendor selling "24K rose gold" and "18K rose gold", they're likely to pick the first over the latter despite the fact that the first option is literally not possible. Saying that "well, our 24K rose gold is made by mixing 24K gold with copper" is deliberately misleading because once the gold is mixed, it's not longer 24K. It's like saying that a mixture of water and 10% cyanide is "pure water" because it's made with pure water...mixed with cyanide. 		Edit because I can't stand when there are missing comments in the discussion, /u/domith88 originally said:		> Yeah, I guess I can see how it could be misleading but then I kinda use logic to figure it out. "24 karat gold with some cooper" by default its not 100% gold due to the fact that rose gold never is, which is what they are stating. They are still using 24 karat gold for the gold part if you choose that alone, not sure how its that misleading? If I was paying the cheapest price out there for a decent "rose gold" coating I would not really care about what percent etc as I am clearly going for bang for buck and my rose gold can never by pure gold by default so the 100% gold part is not what I am interested in, right?

{"body":"The last one is the most glaring in terms of reliability. I pulled this information from my universities database. APA format for you. Abstract from last one: 	    Objective To assess the accuracy, completeness, and referencing of medication information in Wikipedia compared with information found in the manufacturer's package insert.	 	    Methods Wikipedia articles for the 20 most frequently prescribed drugs per published lists of top 200 brand and generic drugs were evaluated. Four drug information residency-trained pharmacists independently assessed the articles for specific categories of information typically found in medication package inserts. Each category was evaluated for presence in the Wikipedia article, accuracy, completeness, and referencing (fully, partially, or none). Package inserts, Micromedex Drugdex Evaluations, Clinical Pharmacology, and Lexi-Comp databases were used to verify accuracy, and completeness was evaluated by comparing article contents to package inserts alone.	 	    Results Of the 20 categories of information assessed, a mean of twelve (range, 8???16) categories were present in each of the 20 Wikipedia articles. Categories most frequently absent were drug interactions and medication use in breastfeeding. No article contained all categories of information. Information on contraindications and precautions, drug absorption, and adverse drug events was most frequently found to be inaccurate; descriptions of off-label indications, contraindications and precautions, drug interactions, adverse drug events, and dosing were most frequently incomplete. Referencing was poor across all articles, with seven of the 20 articles not supported by any references.	 	    Conclusion Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information. Pharmacy faculty should actively recommend against our students' use of Wikipedia for medication information and urge them to consult more credible drug information resources.

I work gloves on and get text/calls from supervisors and employee's, so glancing at them without having to take off my gloves while working is awesome. I can see how important it is to get to my phone and respond, or send a voice text to reply back. 		I normally have my phone sound on max as well since there is a lot of times I don't hear it, but when I get in a quiet setting it can be really annoying. The watch vibration is enough for me to feel while the vibration and noise of the phone in my pocket is sometimes missed.		Those two are enough for me to justify it.

{"body":"That is a great way to put it.. Very interesting comment. Though the problem now is that large companies that have the branding strong enough to actually sell luxury products, like Apple, are avoiding US taxes and throwing all of their money in overseas bank accounts. Paying lower tax rates in other countries instead of paying taxes to the country in which they are based out of. I completely agree that money needs to be spent by the rich and placed back into circulation, but large companies like Apple avoiding US taxes and just sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars in an off-shore bank account isn't necessarily helping our economy out.. right?		I remember seeing a chart recently and Apple monetarily was the biggest offender of this. About 70% of their cash on hand is placed in off-shore bank accounts. Other companies like Google and Microsoft were closer to about 40-50%, but either way, Apple being the largest company in the US right now and having such a large percentage of their money in an offshore account, that's not helping money go back into US circulation all that well.

{"body":"The entire case???screen, battery, and so on???is the part that weighs 69g. The actual 18k outer shell is only a small portion of that weight.		The aluminum Apple Watch Sport case weighs 25g for the 38mm version and 30g for the 42mm version. The yellow gold Apple Watch Edition case weighs 55g for the 38mm version and 69g for the 42mm version.		The aluminum used in the Apple Watch Sport has a density of ~2.8g/cc. The 18k gold alloy Apple is using for the Apple Watch Edition has a density of ~16.5g/cc.		I'm assuming all other components are the same across models for the sake of calculation, even though the Sport model uses glass for its screen and the Edition model uses sapphire, and the bottom lens on the Sport is plastic while the Edition uses ceramic. Also, the internal mounting fixtures differ between the Sport and the mid-range stainless steel model, and I'd assume the Edition differs as well, so take this with a grain of salt???it's clearly going to produce a result that's off slightly.		Based on those assumptions, simple Algebra says the 38mm model's frame has a volume of 2.19 cubic centimeters and the 42mm model's frame has a volume of 2.85 cubic centimeters, therefore the 38mm model's frame contains 36g of 18k Gold and the 42mm model's frame contains 47g of 18k gold.		18k Gold costs $28.77/g at today's market prices. Therefore, the 38mm model contains $1035.72 of gold (for $10,000) and the 42mm model contains $1352.19 of gold (for $12,000).

But thats because there is quite litterally much less under the hood which allows for a bigger battery.
