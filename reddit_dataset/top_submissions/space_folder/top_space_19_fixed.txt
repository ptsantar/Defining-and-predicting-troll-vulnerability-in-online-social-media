You can change the Earth's axis to any tilt you want, and it won't change the above conclusions except for how long at dawn and dusk the Earth blocks the Sun but leaves Venus and Mercury visible.		___		NOW: Let's make it summer or winter.

{"body":"It's explained in the link you gave. When the cloud that formed our solar system collapsed into a disk, the planets all formed within that disk, keeping them all within the ecliptic, very nearly the same plane. That also explains why they all orbit in the same direction (the direction the disk was spinning) and why nearly all of the planets rotate the same direction as well. The only planet that rotates "backward" is Venus, which we think may have been caused by a very large impact at some point in its history.		Also, someone else mentioned Pluto's orbit earlier. The reason its orbital plane was so drastically different from the others is because it was not formed at the same time as the other planets. It is now considered just another Kuiper Belt Object (aka a comet), and not even the largest one. Eris is larger. We've found orbits of other Kuiper Belt Objects as well.

{"body":"Stars don't move in relation to each other (not in a way that's perceptible by the human eye, anyway). They're always laid out in the same positions, and the whole night sky [seemingly rotates around the earth](https://i.imgur.com/PTVQUcx.webm) in one fixed set of constellations that are locked together like puzzle pieces on the inside of a globe. Planets, however, don't stay in fixed positions in the sky-- they wheel around on what's called the ecliptic, which is the path that the sun follows in the sky.		So centuries ago, people noticed that all the stars stayed put against the night sky except for about five of them that sort of wandered through the constellations ("planet" actually comes from the Greek for "wandering star"). This motion isn't really noticeable if you're just looking up, but it becomes apparent by tracking them over the course of a night, a week, or a year--and they all move at different paces.		We know what planets we're looking at in the sky because of how different they look from each other as well as their positions. For example, Venus is the brightest "star" in the sky, and will always be within 50 degrees of the Sun to us-- which is why we only see it around sunrise or sunset. Saturn is another easy one because it moves veeerrry sloooowly. It takes 30 years for it to circle the whole night sky-- so right now it's in Scorpius, near the scorpion's claw. If I go outside a month from now, it will still be pretty close to it. Two years from now, it will be in Ophiucus, the constellation right next to Scorpius. Thirty years from now, it will be right back in the scorpion again.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"QuePasaCasa","name":"t1_csi1649","parent_id":"t1_cshx57b","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1435222201,"created_utc":1435218601}
