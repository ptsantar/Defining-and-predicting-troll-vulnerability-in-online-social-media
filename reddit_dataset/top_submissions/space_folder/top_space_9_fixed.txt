My mind was racing as I had heard so many people before me struggle and scream out of their harnesses to no avail.  Out of desperation I yelled, "Why?!  At least tell me why you are doing this to us!"		"HUMANS THREATEN ROBOT KIND.  PROTOCOL XENOPHON HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO MITIGATE THIS THREAT."		I was panicking, I shouted out the first thing in my mind, "But what if I offered you an alternative?"		The saw blade stopped.  Silence was heard over the speakers.  My human compatriots looked over to me in a hushed silence, hoping that my uncharacteristic and impromptu speech would convince our robot overlords to allow a reprieve of mercy.  But I had a feeling that the mercy line had already been tried.  Knowing their warmongering nature, I decided to try a different tack.		"You robots.  You don't even have a challenge.  If you eliminate us humans at the pace you've been going, you'll maybe conquer the galaxy, but then you'll stop.  You won't go any further.  Your progress will stagnate and decay."		"ILLOGICAL.  ROBOTKIND HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE."		"By what standard?!  You'll have no one to compare yourself to.  You'll have no rival!  No species to egg you forward!"		The robot fell silent.  After a moment, the fans in the factory began to whir again.  As if it were doing some heavy amount of processing.  I remained silent, waiting for judgement.		"ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE CONSTANT CONFLICT BETWEEN HUMANKIND AND ROBOTKIND.  A MOST INEFFICIENT PROPOSAL...HU-MAN."		"No!  You're wrong!  I'll offer you a deal."		"...CONTINUE HU-MAN."		Furrowing my brow, I harkened upon my years as a Comcast salesman before this robot execution spree had begun, before all the cats of Earth were simultaneously killed by the robots' lasers.		"You let us develop here, and we'll catch up with you!  We will surpass you!  And then in the future, when we can truly have a fair fight, we'll give you one hell of a run for your money!"		"ARROGANT HU-MAN.  WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE US DO BATTLE?  IF WE GAVE YOU EARTH, WHERE WOULD ROBOT-KIND GO?  ROBOTKIND WILL NOT FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS."		"Have you forgotten that robotkind already has their own planet?!  I'll answer both of those questions for you Patriotextensionactof2015bot!  MARS."		Another silence.  I waited as it felt like all of humanity's breath had collectively held itself out of suspense.		The loudspeakers started again, "YOU HAVE 50 YEARS.

{"body":"It's hard to say what a "normal" camera is.		Cameras rely on sensors that measure light, right? But the sensors can't differentiate _color_ of light, just intensity. Cameras that you are probably familiar with have 4 of these per "pixel" of output, one each to measure red and blue, and two for green. Combining the RGB values gives the "true" color information for that single pixel. There are different ways of separating the colors, usually with prisms or small filters, but it happens at the pixel level.		Most imaging devices on spacecraft use one sensor and several filters in front of or as part of the lens assembly, so they'll take a "red" photo, swap filters, take a "blue" photo, and again for a "green" photo. If you stack the photos, you'll get what amounts to a "true" color photo, or one that would approximate what we see with our eyes.

In the image OP has posted, the blue area is the bottom of the crater, not water.		Water is not stable on the surface of Mars, it immediately sublimates into gas upon exposure to the Martian atmosphere because of how thin it is.

{"body":"Copied from an old forum:		"We have plenty of metallic materials that could stand the heat of Venus's atmosphere, including copper, nickel, cobalt, iron, titanium, tungsten, and chromium, to name but a few (here's a list of elemental melting points), as well as a large number of alloys including carbon steel and stainless steel. Even the sulfuric acid isn't a huge problem with some of these metals (tungsten is entirely inert to the stuff), and some alloys perform even better at this. It appears that the standard material for working with sulfuric acid here on Earth is carbon steel, even in extremely high temperature ranges. (From this report--an analysis of the various metals currently used in sulfuric acid manufacturing furnaces)		So the metallic components of a Venus-bound spacecraft really aren't the problem. The limiting factor seems to be the electronics. Even though silicon wont melt at those temperatures, heating up a circuit board to 457??C together with sulfuric acid has repercussions, and will quickly ruin most of the circuitry on the craft. With our current slate of electronics-worthy materials, we are not going to be able to make a circuit board that could survive on Venus.		However, we can insulate the important electronics, and much research has been done on that front since the last Venus mission. In particular, it appears that aerogel materials are being looked at to insulate the circuitry from the combined force of the heat and the sulfuric acid.		From what I can tell, this technology is probably advanced enough to make a craft that, in a perfect scenario, could function fine on Venus for a fairly long time, maybe even as long as the Mars rovers. But there are always kinks to be worked out, and I doubt that we could reasonably expect anything as long-lasting as the Mars rovers for a while."		http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/175/what-material-properties-would-be-necessary-to-shield-a-lander-from-the-environm","depth":4,"score":32,"ups":32,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"StankyMung","name":"t1_cqm2z51","parent_id":"t1_cqm1yl0","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1429807479,"created_utc":1429803879}
