{"body":"Sun Shines in High-Energy X-rays		X-rays stream off the sun in this image showing observations from by NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, overlaid on a picture taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This is the first picture of the sun taken by NuSTAR. The field of view covers the west limb of the sun.		The NuSTAR data, seen in green and blue, reveal solar high-energy emission (green shows energies between 2 and 3 kiloelectron volts, and blue shows energies between 3 and 5 kiloelectron volts). The high-energy X-rays come from gas heated to above 3 million degrees.		The red channel represents ultraviolet light captured by SDO at wavelengths of 171 angstroms, and shows the presence of lower-temperature material in the solar atmosphere at 1 million degrees.		This image shows that some of the hotter emission tracked by NuSTAR is coming from different locations in the active regions and the coronal loops than the cooler emission shown in the SDO image.

{"body":"Okay, so let's say I have a digital camera that has arrays of 3 differently tuned photon receptors and I take a photo in fairly dimly lit room with no flash. If you look at the photo later you will be able to pick out objects in the room most likely, a chair in one corner, a coffee table in the middle, but much of the detail, and many objects hiding in shadows, will be impossible to spot.		Now take the same photo with a camera that has 2 different photon receptors. Since your second camera has only 2 receptors in each array it will be able to fit more arrays in the same space when compared to your 3 receptor camera. This increase in density will lead to a photo that appears brighter when observed later, showing things that you couldn't pick out in the 3 color version. However since you only had 2 receptors you will lose information relating to the wavelength of the light and that translates (when seen by the human eye) to a loss of color making the photo look extremely washed out or wrong somehow tricking you into thinking objects in the room are the same color when in the original photo you can plainly see that the curtains are blue and the couch was green for example. This trade off is the same that a dichromatic and trichromatic eye makes. The dichromatic eye can fit more "arrays" in the eye and can therefore pick up more photons from the same scene that a trichromatic eye looks at. The trade off is of course they have less wavelength information (what we call color) in order to boost the brightness of the image.		Now back in the day the original shrew like proto mammal that we all evolved from was nocturnal and like many nocturnal animals it lost the ability to see a wide variety of color in exchange for low light acuity. This is why most mammals today (like dogs, cats, horses, etc) have dichromatic vision. There simply has not been enough pressure on them since they became diurnal for them to select for a wider spectrum of vision. Primates, on the other hand, perhaps due to their need to select ripe fruit over unripe fruit, evolved a third color receptor when one of our ancestors had a mutation that led them having two slightly different versions of the same receptor. This slight ability to barely see a third color was selected for heavily and the receptor became more and more distinguishable from the original, eventually leading to the three color system we have today! So that's why we can see three colors while most mammals cannot.		Birds on the other hand evolved from dinosaurs and they evolved from a diurnal one at that so they never lost their ability to see color and never had to re-evolve the ability. This means they have hundreds of million years of evolution selecting for better and better daylight vision over us mammals and as a result the lowly chicken has 5 different color receptors in it's eyes, as well as the ability to see magnetic field lines thanks to tiny magnetic sensitive cells in their eyes.		And instead of thinking that more receptors leads to a wider spectrum (although it can) also consider that instead perhaps more receptors leads to a finer level of differentiation in the same spectrum. Just like how a color blind man (dichromatic) wont understand why green and blue look totally different to the rest of us we can't understand how two different orange objects might look totally different to a bird.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"boredatworkbasically","name":"t1_cn3gvrm","parent_id":"t1_cn38ups","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1419360069,"created_utc":1419360069}

{"body":"Nothing is 100% proven. We can't even 100% prove that we are not all characters of some very complex video game. Science is not about 100% proving anything, it is about getting as close to 100% as possible. 		For instance, science might say that no human can ever be green. For thousands of years, no humans have ever been green out of the billions of humans. For every person born that is not green, the theory of no green humans grow stronger. However ONE DAY it is possible that a green human might be born, disproving the green human theory. That a theory can be proven wrong, that is, it is _falsifiable_ is one of the requirements for a solid scientific theory. If it can not possibly be disproven in any scenario, it is not science.		This is actually one of the main differences between superstition and science. For instance, a no green human _religion_ might also say that a green human can never exist. It is written in the holy book of the no green human religion that it is impossible, so it can never be. If one day a green human would be born, religious scholars would come up with a reason for why this human was not actually green, or how the holy book meant a different type of green or some other sort of  nonsense.		But black holes are not science fiction. They are observable. Note that they are not actually "holes", that's just what they look like. As no light can escape a black hole, a black hole is effectively invisible. Even so, when you look at a black hole it should be fairly obvious that it's there because of the absence of something to see. The purest black in the entire universe, that is a black hole. 		In a way they are not proven. We can detect that certain points of the universe, like the center of our galaxy, has super strong gravity. Hypothetically, this COULD be advanced aliens using a powerful gravity generating machines, but.. Yeah black hole is the most reasonable explanation that anyone has thought of.		Also: No, you shouldn't be scared of them. Even though their gravity is incredibly strong, it has little effect on objects far away. Gravity "grows stronger" the closer you get to the source.
