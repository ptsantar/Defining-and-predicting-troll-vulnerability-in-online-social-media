{"body":"Great question :) for one,  when you watch movies try and pay attention to the lighting. These are questions I ask myself when watching a movie: Where is the light source coming from? How large is the light source? Hard or soft light? How does this lighting affect this scene?		Now the 'size'  of the light can be Confusing . Would you say the sun is a small light or a large one? Well even though the sun is enormous, it's so far away that the light is small. Meaning it gives off a very hard light with parallel beams. 		Adversely the moon is a much larger light, those being much softer and more refractive beams of light. 			Then on the other side. When not watching a movie pay attention to the lighting on faces and buildings. If it's asteticslly pleasing then find the light source and make a mental note,  after years of doing this you will have a storage bank of different lighting that will just be apparent to you 24/7.  			I can watch a movie with the sound off and be a happy camper.  Light is beautiful and complex and can take a life time to master. 		The common saying in the industry is that cinematography is painting with light,  so you can imagine how in depth you can go. 		Sorry if this is all over the place.

{"body":"The 'supersonic control inversion' specifically with grid fins, is a big problem. Grid Fins work fantastically in the subsonic regime. They work well in the supersonic regime. But in the transonic regime they have a big problem: when shockwaves form on the finlets, the shockwaves are between the fins. As the velocity increases towards supersonic, those shockwaves intersect with the finlets. At this point, air is no longer flowing through the grid fins; the fins instead act as flat surfaces. If you had the fin angled to exert force one way, when you reach the speed of sound the fin will suddenly be deflecting air to the opposite direction. Control inversion.		SpaceX seem to have solved this by not using the fins as control surfaces during the transonic regime, but using them as airbrakes. i.e. deploy the fins in supersonic flight to use as control surfaces -> rotate and lock fins in 'flat' orientation when passing through the transonic region (having them act as big airbrakes to decelerate through transonic faster) with the cold-gas (Nitrogen) thrusters providing some degree of control -> unlock fins for control in the subsonic regime for final landing approach.","depth":2,"score":64,"ups":64,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"redmercuryvendor","name":"t1_cp7i88d","parent_id":"t1_cp7fkcr","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425759178,"created_utc":1425759178}

{"body":"Having the grid fins deployed lowers the terminal velocity. Terminal velocity is determined by the object's drag and the local atmospheric pressure, it is not a fixed number. Pressure in the upper atmosphere is very low, so terminal velocity there is still very high. While the rocket will slow to local terminal velocity, that's still very fast, hence the requirement for the supersonic retro-burn as the stage continues to fall and ends up above terminal velocity once again. The wait until the first crossing the terminal velocity  for the supersonic retro burn is that up until that point, aerodynamic forces are slowing the rocket (i.e. it's 'free' braking). But once that intersection of velocity, altitude (and hence pressure) and local terminal velocity is crossed, the aerodynamic forces are no longer able to perform a useful degree of deceleration (i.e. the local terminal velocity lowers faster than the first stage's *actual* velocity) so that;s where it;s most efficient to start the supersonic retro burn.		The supersonic retro-burn is necessary because aerodynamic forces alone are too small to decelerate the rocket enough for landing. Carrying a parachute, ballute or paracone needed to increase the aerodynamic braking force sufficient to slow the first stage enough would weigh a lot more than carrying the extra fuel.","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"redmercuryvendor","name":"t1_cp7mn9s","parent_id":"t1_cp7jo51","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425768499,"created_utc":1425768499}

But that's a big problem because A. the Falcon 9 is very very bottom heavy (engines, turbopumps, etc. at the bottom and empty tanks on the top), so it's going to be difficult do make it do anything other than fall bottom-first. The best you could do is angle it slightly away from this, but doing that by moving the CG is going to be very difficult. Along the long-axis, the rocket is symmetrical, so moving that CG off-set is going to require adding a big chunk of mass, which is bad for obvious reasons. And it's not going to give you that much control anyway, unless you really get the rocket quite sideways, which is going to take a ton of ballast to accomplish and then it introduces a new problem that when you land you need to get the rocket back to vertical again anyway. 		It really just doesn't make any sense for an object this size/shape, especially if you're thinking about it after it's been designed. Maybe if this was your chosen control method from the very beginning and then you wouldn't be adding useless ballast mass, but instead just designed it to be shaped in a way to give it that mass distribution. But if you were doing that you'd probably go for a lifting body shape and have it land like a plane. 		Capsules use offset CG because adding wings that can withstand re-entry speeds is really hard to do. Offset CG is a solution that adds no mass or new systems and gives you a good amount of control if you have a blunt shaped object (but not exactly fine control useful for landing, moreso in controlling your re-entry corridor). Falcon 9s aren't coming back down from anywhere near orbital velocity, so adding some small fins is not difficult, they don't need to hold up to 17,000 mph re-entry, just a few thousand mph, and they don't add much mass at all and can give pretty fine control that can help you all the way to landing.","depth":4,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jeffp12","name":"t1_cp7h7ym","parent_id":"t1_cp7gydv","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425757141,"created_utc":1425757141}

In Apollo footage you can see the CM rolling during re-entry. 		The shuttle used its wings and control surfaces to very finely control re-entry. Since they have so much control they can re-enter much gradually. Apollo re-entry had a little bit of control but they would still be hitting 6+ Gs during re-entry.

The Dream Chaser spaceplane will have the same capability and its one of its selling points as opposed to CST-100 and Dragon, that it has a much less intense re-entry just 1.5-2 Gs at the most, which is nice for people coming back from months in zero-g, as opposed to capsules that suddenly subject the occupants to 6 gs or more.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jeffp12","name":"t1_cp8cghm","parent_id":"t1_cp7zgrr","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425844764,"created_utc":1425841164}

Offset-CG is a good idea for capsules because you can easily move the CG around without much trouble, and fins/wings aren't a great idea for orbital re-entry. You can do it, but you're adding mass and complexity. Off-set CG gives you control without the need for additional mass or systems. But on a rocket, off-set CG is going to require a lot of additional mass, way more than adding fins.

If you wanted, you could calculate the two options by making a ratio of the additional mass it requires per "unit of aerodynamic control" you achieve.

{"body":"Serious reply - using aerodynamic control surfaces at supersonic speeds is very tricky. 	 	Control surfaces create forces by changing their angle of attack, which changes the air pressure distribution over the surface and results in a lift force in the desired direction.	 	At supersonic speeds, shockwaves form and move across the control surfaces - these shocks create huge pressure changes and can reduce the effectiveness of the control surface to the point where a control input has the opposite of the desired effect (ie pushing left on the stick makes the craft roll right). This is called control reversal and is very dangerous.		Carmack is suggesting that SpaceX should use small nitrogen thrusters only to control Falcon during descent, because their control effectiveness isn't affected by supersonic speeds. Musk says that thrusters aren't enough for precision control at Falcon's reentry speed.	 	Carmack then suggests adjusting the rocket's Center of Gravity or using small control surfaces called [trim tabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_tab) to control during descent, but Musk again disagrees.	 	**TL;DR** Using large movable control surfaces at supersonic speeds presents challenges because of shockwaves.

{"body":"For those interested in a translation from an aerospace engineer (*translation/commentary in italics*):		EM: Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. *What you're looking at is called a grid fin. It's only used during reentry, the rest of the time it's folded against the rocket body and out of the way. When they deploy the four fins create a kind of "X" shape. I like star wars.* Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll. *Each fin is controlled separately, meaning depending on the way they are used together, we can impart pitching forces, yawing forces, or rolling forces on the vehicle.*		JC: Good luck. *If it doesn't work I get to say "I told you so".* We had supersonic control inversion issues with actuated fins, went back to little thrusters that worked at all speeds. *We tried that. They only work in certain speed ranges, and sometimes when you go from one speed regime to another (aka slowing down) the control forces imparted by the fins will reverse (aka invert, aka control engineer's nightmare)! We decided to stick with thrusters because they always push in the direction you tell them too, no matter the speed! Also our control engineers said they'd quit otherwise.*		EM: No choice. *We thought of that. I don't take threats from my engineers.* Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. *We're going so fast when we come in that little thrusters with nitrogen (N2) propellant aren't strong enough (or we don't want to carry all the nitrogen propellant we would need).* Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim. *Aerodynamic surfaces (aka fins) don't cost fuel. We need a lot of force to control the pitch of the rocket (which way it's pointing) when it's coming back in. Using thrusters instead would cost us way too much mass in fuel and big thrusters, and break the design (aka MUST use something else).*		JC: I don't disagree, but I'm concerned. *Trying to be polite.* Maybe offset CG or static trim tab for a touch of body lift, then roll it? *Getting technical. What if you tried this: Tweak where your center of gravity (CG) is (by shifting around where heavy stuff is inside the rocket aka ballast mass), as well as the aerodynamics of your body by itself (static trim), until the rocket generates a small amount of lift by itself (meaning as it's falling back to earth air passing around it will tend to push it in one direction aka "lift" [<- in quotes because it's not so much up as sideways in this case]), then roll it (pitch is hard to control, but roll is easy, so then you just roll the vehicle until the "lift" is in the direction you want).*		EM: That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon. *Not a bad idea, that's how it's done with basically all entry vehicles (think Apollo, Orion, Mars landers, Dragon), but it's hard to generate enough lift force using a falling tube.*		Really a lot going on here.

{"body":"Translation:		The actuated fins are independent control surfaces for maneuvering the vehicle on re-entry and hypersonic speeds. Actuated fins means that they are mechanically controlled (typically through electrohyrdrostatic actuators or electromechanical actuators). This contrasts with reaction control, which is the use of smaller rockets or gas discharges to control the body through momentum transfer.		The downside of reaction control thrusters is that you need a lot of fuel to be effective. However, the downside of actuated control surfaces is that at high speeds, you can encounter a phenomenon known as "control reversal." In essence, the compressibility of air causes the reverse of what you want -- you pull back on the stick to pull up, and you nose down instead. In the early days of jet-powered flight (and some claim in WWII with powerful prop-driven aircraft such as the P-38 and P-47 in dives), this was a frequent problem.		Control reversal is when the control surface changes the structural profile such that the shock profile is changed. This can lead to flow separation, which causes the reversal of control. Modern fighter jets combat this by having all-moving tails. Since the whole tail moves, the profile of the tail never changes, so the shock caused by the leading edge of the tail doesn't get altered enough to cause the reversal. There are other issues, but we'll leave those for tomorrow's lecture.		Carmack's other idea is to modify the intertial properties of the vehicle on re-entry to get a different attitude on approach. This might in principle reduce the control requirements, e.g. instead of coming in like a brick, come in like the space shuttle. But Musk claims that the size of the vehicle makes that prohibitive. In short, the long body of the Falcon magnifies the effect of offset centers of gravity. For example: grab a one-foot long piece of lumber. It's pretty easy to hold even if you don't hold it at the center. Now, grab a twelve-foot long piece of lumber. It's much more difficult to carry even if you're grip is only a few inches away from the center.		Since these four fins each have (at least) three-degrees of freedom and move independently, you effectively have twelve-degrees of control authority, which will help in ensuring that the vehicle enters a suitable state for landing.","depth":0,"score":96,"ups":96,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"the5thLight","name":"t1_cp7g6o3","parent_id":"t3_2y97aj","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425755066,"created_utc":1425755066}

{"body":"For those interested in a translation from an aerospace engineer (translation/commentary in italics):		EM: Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. What you're looking at is called a grid fin. It's only used during reentry, the rest of the time it's folded against the rocket body and out of the way. When they deploy the four fins create a kind of "X" shape. I like star wars. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll. Each fin is controlled separately, meaning depending on the way they are used together, we can impart pitching forces, yawing forces, or rolling forces on the vehicle.		JC: Good luck. If it doesn't work I get to say "I told you so". We had supersonic control inversion issues with actuated fins, went back to little thrusters that worked at all speeds. We tried that. They only work in certain speed ranges, and sometimes when you go from one speed regime to another (aka slowing down) the control forces imparted by the fins will reverse (aka invert, aka control engineer's nightmare)! We decided to stick with thrusters because they always push in the direction you tell them too, no matter the speed! Also our control engineers said they'd quit otherwise.		EM: No choice. We thought of that. I don't take threats from my engineers. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. We're going so fast when we come in that little thrusters with nitrogen (N2) propellant aren't strong enough (or we don't want to carry all the nitrogen propellant we would need). Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim. Aerodynamic surfaces (aka fins) don't cost fuel. We need a lot of force to control the pitch of the rocket (which way it's pointing) when it's coming back in. Using thrusters instead would cost us way too much mass in fuel and big thrusters, and break the design (aka MUST use something else).		JC: I don't disagree, but I'm concerned. Trying to be polite. Maybe offset CG or static trim tab for a touch of body lift, then roll it? Getting technical. What if you tried this: Tweak where your center of gravity (CG) is (by shifting around where heavy stuff is inside the rocket aka ballast mass), as well as the aerodynamics of your body by itself (static trim), until the rocket generates a small amount of lift by itself (meaning as it's falling back to earth air passing around it will tend to push it in one direction aka "lift" [<- in quotes because it's not so much up as sideways in this case]), then roll it (pitch is hard to control, but roll is easy, so then you just roll the vehicle until the "lift" is in the direction you want).		EM: That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon. Not a bad idea, that's how it's done with basically all entry vehicles (think Apollo, Orion, Mars landers, Dragon), but it's hard to generate enough lift force using a falling tube.		Really a lot going on here.
