{"body":"As Venus moves through its evening apparition, it will pair up with the moon after sunset every month, as the moon moves from new toward first quarter.  You would see it as a pretty young crescent moon with a very bright "star" next to it, maybe very close, maybe separated somewhat.  When they're close you can occasionally fit Venus and the moon in the same field of view in the telescope.  During the last appearance of the pair before Venus's inferior conjunction (when it passes between us and the Sun, and moves back into the morning sky), if you're lucky and get both in the same field of view, the crescent phase shown by both objects will be exactly the same.  The moon will appear to be about 30 times the diameter of Venus at that time, but their crescents will be just the same.  I will put Venus in the center of the field of view, with the moon just out of view.  People will say they see the moon.  Then, when I nudge the scope to show both together, the usual reaction is "OOOOOOOH".  This is especially fun to do with kids.  While we're here, consider that Venus is about the same size as the Earth, ~8,000 miles in diameter.  The moon is about 1/4 the Earth's diameter, or ~2,000 miles.  The moon is about 1/4 million miles away.  To see Venus 1/30 the moon's size, it must be about 120 times farther away than the moon, or about 30 million miles.		The last week, after sunset, has provided a pretty and evocative view--Venus is very bright in the southwest.  Mercury was to its lower right, but has now dropped down into the Sun's glare.  At 6 pm or so, Mars is above Venus about the same amount as Venus is toward the horizon.  Drawing a line from Mars to Venus down to the horizon is a rough pointer toward the Sun, about the same distance below the horizon.  The moon has been rising each night, moving farther from Venus and Mars.  Now then, if you draw that line between Mars and Venus away from the Sun, across the sky to the moon and beyond, well, you just defined the approximate plane of the ecliptic, the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, and pretty much the plane of the other planets as well.  The moon's orbital plane is tilted about 5 degrees from that, but it's still close.  If you consider where the sun set on the horizon, up through Venus, Mars, the moon, and just a bit later Jupiter, rising in the east northeast, you'll see the zodiacal constellations, from Capricorn or Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus high up (look for the bright red star Aldebaran, as well as the Hyades and Pleiades clusters), then Gemini, Cancer, and Leo rising in the east, with Jupiter presently residing in Leo.  That's our solar system.  Oh, Saturn is presently in Scorpius, in the southeast before sunrise.		Now then, if you face south and take all this in, the constellation Aries is just to Taurus's west, nearly overhead.  Look at the place between Venus and Mars, on the line between them, then follow that line up toward Aries, and imagine it curving down straight toward you.  That line passes through you, and into the ground just behind you.  That is YOU, riding along on Earth as it orbits the Sun.  You're moving in the direction directly behind you, and down through the Earth toward the far side.  All the while the Earth is slowly spinning from east to west, on our daily rotation around the Earth's axis.  If you stand so at midnight, the direction you're going as Earth orbits the sun is toward the eastern horizon.  At sunrise, as you ride the Earth, you're moving up, toward the ecliptic plane.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"darrellbear","name":"t1_co7bdb9","parent_id":"t1_co6zuro","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1422756589,"created_utc":1422756589}

I'm assuming it's a webcam image, but still that's a ton of light you picked up on the moons. The shot of Jupiter is outstanding even given that it's being washed out from the moon.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HotBondi","name":"t1_co727f9","parent_id":"t3_2ubck8","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1422738291,"created_utc":1422738291}
