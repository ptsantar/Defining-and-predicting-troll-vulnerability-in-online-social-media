The sand itself would be composed of extremely fine powder of iron oxides - rust, which if I'm not mistaken should more cake-up components than erode them over relatively short periods of time.

We know that it is not because he lacks empathy, as he goes to great lengths to save eve and the humans.

Further extrapolating and speculating, maybe the die-off of his species gave rise to his sentience; without the hive mind of robots, he was trapped in his own limited mind and needed to modify his coding to cope and adapt.

The space race officially started on Oct 4, 1957, when Sputnik was launched. On Oct 5, the fires had been lit, and the game was on. Nobody seriously talked about going to the Moon until several years later.		There was no SINGLE space race. The drive to get a person to the Moon first was a big one, yes. It was purely a dick-waving contest between the US and Russia. One early contingency plan the US considered was to detonate an H-bomb on the Moon if we couldn't get people there before the Rooskies, to "mark our territory."		However, going on at the same time was the race to improve rocketry for military purposes, specifically for lobbing nuclear death halfway around the world, and this is the space race that paid a LOT of the bills. This space race was all about who could dominate the world by missiles or orbital weapons.		And as a sideshow to all this, countries were figuring out the value of putting commercial and scientific satellites in orbit.		>There is tremendous research being done every day on the ISS that has major impacts on daily life, 		Oh my no. They produce science by the thimbleful. And given the fact that it is the most expensive human construction in history ($150 billion to date), that has come at a *seriously* bad price. If we had spent that much money on unmanned missions, we could have had an armada of probes and rovers out in the solar system by now, and a fleet of scientific satellites in LEO.		>and it's stuff robots simply couldn't do.		Horseshit. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a single significant bit of science they've done that couldn't have been done MUCH cheaper with an unmanned mission.

The rover is actually driving backwards because the "wheels" were getting punctured by the rocks.  They found out that driving backwards was better for it.  Basically they have this huge robotic arm that is driving in a circle going over different types of rocks to see what is causing the damage.
