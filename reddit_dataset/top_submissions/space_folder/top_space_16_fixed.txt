That does make it seem smaller to me. The comment I responded to claimed that someone who traveled 1000 miles would look on the globe and despair. 		I think if you ran/walked 1000 miles(or 6000 miles doesn't really matter) you would would look around with a sense of accomplishment because you just ran a respectable distance around the planet. 6000 miles isn't "nothing" compared to 25,000 in any sense. It's nearly 1/4 of it. Imagine if your salary was cut by 1/4 that would impact you immensely. It is not "nothing". Running/walking that far is impressive and is something that would be celebrated not looked upon in "despair".		Besides that, Earth is huge but it is not as huge as some make it out to be. You can take a plane to the other side in 12 hours, planes have circumnavigated the globe without refueling, one team sailed around the world in 45 days, and some have even circumnavigated the globe in a balloon, **a balloon!** Sure the Earth is huge and it is a monumental feat to walk or run it. But it can and has been done. Our technology has made the Earth much, much smaller and has opened our perspective to just how small the Earth is. I mean look at the OP! That's the entire Earth! That's all there is!		It really just depends on your perspective. If you compare the Earth to humans, the Earth is huge. If you compare it to how fast you can move around the surface of the Earth, it is small.
