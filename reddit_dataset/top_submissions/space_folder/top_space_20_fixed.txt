{"body":"Have you seen total darkness? No, you have only seen shadows. You cannot imagine it, you cannot perceive it. There are stories from our distant past, from our long gone parents, of the things out there that lurk in the depths of the outer worlds, in places that light has never touched.		There is one such place out there, a moon. It is not very far. It sits under the permanent shadow of a gas giant, hiding its secrets.		Those days people still had the urge to explore, to discover, to search the deepest valleys and to climb the highest mountains. It was during those days that a team of four landed on that moon. Once there, they did what they set out to do, explored.		They dove deep into the black oceans. There are records of this. They swam inside their air bubbles kilometers below the surface. They found life, as expected, and they documented it. Hundreds of different species were identified in a week. One of the divers described them as "ghosts swimming aimlessly in an empty ecosystem". They called them ghosts because, having evolved without light, their bodies never developed pigment and most were white or transparent, and when shined upon with a torch their insides would glow, revealing the inner workings of each.		What was odd was they couldn't identify a food chain. The big ones didn't eat the small ones, and the small ones didn't feed off of any plants or matter of any kind. They couldn't figure out how they nourished their translucent bodies, and, in an attempt to figure out the mystery, they dove deeper still.		Into the darkness they descended, armed with torches and flashlights. Into the depths of the black oceans they were lured, talking of science and greatness. For days they travelled into it, floating in emptiness, and for days they ceased to see life. Into the shadows of the shadows, not even the ghosts ventured to swim.		It is recorded that on the fifth day they stopped. They recorded something 800 kilometers below the surface of that moon. They laughed and talked inside their bubbles with joy. They thought they had finally found the source of the nutrients. And as they moved in to examine the swaying thing they realized what they were looking at: It was a suit. A spacesuit of the old times. Inside it there was a screaming man. Screaming not with joy, not with surprise, not with fear. It was a man screaming because his mind had wandered off. It was the screaming of a body begging for its mind to come back, begging for sanity, and as the team approached him they didn't realize that the mindless man had been deliberately placed in their path.		When one of them dared to touch him a thousand lights shone up to them from the depths. It always has been silly to think that us humans are the only intelligent species. It seemed so improbable back then, to encounter another intelligence. Most missions never had a plan for it, and this specific mission wasn't the exception.		Four people went down into the deep seas of the black moon, one came back. When their ship failed to return a search party was sent to investigate. They found him on the shore, still in his air bubble, his limbs flailing, blood trickling down his throat as his vocal cords were ripped open after having screamed for who knows how long. He had scratched his ears off and most of the hair on his head. His jaw was locked open and it is said that the wailing that came from within him haunted the dreams of the rescuers for years.		The man was taken to a mental hospital, but he never spoke again. It is said that the man was released and he lived the rest of his life in a facility by the beach. Every night he went out to the shore and looked towards the sea, perhaps hoping that his friends would emerge from its insides, and when the tide went up and the water touched his feet he would scream. He would scream until the sun came up.","depth":3,"score":1406,"ups":1406,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Writes_Sci_Fi","name":"t1_cpcjbk4","parent_id":"t1_cpchzc0","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1426173275,"created_utc":1426169675}

Remember that artists before the 15th century (early renaissance if I can recall my art history) didn't even understand the concept of perspective (foreshortening), which is why most classic art looks very flat (cave paintings, japanese woodblock cuts, ancient egyptian art).		Here's a bar trick I always use to illustrate:		I bet that the circumference of the rim glass/cup is longer than the height of said glass/cup (works especially well for champagne glasses).  When judging the glass, we clearly see that the height is bigger than the width of the rim (http://i.imgur.com/rHCi7GH.png).  When it comes to circumference, most people (hopefully) imagine it must be bigger than the width...maybe even two times as big.  But most people don't think that it could be more than 3 times the width (specifically pi times the width).  For the punchline, I simply measure with the edge of a napkin that has been wrapped around the glass and then extend it out next to the glass.

It seems like any sentient species that evolved and developed in extreme pressure environments, such as seas under ice, would have a much more difficult time eventually reaching or inhabiting space. The surface they launch from is as hostile an environment to them as the vacuum of space. Imagine if our space programs had to launch from an environment as difficult for us as the bottom of the Marianas trench.		Additionally, not having eyes would cause them considerable difficulty when it's one of the most important senses in space or over great distances. I guess they could develop some type of technology to convert electromagnetic waves into a medium that is decipherable by whatever their primary senses are but still - imagine having a culture develop between a giant rock and a giant sheet of ice that never had the opportunity to stare up into the stars and wonder, a culture that even if they do eventually breach that gigantic ice layer and reach the surface simply isn't equipped to gaze into the  sky above to see that there's more out there.

If you cooled any of it to 0??C it would still freeze, but just float to the surface immediately after.		> In space, there is no pressure so things freeze quickly. 		Also backwards. Liquids won't freeze in space because the low pressure raises its freezing point. What they will do is evaporate (almost instantly). Evaporation is an extremely endothermic reaction, which cools the liquid to to its freezing point (still at 0??C if its water) which turns it into snow (basically). So the most noticeable thing about a moon sized sphere of water is that its surface would explode (extremely massively) and as its surface evaporated the inner layers would no longer be compressed by the water above, and also explode.

If pulled off of the Earth, it would NOT freeze.  Depending on the volume (and this is a challenging planetary science problem that I'm not about to solve), it would either be able to hold onto enough of an atmosphere to protect itself from boiling away in vacuum or just boil away in vacuum.  Over time, most of the hydrogen would eventually be lost to space from ionization of the solar wind.  I don't know what would happen to the oxygen.  Actually answering that question depends on a) the surface gravity, and b) the maxwell velocity distribution of the gases in the atmosphere.  If a macroscopic amount (think, 1e-6 or higher) of the gas is above escape velocity at any given time, it will be lost.  If not, it will be a stable atmosphere.  This is why Mars has mostly CO2 in the atmosphere, since it's a stable and heavy molecule.		With the volumes under consideration, I doubt there would be enough gravity to form a significant atmosphere and it would all boil away pretty quickly - think a few hundred to thousand years.

They could be intelligent and could possibly have a language and a society, but it would probably be limited to a neolithic level of technology by the environment.     Even if they could break a hole through the ice in a thin spot, they would lack the technology to create the kind of artificial environment needed to escape  from it.		I would think that would be maddening for them as a species.  You're essentially trapped in a Catch 22 bubble.  You can't leave because you're enclosed on all sides by ice.  Being underwater prevents you from developing the technology necessary to leave the bubble even if you were intelligent enough to be able to create such technology.		Some poor Europan Merman would spend his life chipping away at the great ice ceiling of the world, wondering what is beyond, hoping to escape the confines of his reality only to discover a near vacuum on the other side, with no water to swim in.  		If you survived breaking through the ice and weren't sucked out or washed away or something like that you'd come back to your fellow Europans and break the news to them that nothing lies beyond the great ice dome but death.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"factoid_","name":"t1_cpcjolv","parent_id":"t1_cpcfxp8","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1426173982,"created_utc":1426170382}

{"body":"Mars is much closer and easier to access than Europa, and there is mounting evidence that it was for a period of its history remarkably Earth-like. If simple organisms (like cyanobacteria) or their fossils were found on Mars, we have some hope with current technology of actually being able to study them.		Europa is much more likely than Mars to have actual complex life today, based on what we know about it -- which is unfortunately not very much. It is bathed in extreme radiation from Jupiter, and any long-term probe, lander, or orbiter that we could currently build would have its circuits fried in quite a short time -- in particular, based on current reasonable estimates of Europa's ice sheet, in less time than it would take a hypothetical melt probe to penetrate the ice.		The extreme distance between us and Europa means that even if the communication issue could be surmounted, the probe would itself need to by highly autonomous, unlike say Curiosity which receives daily detailed drive instructions from scientists here on Earth.		Then there's the issue of penetrating the ice. The hand-wavy idea is to have a probe with a hot tip that melts its way through the surface. This seems easy but in reality is not. The energy requirements to melt that much ice are huge. The specific heat capacity of water is very high; it takes a lot of energy to warm up water, and even more to melt it. Even more so if the ice is directly exposed to the vacuum of space -- you can expect it to be as hard as granite. So you need to have enough energy available to melt through what might be tens of kilometers of ice.		So let's say you have some sort of nuclear reactor on the probe or something that is capable of doing this. How do you keep contact with the surface as you melt your way through the ice? You can't take a wire with you -- any wire that's several kilometers long is going to weigh a ton, and you need to send this thing all the way to Jupiter. Not to mention that we don't know how the ice crust of Europa shifts -- if it's anything like Earth's glaciers, there's no reason to expect the wire you leave behind not to get snapped by ice moving.		And we also have no idea if the ice is just ice. What if there are rocks in it? Meteors, say, that are lodged in the ice? It stands to reason that there would be -- everything else in the neighborhood is well cratered. So how could you be sure that your hypothetical melt probe would be passing through ice it can melt, and not running into house-sized boulders lodged in the crust?		You need to get down to the ocean, keep contact with the surface, and do so quickly enough that the relay on the surface talking to earth doesn't fry, you need to have smart enough software that the probe -- including the submersible -- can function more or less completely autonomously, since Jupiter is 33 light minutes away from Earth when the two planets are at their *closest*. All of this is really complicated.		Assuming you did all that, and you got a submarine in there, *and* you found Europan life, what would be step 2? How would you study those creatures, that ecosystem? Europa is really far away and you can't just land on it and study. The problem then becomes a hundred times more difficult.		By comparison, Mars is easy, and the honest truth is that we're not even certain that any astronauts we send to Mars would be able to handle the comparatively small radiation dose they would receive on the (much shorter) trip. Nor are we sure they'd be able to adapt long-term to .38g or a 25 hour day. These problems already give us difficulty and yet they are peanuts compared to the ones we face on a hypothetical Europa mission.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"808140","name":"t1_cpcmoay","parent_id":"t1_cpcj8a1","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1426179270,"created_utc":1426175670}

{"body":"It's hand-wavy because it's a sci-fi concept; nothing on the scale of what is needed on Europa has ever been built. Melting ice on earth isn't as hard, since it's quite rare for the temperature on earth to be under 200 K, which means you're looking at (at most) a 75 K temperature change (including the phase change).		Europa's surface is closer to 110 K, which means instead of only 75 K you're looking at a 160 K temperature change, which is going to require much more energy. Sure, the temperature is expected to warm up as we penetrate the ice, but we could still be looking at 5 to 10 kilometers of ice at this temperature or close to it -- for comparison's sake, Greenland's ice sheet is only 3km thick.		Furthermore, a crybot's movement is fundamentally powered by gravity, and Europa's gravity is small relative to ours, which means that even if you could overcome the energy requirements, it would penetrate very slowly, which is a big deal when your relay on the surface and your orbiter are both being fried by Jovian radiation.		What Philberth did in the 1960s is interesting, but it was ultimately not very reliable. The first time it was tried it made it only 90 meters before failing; the second time 200. It descended into Greenland's ice at about 2.5m per hour, which is with the benefit of 1g and relatively warm ice. Assuming that we could penetrate at the same speed on Europa, penetration into the ocean would take between 1 and 3 *years*. But as I said, we couldn't manage that speed on Europa: Europa's surface gravity is only 0.13g, lower than on the moon.		Furthermore, unlike in Greenland, we can't look down into the ice and select a nice place free of rocks to drop the probe, because we don't have that data.
