{"body":"> Would the people of the planet side ever be in the dark? Either the sun or the planet would always be illuminating them. 		Among the Nearsiders, Easterners would get half-dark evenings, and westerners would get half-dark mornings. When the moon crosses over the terminator of the planet, it's receiving much less light than at mid-night, with the full face of the planet reflecting light back.		There would also be relatively frequent eclipses - the planet would take up more of the moon's sky than Luna does Earth's, making its shadow harder to bypass.  	The Eclipses could come in batches, waxing and waning over several nights, according to the combined schedule of the moon's presumably-somewhat-tilted orbital axis precessing around the planet's centre of mass, and the Planet's orbit around the sun, changing the angle of the shadow cast by the planet.  	The eclipses would last a long time - sufficiently long for the moon to traverse the planet's diameter to the other side - and they would be relatively sudden, with widely-spaced and narrow umbra zones on each side, due to the sun's relatively small apparent diameter compared to the planet.  	The eclipses would be deep, as, unlike here, the sun isn't peeking around the edge of the planet like Sol is around Luna during an eclipse - however the giant's atmosphere would refract a dim ring of sunlight around the edge of the planet's disc, but not enough to spoil the rare view of the universe.		So darkness wouldn't be foreign to them, but it may be rare or comparatively short-lived.		The Nearsiders may discriminate or even politicise along the division of the light:  	"God favours the Easterners by rising to us first and providing us bright mornings, and all day showing much of her face to us!"  	"No! God favours the Westerners! She gazes down upon the fruits of our devotion, and soothes us to sleep at night!"  	Both sides are agreed that the farsiders are  	"Heathens! With their star-worship! Stars are clearly subordinate to God - they would appear more often were they not, it's simple logic."  	And along the "equator" between near and far, there would live the mountain-God worshippers. Pitied by all for their eternal rebuke, with God only showing half of herself to them.		I guess that sort of answers this:  	> How would 3 subspecies of humans adapt to conditions at the middle of the planetside, middle of the opposite side and somewhere half way? 		Navigation on the near-side would be a cinch, too.

{"body":"Indeed, I think they would need to excel in mathematics early, just to make sense of the stars and moons, and attempt to predict their motions, and when they'd undergo eclipses... 		However, I think the near-siders will twig gravity first. The moon is not likely to be the closest object orbiting the planet, so there will be objects, perhaps other large moons, plainly visible looping around "God".  	God might also have rings, and the observation that the objects orbiting closer to the rings are smaller may nuance the idea of gravity very quickly, once it is hit upon. 		It'll be the farsiders who apply that to the solar system at large, though, and there will be centuries of confusion over the relationships between the planet, the moons, and the rest of the solar system, just like, but deeper than, there was on Earth. 		For example, the Sun might be considered a very distant moon of the planet, and the stars a collection of even more distant ring particles.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Destructor1701","name":"t1_cpbc81j","parent_id":"t1_cpb83hb","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1426081309,"created_utc":1426077709}

{"body":"Yeah, no, sorry, that video is lunacy. I tried to stick it out, I really did, I even paused it yesterday and came back to it today.		 I couldn't waste any more time on it once he started insisting that all the planet-Gods of antiquity (and coincidentally **only** the planets that are still visible in our skies today) were balled up in our neighbourhood of the solar system mere millennia ago, apparently in an impossible gravitational equilibrium, maintaining a stable configuration for thousands of years, before disassociating but somehow all entering nearly circular stable orbits around the Sun - every one of them consistent with first-principles simulations of an ancient planetary system which only reconfigures over the course of hundreds of millions of years!		Even if all the inner planets *had* been moons of Saturn, orbital resonance would make conjunctions depicting the "wheel of Gods" the exception rather than the rule. There would be clear depictions of differing configurations. If the suggestion is that the configuration remained the same, then gravity would have pulled all those worlds into collision in a matter of hours or days.		The chemical compositions of the rocks and atmosphere on Earth, Mars and Venus would have been altered by the gravitational kneading of our core by Saturn's immense mass, and by the unfamiliar distance to the Sun - Saturn itself would have had massive chemical upheaval transitioning to its current state - yet, of the gas giants, it's probably the most atmospherically serene!		Another thing: where was our Moon during all of this? The mythical sources are contemporaneous with shit-loads of literal depictions of The Moon, but The Moon's orbit would not have been maintainable in such a gravitationally chaotic system.  	For that matter, what about the moons of Saturn!? Where were they?		I could continue shitting on this theory, but let's look at its basis: a really, really shakey stack of overstretched mythical interpretations (with far more plausible alternative explanations), assumptions and bends trying to make it all fit together, and rebukes to experimentally verified science. He then declares that to be "evidence that cannot be ignored". Hilarious!		This is an example of exactly what it is trying to replace in our pre-history: overzealous pattern-recognition leading to inflexible faith in a crazy idea.

{"body":"> in terms of surface conditions		Sort of.  It depends on what you look for, because Titan (not a planet, but a moon) is the most Earth-like if you're focusing on weather.  It just has a methane cycle instead of a hydrologic (water-based) one, methane seas and rain instead of water ones, etc., while Mars just has huge dust storms.  Beyond that though, you're not wrong.		Also, in terms of mass, size, and composition, Venus is probably the most Earthlike planet that we know of.  It's just that it got a headstart on the whole "carbon dioxide-choked hellhole" thing (don't worry, Earth will have caught up in 2-3 billion years!), thanks to a combination of its closer orbit, slow rotation, and lack of tectonic activity.  It's implausible to settle it though, unless you're talking about having floating colonies above the cloud layers, or have some way to sequester the crapload of carbon in its atmosphere.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpa4hkk","parent_id":"t1_cpa3c0t","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425987892,"created_utc":1425984292}
{"body":"Titan is only Earth-like in the most surreal, Salvador Dali-esque sense.  It has features that look like things we know - clouds, rain, rivers, seas - they just exist under such bizarre conditions that we would die instantaneously if exposed to them.  In practical fact, it's as weird as it gets and still have a surface to walk on.		But I don't see much of a future for humans there, despite how interesting it is.  Working there would be very complicated even compared to other places off-Earth, extremely energy-intensive, and there's just no way we're going to terraform it - there'd be violent, global phase transitions totally beyond our control.  It will always be very scientifically popular though.		Mars is relatively simple compared to Titan: An extreme version of an Earth desert robbed of air and a magnetic field.  We can not only deal with that, we already know how to change it (because we're already stupidly doing that here, on the wrong planet for it).  And the much more modest amount of volatiles in the crust will make the climatic transitions manageable.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","name":"t1_cpa529s","parent_id":"t1_cpa4hkk","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425990354,"created_utc":1425986754}
