You can increase your delta-v by decreasing your weight, using more effective engines, and/or bringing more fuel. Also, make sure your thrust to weight ratio well exceeds 1.0 for liftoff and Mun landing stages.		The Apollo missions used a small lander that had a few tricks up its sleeves. For example, it jettisoned its landing legs / gear when taking off.

If the engines were just 'straight' / in line with the shuttle only, you would pretty much instantly lose control of the vehicle upon seperation of the SRB's. This is because once the SRB's are dropped, there is a rather large shift in the position of the center of thrust, from somewhere between the orbiter and external tank, to just behind the orbiter. Ever had one of those pinwheel fireworks that spins ultra fast? Yeah, that's what would happen, although with alot more boom and alot less fun. To compensate for this, the engines are angled in such a way that if you drew a line from their combined center/vector of thrust, it would go right through the center of mass of the vehicle at that point in flight (I.E. Right after SRB seperation). These engines also generally have quite a large gimbal (vector changing) range to compensate for center of mass shifting as fuel is burned, as well as payload weight.

{"body":"Perhaps you meant to reply to a different comment?		Anyway, the space shuttle has an external fuel tank, but the engines were on the orbiter itself.  With the Buran, it only had small engines (like the Orbital Maneuvering System - OMS - on the shuttle), but not the big ones like the SSMEs.  Instead, the engines were on that big external tank: the energia.		So the difference is that the shuttle could recover those engines, while the Buran had no engines.  They were instead on the energia, which was a fully capable rocket that just took the Buran along.		There were actually some crazy plans to put wings on the energia and make it reusable.

Because of that, you have things like vinyl laminated to the metal, and, very common in aircraft, rivets that tie things together. You have thin pieces instead of cast pieces. You have anodized stuff.		When aluminum is remelted, anything that can't be alloyed together is going to form nasty stuff in the metal. To get rid of it, you have to heat it up beyond melting and add degassing agents to remove it from the melt. Even aluminum oxide is an issue which is why thin metal and annodized metal is an issue. It doesn't take much before the heat and degassing costs on top of transport adds up to more than the value of the aluminum. And while you may say 'its high grade aircraft aluminum', it isn't. There are a wealth of alloys and different things that get mixed up in the melt. So afterward, you don't have aircraft aluminum, you have, at best, popcan aluminum, and at worse an alloy that has to be chemically separated. The latter issue costs so much to make it worthless. 		The last thing fighting against this is aluminum ore is exceedingly common. Aluminum only costs what it does due to the electricity it takes to make it.

{"body":"NASA would have almost certainly been able to build a US only version of something like the ISS massively cheaper on its own.  International cooperation on the ISS was basically a jobs program to keep all these very smart and well trained ex-soviet rocket scientists from getting jobs in Syria and North Korea and on that basis it was a massive success.		Edit: You can feel salty about this if you want to but the greatest part of the cost of the ISS was getting it into space, not building it.  Launching into an orbit that can be reached from Russia's launch facility meant that the Shuttle's payload capability was reduced by around 20%.  NASA traded a 100% chance of a significant increase in the cost of the most expensive part of the operation for the potential of a slight reduction in the cheapest part (if Russia's space program doesn't implode before they their promises and if they were even in a position to deliver on their promises in the first place which the US had no way of knowing before hand).  You've also got all these issues surrounding management and potential political problems and blah blah blah.		In the early 1990s Russia's space program was chronically underfunded and had lost something like 30% of its space program to jobs overseas within the span of 3 years. If you want to live in a world where North Korea can't start lobbing missiles at Los Angeles this was *somewhat concerning*.  By partnering with Russia to build the ISS the US was able to inject a bunch of hard currency into the Russian economy at a point where they really desperately needed it and make this ongoing support contingent on Russia continuing to have a space program. This served to both do a bit to prop up the Russian economy at a point where the US was seriously concerned about tanks rolling through the streets of Moscow a and also to keep Russa's very smart well educated space program inside of Russia. 		If you're trying to build the best possible space station at the cheapest possible price Russa's involvement in the ISS makes no sense, but as a piece of statecraft it was absolutely brilliant.

No planning was made towards water mitigation, corrosion from salt water, biological growth, coatings performance over the long term, etc. So yes, they were designed to withstand nearly unimaginable forces, but only a short time period of those forces.

{"body":">It make me wonder what we could have already accomplished if the space race had been about our nations working together to explore the universe instead of a battle for near-space supremacy.		History shows that what we would have accomplished is...a lot less. So much of the Apollo program was driven by the Cold War competition between the USA and the Soviet Union. Without the Soviet threat, Apollo might never have gotten funded at the level that it was. The USSR was working just as hard to get to the moon as we were, one reason the Soviets didn't get further is that their heavy lift launch vehicles didn't work, one blowing up on the pad in a rocket-fueled explosion so destructive it took out their launch facilities and (sadly) quite a few engineers on the ground as well.		With the Cold War over, the USSR (later Russia) cooperated with the West on Apollo/Soyuz and ISS efforts such as module building and ferrying Western and Eastern astronauts, but neither represents the type you hoped for from working together in peace. This period of peacetime cooperation is precisely the period of space exploration when everyone is complaining about the total lack of progress. Both space programs seemed to get a lot more done when both sides were driven to stay in front of the other for political and military reasons.		I'm definitely not saying we should have another Cold War to fuel space exploration again, but history shows it was when the West and East were the most unfriendly to each other that the most progress was made in manned spaceflight, and it was when they were cooperating the most that the least progress has been made. We somehow need to find an equally compelling, yet positive, motivation to fund the exploration of space. Unfortunately, if history is any guide, the exploration of space isn't going to be accelerated for science or human togetherness or whatever. Funding will be driven by military superiority (countries who want the high ground and can afford to achieve it, currently China is the most motivated), or economic superiority a.k.a. profit (one country or one corporation wants natural resources found in space like mining). Those are the things that have always motivated exploration the most, over and over again, throughout human history.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alllmossttherrre","name":"t1_cs4nwzq","parent_id":"t1_cs4j0qs","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1434147733,"created_utc":1434144133}

I think that the public perception has seized on the "weapons platform" story because it has a certain romantic flair about it, but it may well have been a much more mundane military satellite.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"afranius","name":"t1_cs52yv1","parent_id":"t1_cs4nio0","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1434182985,"created_utc":1434179385}

It simply was never used for what they designed the thing for. 		The design of the shuttle allowed it to launch into orbit, capture a satellite and return exactly to the launch location in ONE ORBIT. That's fucking impressive and is completely unparalleled capability of a space vehicle. 		The shuttle was also designed to launch into a polar orbit, launch a spy satellite and land again without ever being detected by the soviet union. That is also a game-changer in terms of capability and the Soviets were understandably scrambling to play catch-up. 		Essentially what happened was the Air Force expressed a great need for the vehicle and NASA spent a fortune developing it, only to have the Air Force never use the thing.

Basically the space race was the race for ICBMs. After WWII, both sides rushed to collect as many German scientists as possible. The US also wanted spy satellites. The problem was that the U.S. feared international precedence would make space overflight illegal. Von Braun's rocket was ahead some 9-16 months (no longer remember the exact number) or so of the Russians. The US also had two other rocket programs...which were falling behind von braun's. They didn't want a German's rocket to be first in space. They green lighted the air force which was reported to be further along than was, but it also provided cover. Lots of pad and midair explosions followed.		Eventually the Soviets did launch and the other US programs were still not ready and the administration way under estimated the public fear and backlash by allowing the Russians to go first...yet it did legally establish overflight in space is legal; as the Soviets did it and the US didn't complain. To calm things, and because the other programs were still plagued with problems, von braun's rocket was taken back out and the satellite von braun had been cruising around with in the trunk of his car was made ready.		Von braun's rocket was reassembled, payload attached, and successfully launched into space on the first attempt. The rocket which had been mothballed months before the Soviet launch worked without issue. Next was to regain international pride which had taken a beating from the Soviet's first. And so the manned race to the moon was kicked off. The best the Soviets could muster was a fairly advanced moon rover.		This part is key. The rocket technology which has the lift capacity to take payloads to the moon have the capacity to carry nukes and orbital spy satellites.

{"body":"The biggest plus of the Buran was the carrier system. The Buran didn't need large engines to reach LEO, all the work was done by the rocket. Therefore the engine system was smaller and cheaper. Of course in return the rocket was more expensive than the American carrier system, but the big engines of the Space Shuttle was one reason why maintenance for the Space Shuttle was so much more complex and expensive than initially projected. 		But in retrospect both systems were ahaed of their time and couldn't fulfil the promise of a cheap reuseable spacecraft. A Space Shuttle with a heat shield that you don't have to overhaul after every launch combined with a cheap Energija-style carrier system from a pirate company like SpaceX might be the future.		But I have the feeling that we will rather work with capsules as "Earth to LEO" taxis and that the next manned space ship will be build in space like the ISS, probably using inflatable modules so that we can build large manned structures in space (much larger than the ISS in terms of pressurized living space) with just two or three launches of a Falcon Heavy. I don't think that we will ever need or use Space Shuttles again. We don't Space Shuttles anymore to transport satellites and other small structures to space, and instead using Space Shuttles for maintenance tasks we might just have several (inflatable) space stations in orbit and small vehicles docked at them to travel between the space stations and perform maintenance tasks on satellites. That would save us the entire process of launching a heavy vehicle like a Space Shuttle into space and overhauling it after every launch.
