{"body":"I want to second this post.  If you can get to a night launch of a big rocket, GO!  	I was probably around 13 when I saw my first shuttle night launch.  My parents loaded up the van and we drove from Tampa to watch a tiny lighted tower on the horizon.  We didn't have a scanner or even know what station to listen to so that we could find out when it would launch.  Thankfully, as others have said, we were not alone and there were numerous people around more than happy to provide play by play.  So you wait there in the dark, wandering about, waiting for that magical moment when they release the T-9 minute hold.  Once released, you quickly check the clock and wait.  Everyone gathers around one of the play-by-play distributors so you know if they have an extra clock stop.  Finally, with 7 seconds to go, a small flicker appears at the bottom of the tiny tower off in the distance.  Over the next few seconds it glows brighter and brighter, like the very early dawn.  Suddenly, the SRB's ignite and the whole sky is alight, from that tiny little tower a raging blowtorch erupts forth.  The sky is now as bright as the mid-day sun and all you hear is the crowd around you mesmerized at the amazing display put on by the brilliant engineers at NASA.  Depending on how far you are, the next moment is even more astounding.  As the Shuttle lifts off higher and higher the daylight quickly fades like a winter sunset.  Then, more than a minute later, the ground starts to shake and a deafening roar comes over the water as the sound of the launch finally reaches you (I was usually about 15sm away).  I was young, but the ground shaking was something a remember most.  I was standing on top of the van and had to drop down to grip the sides.  The sound lasts for nearly 30 seconds before everyone is left in the quiet, wet, darkness that is central Florida.	Also of note, even if you are Canadian, bring a blanket for spring (Jan-Mar) night launches, sitting around doing nothing in the extremely wet, cool air will chill you to the bone.  I vividly remember two scrubbed launches when the temp was 40 degrees and I was freezing my ass off thinking it isn't that damn cold.
