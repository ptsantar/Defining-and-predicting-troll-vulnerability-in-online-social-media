{"body":"A BBS is a bulletin board system.  I was involved with them from the early 80's through the early 90's, and even ran a small one for a short time in the early 90's.  Basically, someone would run some BBS software that allowed people to dial up with a modem and connect to their computer, and the software would present menus for the user to navigate its features, which would normally include forums, downloads and online games.  BBS's varied in size from 10+ line commercial ones all the way down to single line personally-run boards like mine that were totally free, but didn't offer nearly as much.		In my local dialing area, there were normally 25-50 BBS's active at any time.  The big ones would stay around a long time, but small ones would arrive and disappear pretty frequently.  Someone in our area would keep track of them and provide a list to download, so you would know what numbers to dial.  You would have to sign up for an account for each one individually, and they would have different requirements for granting you access.  Some would just grant you basic access immediately; many (including mine) would require you to enter your name and telephone number so they could call you and talk to you briefly before granting access; and a few of the commercial ones would require you to give you payment details for any access at all (but most of them would have some level of free access).  Many free ones would have hidden areas with pirated software or porn downloads, that you'd have to know the sysop (system operator) to get access to.		On a small BBS, the forums were mostly dead, because you would just be communicating with people who had accounts on that specific BBS.  But most commercial systems had access to FidoNet, which was a huge network of BBS's that communicated with each other to exchange forum messages.  I'm a little fuzzy on the details because I was just a user and I wasn't on FidoNet with my BBS, but basically there specific forums defined somehow within FidoNet, and each BBS could subscribe to any number of them.  Each BBS would need to dial one or more specific BBS's to exchange forum messages on a regular schedule.  The smaller systems on the leaf nodes would just dial up one system and send it all of the new messages entered since the last communication, and download all new messages for the forums that they subscribed to.  Then the larger systems would communicate with other systems, knowing which messages needed to be sent to each, based on the network map of nodes.  At no point in time would all of the messages entered be distributed to all systems in the network, but each message would eventually be sent to every subscribing system, as long as it was able to continue to connect to the network.

Sure you will see fewer stars than you can see in pics, but in fact the number difference doesn't matter; it won't cause shape difference between what you see in real and on screen. 		However, you can only recognize it's shape. Due to limits of cells in human eyes, it is hard for most of us humans to observe milky way's color with only bare eyes. It doesn't mean the sky is colorless - you'll still be able to recognize colors of those brighter stars. It's certainly far less colorful than pics, but it's also far from only black & white.		In a word, the milky way you see with your bare eyes is like that in videos/pics, with fewer stars, and  added some sort of color filters.		But it's still extremely breathtaking.			and another thing: " far enough away from cities" doesn't mean hundreds of miles. The distance from cities to places you'll be able to see milky way is shorter than most people would think, even in heavily polluted areas.

But to go opposite of that and to invest into love, family, kids, dogs, hobbies or whatever people care to fall for is something else when going from one to the other.  To just dance with it all.  Don't force yourself in but to bounce with it and dance as the universe does. Ahhh.  Existing, reading your comment, typing my response.  Fucking awesome.

{"body":"Hey, it's not a problem and how else will you learn without asking? The fact that we don't notice movement in the stars is just because they are very far away. I mean, the numbers are so big that they lose meaning. To explain, let me use an example. Say you are looking at a car coming towards you from a distance. At first it may seem like the car is almost stationary. But as it reaches you, you see it moving really fast. The car was moving at the same speed when it was far away from you and when it was close. It is just that the car is so far away that its movement is hard to detect. Now imagine you were twirling while you watched the car. It may seem like the car is moving constantly around you, even though in reality if you weren't twirling you wouldn't be able to notice its movement.		To answer you question, yes the Earth's rotation around the sun has little effect on how we perceive the movement of stars in our sky.

I guess one question I have remaining is that are there stars that the earth is traveling faster than, relative to our movement through space?

It is also why certain stars are only visible during certain times of the year. An example of this in action can be seen by [this photo](http://i.space.com/images/i/000/002/171/i02/070102_earth_analemma_02.jpg?1292265175). It was taken at the same time of day everyday for a year. You can see that the Sun's position moves throughout the year. So depending on the time of the year, you can see different stars. 		Now, we live in an expanding universe. Meaning everything is moving away from everything. This can be overcome by gravity, for instance we aren't going away from the Sun but orbiting it. As far as if there is a star moving at a slower velocity than us, I dunno. It's possible, but I don't know of any specific examples. 		Our Earth orbits the Sun. Which orbits a massive black hole. Which is moving as well. These velocities all moving around is really complicated so I don't know how the Earth is moving at a universal level. Sorry can't help you there. Hope this helps.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Whats_Not_Taken","name":"t1_cnwuni2","parent_id":"t1_cnwu4f1","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1421898308,"created_utc":1421898308}
{"body":"Not even really that its old light that were seeing. Its more with how far away they are from us that makes them stationary on small time scales and from our frame of reference. Light travels at the same speed all the time. So all the light that we are detecting (including with our eyes) is coming in like a constant stream. When we watch a distant body, whether it be star, galaxy or otherwise, we are seeing it played at more or less the same speed, but the information we are getting via the light is not current. It could be one year old, it could be a billion years old. Think about watching a concert you DVRd. You get to watch it at the same speed the actual show was played at, but the performance may have happened 24 hours ago or 24 years ago. Same deal. We are watching a Supernova at the same speed it happened, but we are just now seeing it, when it may have happened 2 million years ago. 		The biggest reason you don't perceive some stars or galaxies as moving is because they're just so far away. Farther than any distance you can really even fathom. If you were to draw a straight line between your eye, and a galaxy, then live 10,000 years, then when the earth is at the same place in its orbit, and at the same time of day you draw another line between that same galaxy and your eye again, then measure the difference in those two lines, say maybe the angle between them, it would probably be so close to zero that it wouldn't even make sense to measure it in the first place. Its such a staggeringly long distance away that though it might be traveling at 200,000 mph, it looks to us like its stationary.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PantsinmyPants1211","name":"t1_cnwuf3v","parent_id":"t1_cnwss6h","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1421897878,"created_utc":1421897878}

It is basically an electric motor driving a mounting plate. The motor is geared so it completes 1 rotation in 24 hours*. The rotation axis of the mount is aligned exactly with the North Celestial Pole (very close to the Pole Star)  or the South Celestial Pole, if you are in the Southern Hemisphere. It rotates so as to exactly cancel the apparent rotation of the sky caused by the Earth's rotation. 		This is also one way in which astronomical telescopes are mounted, and it is what allows them to keep them centred on the same star/galaxy/whatever for the hours it can take to make a long exposure image.
