submission: { t3_2iaacm	Bersonic	The result of me not sleeping for two days last weekend. I present to you my photo of IC 434- The Horsehead Nebula.	1412440121.0	1412443721.0	2	6047	6047	0	t5_2qh87	space	 }
{"body":"This is a photo I took of the Horsehead Nebula and the Flame Nebula in Orion.		I used a Vixen Ed80sf refractor mounted on an Orion Sirius equatorial mount. (The mount tracks earth's rotation to keep the nebula in place). I used a stock Nikon D5300 as my imaging camera, and a SSAG for my autoguider. (for those who care)		The Horsehead Nebula is particularly challenging because much of its light comes in the form of Hydrogen Alpha light. (light emitted from ionizing Hydrogen). Modern Dslrs filter this kind of light for some odd reason, so I had to expose much longer to compensate for this loss of light.		**Here are the full technical details:**		Shot from the CalSTAR star party (SQM of 21.4) over the course of 2 nights. 			* Nikon D5300 (Non Modified)	* Vixen Ed80sf (600mmfl)	* Orion SSAG	* St80 guide scope	* Orion Sirius Mount	* Hotech field falttener	* 70x420" Iso 800		For more space pictures... /r/astrophotography		Further technical discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/2ia9mw/ic_434ngc_2024_the_horsehead_nebula_and_the_flame/		More info on my blog: http://bersonicastronomy.com/2014/10/03/ic-434-the-horsehead-and-the-flame/","depth":0,"score":815,"ups":815,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Bersonic","name":"t1_cl09wag","parent_id":"t3_2iaacm","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1412444090,"created_utc":1412440490}

Exceptions would be beasts like Canon's MP-E 65, which is definitely macro-only and requires more equipment to really take advantage of.		But if you get carried away, sooner or later you aren't satisfied with "macro" and want to do "micro". So you start buying up microscopes, optomechanical equipment, and custom-machined parts.

With my 1000mm telescope, it's a bit more prone to streaking just a tad, but overall it's still no more than a couple of pixels of streaking.		The thing is, guiders only make *very* miniscule movements, so as long as everything operates the way it should, you'll never get any significant trails. Guiding is cannot account for large errors.
