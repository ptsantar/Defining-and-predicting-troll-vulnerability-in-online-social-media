Luckily, nowadays trust in currencies is not really based on the gold laying in a vault somewhere any more. But still, it would definitely disrupt the world's economy significantly. The thing is though, that bringing a huge amount of gold from a planet would be very expensive with today's technology. Nobody would want to spend billions and billions of dollars just to see his goods become nearly valueless the moment they arrive at earth. The people bringing the stuff here would also benefit from keeping the supply down. So I think the market will sort of take care of such a problem as long as the costs are high enough.

The interior of the Earth is highly radioactive, because the concentration of extremely heavy, unstable elements is much higher than on its surface.

{"body":"It's truly surprising how much of Curiosity is off-the-shelf stuff. Even the [radiation-hardened computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750) is a commercially-available, radiation-hardened variant of [what they used in Macintosh G3 computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_7xx#PowerPC_740.2F750). To put it another way, the software used on Curiosity could run, without modification, on the board in a [PowerMac G3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3_beige), or the early [iBooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook). Granted it would have trouble with the fact that it didn't have any of the peripherals or firmware, but if you included those (or figured out a way to fake them) it would.		In fact, I would be really surprised if they used the radiation-hardened variant for writing and testing new software for it. The RAD750 is a lot more expensive than the regular PPC750 and, since they're completely compatible with each other there's no reason to use the expensive one unless you absolutely have to (ie, because it's being run in a high-radiation environment, such as space).		As for operating systems, NASA has been using something called [VxWorks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks) for a while now and seems pretty invested in it (they've used it for most of its rovers and probes built in the last twenty years).		I think it would be really cool to see someone use [RTLinux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTLinux) in a spacecraft. Assuming it was in Earth orbit, and you had a radio dish you could pretty much just ssh into your cubesat. In fact, if you included a satellite internet transceiver and kept paying the bill you wouldn't need the radio dish.		Crap, now I want to build a cubesat with a mirror and satellite internet connection and have it flash morse code at people on the ground.

It seems that water deposited at the surface by frost can mediate oxidation of magnetite to hematite, due to rapid loss of hydrogen during an otherwise unfavorable reaction.		Another leading candidate is that the oxidation is catalyzed by hydrogen perooxide, itself formed due to ionizing radiation in the atmosphere.

What we're seeing here is likely due to the soil chemistry (heavily influenced by soil physical properties like particle size composition (sand, silt and clay percentage, and meta structures of the soil)) and the high presence of iron in various stages of RedoX reaction. Ferrrous material that's red is oxidized and gray material is reduced, This could indicate the presence of water a long time ago or a really low oxygen content in the atmosphere (which we know to be true about mars). On earth this is one of the fundamental driving chemical properties of soil, as it influences pH and thus the ability to support life. It could also be attributed to a geologic event that placed completely different material on the surface of the grey material, and their mineral composition could be completely different. My money is on the Iron ReDox chemistry. Otherwise the material on top has high amount of oxidized iron and aluminum, and the grey material has heavy amounts of manganese. Since Manganese is less common on earth than iron and the mars has a similar composition I'd again say this is presence of ReDox reaction in the soil.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"drodspectacular","name":"t1_cp6u7be","parent_id":"t1_cp6i2ef","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425690086,"created_utc":1425690086}

If you don't think that's a fair, you have a rather closed definition of telepathy that requires supernatural origin.

{"body":"I'm just using the definition that has been accepted for decades, and explaining why it doesn't make sense to change it.  		If wires don't count in your version of telepathy, then cell phones don't count, either.  The wireless signal from your cellphone only travels at most a couple of miles, before travelling many hundreds to thousands of miles farther through wires.  		You could set up a light-sensitive switch connected to your trans-Atlantic telegraph that would "click" the telegraph whenever you shined an infrared laser on it.  That would achieve "telepathy", since the sending device is connected with short-range wireless to a long-range wired network.  		You could easily send brainwave recordings over this medium, granted you had a computer to encode the data into infrared laser pulses (easy enough, you could do it with <$50 of electronics).  Then again, you could easily send the same information over a cup-and-string setup using the same principles as a dial-up modem.  		I also don't think cell phones would appear magical to engineers from the 1960s.  They transmitted live video from the freakin' Moon over microwaves.  We're just doing the same thing except digitally encoding data rather than using an analog encoder.  		If you had a brain-scanning, WiFi-enabled hat that could be worn by two people, and they could communicate without typing, talking, listening, or reading (and the like), I'd be comfortable calling that telepathy.","depth":13,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"terabyte06","name":"t1_cp7ysio","parent_id":"t1_cp7peow","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425797152,"created_utc":1425797152}

Again, that needs more of a professional to answer than I am.		>Does that mean there was plant life that was converting CO2 to oxygen?		Possibly, but I doubt it.

Nope, they are opposite.		> So the more stable an atom/molecule or the more "electronically" fulfilled it is, the less reactive it is?		Exactly. Oxygen is short 2 electrons in its outer shell, which is why it pairs up with other Oxygen to share them or bonds to another element (like Carbon). Once bonded, the entire molecule is stable because their shells are complete. Absent some other input to change the state of the electrons the CO2 molecule is stable.		> Or is that not always the case?		Pretty much always the case. There are different ways atoms bond, but they all revolve around the idea of imbalances in the electron shells.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"werewolf_nr","name":"t1_cp7kq0q","parent_id":"t1_cp7j58a","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1425764363,"created_utc":1425764363}
{"body":"> Nope, they are opposite.		Well that's what I meant i just didn't know how to phrase it. I should have said more reactive = less stable?		>Once bonded, the entire molecule is stable because their shells are complete.		So the way that I'm thinking of it is the molecule is "full" and it REALLY doesn't want any more. Is there a way to make it WANT to want more? Like I kind of get how the different shells and different levels work. Each one has a particular number of electrons it can accept until it's complete like 2, 8, 18 etc so with CO2 you have a perfectly stable molecule? With oxygen having 10 electrons each atom, 2 native but 8 shared electrons for the carbon so 22 total? So the whole molecule itself isn't "hungry" for any more? I get that if you put other elements next to is it probably just won't care and won't bond with it. But is there anyway to GET it to want more and start a new shell or does that all depend on not only it's native atom stability/reactivity but it's nucleic weight which determines how many shells it has? I feel like I'm asking in different ways but I'm just making sure if I understand WHY atoms/molecules have the shells that they have because it seems like the size of the nucleus determines how many shells it has which will then determine how many electrons it can accept which depending on how full it is already determines how reactive it is.		Also one more thing while it's on my mind. So with a molecule like CO2 where all of the 2nd shell molecules within the carbon atom are shared, is that bond between electron and nucleus less for either of the oxygen or carbon atoms less strong? I would think they're 50% weaker since they're going between two different atoms but how does that affect the overall bond if you have these "weaker" bonded electrons running around? Also I get that it's 4 out of 8 electrons per oxygen atom on the second shell that are being shared, is it the SAME 4 electrons or do they rotate? Could the carbon be taking electrons from oxygen atom number 1, cycling it through i it's shell and the taking it to oxygen 2 and then circling it around again like a train set?
