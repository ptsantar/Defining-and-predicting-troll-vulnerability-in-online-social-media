{"body":"> Just curious, would it be possible for humanity to survive underground? 		For an impact like this, no chance. Our best hope would be to leave the planet, and either find a new one or survive for centuries aboard a self-sustaining space station. And preferably we would be some distance from the dangerous materials being ejected from the Earth, maybe orbiting a planet nearer to the sun to take advantage of the improved solar energy output.		An impact like this tears apart the crust so violently that it actually causes pieces of it to eject into space. Think about that. Right now the worst thing the crust does is slightly move above or below itself naturally along faultlines. And even that--earthquakes *as we know them*--can crumble our civilizations. If anything, underground is the *most* dangerous place to be during a quake. Everything above you is coming down. Everything below you is shifting and either cracking or erupting. That kind of event would result in the kind of earthquake that is simply unspeakable. Even if you survived the heat (vacuum-sealed mole people city?), and managed to keep the necessary supplies on hand (water, food, maybe nuclear power to keep the lights on?), the quake(s) alone would be enough to turn you into jelly. Basically you'd be thrust into the walls, floor, and ceiling repeatedly with unbelievable force, breaking... you. All of you. I mean, this would affect the movement of the entire globe.

{"body":"Direct flash would kill anyone in line of sight instantly - I'm not sure how the radiation blast further out would attenuate through the earth or how much hard radiation would be generated.  Further away I think you'd be killed by the shock wave moving through the earth's crust rather than the air blast (4-6 km/sec vs 0.35 km/sec).  Once the shock wave reaches you, death would be pretty much instantaneous as would be flying into a rock wall at 4-6 km/sec.  The shock wave might take a while to reach further locations.  So my hypothesis is that if the prompt radiation blast didn't kill you, you might live for a reasonable fraction of an hour if far away while the earth flies apart until killed by the seismic shock wave.  But nothing would survive - the amount of energy present if both earth and Pluto are moving near orbital velocities would kill the earth.  As a quick order of magnitude, the energy present would be sufficient to launch a comparable mass to Pluto back into space at the original impact velocity.  In actuality, some will be launched with escape velocity, other material will just be thrown up to eventually rain back down.

Of course, many deep space pictures are based on light spectrums our eyes cannot see, so they are more just showing us glimpses of the universe we could never see with out eyes - a bit like if you look at your remote control through antmy digital camera, you can see the IR led blinking while your eyes see nothing.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tieluohan","name":"t1_ct2umxj","parent_id":"t1_ct2savw","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436882250,"created_utc":1436878650}

{"body":"Hey, I don't post here as much as I used to, but I wanted to reply because I believe your statement is both heartfelt and because I once shared it. I couldn't see any reason why we should spend billions of dollars to get a few pictures of a place we would never be able to life when there were so many problems here.	 The view that money spent on space could be better spent on helping American while understandable, lacks the context of our last century and doesn't fully respect the gravity and scale of this centuries problems. The space race produced a wide variety of technologies that you and I depend on for our daily lives, and many other technologies that help communities rich and poor around the world. 	Here are a few of many examples:	Whenever you see an American vet walking again thanks to prosthetic limbs, that is an offshoot of the work of NASA. 	Whenever you hear about microloans helping African communities start through the use of cell phones, remember where cellular technology was born.	Whenever you hear about poor communities getting water purification systems, or Bill Gate's ambitious (and successful) project about turning sewage into pure drinking water, know that that technology was pioneered for space travel and is used today on the ISS. 	Anytime a fireman pulls a kid out of a burning house, his suit has inhabited the same features and protective cloths that were initially designed for space-suits.	There many many other examples like Food safty systems, new kinds of preserved food ect that started as solutions for manned and unmanned space exploration.		What people fail to realize is that we spend most of that large sum of money on a process, not the end result. That process forces creative and critical thinking to solve problems that are so difficult, so challenging, that it is difficult for the human mind to comprehend. When Apollo 13 went tits-up IN SPACE. NASA and the crew had to figure out if it was possible to get them alive with a limited amount of air and fuel under conditions no one had tested for. To survive the three days in space, they had to build an oxygen purification system out of fucking house-hold parts. They also had to figure out the math of slings-hotting their craft around the moon to get the exact right amount of energy to return home without losing all of their fuel and not be flung out into space. Entry into the earth's atmosphere required a manual burn to hit the exact right entry coordinates (otherwise you burn up or are deflected off into space where you will die of asphyxiation.) To put it into perspective just how fucking hardcore that is: think of the earth as a basket ball, the point of correct entry at any given point to safely enter without dying is many times thinner than a sheet of paper. They made it home.		New Horizons and Dawn have answered technological problems that one day will have broad implications on earth. New Horizons is 3.5 BILLION miles away, (If the earth were that basketball and Pluto were say, a softball, you would have to jump in a car and literally go hundreds of miles to see one or the other) that means that even going the speed of light, it takes over four hours for a message to reach it or us. How do you communicate with something that far away without the signal getting lost across such a vast difference? How do you gets something there within a lifetime? How do you measure the composition, the air, the magnetosphere of an alien world so far from home when you are going so fast? Pluto we now know is a dynamic world with an active atmosphere and climates and seasons. But even it was just a little dead ball of rock and ice, the problems it required us to overcome get us there are where the real societal value lies.		We don't live in a world dominated by small problems. We won't survive by thinking small. Any species that fails to adapt to a changing world (even one changed by their hand.) goes extinct.	Do you want to know how the desertification of Africa might be reversed?	How climate change works (and how it would be partially mitigated or even reversed?) How about super crops that can grow in inhospitable places to feed the seven plus billion people on earth? If you do, check out the process terraforming. And, if you really want those 10 thousand homes for homeless families, (we all do, hopefully.) You should look at the Military's annual budget and tax percentage vs NASA. We scrap hundreds of working JJ Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to keep manufacturing jobs going at the colossal cost to the American tax payer.

If we taxed higher income brackets a fraction more (corporate or otherwise), or restructured how our military industrial complex works (not dismantling it, but making it more efficient and less wasteful) We could have those same houses.

Hell, yes.		Do I support a dedicated Plutonian Orbiter? Not soon given its great distance and our proximity to worlds like Europa and Titan that are so much closer. But who knows, there will be months of data. (A four hour delay and a 1kb download speed means even if NH finds something earth-shattering, it will upwards of half a year before we find out about it.) Your first post was judging the expense of NH based on a photograph that will be obsolete in a month or less. We haven't yet read the first page of this book of the formation of the Solar System and its many children.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ItWhoSpeaks","name":"t1_ct38un7","parent_id":"t1_ct37eft","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436904118,"created_utc":1436900518}

It takes most of a day to get the data beamed back, then probably another day to clean it up and make it public-viewable.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AuntieSocial","name":"t1_ct34hq4","parent_id":"t1_ct33jn8","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436898065,"created_utc":1436894465}
