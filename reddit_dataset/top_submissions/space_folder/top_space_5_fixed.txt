There, it made a close pass to Jupiter which put it on a much smaller orbit around the Sun.  After a few orbital periods in that orbit, it passed by Jupiter in the same place again which put it on a different orbit.

{"body":"The trail of sand is because of gravity, which pulls the sand to the ground and holds it there. Without gravity or air resistance, as in space, the sand would just keep moving the same way that it was before you let go (this is Newton's First Law of Motion).		So for comets: if you had a comet orbiting a star that some how emitted no solar wind but still emitted heat, the water vapor from the melting ice would just sort of form a bubble around the nucleus since nothing would be pushing it away and it would still have the same orbital momentum that it had prior to evaporation. (Additionally, the nucleus would be exerting a small gravitational pull on the vapor, which would be small on an absolute scale but still probably larger than any other force at work.)		This is why Earth, Venus, and Mars have atmospheres but Mercury doesn't. Earth and Venus are large enough that gravity prevents the solar wind from blowing away the atmosphere. Mars is smaller, but also farther away from the Sun, so the solar wind is weaker. Mercury, meanwhile, is both small (for a planet) and very close to the Sun -- so gasses close to the surface are all blown off towards the outer Solar System instead of forming an atmosphere. This is actually [still happening](http://news.discovery.com/space/mercurys-tail-make-it-a-comet-planet.htm), although the resulting tail is too small to be easily visible from Earth.		**Edit:** as /u/Double_Nagintata and /u/hett have pointed out below, the magnetic field of the Earth is another important reason that we have the atmosphere that we do, because it deflects a lot of the solar wind.

It's believed that an immense impact of some kind stopped Mars' molten core from spinning, letting it cool (relatively speaking) and degrading the planet's magnetic field, which resulted in it loosing large portions of it's atmosphere.

This is was really confusing when they found it out in the 60's since previously everyone had thought that such a magnetic field was necessary for a thick atmosphere. The reason it hasn't been depleted by the solar wind is that it is thick enough to create an [induced magnetosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#Induced_magnetosphere) through interaction with the solar wind and the Sun's magnetosphere. This provides enough protection for comparatively heavy molecules, like CO2, to remain on the surface, but Venus is bleeding light gasses (and so, I guess, should have a tail of its own).

{"body":"Thanks, I was trying to keep it on the simple side, but I agree that Earth's magnetic field is important in us having such a lovely atmosphere. But the link between magnetic fields and atmospheric loss is a little more complicated than that -- Venus has a much weaker magnetic field than Earth does, but still has an thicker atmosphere even though it is closer to the Sun.		The reason behind this, to my understanding, is that even though Venus appears to have no magnetic field coming out of a rotating planetary core (as on Earth), the outer layers of the Venusian atmosphere are ionized by the intense solar radiation and create their own magnetic field which protects the inner atmosphere. The Martian atmosphere produces a similar effect but is not thick enough to totally shield itself which is why its so thin.		The trick here is that this means a planet without an internal magnetic field can have a thick atmosphere as long as it has a thick atmosphere, which is pretty circular. I don't know why for sure Venus has a thick atmosphere but Mars doesn't -- but I would speculate that the greater mass of Venus has something to do with it, since the higher gravity would lead to a denser atmosphere which would in turn lead to a more protective atmospheric magnetic field.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gradath","name":"t1_clir9q9","parent_id":"t1_cliqpe0","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1414180808,"created_utc":1414177208}

In real life, people have such a terror of letting go of things even when they know they're wrong- they're afraid it means they've given up or they are losers or they are idiots, and of course nothing could be further from the truth, right? 		my advice is, be like a real scientist, the truth is a constant, there is no dishonour in recognizing you're wrong, humility is the greatest virtue, and it takes a lot of courage.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dripdroponmytiptop","name":"t1_cliuy05","parent_id":"t1_clitj9k","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1414187696,"created_utc":1414184096}

The surface of the comet will be solid rock.		2. The surface will either be entirely devoid of ice or it will have a very light frosting of ice in small pockets.		3. Image sensors will detect areas of whiteout if the comet is active.  This whiteout will be caused by plasma discharges. Should the landing be successful, it???s possible that the lander may directly image plasma electrically machining the rocky surface of the comet.		4. The surface will be heavily cratered, with sharply defined ridges and mesas.		5. The lander may short out or explode as it approaches the comet.  It???s possible that a massive explosion could occur if a large electrical exchange were to take place between the lander and the comet.		6. The Rosetta lander Magnetometer And Plasma monitor (ROMAP) sensor will go haywire or produce completely unexpected results.		7. No ???water??? jets will be pinpointed, but OH blooms will be identified to be coming from the ridges of craters and from areas of whiteout on the image sensors.  There will be no observed large scale photodissociation of water, as is presumed by standard comet models.  OH production will be wildly out of proportion to observed H production.		8.  The surface will be blackened and charred from electrical scaring.  It will have the albedo of asphalt.		9.  The CONSERT (COmet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission) sensor will return data consistent with a solid piece of rock, not a hollow snowball.		10.  Other sensors will return data consistent with the comet being made up entirely of typical terrestrial rock, devoid of interior ice, discharging an electrically charged plasma coma around the nucleus.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zeus_is_back","name":"t1_clj2rfv","parent_id":"t1_climirj","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1414206802,"created_utc":1414203202}

{"body":"Yes, there is a center of gravity like there is on all objects! Everything from your pencil to the galaxy has a "center of gravity". 		But you have to remember what center of gravity means. A simple explanation would be that from a distance away, the center of gravity is the "point" where you can assume that all of the mass of an object is located. This is also known as the "center of mass". (They are technically different things, but for most purposes they can be assumed to be the same thing). 		Think of it this way... You're standing on a grassy field on the Earth. Everything around you has mass, and everything with mass pulls on you with gravity. The blade of grass on your left is pulling you to the left, the blade of grass on your right is pulling you to the right. The stones under your feet are pulling on you down, and the Great Wall of China on the other side of the world is pulling on you towards China! If you add up all of these "pulls", the point that they would be pulling you to is the center of gravity.  		Now for this comet, I do not know where the center of gravity is, as I do not know how the mass is distributed. Is one of the "halves" much more massive than the other? In which case the center of gravity will not be in the center between the two halves, but closer towards the center of the more massive one.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_Stargazer","name":"t1_clsjt9j","parent_id":"t1_clsi09h","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1415098842,"created_utc":1415098842}
