Previous US cargo missions since the retirement of the Space Shuttle have been berthed, rather than docked, while docking is considered the safer and preferred method for spacecraft carrying humans.	> 	> Secondary payload[edit]	> The mission will carry more than 4,000 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station including the Meteor Composition Determination investigation which will observe meteors entering the Earth's atmosphere by taking high resolution photos and videos. The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space has arranged for it to carry more than 30 student research projects to the station including experiments dealing with pollination in microgravity as well as an experiment to evaluate a solar radiation blocking form of plastic.[3]	> 	> CRS-7 will also bring a pair of modified Microsoft HoloLenses to the International Space Station as part of Project Sidekick.[7] They will allow astronauts to complete complex tasks more easily and aid in communication between astronauts and NASA.[8]			On first look nothing super duper major.

There's no such thing as "safe without a doubt". Chris Hadfield once commented that one of the things you think about during launch is the fact that 1/34 manned flights fail catastrophically.

The flight termination system (FTS) is a backup self-destruct built into all american rockets. The idea is that if something goes wrong with the rocket, or if control seems to be lost, it's a lot better to lose a rocket than it is to have the rocket potentially go towards something you don't want it to go towards (like people).		I'll update this if people seem to want it.		**Edit 1:** There was an issue with (over?)pressurization on the second stage.

Grow from here. Could help in expediting future development from lessons learned.		* Not aware of any FTS signal sent to the Falcon 9.		* SpaceX is having another technical meeting after the 10AM PST press conference and will update with more details afterwards.		* Investigation by SpaceX should only last a few months; paperwork to be reviewed by FAA afterwards.		* Still moving forward with Progress resupply on the 3rd. 		* Crew mission via Soyuz still on track for mid-July.		* Current logistics on board will allow for crew to remain on station until end of October.		* Have a second IDA (international docking adapter) and parts to build a third.		* Multi-filtration beds for the ECLSS Water Recycling System were lost on last two attempts (CRS-7 being one) and progress will be made to get new ones made by the end of the year; will examine contaminant breakdown but currently isn't enough to be considered harmful - they also have enough extra water for four months. 		* EMU on station that was going to be replaced with one aboard Dragon will have to have its pump replaced (as the suit itself was going to be replaced). Two other EMUs are on station.		* Important down-mass was successfully sent with Dragon 6 leaving mostly just trash as excess mass on station that would've have been delivered upon 7's return.		* I'll update when I remember more later below...		* Dragon 2's ELS would have worked easily to save crew had this happened on a human launch... designed for even more energetic anomalies.

{"body":"It happened right after they began MVac chilldown.			My money is on some buildup of pressure due to a faulty valve or some such, causing an oxygen rupture that filled the interstage fairing and ruptured it, removing the structural integrity of the rocket and allowing aerodynamic forces to crush the interstage and then the rest of the rocket like a pop can. 			Of course this isn't nice, but at least on the bright side SpaceX may find the cause of this problem and implement a fix that makes this failure mode a thing of the past. Thus making the F9 safer and more reliable than it has been all along, something that's good for commercial crew. I wish SpaceX the best and I hope this launch failure doesn't tarnish their relatively new reputation. Remember that most (or all) rocket companies have had multiple launch failures on multiple vehicles in the beginning, and only after a lot of time and successful launches did they get as reliable as today.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Norose","name":"t1_cslgh2d","parent_id":"t3_3bejxp","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1435509237,"created_utc":1435505637}

First stage continues on its merry way followed by a minor explosion/rupture of something and a second larger explosion/rupture that tears everything apart.		If the Dragon was the part that fell off I wonder if they had any chance to recover it?
