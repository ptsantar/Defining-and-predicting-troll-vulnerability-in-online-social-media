But, and this is a big but, Pluto's orbit takes it through the space occupied by the Neptune Trojan asteroids. Based on the large distance and the dim light out there, and the few Neptune Trojans that have been found so far, some very credible astronomers predict that there are as many or more asteroids on the Neptune Trojans, than in the main asteroid belt, plus the Jupiter Trojans. That would mean that Pluto could experience an impact rate roughly equal to Mars, or Earth, or the Moon, or maybe much less, because the volume occupied by the Neptune Trojan asteroid belt is about 3000 times larger than the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.		So far as I know, there are a lot of conflicting theories on the density of asteroids out by Pluto.

(compared to 47 TW efflux from the core to outer surface,)		- without solar radiation, the planet would quickly cool down and become inactive.			*Mercury is quite an exception because his outer crust has been ripped off by asteroid impacts and he is made of very dense material now.*","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pat000pat","name":"t1_ct5cof0","parent_id":"t1_ct4s247","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437059645,"created_utc":1437056045}

{"body":"> Solar radiation is the reason why earth has not cooled down like Mars did.		No, that's because Mars is like 33% smaller than the Earth, we have much more heat from our formation to radiate away, and more radioactive materials to decay. I'll see if I can figure out where the balance of internal/external energy is -- my guess is that it's within 10km of the surface of the Earth, that is to say, my guess is that that only the first 0.1% of the radius of the Earth is maintaining temperature due to the Sun, while the rest of it is due to radioactive decay. Basically it wont take much depth to "eat up" all 173,000 watts, within 1% radius I bet the internal and external flux is equal (say 5,000 watts internal and 5,000 watts external), from there on it's all due to radioactive decay. Again, otherwise the temperature would drop as you dig down, not go up. At equilibrium the temperature increases towards a heat source, yea? If the Earth was maintaining temperature only due to the Sun then the surface would be the hottest part and it would get colder as you go down.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Pithong","name":"t1_ct5bx9u","parent_id":"t1_ct544aw","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437058288,"created_utc":1437054688}

{"body":"Nearly *everything* in space is in orbit around something. Some things are also on sub-orbital trajectories (meaning they will smash into something at some point), but they are simultaneously in a real orbit around either a small body, a planet, a star system, or the centre of the galaxy itself - and more often than not, several of those things simultaneously.		Anything that is not moving fast enough to be in orbit will be destroyed in short order as it is falls straight into the nearest significant gravitational body (a sub-orbital trajectory). But keep in mind that even if there was an asteroid somehow at a dead stop in our solar system, and it would then immediately start falling into the sun or a planet, that asteroid is still in orbit in the galaxy (along with everything else in the solar system). And if it's a planet it falls into, then the asteroid is also quickly being placed into an orbit around the Sun as it accelerates towards the planet. Falling towards anything in space tends to give you the velocity necessary to get into orbit around something else. You can't just be "zipping through space" without achieving either an orbit or sub-orbital destruction very quickly.		The only difference between a comet and an asteroid is the material it's made of.

{"body":"The data will take 16 months to be sent back because the transmit rate is between 1 and 4 kilobits per second. (yes, bits, not bytes or nibbles). This was talked about in the project scientists' AMA yesterday. 		I'm a satellite systems engineer, and though I've never worked something interplanetary, I think I understand the decision behind this. 		1. The spacecraft needed a big boost to get out to Jupiter in time to make its gravity-assist flyby rendezvous, but they were limited to a ~~Delta~~ **ATLAS V** rocket, which constrained the mission's maximum weight. 		2. Getting a high data transmit rate would require a larger high-gain antenna (that big dish looking thing), which takes more mass. 		3. They'd rather use that mass to put on more science instruments, because that's what planetary scientists do. 		4. It came down to the following trade-off: Do we put on the larger antenna and more powerful transmitter and get our data back in a month, or do we make those smaller and put on one or two more instruments, but have to wait 16 months to get all the data?		So the scientists chose the slower data stream, simply because THIS IS ENOUGH DATA TO KEEP THEM BUSY FOR SEVERAL YEARS, it doesn't matter if they can't get it all at once. 		Other missions, like Kepler or the Mars Rovers, or Hubble don't have this flexibility. They are collecting data all the time, at a (kinda) constant rate. So their downink speeds have to at least keep up, or else their disks will get full and keep getting more full. 		Since New Horizons is only going to have 3 data collection bursts separated by many years (Jupiter, Pluto, whichever KBO they visit next), they can make the download pretty slow without filling up the disk.","depth":4,"score":195,"ups":195,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_ct4lg2b","parent_id":"t1_ct4i0wd","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436997679,"created_utc":1436994079}

You also have to realize that they probably need to coordinate other stuff (station keeping, health monitoring, etc), so effective bandwidth is actually under 1kbps. It can also compress the pictures and send those, basically thumbnails so they can decide what to download next. If you assume they send a thumbnail first, and then download everything (they look at them, sort them, then download), well the thumbnails actually increase the data to be transmitted past the 8GB mark, so call it 9GB (I really have no idea how much). I'd assume they have the capability to pause and resume a partial download (so they can probably download pictures over multiple days or whatever).

Other probes will get priority, other probes need those dishes, and only a fraction of them can point point at NH at any time (about 8 hours a day for each dish, they are placed so if you get [the right] three dishes in the same day you can get 24 hour coverage).

Basically you create a new network on that repeater PC, and you link that network to the home network with the internet. So your bedroom components all link to that PC, and the PC links to the router, and the router to the modem, and the modem to **the internet**. 		It's a neat way of boosting signal in certain areas. Also, useful if your laptop gets WiFi outside your house, but your phone doesn't. Just take your Laptop outside, set it on the patio or whatever, keep it plugged in, and have it act as a repeater.

If you want to go Pluto [*], read down to the green square.  You need to increase your speed to 41.599km/s, so you burn (41.599 - 29.785) amount of fuel to increase your speed to that value.  		You are now in a new orbit, one that has a perihelion (closest to sun) at Earth, and an aphelion at 39AU, Pluto distances.  Wait several decades, and you will be at that aphelion.

So getting from Earth-orbit to Pluto-orbit involves two speed ups:		* one that moves from a 1AU-radius-circle to a really stretched out ellipse	* one that moves from that stretched out ellipse to a 39.5AU-radius-circle.

The resolution will also vary for the luminescent sections where most of the heart for example will be in high res (more detailed than released today) with other areas in lower res which I believe to be comparable to today's photo.

{"body":"You ask a good question.  		Are you familiar with the term "escape velocty"?  It is the speed at which you will never return to a gravitational body.  It is equal to Sqrt (2GM/r) where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the body you are escaping from, and r is your distance from that object.		One interesting thing to point out is, if you increase r to infinity, the escape velocity is 0.  This is not a coincidence; this is because when your velocity equals the escape velocity, you have enough energy to go forever, but when at infinite distance you will be stopped.  And as you approach infinite distance, you will be going very very slowly.  		New Horizons was launched from Earth with a velocity greater than the escape velocity to escape the solar system.  It also used a flyby of Jupiter to be going even faster.  It will not be returning to Earth, or the inner solar system.

{"body":"One of our very own space crafts just passed a planetary object nearly 5 billion miles from our home, and sent us high resolution photographic evidence...				...Human beings are scary.				We breathe a corrosive gas, drink one of the most potent solvents.				Our preferred method of hunting was persistence hunting, where we chased animals until their body simply gave up and died.				We can eat just about anything we find, which means that we don't need to stop for food when chasing our prey.				If we can't find food, that's fine. Our body will simply begin to eat itself so that we don't have to stop chasing our prey.				We walk upright, we sweat, we don't have much body hair, which allows us to radiate away our body heat. This means that excessive time or extreme environment wont stop our hunts.				If the animal fights back against us, we can take massive damage to our extremities and lose half our blood and still live.				Our entire existence is owed to persistence, endurance, and determination. When we put ourselves to a task, it gets done, period. And this instinct is still affecting us today.				332BC: Alexander the Great hits a stalemate with the fortified island city of Tyre. Instead of going back defeated, he builds a kilometer long bridge in order to raze the city.				49BC: Cesar, after defeating the Gauls and invading Britain, turns a political fight into a civil war by invading Italy with only a single legion. He eventually becomes dictator starting a world superpower whose engineering feats are only recently being broken.				1804AD: A charismatic French general declares himself Emperor and sets off to conquer much of mainland Europe. He is captured, exiled, and then escapes. The soldiers sent to recapture him instead lay down their arms and join him.				1961AD: One man decides that we will go to the moon, despite much of the technology to do so not even existing yet. Just eight years later, two humans stand on the surface of the moon and look back upon the Earth.				200 years ago, we didn't have railroads. 100 years ago, we didn't have airplanes. 50 years ago, we didn't have spaceflight. 25 years ago we didn't have the Internet.

Since the spaceship is travelling at such a high speed, slowing it down is not an option, only deviating its path is possible. In 2011, NASA used the Hubble and several ground based telescopes to identify potential future targets after the Pluto flyby that were in the vicinity of the flight path. PT1, PT2 and PT3 were subsequently identified. PT2 has since be discarded as a candidate due to low probability of success in getting there.

It once flew through an immense cloud of ionized gases just floating through space outside the heliopause.		We literally don't know if there is any limit to the Solar System when it comes to random floating objects orbiting the Sun. Even the Oort cloud was first theorized when we noticed comets repeatedly visiting the inner system. The Kuiper belt object Sedna, is another curious object whith such a huge orbit that its difficult to claim for sure that there is nothing beyond.		Also, Neptunes sometimes weird orbiting pattern has led many astronomers to theorize the presence of larger bodies in the far distant corners of the Solar System.		Beyond heliopause lies the scary aspect of deep deep space, where even solar radiation is considered to be a friendly blanket of sorts. Here, cosmic radiation from all directions will bombard any object, a rather difficult region for anything organic to survive. Maybe NH, when it reaches here in the 2020s will tell us. It can reach PT1 with less than 30% of its remaining fuel reserves, leaving a lot more for further exploration.

And you can do a lot with a flyby. You can image the whole surface, something a lander can't do.

Also, the purpose of the cameras isn't to take nice pictures, but to do science.  Picture cameras have fixed individual red, green, and blue filters over each of the pixels.  You can think of it as taking three pictures at the same time, each with a third of the resolution.  		Science cameras, on the other hand, use a mobile, changeable filter over the entire pixel array.    They could have an infrared filter to highlight sources of heat.  They could have a blue-green filter to detect copper compounds.  In other words, they choose the filters to help them detect specific parts of the spectrum, which gives much more valuable scientific data than a regular camera can.

Pluto is the largest and most interesting world beyond the orbit of Neptune. It snows methane, ammonia and carbon monoxide ice onto its surface. It has seasons that last for centuries. And the shocking new information revealed today suggests that Pluto is somehow still geologically active- it has a molten core, and potentially cryovolcanism- think volcanoes, but with liquid water instead of lava!		>no relevance to anyone		I don't see how it could be any *less* relevant. Despite being billions of kilometers apart, the Pluto-Charon system shares remarkable similarities with the Earth-Moon system. Firstly, Charon- Pluto's largest moon- is thought to have formed in an impact similar to the way our moon was. Comparing the two and how they differ could improve our knowledge of how our moon formed, in the planet annihilating event that ultimately led to the appearance of life on our planet. 		And Pluto itself is a surprisingly good Earth analog. Its atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, just like ours. Learning about it will improve our understanding of Earth's atmosphere too. And Pluto's atmosphere is constantly escaping into space. It's thought that the early Earth's atmosphere did the same. So by looking at Pluto we can understand hydrodynamic escape, a process that hasn't occurred for billions of years on Earth. It's thought that hydrodynamic escape is where the oceans of Mars went, too. And again, this process was crucial in the shaping of our planet to the point where life appeared on its surface 3 and a half billion years ago.		>If I could spend this money on, say, a Europa mission...DEFINITELY would go for Europa instead.
