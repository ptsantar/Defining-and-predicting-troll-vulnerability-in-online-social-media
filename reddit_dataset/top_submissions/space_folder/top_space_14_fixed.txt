{"body":"Actually there's been some data to suggest that the bright feature isn't ice or snow at all but might be outgassing of some sort, a plume essentially. This comes from the scientists observing that the bright spot was still visible at an angle where the interior surface of the crater should have been below the lip of the crater, essentially it was still visible when a surface feature should have been out of the spacecrafts line of sight.

{"body":"Sand, at least on Earth, is usually made of tiny quartz grains. Quartz is particularly resistant to erosion due to water, and is usually the last thing left behind after water has dissolved everything else. This is why it tends to be at riverbeds and beaches. 		The expected composition of the rocks on Ceres are more like basalt. Basalt tends to be too silicon poor to form quartz. The normal source of quartz is missing making it unlikely to be sand in the traditional sense. Additionally, with it's small gravity, it's unlikely that liquid water ever existed in any substantial quantity required for the erosion process to wear down the other materials to leave only quartz behind.		There is the possibility that silicates are extracted from the basalt using hydrothermal activity and then deposited into vein systems using high temperature fluids (water), but this is again unlikely given the expected composition and size of Ceres. Any heat of formation has long since become irrelevant, so the only source of new heat on Ceres is the sun (not nearly hot enough to melt anything, or produce hydrothemal fluids) or impacts from asteroids. Impact are quite a reasonable trigger for hydrothermal events, but they would be few and far between these days, and would probably not concentrate enough quartz to be the source of a feature so large.		So, the main problem is, no source of sand. Ceres is within the so-called 'snow line' in the solar system when it comes to water ice which means it's also too close to the sun to form substantial carbon dioxide ice except in shadowed areas, and any impact would probably cause that ice to sublimate away when exposed. Ammonia or methane ices are too cold for Ceres. Other ices are too exotic to exist in quantities greater than water ice.		Even if it is water ice, it receives too much sunlight for it to be a persistent feature. At the nearest point of the orbit, at the warmest part of the day, it should be about 235 K (approx -40 C or F) which is cold, but still warm enough for ice exposed to sunlight to sublimate away. In which case, it must be fresh material. This means there is either an active process on the surface, or recent impact events which exposed the ice. If this is the case, then some component of it may be dry ice and not water ice.

{"body":"It's still unlikely. If the sand was delivered by an asteroid in an impact, that sand still needed to be in that asteroid. For much the same reasons as the sand being unlikely on Ceres, it's highly unlikely to exist in an asteroid.		Just as we find chunks of Mars or Vesta that have landed on Earth, it is possible for impacts to happen on earth that kick up chunks of Earth rock and fling them out into the solar system. However, the amount of sand we'd require to explain that white spot is enormous. To deliver that much sand would require an impact of the sort that wipes out all life on Earth or larger. 		Assuming the sand started on Earth, to eject material from Earth to reach Ceres, you'd need a delta-v of at least 16 km/s. For a 1 km cube of sand, that's on the order of 10^23 J of energy, or about the amount of energy released during the Chicxulub impact event (which wiped out the dinosaurs). When an object of this size and speed impacts Ceres, it would certainly be vapourised leaving no sand behind.

When you try to take a photo of something very dark you need to expose for a long time (or pump the sensor voltage up a lot) but the camera only has so much range.		E.g. You want something 'black' to appear 'visibly' grey so you need to capture enough light from the black area to be able to see it.		Problem is that you obviously can't decide what you're capturing light 'from' so if there's something more reflective in the shot it'll give you a lot more light than you want (and appear white).		It's a basic overexposure problem.		The overexposed area doesn't have to reflect a lot of light.

Who is 'fooling themselves'? I have no idea where you're getting this notion from that every human is out of touch with their emotions. If the human race wants to survive, it needs to solve the problems that pose a threat to its elimination - disease and environment being the main two. These are engineering problems that require much domain knowledge, technical aptitude, and creativity. How does emotion help to solve these problems (specifically, not more abstract terms that don't mean anything).","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iamcornh0lio","name":"t1_cr93e00","parent_id":"t1_cr92xk2","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1431629175,"created_utc":1431625575}

By hard science you're referring to math, engineering, physics, etc (not psychology), so you can't make such bold claims without having providing any logic to back up your argument. 		Confirmation bias. Have you ever seen how slow things change in the science world? It's because people continuously look for data and answers that confirm already-held beliefs rather than accepting new data that might be to the contrary. See: plate tectonics, the lipid hypothesis and monoamine hypothesis (still accepted today, despite massive evidence that they are incorrect), the helio-centric model of the solar system. 		Confirmation bias isn't logical, but it happens, and defines much of what goes on in the scientific community. Ask any scientist about confirmation bias and they'll lament about how funding usually gets provisioned to people looking to reinforce the status quo narrative.		>It's purely your anecdotal experience which does not match my experience.		Look anywhere on Reddit. You'll see people going "LOGIC AND REASON, BRO" pretty much constantly while ignoring their own confirmation bias. /r/atheism is a good example of this behaviour - they claim "logic and rationality," but then exist in a dogmatic vacuum not unlike the people they claim to despise. Same goes for MRAs, SJWs, or whatever reactionary group you can think of - they all claim they're the only ones thinking "rationally" about their given subjects.		>Another abstract claim with no way to understand what you mean here.		Family relations. Community relations. Macro-economic relations. Geopolitical relations. At every level of society, emotions run high, and interactions between people are not governed through Taylorist mathematical formulaes of who gets what 1/1000th of a resource vs. who don't, but rather allegiances, familiarity, ingroup/outgroup behaviours, and so on. Basic sociology.		>I have no idea where you're getting this notion from that every human is out of touch with their emotions.		>disease and environment being the main two.		ICBMs, biological weapons, economic theories that leave large portions of the population without the resources to survive, war. Inventing a spaceship that can travel to Alpha Centauri won't solve those problems, but people in this very thread are saying, "we need to go to Alpha Centauri to survive!" as if space-travel is some kind of panacea. We could easily survive on this planet with the resources we had if we showed people empathy and stopped making so many people's lives Kafka-esque contrived situations which lead them to make terrible decisions and ultimately perpetuate the problem to the next generation. We *have* the technology to do this, and yet people keep thinking that the Next Big Thing will be invented and save us all.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cr93u1z","parent_id":"t1_cr93e00","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1431629881,"created_utc":1431626281}
{"body":"Ok thank you for being explicit, I understand your points now.		point 1 - I don't see confirmation bias in my field, but there are researchers that work toward getting better scores on outdated metrics simply because that's the stipulation for their funding, so I understand your point.		point 2 - Those are just examples of laypeople who have never studied logic and likely have flaws in their epistemic belief-forming method. I don't see how that implies that humans collectively shun emotions.		point 3 - makes sense now		point 4 - I think we're defining "survival" differently. Survival of the human race does not require that we end starvation and share our resources equally. Survival requires us to solve the problems that could potentially eliminate every single human - this is why I believe disease and environment are the two biggest threats. And again, the sub-problems in these domains are engineering problems and we don't need emotion to find an optimal solution. Sure, we need emotion to create the type of world that we want to live in, but I don't think you have a strong enough argument to claim it as a necessary component for survival. I mean, ants and mosquitos survive, right? You can't claim that emotion is necessary for humans to survive without extrapolating that claim for other biological creatures as well.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iamcornh0lio","name":"t1_cr94uja","parent_id":"t1_cr93u1z","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1431631505,"created_utc":1431627905}

{"body":"Because way before our time, a pinnacle race found that AI and Organic life just DON'T mix. They can never reach understanding of each other or their motives. Because of this they're always in some kind of conflict. The two types of life were so alien, they couldn't really get symbiotic like plants and animals or other organic species. Kind of like Ender's Game. The Formics and humans were just too alien from one another to coexist without a radical change in behavior from one or the other. The Formics were TRYING to get in contact with the humans but they just didn't understand that we're all *individuals*, and that we even communicated verbally. They communicated via quantum entanglement (more or less) neural pathways. When they tried it with us, we were totally mute. Totally silent. So they got afraid. They knew this advanced civilization was right around the corner, they were running out of resources and had NO idea what we were going to do. So they went to war. To them, they'd wage war by killing off all of their rivals workers that the hivemind controlled. When they did that to us, they didn't realize they were essentially killing millions of individual 'hive minds'. 		So in Mass Effect, the pinnacle race decided, "lets build something that's NOT organic and NOT AI." And they built *them*. Except *they* decided that organic life will always persist and machine life will always inevitably be created by organic life. So their conclusion was to wipe out highly-intelligent space faring organic species every 50,000 years, and destroy or repurpose the AI they created to nothing more than basic machines. They then use the new things both the AI and the organics learned to improve *themselves*. Each cycle was relatively different in that they'd bring all kinds new perspectives that they could use to gain new perspectives on their surroundings. Essentially they were using our competition between AI and organic life for their benefit.","depth":5,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mirrory","name":"t1_cr9btin","parent_id":"t1_cr91bxt","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1431642547,"created_utc":1431638947}

{"body":"I found this on an interesting article, and some people's explanations on what it could be.:		* This is, in fact, water-ice. Frozen water at the bottom of this crater, quite surprisingly, remains stable, even in direct sunlight, even near the equator. This rocky, giant asteroid can stably hold onto this ice, even over billions of years.		* This is some other form of ice: perhaps frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice), which has a higher molecular weight than water does. In some ways, this would be even more surprising, since even though it???s more difficult for it to reach escape velocity, dry ice sublimates at a much lower temperature than water does.	* This is some solid, rock-like feature that simply has a different reflectivity (or albedo) than the rest of the asteroid. This could be intrinsic to Ceres (its version of bedrock) or it could have been from material brought to Ceres by an impact.

We've seen comets up close before but they don't really count as kuiper belt objects as they have had their surfaces evaporated away after thousands of close encounters of the sun. Thankfully, New Horizons is just a couple of months away from imaging the first fresh, pristine kuiper belt objects- Pluto and its 5 moons. 		And that's ignoring the centaurs, minor objects that are both like asteroids and like comets too. Two of the largest centaurs, Chariklo and Chiron, both have complex ring systems! We've never even gotten close to one with a probe.		So yeah. We haven't even come close to answering the 'big mysteries' since there's so much of the solar system we've yet to explore.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"0thatguy","name":"t1_cr9aind","parent_id":"t1_cr97t2l","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1431640433,"created_utc":1431636833}

{"body":"You should read up on actual stellar evolution some time.  There's pretty much zero chance that what you're saying could occur, considering that objects like the Moon (which seems to have formed from the debris ejected when Earth experienced a giant impact about 4.5 billion years ago, going by its composition) don't have enough mass to be the cores of gas planets, let alone stars.		A star like the Sun is going to leave behind a white dwarf (composed *almost entirely* of carbon and oxygen) of between about 0.5 and 0.62 times its present-day mass, and extremely low-mass stars (down to about 0.08% the Sun's mass) will still leave behind helium white dwarfs heftier than the majority of substellar objects - and these will take an almost unfathomably long time to cool down to temperatures like those of Ceres.  Even if they had a source to strip more mass away, they'd still be much denser than any regular planet or moon could be, which we can see in [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_J1719-1438_b) former CO white dwarf-turned planet (which has been stripped down to a mass comparable to Jupiters, but is much denser than any regular planet could be, with a radius similar to or smaller than Neptune's).","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sinndogg2","name":"t1_cr9jih5","parent_id":"t1_cr91ywt","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1431656524,"created_utc":1431652924}
