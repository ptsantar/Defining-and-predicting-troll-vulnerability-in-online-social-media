{"body":"I agree, but I'd say it's both the sensor AND the lens. 		The materials of the lens differs from the organic features of the eye. The eye has the ability to use muscles to relax or contract to adjust focus. Lenses, on the other hand, are inorganic and adjust focus by rotating numerous optical elements.		I'll also add to the sensor argument.		Camera also generally have better acuity. Because there isn't an optical nerve taking up spots where cones and rods are, camera sensors, unlike human eyes, lack a blind spot. While the eye also has something called the fovea centralis, which returns the highest visual acuity and color sensitivity of the eye, the sensor of a lens is more distributed with high acuity throughout the image (and slight dropoff towards the edges). If you actually used the human eyes as a camera lens, you could see this blind spot and peripheral blur.		HOWEVER, eyes, unlike sensors, have incredible dynamic range. We can focus on dark, we can focus on light, and trick ourselves into seeing both simultaneously.

{"body":"\#1. Most of them. Some are volcanic, but volcanic activity has been pretty much dead for a long time.		\#2/3. Nope. A lot of the impacts took place when the moon was still melted, so they disappeared immediately. And a lot of later impacts were covered up by subsequent hits, since the moon is so covered in craters that almost any new crater will destroy an existing one		\#4. Theres been impacts observed even recently, though I don't think any were large enough to make a crater visible without a huge telescope. No idea about the larger craters, theres probably some estimates on age but for the most part it'll be difficult to accurately guess without having samples from the surface		\#5. No. The moon is basically covered in craters. On earth, most asteroids burn up in the atmosphere before even reaching the ground, and the ones that do hit are mostly small so their craters are covered up by erosion and volcanic activity and such relatively quickly. Its very hard for a crater to form and stay intact on a geologically active planet with a thick atmosphere. There are some craters here, but the majority of them are from very large impacts (rocks several tens of meters to kilometers wide that can survive atmospheric entry and produce a crater big enough to withstand erosion). For such large craters weve probably got about the same distribution as the moon, but small ones are nearly non existent on earth		Edit: fuck reddit formatting.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brickmack","name":"t1_cqu6zle","parent_id":"t1_cqu5eci","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1430426600,"created_utc":1430423000}
