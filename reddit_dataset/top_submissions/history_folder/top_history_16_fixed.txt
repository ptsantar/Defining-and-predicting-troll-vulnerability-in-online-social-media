{"body":"My Great Grandfather used to tell my Grabdfather about this all the time, he was a vallet in England before the war, so he knew English quite well. When war broke out he came back home to Germany. He fought in the Western theater and in 1914, they were winning and thought the war would be over soon, or at least thats what they had been told. They were in good spirits that year and for Christmas, their unit had been shipped Christmas trees and they were trying to put them up on the trenches. The British on the other hand would try shooting them down. After awhile of getting frustrated at having to put up the trees, my great grandfather started screaming and yelling across the lines to stop shooting because its Christmas, in english. The English responded, and suggested there be a cease fire. One of the minor lieutenants, agreed and they all got out of the trenches, collected their dead and exchanged small trinkets. About half the day went by before the higher up officers put a stop to it. He always would tell my grandfather, that by the next year, after all the killing, there wasnt any joy left for Christmas. He liked to recall that particular part of the war, and the story got passed down from my Grandfather to me. Anyhow thats my little family history story.","depth":0,"score":509,"ups":509,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"deathnoose15","name":"t1_cn4uyo6","parent_id":"t3_2qcd0i","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419490256,"created_utc":1419490256}

Also "the people in power" didn't make sure the following Christmas was a blood bath, the men themselves did.

You can actually [read it here.](https://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/dokumente/hollweg/) *Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegzielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914???1918*, published by Fritz Fischer, used this document published in September 1914 by the German government to prove it was a war of German aggression and it is still the principle academic work today on it. Here are the translated things they wanted:		1. All fortifications from Dunkirk to Boulogne will be destroyed.		2. The ore rich area of Briey will be annexed outright. Coastal strips in the North would also fall under German control.		3. War debts shall be imposed on France so large that she is incapable of rearming herself for 15-20 years		4. The French will cease all trade with Great Britain and will be reliant on the Germans economically.		5. Either the outright annexation of Belgium or the seizure of lands up to Antwerp and making the rest a "vassal state"		6. Luxemburg integrated into the empire as a "Germanic State" (think how Prussia, Bavaria, Wurttemburg, and Saxony were quasi-independent states in the Empire)		7. The creation of a Central European economic sphere (think EU almost) of the German client states in the West and the newly formed states created in the East from a supposed Russian defeat as well. All client/buffer states of Germany, of course. Translated it states *" including France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Austria-Hungary, Poland and tolls. Italy, Sweden and Norway. This association will not have no common constitutional supreme superficial equality of its members, but actually under German leadership, must the economic dominance over Central Europe stabilize. "*		8. The annexation of all Central African colonies controlled by Belgium and France -- basically creating a continuous state across the continent.		Now, there is no such document describing the war goals for Russia but we don't need one -- because the Germans beat the Russians and signed a favorable treaty. It's called the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. [Here is a map of the territorial gain of Germany.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Armisticebrestlitovsk.jpg) [A more in depth map.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Map_Treaty_Brest-Litovsk.jpg) The Ukraine would be declared an independent state (but basically under Germany's thumb as a buffer state), Germany would gain control of the Baltics, the Russians would pay billions in gold marks. This treaty in many ways conforms to the goals and intents stated above by Germany with respect to the West.		> You have to remember that the Germans easily defeated France in the Franko-Prussian War of 1870 and could have tried to claim the whole country. Instead, all they wanted was the region of France closest to Essen since the area was populated with ethnic Germans & German was the prefered langauge spoken there.		It's about a 50/50 split where one part speaks mostly German and the other part speaks mostly French -- Alsace Lorraine. It was not some holy grail of German lands the evil French were clinging onto unfairly it was legitimately a contested piece of land for centuries with both ethnic groups in there. The way you paint it is as if it was some war to reclaim a bunch of land that vied to be German again but it was just another war of conquest.		The Franco-Prussian War was neither necessarily good or bad it was just the norm -- goading the enemy into war and then using it to seize land and unite the Bavarians and Badanese and Saxons under your banner to solidify the idea of a unified Germany. Nothing more. It was not some noble crusade to free German lands.		> What the Prussians intended to do was carve out a unified Germany by using their military to take ownership of every part of Germany where ethnic Germans resided. They had fought & defeated the Austrians, Danes besides the French and in each time only took the portions of their countries where Germans were the majority.		And yet excluded many parts of Austria that had ethnic Germans in it and Russia as well. They took what they could get. The Franco-Prussian War was mostly about bringing Bavaria and Saxony and Baden into the fold along with forcing France to recognize a unified Germany rather than 'free German people' or any nonsense like that.		> Between 1600-1820 the French had invaded the Germanic states more than thirty different times, so they saw each other as traditional enemies. 		What a disingenuous way to start a paragraph. Your bias is starting to show and by starting I mean totally apparent. You say the French invaded Germany over 30 times and then say they were mortal enemies because of it -- strongly painting the point that France was the natural aggressor and Germany was just a hopeless defender (a theme which repeats itself throughout your post). You also paint every single army and every single campaign as a totally separate invasion which is just outright being misleading and using loaded terms to make a point. You're inflating numbers so you can make the French seem villainous and it's kind of obvious.		I'm sure you'll completely negate the fact of Hapsburg Spain invading France numerous times during the 30 Years' War and will purposely focus it on only ethnic German armies invading ethnic French territories to further limit yourself. I'm sure you'll completely ignore things like the 7 Years' War which was a war of which French territories were attacked by Britain and Prussia also waged a blatant war of expanionist aggression in Central Europe [which expanded their territory numerous times over.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Acprussiamap2.gif) You paint the Germans as these innocent defenders against French aggression when their entire history from 1600 to 1789 has been blatant wars of aggression and expansion with a military industrial complex that puts even the most radical interpretation of modern America to shame -- over 80-90% of their budget dedicated to their military. They may not have waged war against France that often but their history in that period is painted with the constant wars against Austria, Poland, and Sweden along with the blatant annexation of land for expansionist purposes.		I'm sorry I just can't take a point like this seriously because you just interpret different invasion forces as totally different invasions of "German states" while completely ignoring German imperialism. The Hapsburgs anyone? Prussia? Really just going to ignore that? I just find it hilarious and kind of sad how you mope on later about ethnic German lands being 'stolen' **when the principle territorial expansion of Prussia was divvying of ethnically Polish lands.**		> Of course we all know how much the British and French also hate each other, so in 1914 the Germans completely & sincerly believed that the British would have no reason to care if they defeated France again.

Which is precisely what they did.

Just because Germany was deluded as fuck doesn't mean it was some actual betrayal. We know from actual events of things that actually happened that Britain was backing France as early as 1904. What the fuck did Germany expect? They perform a rapid military buildup of close range battleships to directly contest the North Sea (ie: Britain's border) and to neutralize British naval hegemony and they expect Britain **to come to war on their side?** No fucking way. The French and British create an agreement divvying up Northern Africa between their two claims? ie: Britain recognizes French Algeria, France recognizes British Egypt? Germany tries to start a fucking revolt in the lands to undermine the treaty. Few years later French quell a rebellion in Morocco? **Germany sends a freaking war ship to intervene and mobilize their fleet.** 		I'm absolutely sorry to crush your worldview here and I'm sorry I'm being a dick but for pete's sake it wasn't some surprise Britain went in with France. Germany directly tried to strip Britain of its naval hegemony and directly threaten its home island. Germany directly undermined and intervened in foreign treaties w.r.t. Britain. Germany directly intervened in French colonial disputes with freaking warships -- a naval domain Britain felt was hers and hers alone. Germany was constantly creating problems after unification and Britain realized more and more that continental intervention was necessary to contain them. Britain and Russia solved centuries old claims in Central Asia (mostly Persia) just so that they could both play nice and create a three way alliance with France w.r.t. Germany. Just because some Germans thought because they were vaguely ethnically related a thousand years ago during the Saxon invasion doesn't mean it was some kind of shocker.			> Then when the treaty to end WW1 destroyed the German economy and gave areas populated by a majority of ethnic Germans to other countries, it set the stage for WW2 out of desire for revenge.

[I go into that here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ethjc/was_it_known_or_suspected_that_the_treaty_of/ck2z0z2) which should clear some things up. Notably this bit:		> The final war bond drive would acquire 40% less "subscribers" (citizen donators) than needed. The German people just did not have the money to throw it away at war bonds when they could barely find a loaf of bread to feed their family. **In response to this the German government would begin just flat out printing money to pay for the war hoping that in a victory they would seize so much economic potential from conquered territories that it wouldn't matter.** Obviously they lost and the exact opposite happened -- they were the ones partitioned. This leads me to final point: **By the armistice Germany was spending 90% of its ordinary budget on interest payments acquired through war debt.** The German government had effectively sabotaged their own economy from pure incompetence.		> . . .**What happened next was not incompetence but deliberate sabotage however. Rudolf Havenstein, president of the Reichbank from 1908 to 1923, would deliberately and intentionally conspire with other critical members of the German government to sabotage their own currency.** The belief, as you can read more in depth in Sally Marks' *The Myths of Reparations*, was that **by destroying their economy and basically sending inflation intentionally into overdrive they would force the Entente powers to reconsider and even remove reparations and sanctions. It was also an act of post-war aggression.** They had lost the military war but wanted to win the economic one. **By basically screwing the French out of their reparation payments needed to rebuild their country and industry the Germans would (theoretically) destroy the French economy in tandem** by restricting their rebuilding process.		Germany fucked themselves over, nobody else. You whine and whine about France stealing German territories when it was Germany trying to seize territory which had been French since 1648 all the way in 1914 -- and that wasn't even the beginning considering the *Septemberprogramme* proves they wanted to take far more than that. Wanted to annex Belgium, take the northern French coastline, completely demilitarize France similarly to how they were, and so on and so on.		Yet all that is conveniently left out. What happened to Germany was precisely what Germany wanted to do to France and Russia. 		> This is why the V-rockets that attacked England start with the letter V. V is for Vengeance.		Er, no. It's V for *Vergeltungswaffen*, which means *"Retaliation Weapon"* -- a retaliation in 1944/45 for the unrestricted British bombing of German cities...","depth":7,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elos_","name":"t1_cn571s8","parent_id":"t1_cn571qf","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419536938,"created_utc":1419536938}

Things *'Franko-Prussian War of 1870 and could have tried to claim the whole country. Instead, all they wanted was the region of France closest to Essen"* and *"Between 1600-1820 the French had invaded the Germanic states more than thirty different times, so they saw each other as traditional enemies."* and *"The Germans hoped to recreate their victory of 1870 and use it to take over France's colonies, since the Germans had been largely left out during Europe's period of Imperialism because it had taken them so long to form a unified country."* make it seem like you're saying, at least from my reading, that the Germans were just trying to take their rightful place in the world / defend ethnic Germans while those French were trying to keep them down for over 220 years which is just spouting Willhelm II's propaganda (no offense).		I mainly took issue with your characterization of WWI though because the lines of British support of France had been solidly placed by 1914.

You're failing to see why I used it if you think this was what I was trying to accomplish.

This is actually quite untrue. Once the British got involved there was intense discussion publicly back in Germany over it and the common sentiment by the German masses was the feeling of betrayal.

Yet that is what the high command wanted to use those shells for.

So the British talked to reporters about the problem and the reporters made it a big national scandal at home and it resulted in the creation of the Ministry of Munitions as a way of trying to make sure such a huge mistake never happened again. This satisified the British grunts at the line.		But the French had the same problem, and refused to do anything about it. Worse anyone who dared try to inform the public about it like the British soldiers had, was threatened with court martials and reporters were banned from discussing the mater under wartime censorship laws. So while the British felt as if their country was willing to listen to their needs, the French felt the opposite. So when this big offensive came they expected a repeat performance of the Somme or Verdun, both of which were huge tragedies due to the shell problem, and revolted.		So to end the mutinies and try to restore order, Nivelle  was sacked and replaced by Petain.

But despite this, actual scholarship regarding the truce is surprisingly sparse, and notable controversies surround the event in academic circles. 		Contrary to the popular impression, the Christmas Truce was not a universal occurrence on the front, and if anything, the popular image of foes cavorting in ???No Man???s Land???, and even playing soccer, are to be chalked up as the exception, rather than the rule. The Truce was a rather spontaneous act, certainly with no pre-planning from higher up, and as such, some units were eager to put aside the fighting for a day, while others were not. The French and Belgians, perhaps to be expected, were generally not eager to fraternize with the enemy (the French Foreign Legion specifically, less so), while it was more wide-spread in British sectors (but certainly not all of them). It happened on the Eastern Front as well (even though Orthodox Christmas was later), and apparently only the Serbs showed zero interest in paling with the enemy for a few hours, as there are no accounts of any sort of ceasefire occurring in the region.		Arrangements for the Truce came about rather informally. In the case of The Scots Guards, they reported that a scout went out late on Christmas Eve and met a German patrol, where they traded a few goodies, and agreed to a ceasefire for the morning. And however it started, almost every account reports that it was the Germans who pushed for the Truce, some apparently through the singing of carols on the night of the 24th that is almost always used in media portrayals - even singing competitions. Major John Hawksley, in the southern part of the Ypres Salient, wrote home that:		>[Both sides] sang in English Home sweet home together. Then God save the King was sung by both. I don???t know what words the Germans sang to this tune. Then late on a German shouted out to the Warwicks ??? ???We won???t fire tomorrow if tomorrow if you don???t???. Our men shouted back ???All right???.???		In other cases however, contact was much less emotional, with just a white flag in the morning leading to a meeting to establish the truce.		Often, the time was used for nothing more than to bury the dead who had been sitting in No-Man???s-Land, as well as the Germans returning a number of dead who attacked a few day???s prior, at least in the section of the Scots Guards. Joint prayer sessions are attested to by the Scots as well, as well as the trading of small goodies and paraphernalia, such as food or badges. But often, whatever Truce existed was little more than an informal understanding to hold fire. Interactions between the two sides in No Man???s Land often lasted no more than 30 minutes or so, rather than an all day affair.		The football games are by far the most famed occurrence, but they were at best informal (In his work on the War, Martin Gilbert notes *"a football was kicked around"*), and real, proper, verified accounts are very few, so how many games actually happened is up in the air (In the recent Sainsbury???s ad, Taff Gillingham, the historical adviser, wrote afterwards that he had to press hard to keep soccer from being a dominant theme of the ad). Although some of the most explicit accounts are certainly frauds, there is enough evidence to believe some games certainly happened though, but far from being a veritable World Cup up and down the front, it at best was little more than a handful of informal games, especially relative to the millions of men then manning the front. In ???To End All Wars" by Hochchild, a German Lt. is quoted quite famously stating:		>Teams were quickly established ??? and the Fritzes beat the Tommies 3???2.		But in fact, this account by Johannes Niemann of the 133rd (9th Royal Saxon) Infantry is a recollection coming many decades after the war, in an interview from the 1960s, and is highly questionable in its details, least of all as he never mentioned it previously when speaking on the topic! Hochchild also notes that a Brit is reported to have written somewhat ambiguously:		>The Germans came out ??? they???re good fellows on the whole and play the game.		But this can fit cleanly into the many verified reports of a *desire* for a game to happen being expressed by both sides, with no game happening, or plans for one at a later date not bearing fruit. One of the best attested to games, written of in a diary kept by an unknown ???Tommy??? mentions a game being played, but heavily implies that it was not against the Germans, but simply among the British themselves taking advantage of the lull:		>a game of football at the back of our trenches! We???ve had a few Germans over to see us this morning. They also sent a party over to bury a sniper we shot in the week. He was about a 100 yards from our trench. A few of our fellows went out and helped to bury him.		He later goes on to note that later in the day there was another brief meeting in No Man???s Land which brought about an exchange of small souvenirs, so it should be clear that had the Germans played too, this would be included! A Capt. Hamilton wrote of a challenge that was issued for a game to be played later (New Years?), noting that *???A Coy were to have played the Saxon Corps, but were relieved???*. In fact, there is, best as I can find, only a bare handful of games played which are corroborated by multiple, reliable sources, as there are two German accounts from the 133rd (9th Royal Saxon), the aforementioned by Lt. Niemann which mention playing a game at Frelinghien against the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on ???a frozen meadow???, and a second from a letter written home by a German soldier to his mother. There is no account from the British side there, but for a second game, we have a degree of corroboration from men of the British 5th Division that they *???kick[ed] a football about between the two firing lines???*, and a second writer noting "*we had a rare old jollification, which included football, in which the Germans took part,*" but just how much of an actual game was played still is up in the air. As with the 133rd???s accounts however, there is again no accounts from the other (German) side in this case.		How long the meetings lasted also varied wildly, with at least a small number of reports of it lasting for some time, and other places maybe just a half hour before officers ordered men back to the trenches. In one of the attested occurrences, which is visible in the afore mentioned Sainsbury???s ad, is a German barber giving a Brit a haircut. Against all odds, according to Hochschild, the German was his normal barber back in London. Which isn???t that hard to believe as there was a large number of Germans who had been in London prior to the outbreak of war, often employed in the service industry. Another German gave a Brit a letter to mail to his British girlfriend. In some places though, the truce ended in gunfire. In at least one area, a Scottish unit ended up shooting a German working party for an unspecified reason, bringing a premature end to the matter. In other sectors, the truce lasted through New Years, or at least a ceasefire remained in place, even if there weren???t further meetings between the lines. In the end, 41 British soldiers were reported killed on the 25th, which while low, was still higher than the numbers for eight other days in the month!		Of course, as I noted, not everyone liked it. Adolf Hitler, among others, was not a fan, and reportedly said *???Such a thing should not happen in wartime. Have you no German sense of honor????*. In French sectors, some French units fired volleys at the Germans and sang ???*Marseillaise*" to celebrate the occasion. On other sectors of the line, attacks were carried out on the 25th, again mostly by the French. And of course the higher-ups were not pleased. When reports showed up of what had happened, commanders quickly sent out orders to stop it from occurring again. Gen. French???s remarked *???I issued immediate orders to prevent any recurrence of such conduct???* (Although Hochschild remarks that during the Boer War, French was happy to send whiskey and cigars under a flag of truce to his Boer counterpart). One account has a German soldier crossing the lines under a flag of truce following a barrage to apologize to the French soldiers of the 99th Infantry on the other side for what had happened, since while they had agreed to a ceasefire through the New Years, higher command had seen fit to ???spoil??? it.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Georgy_K_Zhukov","name":"t1_cn4zs0w","parent_id":"t3_2qcd0i","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419514755,"created_utc":1419514755}
{"body":"And those who weren???t in the trenches didn???t celebrate with the enemy either. The Germans made their first air attack on Britain, bombing Dover on Christmas Eve, and the British Navy attempted to return the favor, sending planes over Cuxhaven on the 25th, although the planes had to turn back, with only one bombing his ???target???, which later turned out to be a fish-drying shed, rather than the Zeppelin hanger he was after. And in an interesting ???first???, a German attempt at a second raid, this time on the 25th, resulted in the first air-to-air interception, with an RFC Gunbus successfully driving off a German FF29 as it attempted to bomb London that day.		Back at home, Socialists and other anti-war activists heralded it as the working-man seeing their common humanity. Keir Hardie wrote that it was part of the soldiers realizing "that the workers of the world are not ???enemies??? to each other, but comrades." Most writer though don???t ascribe such high-minded principles to the matter. Such temporary cessations to hostilities can be found in many earlier conflicts, and really, this was one of the last occurrences of such matters, and unique more for being the end of it, rather than being singular. To quote Peter Hart:		>There was no real desire for compromise or negotiation: the Christmas Truce was an exercise in sentimentality and nothing more.		The next year, truces were much more rare. Commanders gave very strict orders against it, and often artillery barrages were scheduled during the day to discourage any such behavior. Cpl. Pankhurst noted that "*We hailed the smiling morn with five rounds fired fast, and we kept up a slow fire all day."* Presumably, this kind of ruined the caroling that evening.		So in the end, what can we say for certain happened? Well, there was a Truce. At points along the front, the fighting stopped, and both sides met and interacted, but that???s about it. Professionals and reservists, they were more likely driven by their occupational bond as soldiers - the very thing making them fight - than their common humanity. And it is quite wrong to extrapolate that into a front wide occasion, as it was anything but. Given the nature of how the Truce came about it was very much compartmentalized, with the Christmas experience of any given unit varying wildly. Stories of friendly soccer games in No Man???s Land warm the heart, and ???restore faith in humanity???, but they unfortunately give a rather false impression just of what happened, as a few accounts make mention of a football, but the image of games played all over the front is as wrong as can be. Military history is filled with brief lulls such as this, of which the 1914 Truce is really just the last notable occurrence, rather than an anomaly. And as with so many previous interactions with the enemy, we can???t lose sight of the reality, that days later, these men were right back to shooting each other.		**Sources**		To End All Wars by Adam Hochschild		The First World War by Martin Gilbert		The Great War by Peter Hart		Catastrophe by Max Hastings		Britain at War: 1914: An Illustrated History of the First Year of the Great War edited by Martin Mace		Additionally, [the stellar work of Taff Gillingham](http://www.mrallsophistory.com/revision/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Taff-Gillingham-Twitter-combined.pdf), who most recently served as the historical advisor for the Sainsbury's ad.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Georgy_K_Zhukov","name":"t1_cn4zs3b","parent_id":"t1_cn4zs0w","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419514766,"created_utc":1419514766}

{"body":"This is a pretty...sorry to say, bad view of things.		> Their focus on superior technology is what makes them fearsome, but it's also their downfall.		This is a stupendously vague thing to say and really only applies to their most recent war. Yes the Germans were mostly focused on stupid, overly costly superweapon projects in WW2. It's not like they didn't know how to build more of the same thing though. How does this apply to any other war though?		> A panzer will almost always take out an American tank, but it can't take out three American tanks of the same class. The Americans and Russians had simpler, cheaper tanks that were suckier, but quantity beat out quality.		A Panzer can't take out an American tank 'almost every time'. The circlejerk about German tank superiority is just obscene sometimes. The M4's could stand up to a Panzer. The M4's didn't need to stand up to a Tiger because they were glorified bunkers they required so much repairs and oil to operate. Further it's not a soccer match it's a war and that's the big issue with these types of discussions. The issue with a Panzer is that it was not cheap it's that the Germans did not have the capacity like the Americans to perform combined arms operations.		The fact is this. In terms of pure tank on tank warfare the T-34 outclassed the Panzers in just about every imaginable way but the M4 was without a doubt the best tank of the war. Why? *Because it did what tanks were supposed to do.* It was more 'quality' in that respect. What does a tank do? It supports the infantry and strikes the enemy first. It doesn't matter if that Tiger tank can win a 1 on 1 battle because the M4, even just one of them, or a squad of paratroopers can destroy its fuel depot or its parts reservoir and the men inside will have a costly and pretty looking bunker on their hands. 		The M4 could do what few other tanks could -- truly support the infantry in offensive actions. It wasn't there for pretty tank on tank battles because they had a combined arm of air attacks, infantry based anti tank weaponry, and their own weaponry. The fact that entire Tiger Tank and Panzer Tank columns in the Battle of the Bulge were held up by just a few Americans with bazookas shows this most. The German tanks were not quality > quantity they were just not quality for what tanks were meant to do.		> Both sides had massive amount of them. The Germans gave their guys bolt action rifles, but the Americans had M1 Garands, that were more accurate, fired quicker, and most importantly, were mass-produced.		You act like they were just dumb for giving their men bolt action rifles as if they could just switch overnight. It took many months after 1941 for the Americans, who were issuing Marines 1918 issue Springfield *bolt actions*, to switch over to semi-automatic. They were the only army to use semi-automatic rifles en masse because they were the only ones who had the industrial excess to overturn their entire infantry bodies primary weapon and bullet caliber. 		The Germans were not idiots though and they designed their doctrine around it. The German squad was a squad, as in, it was a body that had to work in total unison to work and its machine gun was the centerpiece. The entire infantry squad was centered around protecting the machine gunner and his ammo guy and its officer, 3 guys protected by the rest. The rifles were not there to win the battle the machine gun was, the rifles were there to screen the enemy and keep them away. The Americans did not give their squads, by and large, their own machine guns. They gave them semi-automatic weapons and hoped that they could provide their own covering fire and, surprise, they were actually largely wrong.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elos_","name":"t1_cn57og5","parent_id":"t1_cn56y3m","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419538514,"created_utc":1419538514}

{"body":"Also the narrative wasn't altogether a good one. Usually the rulers can come up with some sort of threat of annihilation or something like that, but the reason for this war was an old school one and it no longer had very much significance to the masses. Modern people needed a better reason to fight a war than what their rulers could supply. The honor of the nation or king and country wasn't a good enough reason anymore. And yet the ruling classes(or more particularly, that of the old guard, monarchies and such) did not yet understand that their moral authority was no longer seen as legitimate in a modern world. Franz Ferdinand died because of this tension, the revolution in Russia happened because of this tension. So, when we see this photo, it shows a lot about the attitudes of the time. Just a few decades ago, people would go to war for the same reasons as they supplied to justify this one. But modern people in Europe were becoming a new kind of person.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ruminating","name":"t1_cn5ffdr","parent_id":"t1_cn5e9jz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419558685,"created_utc":1419558685}

The soldiers didn't refuse orders and stopped fighting for christmas.

They had been with little food, gas and ammunition in the trenches opposite each other for weeks without fighting. As always in such situations there was communication between the fronts. Dead soldiers were exchanged etc. Furthermore, the "Christmas Truce" was only reported from the front in Flanders between the Germans and the small British Expeditionary Force.
