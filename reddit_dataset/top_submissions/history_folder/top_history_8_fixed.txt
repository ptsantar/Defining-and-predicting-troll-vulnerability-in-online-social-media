She was the first command of John Paul Jones, and she proved to be a "little sloop that could" sort of vessel as she went on to capture 40 British vessels over three years in service before she was destroyed by her own crew to prevent her from falling into the hands of the enemy.

Most of the vessels *Providence* captured would have been classified as "sloops-of-war," the name for which confusingly has absolutely nothing to do with actual sloops.  The sloops-of-war as defined by the Royal Navy were basically any ship in naval service that was pierced for fewer than 20 guns and thus was too small to be rated.

{"body":"The Thirteen would have eventually split off from Great Britain in one way or another. Probably westward expansion would have come later, when Britain forcibly enforced their treaties with the Natives, but eventually that would have fallen aside when Britain saw the benefits of the west being colonized. Americans would probably spell some words with a U, and used the letter Z more frequently. The real test would come about during the twentieth century, I think. So many open questions to really look that far, but you have to wonder if the American colonies would have joined the war sooner, or not at all, depending upon sentiment in the Americas. Would they use Britain's preoccupation with the Continent and assert independence, or would they be like the other Commonwealth nations and rally to the flag of Mother Britannia.		There are a lot of really interesting scenarios that could have happened. I doubt the Civil War would have happened, or if it did, it would have been a lot shorter as and state going against Britain had the British, the North, Canadian militia (who most certainly would have been called upon for this war) and possibly Native bands still friendly with the Crown. Or they might have accepted that it was futile to resist, and abolished slavery when Britain did so.		There's also the chance that, with the wealth and manpower of the Americans firmly British, would they have pressed their imperial claims further around the world and in Europe? By using North American soldiers and militia, they could have focused more on Europe if they went to war against Spain or France, and would have been able to pull their garrisons out of North American sooner, if relations with the colonies were good enough. If they were able to lessen their military burden before the cooling off period toward the feelings of empire in Britain, who knows. They could have expanded much more.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kain292","name":"t1_cqysfr3","parent_id":"t1_cqypl0h","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430803608,"created_utc":1430800008}

{"body":"I agree with the above, as a Brit, too!		The history of the British Empire is often divided in two with the American Revolution being a watershed moment. Everything after wards is British Empire 2.0. 		The British learnt a lot from the war and it's causes. They gave Canada more rights, as the whole " no taxation without representation " could have taken hold there too. Give it more rights, they are less likely to rebel. 		Further more, and this is applying history backwards, which I shouldn't but I will, in the 19th century it was said (forget by who) that a time would come when a colony would naturally move to independence, like a child leaving the family home, and it would be encouraged. This was talking about the settler colonies: CA, AUS, NZ, SA. The USA would have fallen into this category. 		Can we say for certain? No. But things would have changed. Maybe what Britain gave Canada would have also been given to the US. 		The biggest change for me though would be without the loss of the US, Britain would have had no cause to colonise Australia.

{"body":"Yeah, in one form or another. Look at the settler colonies. CAN, NZ, AUS, and SA all achieved their independence by basically asking for it about a century after America bled for it. After a point, the colonies just became self-sufficient enough and too expensive for Britain to have such hands-on control with that it was just easier to hold the Commonwealth nations on a much longer leash. The only major time the before mentioned countries had a problem with this was during the First World War, when we were called to war and had no say in it. Up until that point Britain still controlled our foreign policy, and any dealings with other nations were done through representatives of the Imperial government, but by the end of the Great War that was almost completely eradicated.

{"body":"I think either the British would have fairly quickly realized the 13 colonies were a dangerous and expensive millstone around their neck and given them quite a bit of autonomy in order to keep the peace, or alternately, British politics would be more conservative and they might have tried to cling onto them, in which case I think there would have been a second revolution. There might have been a second revolt regardless, just because of the amount of bad feelings and nationalism whipped up by the first one. Hard to say.		Something would have had to give, because by the 1830s the US had a population as large as England's.			The British wanted to keep a tight rein on their colonies in the 18th century because of mercantilism.
