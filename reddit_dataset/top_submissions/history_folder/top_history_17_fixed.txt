The dialog is basically 		1. holocaust is topic		2. people say 'more than jews died' 		3. others point out details about how insensitive it is, how its about jews, etc.		4. someone brings up that higher % of gypsies were wiped out		5. someone else brings up double the slavs died than jews		6. end of discussion			It should not be "first and foremost" that someone was the "recipient of the holocaust." Because it isn't true. Many groups were ravaged, less groups get more attention proportionately. 		It is about representation, correct? When someone brings up that more than jews died, it isn't to trivialize the jews that died, it is to call attention to other groups that were harmed. 		If you are so inclined to review the documented propaganda of the era, you'd see that the jews were considered the largest threat within germany and focused on as such, but outside of germany the various regions underwent similar treatment without all of the direct rabble rousing within germany. 		this is why people have a disproportionate understanding of exactly what happened, the propaganda was built for nationalism's sake. When that nationalism extended outside of the borders, the propaganda focusing diluted. When the propaganda is 'kill the jews (and anyone else that disagrees with our ideals)' that "other" can be, and was, larger than the target. But like any good propaganda, stay on one easily hyperbolized point.		And just like people have an unclear version of the facts and blow things out of proportion for whatever reasons, you hear exaggerations and hyperbole on all ends of the tragedy.		So pardon anyone for trying to clarify false "assertion of focus," but when a group is not the most killed, or loses the largest % of their population, but receive the most targeted propaganda within germany it is not exactly fair to turn it into a tragedy pissing contest as your defense.

{"body":"Though it's true Muslims from Bosnia were executed as well as many gays, blacks and especially roma, ukrainians, poles, serbs, hungarians etc., there's no doubt that the main theme of the genocide was the extermination of the "Jewish race". The plan was called the final solution for those who don't know and the solution was to the problem of "the Jewish question". After WW1, it was a widely accepted conspiracy that the Jewish bankers of Europe had shrunken the coffers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by taking control of the financial systems for personal enrichment ultimately resulting in the demise of the German people and the loss of the great war. Anti-semitism wasn't the same as hating blacks or roma or gays- it was a cultural statement of Europe and all over Europe, not just Germany or Austria, there were what were called pogroms (mass killings) of Jews in and around towns and villages where they were seen as gold stealing, relentless subhuman creatures just waiting to take over the gentiles.  There were even pogroms against jews after the Holocaust in Poland because the hatred was so strong that the returning Jews were seen as scapegoats for mass violence. My grandfather was born in Dresden, in about 1930 and his family owned a pretty successful textile business that flourished and allowed them to live quite comfortably. The entire family were reformed Jews, nothing too conservative but nonetheless, visibly Jewish. After the Nuremberg laws in 1935, my grandfather and family went on vacation to some chalet/lodge in the alps for summer holiday and stayed every year. One day my Zayde (what i call my grandfather) went looking for his brother who had been missing for a couple of hours. My grandfather ran into a barn and found his brother roped around a beam with a fire being lit under him with swastikas pinned to his jacket while some of the boys from the Chalet ran around him singing "burn jew burn" in german. They left the vacation and returned home to dresden unscathed. When school started, my zayde  was ready for first or second grade and was now making his own way to school. On the streets, there were chants at him and he would be beaten by both his teacher and classmates simply for being Jewish even though he was too young to fucking know what that even meant. The next year, 1936 the family car was set on fire and the year after that, my family decided to get the fuck out of Germany while the getting was good. Well that was the best fucking decision of their lives and of mine, they bribed their way out got visas and with the little money they had, left and settled a piece of shit land her in Ontario. My Zayde's entire family tree save 2 cousins was exterminated. All his friends were murdered. His wife's (my grandmother) whole family was murdered and they weren't even reformed they were secular. They didn't even fucking practice Judaism and just because of some lineage their entire genetic history was literally destroyed. So when someone says that the Jews hog all the attention, I'm fucking sorry but they don't know wtf they're talking about. I'm horribly sorry for your great grandfather and nothing can justify that level of barbarity, but there were no propaganda posters in 30's Germany of Bosnians killing live babies for fun like there were of Jews. My Zayde has a cousin (also a Holocaust survivor) who changed her name and family to identify as catholic. Until she was around 70 years old, she had no idea that she had a single relative who survived, however because she was an amateur geneologist and had contacts at Yad Vashem, she located my family in Canada along with my Zayde (her first cousin). She didn't even know her real name until she was an adult and didn't learn of the extermination of her entire family until the 1960's. She now works at a program called the missing child initiative which relocates family members with any remaining relatives they might have as sort of a therapeutic cleansing to try to make some of what happened better. However her story and even the story of my greater family on my mom's side is in a way a miracle of the Holocaust because I have Jewish friends here in Canada who's grandparents still bare the tattoos from Auschwitz and were too irrevocably damaged to be able to lead a normal life and so passed that depression down through their new Canadian families. All I can say to anyone who thinks that the Jews get overplayed is, fucking talk to a survivor because though their numbers are decreasing they're still out there because not even toddlers were spared. Don't read some numerical stat as to how many were killed, get a first hand account of the kind of isolation and dehumanization the Jews had against them because it really is appalling on a unique scale.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"icouldabeenacontenda","name":"t1_co229uz","parent_id":"t1_co1iodj","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1422333044,"created_utc":1422333044}

Even in the appellplatz, prisoners were made to stand for hours and hours on end in the heat of Summer and the freezing cold snow of Winter for absolutely no reason other than to torture them.  They were controlled by fear - and torture (both mental and physical) was a way to instill that fear.		Prisoners were forced to do 'useless' labor.

Psychological torture.  Not allowed to feel any sense of accomplishment or relief at completing a task.  They were 'useless people' doing useless tasks, because their lives were 'useless'.		There were hangings conducted (for no reason) at times in the appellplatz,  again, psychological torture and total control through fear.
