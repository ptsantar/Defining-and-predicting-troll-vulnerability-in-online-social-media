{"body":"Read the linked speech. I think this is very telling from Douglass:		>  I told him that he had been somewhat slow in proclaiming equal protection to our colored soldiers and prisoners; and he said that the country needed talking up to that point. He hesitated in regard to it, when he felt that the country was not ready for it. He knew that the colored man throughout this country was a despised man, a hated man, and that if he at first came out with such a proclamation, all the hatred which is poured on the head of the Negro race would be visited on his administration. He said that there was preparatory work needed, and that that preparatory work had now been done. And he said, "Remember this, Mr. Douglass; remember that Milliken's Bend, Port Hudson and Fort Wagner are recent events; and that these were necessary to prepare the way for this very proclamation of mine."		And I have to admit, I was kind of moved by the following, also from Douglass, directly following the above:		> I thought it was reasonable, but came to the conclusion that while Abraham Lincoln will not go down to posterity as Abraham the Great, or as Abraham the Wise, or as Abraham the Eloquent, although he is all three, wise, great and eloquent, he will go down to posterity, if the country is saved, as Honest Abraham [applause]; and going down thus, his name may be written anywhere in this wide world of ours side by side with that of Washington, without disparaging the latter.		I suspect that Lincoln could not have done what he did, had he not said the things you quote.","depth":3,"score":72,"ups":72,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nairebis","name":"t1_csvb1lj","parent_id":"t1_csv2tzd","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436300206,"created_utc":1436296606}

{"body":"I guess the view I'm forming of Lincoln is that he was a consummate politician. Not in the sleazy, manipulative way, but in that he understood the state of the country as a whole, and aligned more to the needs of the times than to personal crusades. Of course what you posted makes him seem like a monster. But he seems to have taken the moderate position necessary to eventually be elected, to keep the border states from seceding, and later orchestrate emancipation. I don't think the "radicals" of the time who fought for complete abolition would have been able to lead the country in the way he did.  I guess the quote from Douglass feels like a nice counterpoint to Lincoln's public views on black people, which is to say that Lincoln was a decent and respectful man, despite not maintaining a career-long commitment to racial equality. This is copied from *Team of Rivals*:	>There is no way to penetrate Lincoln's personal feelings about race. There is, however, the fact that armies of scholars, meticulously investigating every aspect of his life, have failed to find a single act of racial bigotry on his part. Even more telling is the observation of Frederick Douglass, who would become a frequent public critic of Lincoln's during his presidency, that of all the men he had met, Lincoln was "the first great man that I talked with in the United States freely, who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color." This remark takes on additional meaning when one realizes that Douglass had met dozens of celebrated abolitionists.... Apparently, Douglass never felt with any of them, as he did with Lincoln, and "entire freedom from popular prejudice against the colored race."","depth":3,"score":157,"ups":157,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vlisingen","name":"t1_csv4r5d","parent_id":"t1_csv2tzd","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436291327,"created_utc":1436287727}

{"body":"It's interesting to note that Lincoln held views against slavery dating all the way back to 1837. While in the General Assembly of Illinois, Lincoln voted against a resolution meant to make abolition societies illegal, and that slavery itself was sacred in the Constitution. Although Lincoln argued that abolition doctrines tended to worsen the evils of slavery, he also ceded "that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy." This is 1837. 		In 1849, Lincoln again proposed an amendment for compensated gradual emancipation in the District of Columbia. He proposed, "	When Douglass was received in the White House in 1863, he had had 5 years of Lincoln critiques before hand. He had said in 1860 of Lincoln, "Slavery will be as safe, safer, in the Union under [Lincoln,] than it can be under any President of a Southern Confederacy.???		Harsh words for someone who would come to see Lincoln as a great man. I think it is exceptionally difficult to view select passages of Douglass on Lincoln. Lincoln himself oscillated and compromised and with every sway, from 1858 until his death, Douglass had something to say. 		In 1860, Douglass wrote of Lincoln in his *Monthly* that he was "a man of unblemished private character; a lawyer??? has a cool, well balanced head; great firmness of will; is perseveringly industrious; and one of the most frank, honest men in political life.???		After Lincoln's election, Douglass chastised the president, arguing  	"If Mr. Lincoln were really an Abolition President, which he is not; if he were a friend to the Abolition movement, instead of being, as he is, its most powerful enemy, the dissolution of the Union might be the only effective mode of perpetuating slavery in the Southern States.???		Douglass saw the flaws within Lincoln's approach to slavery. He understood the difference between being anti-slavery and abolitionist. And I think Douglass truly understood, and harshly criticized Lincoln for the mans steadfastness in his beliefs, which had been founded under Henry Clay. Lincoln aided in the destruction of slavery, but for him, I believe it was only the Constitution, Law and the need for the preservation of the Union that aided in it. 		Throw in the Emancipation Proclamation all you will, then the amendments, Lincoln though Anti-Slavery, had no means through law to destroy slavery. Had the Confederacy rejoined the Union, I think Lincoln would have ceded them slavery, and down the road proposed a gradual emancipation. But War happened. And the only way to preserve the Union was to fight, was to destroy slavery. Notions that Douglass held from his early days as an escaped slave. It's an amazing story, one that I have studied in depth. Douglass held just about every opinion you could have on Lincoln. Great men they were, yet forever they were divided. Anti-slavery versus abolitionist.

{"body":">And what did Lincoln do?		He issued a proclamation freeing 3 million slaves. Which, if you're counting, is about 3 million more than any other U.S. president. He was no Radical Republican, which is a shame, but he's still in my opinion the greatest president we've had.		He issued it per his war powers, therefore it didn't apply to the slaves in non-Confederate states where the remaining quarter of slaves were.He then pushed for passage of the 13th Amendment, because he knew that he could not end slavery by executive order, and he feared that the proclamation would simply be rescinded by the next president.		And just to rustle the jimmies of you neo-Confederates, here's a lovely telegram from Karl Marx to Lincoln:		>We congratulate the American people upon your re-election by a large majority. If resistance to the Slave Power was the reserved watchword of your first election, the triumphant war cry of your re-election is Death to Slavery.		>From the commencement of the titanic American strife the workingmen of Europe felt instinctively that the star-spangled banner carried the destiny of their class. *The contest for the territories which opened the dire epopee, was it not to decide whether the virgin soil of immense tracts should be wedded to the labor of the emigrant or prostituted by the tramp of the slave driver?*		And my favorite bit:		>The workingmen of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Antislavery War will do for the working classes. **They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.**","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ShipofTools","name":"t1_csv9jyh","parent_id":"t1_csv7ize","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436298118,"created_utc":1436294518}

Obviously, this required a supermajority of Congress and the States - the President can't issue an ammendment.
