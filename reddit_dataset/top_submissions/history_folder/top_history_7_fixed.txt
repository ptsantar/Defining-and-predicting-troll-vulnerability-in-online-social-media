{"body":"Accounts of the Holocaust, and of liberation of the camps specifically, is something that gets lost in the WWII/Holocaust education of many these days I'm afraid. Thank you for this post, it made me think of my own Zeide's story (Zeide is Yiddish for Grandfather) and how he made his way following his time in the camps (He was taken in Prague in 1939/early 1940).	   	My Zeide wasn't liberated; his camp was further East and when the guards heard the Russians were coming led them on a deathmarch due west; there was a riot after a day or so and he (and the 2 guys he was chained to) got away, found an abandoned farm, found the barn, and broke their chains. Then they started walking.	  	After 2ish days my Zeide heard English being spoken (He was from Prague and had attended a German School so he had learned Czech, German and English in school) on the other side of some bushes. He and the 2 guys he was with (1 Lithuanian Jew, 1 Polish Jew that had fled Poland but been rounded up later) hadn't eaten since before the left the camp, so he just jumped out the bushes yelling "NO SHOOT! NO SHOOT!" and evidently nearly got shot by some American G.I.'s	   	They sent the other 2 concentration camp survivors to the Red Cross, but since my Zeide spoke English and German, and could read both, they asked him, "Max, you can go to the Red Cross or come with us and join the American Army as a translator, we got more documents than we know what to do with." So he did (as his ultimate goal was to emigrate to the United States). Now, it took them a few days to get where they were going, during which  they were riding, the 2 G.I.'s and my Zeide, in a Jeep. They had radioed ahead and made "accommodations" as they said, but they kept apologizing to him that it "wasn't good enough." Now, my Zeide's English had been school-taught, so he didn't know any of the swear words, slang, or non-academic words that were being used on this ride, but he was very polite and obviously really happy to not be heading to a refugee camp. He just kept making jokes being like, "Guys, Guys, I'm sure it'll be fine...you really don't know what it's been like for the past 4-5 years"	   	So they get to the Army base in the middle of the day, and everyone is out doing stuff. They bring him to his bunk and show him where his bed is and keep saying, "This is temporary, this is temporary, it'll all be fixed in a week" and he's just like "...Whatever, okay, this is awesome, whatever." So he's sitting there waiting for the soldiers to file in. Well, they do. Turns out he was in the Black Bunk, with the Black soldiers. Suddenly it all hit him: that's why they were apologizing, that's why they were so awkward about it. So my Zeide's education about the United States and the United States Armed Forces came from the weeks he spent with in the black bunk.	   	After a few days he started translating, he said it was mostly just normal procedural documents (not surprisingly), but pleasant enough work, and he had 3 square meals a day (most he had had in years). My Zeide started to put on weight and become his old self again; wry, sarcastic, joking, and very sure of himself. He learned from his bunkmates that, as a Jew...he should pretty much stay away from the South entirely. He learned that cities were his best bet, and that New York was probably where he should head first.	   	When, after about 2 weeks, the white soldiers came back to him and said, "Max! Good news! We found you space in a good bunk, a real bunk, a *white* bunk. Come on, pack your stuff!" My Grandfather said, in his polite-but-firm way, "You really, really don't understand what I've been through these past few years, do you? I am going to stay here. I think...I think my place really is with these people." And in the black bunk he stayed.	  	Due to the nature of his work, he was technically made a member of the United States Army. This is what allowed him to eventually find my Bubbe (Yiddish for Grandmother): they had been married shortly before the invasion of Poland in a small shtetl (Jewish village in Eastern Europe) by a local Rabbi. My Zeide had heard she was still alive halfway through the war when he ran into her brother in a concentration camp. She was in a Red Cross camp, and he found her through the U.S. Army. Shortly after the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, they immigrated to Israel, and by 1950 they had immigrated to the United States, through Boston, before settling in Terry Town, New York, in Westchester County.	   	To this day, the Army comes and puts a little flag on my Zeide's headstone every Memorial Day.	    	I realize now that this comment may well be removed for being slightly off topic, but it felt good to share. My Zeide's Yahrzeit (Anniversary of Death) is coming up shortly after New Year's, so my mind has been on him of late. Even if this gets deleted, it felt really good to write.","depth":0,"score":45,"ups":45,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"puck342","name":"t1_cn0mbxr","parent_id":"t3_2puapu","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419100212,"created_utc":1419100212}

{"body":"You're welcome! Keeping his story alive is something I try to do, he didn't end up being able to record his whole tale before his health seriously declined in the 1990's and he passed away 1996, at the age of 83. I really wish his story was with the others at Yad Vashem (Holocaust Memorial in Israel).	    	But yeah, that's just what happened to him AFTER the camps. He escaped the camps twice while he was there. 	   	One time, he was caught nearby, brought back, and placed in a line to be shot, as they are going down the line, shooting Jews, the 5 o'clock bell rings. Well, being the bureaucratic folks that they were, they stop shooting their rifles and go clock out. My Zeide hid in the pile of bodies until nightfall (1-3hrs later) and then snuck back to the shed in camp he was in before he escaped. 	   	The other escape went well, in that he wasn't caught, but the Nazi's had cleared the local forest of all useful brush/animals. After the better part of 2 weeks basically starving, and it getting colder every night (it was fall-ish), he went back to the front gate...with his arms up. They opened up the gates, took him back in, demanded to know how he escaped...and lucky for him, the Nazi in charge of his intake/execution was one of the guards he was "friendly" with (insofar as they liked his singing voice, enjoyed that he spoke German fluently). He told my Zeide he'd shoot over his head later when he was in the firing line, but that the rest was up to him, so he once again hid in a pile of bodies, for the better part of a day, before sneaking back into a bunk at night.	   	When he shared his stories with me growing up (starting at age 4 when I asked him where he got those numbers on his arm) he was always very clear about one thing; in his mind, he did not just survive the Holocaust because he *was* Jewish. He survived the Holocaust so that he could *be* Jewish. My Zeide was a very religious man until the day he died, and made sure to visit Israel regularly from its founding in 1948 until his health no longer allowed him to travel in the 1990's. Seeing the USSR fall and his home country of Czechoslovakia (by then the Czech Republic) become free once again was one of the happiest moments of his life.	   	I'm glad you appreciated learning his story. As amazing as all of the stories of the Holocaust that have been made into movies and books are, and they are amazing, the stories that haven't been told are just as amazing oftentimes.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"puck342","name":"t1_cn0qset","parent_id":"t1_cn0q0rr","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419110394,"created_utc":1419110394}

{"body":"It just contributes to that surreality. A lot of the bodies looked like models, their skin was so smooth and their eyes were just these sunken holes. But if this were in HD, you'd see the flaws of the skin and the shadowy caverns where eyes had once been would be filled with the decrepit, rotten eyes. Usually with low res stuff, your mind fills in the gaps for what isn't clear, but my mind cannot fathom actually seeing a pile of dead humans, and it's hard for it to accept what it does see--which is why these images need to be seen, otherwise they'll never be understood.		Watching them toss the bodies around really got to me. In our culture, we've become a bit desensitized to violence, gore, and death, but we rarely, if ever, see the aftermath. I think that's why killing is treated so lightly, it doesn't seem like it has consequences, whereas in reality soldiers were stuck in foxholes with the corpses of their closest friends for days, watching them rot (especially in WWI), or literally walking on top of the corpses of their comrades (especially the Eastern Front in WWII). There's a shot in this film that has a pile of corpses in the foreground and then only a dozen yards away a group of prisoners are sitting together on the ground, waiting to end up like the others. Death isn't even a moment that comes, it's something that's already there. I can't even imagine what that's like.		This past summer I worked at a park district as a supervisor. Sometimes the people I supervised wouldn't show up, so I'd do other stuff. One day I helped a coworker out on what was called the "garbage route", basically going between parks picking up garbage bags that had been sitting out in the summer heat for a day or two, chucking them into the back of a pickup truck, and then, once the truck was full, chucking them into a dumpster. Watching this video, all I could think was that we handled that garbage with more care than these dudes did the bodies of *people* as they tossed them onto those trucks or into the mass graves. And even though it seems like they just didn't care, to me I think they just didn't have time, they were worn out on caring (although certainly they didn't care to begin with, since they murdered these people). Despite that, maybe they'd been more cautious in the beginning, but they weren't anymore. When one woman gets caught on some railing and the dude just kicks her body off...		I'm trying to put myself into the heads of these guys and all I can think is "they don't want to do this job". I've done menial labor with people who do menial labor for a profession and they carried themselves in the exact same way. "Let's get this done and go home". These SS were miserable with this work not because of principle, not because it's people, not because it's disgusting, but because they just don't want to do the work. They're frustrated with how much they've already done and how much there's yet to do. They don't think it's fair for them to be doing all of this by themselves. *That's* how many bodies there are.

This argument has shown up on /r/badhistory a number of times and I suggest you do a search on there (or it might be in the wiki/faq/whatever) to see the counterargument for "they were just following orders" and "Hitler was elected". Very quickly I'll say my view of the argument: I don't think every soldier is to blame for the war, but those at the camps most certainly each share in the blame (some volunteered). There is never a moment where you can say "I was just following orders, so I helped kill thousands of people because otherwise I would have been killed". The idea of agency in war isn't a settled topic, however. There's a certain degree of "following orders" vs "being a human being", because there are certainly times when horrible things must be done (war itself is horrible) or, as is the case with bombings nowadays, one must make a decision with the knowledge that they might blow up a school instead of a military target.		As to Hitler's election, he assassinated his opponents (look up the Night of the Long Knives) and stole political power. It was not ethical. Certainly nationalism, propaganda, and brainwashing contributed greatly to the people supporting him, but his power was not democratic.		edit - I'll admit absolute ignorance to your issues in Sweden. However, this modern age is extremely different than 1930's Germany. That type of nationalism does not exist in the West anymore, partially if not mostly because of the example Germany gave of its consequences (in fact, this model of emotional nationalism is called "German nationalism" by academics, in contrast to ideological or "secular" nationalism known as "French nationalism").

{"body":"Well this is why (especially in a post-WW2 era) governments tend to have checks and balances put in place at the moment of their founding, or at the request of their people. To commit atrocities like the Nazis did you need to have control of the hard power (the military, the police, the arsenals etc...) and the soft power (the media, the ballot box, the education system etc...) in a nation, and you need it centralized in the hands of a VERY small group of people. If you lack that level of control, there's a good chance that you aren't going to last long enough in power to do comparable harm. If you don't control the hard power, you get something like the Egyptian military coup of 2013, where the military sided with the protesters and helped to oust an unpopular government that was trying to cling to power. If you don't control the soft power, you may be able to last longer, but it is only a matter of time before your own people bring your injustices to light and oust you democratically, or someone bigger and badder tells you to knock it off, or else.

If I ever get a chance I will read that book. I remember distinctly that before we got to Auchwitz, we watched The Pianist on the coach, and Shindler's List when we were on the way to the actual factory. It was a heavy ten days... very much brought the whole year together, because in the down time we had we were all trying very hard to appreciate our time there and help each other take a breather during the nights. 		I know this might seem odd as a sidenote, but I feel like it's an important part of my experience, I listened to Ulver's *A Quick Fix of Melancholy* fir the first time during the journeys, forever associate that ep with the atmosphere and the snow there.		 Other memorable moments: visiting the oldest and only synagogue in one  particular town, one that survived being torn down. We stayed for a service, this was our sort of pick - me - up for after the camps, very warm and jovial experience. We also visited the last Jewish man surviving in a town that, before the Shoa, was heavily populated by Jews. Everyone he knew was killed, he had no family left. I remember thinking about what a huge number that ~6 million was. If everyone I knew, and their friends and their family died, that would not be a scratch on the surface. We went to the [Plazow monument] (http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/04/58/12/1c/plaszow-concentration.jpg) which overlooks a green ditch. Me and my friend felt at a loss, knowing some people might not even know why that was there; there were tyre tracks all over that ditch. It was the site of a mass pyre and grave... That really bothered us. I can't believe how long ago I made that trip... I would certainly go again, but having a guide like my headteacher was invaluable and impossible to replicate.

Another similar place that affected me deeply was Hiroshima nuclear bomb museum in Japan, where I had the luck to meet an old Japanese gentleman who was volunteering at the museum. He had been there, had seen the bomb fall, lost family members and seen and smelled the piles of bodies. This wonderful man walked with us through the whole museum, sharing his very personal stories, of which I am eternally grateful. I had to stop interpreting his Japanese to my companion after a while, because it was too upsetting for him to hear, but despite the scar that visit left to me mentally I think it was very important that I went there too.

There is a perfectly acceptable word for what you are describing, a word that has been used for years now		- Moderation 		Now there is good moderation, bad moderation and awful moderation. On all three of these you can technically put the censorship label. However censorship is mostly used in a negative context where people want to attach a level of severity that isn't there. It is often implied to be related to censorship from governments or to be on the same level. Which frankly, is offensive to people facing censorship in their daily lives and can't simply avoid it by creating a alt account/moving to another subreddit/etc. To quote the wikipedia definition "Censorship is the suppression of speech", which simply is fundamentally impossible because of how reddit works. 		So think about this for a moment. Do you really want to discuss how subreddits are moderated? Or do you want to make it a political issue by equaling moderating (removal of posts and comments) with what some governments do to their citizens (persecuting citizens) ? Because in my opinion the first is perfectly acceptable and I would welcome that discussion. On the other hand if it is the latter I am going to pass.			edit: 		To expand on your "why not let votes decide"		Well there is this: 		"The Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site, the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take specific measures to prevent it."  [^Source: ^Article ^by ^Paul ^Graham, ^one ^of ^the ^people ^that ^made ^reddit ^possible](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) 		The reddit FAQ also has a entry about it called: [Why does reddit need moderation? Can't you just let the voters decide?](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F) 		What this means is basically the following, say you have two submissions: 		1. An article - takes a few minutes to judge. 	2. An image - takes a few seconds to judge.		So in the time that it takes person A to read and judge he article person B, C, D, E en F already saw the image and made their judgement. So basically images will rise to the top not because they are more popular, but simply because it takes less time to vote on them so they gather votes faster. 		Not to mention that there hardly ever is one singular community on subreddits. Rather there are subgroups of people which you have to take in consideration. For example one group might disagree with something and because of that voice their discontent. This while another group of people is actually happy with the things as they are and because you will not hear them because they don't have much to talk loudly about. Now it is easy to do what the loud group says because that is the group that is easy to spot. But if you simply do what the loud group says you are basically ignoring the other group. 	So in that regard it is always a balancing act and for that matter one that almost never will make **everyone** happy.","depth":2,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"creesch","name":"t1_cn0lsk4","parent_id":"t1_cn0h3c1","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1419099030,"created_utc":1419099030}

It was right after the museum had opened, and was a big part of the reason we took a two week family trip to Washington D.C.. There were long lines and thousands of people waiting to get in and touring the museum that hot summer day. We slowly worked our way through the entire museum. We saw the stacks of umbrellas, the luggage, the train car, the rubble of the Polish Ghettos, etc. The entire time my father patiently explained everything to me, bit by bit, item by item. When I did not know what an item was used for, that was explained too. 		We spent the entire day in that museum. My family, being Jewish, had a connection to this museum. We had relatives who had been killed in the camps, and my father wanted us to understand the history of the entire event - what led up to it, how it progressed, and the men who stood up to this evil and stopped it. My father is the type of man who kept the History channel on when I was growing up, always teaching me about the past and how it connects to the present.		The one thing I truly remembered from that museum my entire life until I visited it again 20 years later was that video that plays in the middle of the hut. My mom told my dad not to let me see it because I was too young. I insisted that I wanted to see what had made her cry. My father lifted me up and held me high enough so I could watch the entire video. Then he held me through it a second time and *explained everything in it*. The experiments, the piles of dead, the starving and diseased people laying on the ground slowly dieing. He made sure I understood everything that had been done to those poor people.		I didn't cry, but I did wonder at the sheer sense of injustice for it all. I wondered why the people hadn't fought back. I wondered how the world could allow such an atrocity to happen. I had a *lot* of questions, and my father spent the rest of the night answering every single one of them in detail. I'm glad he did all of that and was patient with me because it gave me an appreciation for history and taught me the past of my people. It gave me a very strong sense of right and wrong as a young child. It had a very profound effect on my life.

The fact that you can see the memorial of Buchenwald for kilometers on the sunny day (it's a huge bright tower standing on the mountain where the camp was on, so it's visible for at least 50 km). The name "Buchenwald", which has this nice ring to it in German (it means "wood of beech trees") or rather: it would have, if you didn't know, what carries this name. Or the little stone memorial somewhere in the Thuringian Woods in the middle of nowhere, carrying a little sign saying (approx.) "Here SS soldiers shot 7 prisoners on the death march from Buchenwald because they were no longer able to walk". That's some 60 km from the camp in a lovely stretch of wood, where I stumbled upon that memorial one day on a bike trip.

The former may convey to readers a sense of "ooo spooky..." while the former does a better job explaining why people often say they don't see birds at the camp. 		Seriously though, why are we talking about birds when discussing something as serious as the holocaust? That place is a downer without birds anyway. It's not a big deal, just meant to say we should be careful how we relate our experiences when presenting history.

At that point all it took was a speech to tell them he could free them from oppression from their enemies through torture of their enemies. In their minds it was all in their name of freedom. hitler showed us that "freedom" can be twisted into a very corrupt form and still be backed up by popularity 'in the name of freedom'. I really hope humanity learned from this and not just pass it off as something like this could only happen under power of Stalin or hitler.

{"body":"There's a little more to the story of why it wasn't released at the time.  They originally commissioned it because they wanted to quickly release footage of the camps, largely to confront the German people with the horror of the camps.  But the film took much longer than expected, and by that time the Allied governments were trying to rebuild Germany.  They thought that releasing the film and rubbing the Germans' noses in it would be detrimental to those efforts.  So that's why they suppressed release in the end.  And as you say, by that time other footage had already been released, so the Allies had already accomplished their purpose.

He takes power in 1933 and if you're 9 years old at that time you would be 17 by the time of Operation Barbarossa -- just old enough to get in. He had millions upon millions of young men who grew up under the Nazi Party's rule and in the Hitler Youth in particular. When Timmy from Utah was learning grammar Hans was learning how to disassemble a Mauser in the Hitler Youth. That's just the fact. Yes they were brainwashed but they were not forced. These were people who, by the millions, spent the most formulative years of their lives under direct Nazi authoritarian rule and propaganda -- **of course they bought into it all.** There's no way they didn't. 		So when they invaded Western Russia and were told they could commit war crimes against the Slavs with no punishment (Barbarossa Decree) they weren't forced to perform those atrocities and to assist the Einsatzgruppe in over 600,000 innocents deaths via execution between June 1941 and March 1942. They did it on their own whim because that's the world they grew up in. The Slav was evil, the jew was the enemy, the Bolshevik were the jews. The Bolshevik, therefore the jew, must be eliminated.		They were willing participants. Brainwashed, certainly, but willing. They bought into it. Everyone between the ages of like 6 and 16 in 1933 would be fighting for the Nazi's. Those testosterone filled, easily molded boys would grow into men pumped full of Nazi propaganda in every corner of their lives.
