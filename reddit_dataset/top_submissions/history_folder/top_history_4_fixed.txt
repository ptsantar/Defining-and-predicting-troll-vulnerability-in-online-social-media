{"body":"It's a shame that we don't remember his adopted son Octavius (also known as Augustus) nearly as well. Since Julius Caesar was young, the Roman Republic had basically devolved into a game of House of Cards, where everyone was Kevin Spacey. People were always plotting to become Rome's leading senators, and a few had taken absolute power with the backing of the Roman legions. Caesar was the first to really try and set himself up as a monarch, but since the Romans were actually very against the idea of monarchy, he could never get around to it. People guessed what he was up to, and then Brutus, Casca, and the rest went and killed him.		Enter Octavian, some 20-year old, nerdish nephew of Caesar who nobody had ever heard of, and who was adopted by the great Dictator-for-Life posthumously, and who was left most his estate. Over the next few years, he teamed up with Marc Antony to hunt down the senators who had conspired to kill his uncle-father. Once that was done, he shared power with Antony for a while before they turned on each other, and Octavian defeated him.		So now we're left with a still pretty young guy who, for the first time in Roman history, has conquered all of his political enemies to take total control of the Republic. This is where I think he gets remarkable: not only did he consolidate power for himself in order to stay on top for the rest of his life, he reformed the entire Roman Empire to ensure its stability *after* his death. He didn't just build a legend by taking power for himself, like every other Senator had wished to do. He made sure that his legend would be passed on to his descendants, a legend which we remember more than any individual senator, dictator, or imperator: the institution of the Roman Emperor. Augustus was the first, and because of everything he did, is probably my favorite.		Because really, who remembers Rome as a republic?		I will credit Julius Caesar with one thing, though. The senators chose the Ides of March in 44 BC because he was about to go off on campaign, which he did not plan to return from for several years (for a mission of conquest, that was pretty unusual). His goal: conquer Parthia in the east, wheel around north to conquer the Russian Steppe, and then head home via Germany, which he would also conquer. The senators couldn't risk him doubling the size of the empire, because that would make him far to popular with the people to kill. If he had lived and succeeded, however, we would remember Julius Caesar as the Roman Alexander, not as that guy who got stabbed a bunch in some play.","depth":1,"score":84,"ups":84,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nachollison","name":"t1_cpfqpir","parent_id":"t1_cpfk5yv","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1426445718,"created_utc":1426442118}

{"body":"Yes, a big day indeed. Also, for Cleopatra and Egypt.		Not only did Cleopatra lose her lover this day, but she also became the focal point of a war that would ultimately lead to the fall of Egypt and the total rise of the Roman Empire.		After Caesar was murdered, Octavian and Marc Antony debated over who should rule Rome. Even though Marc Antony was closer to Caesar both on a professional and personal level, Octavian took the role anyway.		What happens next, we all know the story. Marc Antony meets Cleopatra, they fall in love (most definitely Marc Antony, probably Cleopatra, but one can never be sure). They have some kids. They spend a lot of money. Egypt rises to become the richest country of the time. Keep in mind, Marc Antony was so close with Caesar, and here he is having children with Caesar's mistress? Did I also mention, Marc Antony was married to Octavian's sister? Well, at first he was, but after cheating on her with Cleopatra he filed for divorce. Anyway.		The jealousy between Marc Antony and Octavian never subsides. They hate each other. Wonder why? So naturally, they do what Romans do, declare war.		Off and on fighting, calling names, then Octavian finally gets to the shores of Egypt. A huge naval battle later, including a capital ship with Cleopatra on it, and Marc Antony and Cleopatra flee the losing battle.		The rest is history. Marc Antony receives false news that his lover is dead, tries to commit an honorable suicide by stabbing himself in his stomach, and yet fails. Not even his servant will help him finish the job.  		Meanwhile, Cleopatra is getting chased down by Octavian. After all, she's the prize jewel of rich Egypt. She locks herself in her burial building. Marc Antony's servant drags him to her, bleeding and all, hoists him up to the roof of Cleopatra's building and drops him in. A drink of wine and he dies beside her. At least, that's the poetic version.		Cleopatra, now understandably distraught. What else can she do? Caesar is dead, Marc Antony is dead, her children will probably be dead. She's locked inside this building with Octavian standing outside (not literally, his soldiers were, but you get the idea). Sure, she could surrender, and Octavian of course offers this - maybe even prefers it (probably not). If she does this, she'll be paraded through the Roman streets in a cage. That indignity is not for this Isis goddess (not ISIS, Isis).		So, Cleopatra hides a snake in a basket of figs and has it delivered to her. Just kidding. Do you really think an asp would be that agreeable? More likely, she hides a vial of poison in a basket of figs instead. She forces her slaves to drink it, then drinks it herself.		An end of an era. Egypt falls to Octavian. He pillages the riches and uses it to pay off his army. After all, they came along with him for this adventure, they deserve some treasure, no? Rome also really needs this cash too. They're broke. Business first. Octavian kills Cleopatra and Julius Caesar's son (yeh, she had a kid with Caesar too, aptly named Caesarion). Octavian returns home, whips the Roman people back into order, changes his name to Augustus Caesar, and gives the children of Cleopatra & Marc Antony's to his sister to raise. Wait, say what?

The problem with that is that the initial correction didn't fix the calendar to be on track with where it was when the Julian calendar was created, with equinoxes and solstices placed on about the 25th of the month.  Instead, it corrected back to the date of a Christian council at Alexandria some 500 or so years later, at which time the seasons were calculated to have moved to about the 21st.  So if you applied Gregorian corrections backward all the back to the beginning, you'd be... uh, "over-uncorrecting"?		What does this mean, math-wise?  I dunno, my brain's not up to it right now.  But I'm pretty sure today wouldn't have been exactly March 15th when Caesar was killed.  For one thing, that was 10 days before the vernal equinox back then, and now it's only 6.  So I feel like today should be March 11 on the calendar back then, but another part my brain is worried that's over-simplifying.		------RM","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LordRobin------RM","name":"t1_cpfp9rv","parent_id":"t1_cpfnjq9","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1426443016,"created_utc":1426439416}

{"body":"I think you're complicating things when you say "if you applied Gregorian corrections backward all the [way] back to the beginning." You don't really need to apply them backwards. You just go back to the beginning of the standardization of the Julian calendar in AD 8, and then apply the Gregorian method for any leap years (so Julian and Gregorian are EXACTLY the same until the year 100).		If you look at my first post, I say that "if you were to use a proleptic Gregorian calendar"; a proleptic calendar here just means that it's basically anachronistic and that one is trying to apply it to a period when it wasn't in use (i.e. using the Gregorian calendar before 1582).		So in 1582, there was a 10-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, because that was how much a gap had arisen between the two methods. However, not every society switched over to Gregorian at the same time. For example, the British (and thus the Americans) didn't switch over until the 1700s, so the difference between the two calendars was 11 days. When the Russians finally switched over to Gregorian in 1918, the difference was 13 days.		The main reason I suggested that 13 March might be the probable date is that between 44 BC and AD 8, they often did a leap year every 3 years, so you sort of have to adjust the difference by around -2, hence 13 March.		(15 March, 44 BC is in the Julian calendar, by the way; you usually use the Julian Calendar for historical dates from 46 BC to 1582).		EDIT: I'm not going to touch the commentary on the vernal equinox, because I'm working off the actual calendar system, not astronomy. Our annual calendar doesn't readjust based on the astronomy, so I'm not taking it into account (liturgical calendars have their own reasonings that I'm not going to touch).","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FarragutCircle","name":"t1_cpfqudy","parent_id":"t1_cpfp9rv","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1426445967,"created_utc":1426442367}

IIRC they ended up on opposite factions during the Civil War, although the polar opposite factions that they fight for in the show.

{"body":"Wow, you've gotten some really poor answers to this. I'm sorry. I'll go ahead and try to clear Caesar's name up :) There are three likely scenarios behind the man's name: The most likely, the one that Caesar liked to push, and the vague possibility that we like keeping around because reasons. 		1. The most likely. Caesar in Latin is rooted in the word for "hairy" (caesaries). The Romans loved giving nicknames, especially descriptive or derogative ones, and this is a very typical nickname for someone. For some more examples, Cicero is thusly named because one of his ancestors had a wart that was shaped like a chickpea (Latin: cicero). There was a Scipio with the cognomen of "Asina" because he made an ass of himself. Clodius "Pulcher" was thusly named because he was beautiful. Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the Delayer) is another example. So Caesar had an ancestor with a full head of hair. The irony is that the Caesar who we're discussing was balding pretty heavily. 		2. The one Caesar himself liked to trumpet (If you look at [some of the coinage he minted](http://www.ancientresource.com/images/roman/romancoins/silver/julius-caesar-19728.jpg), you can see this one. Caesar is apparently similar to the Punic word for "Elephant" - apparently, one of Caesar's ancestors during the Punic Wars killed an elephant single-handedly. Therefore, he was named in that way.		3. The far-fetched one. One of Caesar's ancestors was born by C-section. The process was not unknown to the Romans, but it was also a guaranteed fatality for the mother, and was therefore very rarely used. While it's possible, Julius Caesar himself was not born via C-section - his mother only died about 10 years before Caesar did. 		Caesarian sections are known as such due to the Latin word for "cut" (caedo, cecidi, caesum).","depth":1,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Celebreth","name":"t1_cpfqye7","parent_id":"t1_cpflehz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1426446173,"created_utc":1426442573}
