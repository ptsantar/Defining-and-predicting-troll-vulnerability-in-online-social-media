{"body":"I think hype about this battle goes too much toward emphasizing Custer's failures/defeat instead of recognizing some of the genius of the Lakota. They were (are) some of the finest "Cavalry" units in the world. They were quick, adaptive, unpredictable, willing to experiment with new technology and weapons, and hybridize.		Also, that bit at the end of the battle where the Lakota warriors dressed up in the dead 7th's uniforms to confuse Reno's survivors/Terry's incoming column and cover the escape of the noncombatants? Oof.","depth":0,"score":302,"ups":302,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hypocrite_deer","name":"t1_csi8vhn","parent_id":"t3_3b29ge","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435246098,"created_utc":1435242498}

{"body":"Custer had nothing whatsoever to do with the choice of the Springfield carbines that the 7th Cavalry used. They were standard issue for the U.S. Army in the 1870s forward until 1892, chosen after evaluation of 99 rifles by a military board convened specifically for the purpose (ironically chaired by Sioux campaign Custer superior General Alfred Terry) during 1872-73.		The Gatling guns brought to the Yellowstone with the Terry/Custer forces presented several problems. One, as discussed by General Nelson Miles at the time, was their notorious reputation for jamming that rendered them essentially useless in the heat of combat. Another was that these specific guns were pulled by condemned horses, hardly suited to being part of an attack force moving to confront a mobile foe. Another was that the terrain upon which the 7th Cavalry was traveling along Rosebud Creek and throughout the course of the nearly 100 miles from the Yellowstone camp to the Little Bighorn consisted of river banks, steep ravines and several mountain passes, conditions that would have rendered the Gatling guns a significant burden.		This burden had been experienced by Major Reno during the week prior when he led several companies on a lengthy scouting foray and brought one of the guns along with him. Ironically, if Custer had brought along the Gatling guns the Battle of the Little Bighorn and his last stand would likely have never occurred. The guns would have prevented the 7th Cavalry from getting to the Little Bighorn while the village was still there.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Seeda_Boo","name":"t1_csko11h","parent_id":"t1_csiv9u0","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435431993,"created_utc":1435428393}

Four is now the norm and has been since shortly after Custer's time. So what's your point anyway?		> His troops hated him		*Some* of his troops in the West hated him. Many didn't sign up to be soldiers, they signed up to get a paycheck. This isn't necessarily the smartest way to get one. Others were tainted by two officers who loathed him for personal reasons, Benteen and Reno. Others had legit gripes.

Hmm. Almost? I almost banged Kate Upton. Then I woke up. The military death penalty for mutiny notwithstanding.		Fragging? Source, please.		In the Civil War his troops loved him so much that they adopted his famous red scarf and many wrote home to family about his inspiring bravery.

The only battle which Custer fought against the Indians at a village besides the LBH was at the Washita in 1868. Prior to the attack on Black Kettle's village, which included young warriors who had conducted widespread raids in Kansas and were admitted by the chief to be beyond his control, Custer ordered that the killing of women and children was to be avoided. Some women and children were killed in the course of the fight which took place right in the village, 53 were taken prisoner.		> described them as "lice."		No. That would be John M.

{"body":"> properly lead, the US troops, though rough around the edges (like most enlisted soldiers through most of history), were an outstanding fighting force, and Custer's failures need to be laid squarely on his lap.		Any of the U.S. Army forces in the field in 1876 would have been annihilated in confrontation with the native forces at the LBH. A subset of the very same Sioux and Cheyenne warriors handily whipped acclaimed "Indian fighter" Crook's force of over 1000 just a week earlier 40 miles further up the Rosebud to such an extent that he essentially withdrew his men from the campaign. It would have been nice had he bothered to get word to the other forces in the field at the time.		Custer certainly made fatal mistakes at the LBH, but the culpability for defeat and list of mistakes made throughout the planning, lead-in, battle and aftermath extends far and wide. Among many others who contributed significantly to the fiasco are Grant, Sheridan, Crook, Terry, Gibbon and of course Reno and Benteen. That's just the short list. The Great Sioux Campaign of 1876 was a massive cluster fuck.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Seeda_Boo","name":"t1_cskoyl4","parent_id":"t1_csifh4f","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435433892,"created_utc":1435430292}
{"body":"Only a very poor commander like Custer would have put his forces in a position to be annihilated.  When Crook lost the battle of Rosebud, he was able to retreat in good order to reorganize, suffering about equal casualties to what he inflicted.		Given the task that the Army had been given, to push the natives off the land to allow for mining, their strategy in the Black Hills war was reasonable, and can't be faulted for the loss at LBH.  Regiments were designed to operate independently (that's why they were regiments and not brigades), and the 7th had the support it needed; if Custer had taken the artillery he was offered, he would have had a lot more firepower.		Blaming Reno and Benteen is unfair to them; they performed as well as they could in the situation in which Custer placed them.  Reno engaged the enemy and held on for most of the day - only retreating to avoid being flanked.  Benteen had been placed far away from the action by Custer; he did an admirable job of getting to Reno's position in time to save them - there was no realistic way of getting to Custer's position given the tactical situation.		The fact that this was the only catastrophy of its kind in the Indian Wars, combined with the mind-numbingly bad descisions that Custer made puts the blame for this solely on his shoulders.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cskqabt","parent_id":"t1_cskoyl4","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435436611,"created_utc":1435433011}

Calhoun's line to defend from Indians following them up the ravine they used to ascend from the riverbank, Keogh's line interpreted as defending the anticipated approach path of Benteen and the ammo.	 	* Again, as you seem to agree, because that was the primary location of souvenir hunting for as long as it was allowed, over 65 years, as confirmed by military who originally had charge of the battlefield, the NPS, historians and locals alike.

This is the first refernce I've heard of Keogh guarding the approach of Benteen.  It's possible I missed that memo :)  From the sources I've read and from visiting the battlefield, it seems more likely that as commander of Custer's south "wing", holding that end of the ridge, he had been dropped off by Custer to screen his flank from Sioux infiltration up Medicine Tail Coulee.  That's when (possibly Crazy Horse) rushed his position and his body was found on the east slope, indicating he had been pushed back with a few of his men.  This was how his horse, Comanche, came to survive the battle.		As happens with historical research, time covers the trail with dust.  Fox's work is, as you say, remarkable, and there will always be controversy since the only witnesses (the Indians) had a different perspective on time and events.

{"body":"Your Keogh scenario is of course legit. But I subscribe to these two missions being compatible with each other. Of course it was secondary to more immediate pressing concerns but that line for Benteen had to be kept open if Custer was to have any hope. Keogh's position both served that purpose and provided a sound (for as brief as this was so) position for defense against influx of warriors from MTC. As his brother Boston would have revealed to Custer, Benteen was in reachable distance. Boston had passed him on his way to join his family and reached them in expedient fashion from that point.		The Keogh defense for the pack train access is a widely-held hypothesis among those who have done in-depth analysis of the battleground.

If somebody else wants to jump in with more qualifications than me, they are very welcome. Still, I'll give it a shake?		For a lot of the antebellum 19th century, you had military officers who were predominantly peace-time officers. (I know there were some exceptions, but I think those conflicts would have been thought of today as police actions, mostly.) I think some resurgence of European fighting tactics flowered in the 19th century with there being a lot of large scale conflicts in Europe at the time that were studied by various West Point officers as practical examples. Many of them went over to "observe" the various Crimean war conflicts. I get the feeling it was sort of fashionable to talk about different maneuvers and tactics in that context. War could get theoretical again because it was peace time, and no one was imagining it on the home front.		In Allen C. Guelzo???s *Gettysburg: The Last Invasion* he suggested that Civil War battles in particular moved to more "line up and blast away from stationary position" because a lot of the men (at least by the battle of Gettysburg) didn't like to charge or get down to hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. A lot of them were less experienced, and a charge is very personal and intimidating, especially when you're fighting people who look like you, are the same socio-economic class as you, and are involved in a mostly (to whites) political war. Even though it's much more inefficient and tactically destructive to line up and shoot until you run out of men, the everyday soldier was more capable of doing that unless they were very well lead. There's that remove.		All that said, I think Custer's battle *was* fairly guerrilla. Sure, he was leading a command of organized troops with a firm power structure, but it was much more adaptive than one would think hearing "Cavalry." His number of friendly Indian guides and scouts was exceptionally high, and he let them fight, even sending them in ahead of time to steal horses. He used mules instead of a typical army pack train to keep his men fleet and able to cross varied terrain. He favored night or early morning attack. On the morning of June 25th, he had just snuck through a parallel valley and unexpectedly raced through a pass to try to attack the Lakota village unaware at first light. This ambush, surprise attack is much more characteristic of a dynamic Indian fighting style than what we would think of as an old school military maneuver. 		Edit: Oh, I just thought of another thing! Custer's men really probably should have been fighting mounted instead of in skirmish lines. A lot of them had problems with their horses because the campaign was fairly new and many of the horses hadn't been trained to combat yet. They heard the gunshots and Indian whistles and spooked. So a lot of the time it seems like he was forced to dismount his men, line them up, and fire while one in every three man held a handful of bridles. Not necessarily a characteristic, just a response to an unideal circumstance.

{"body":"I'm not trying to be argumentative, and I take your point that numbers are a pretty sure way to win, but in this case, it wasn't as simple as that. Getting those sheer numbers was a fairly remarkable feat of maneuvering and leadership on the part of the Lakota in itself. They didn't have a centralizing government or telegraph lines to order up troops. They didn't have railroads to ship fresh men out or riverboats to resupply them en mass. We say that it was Custer vs. the "Sioux" or Lakota like they were a unified standing army versus another unified standing army. But in the case of the BLH, we were talking scores of bands of unique, culturally distinct tribes: Lakota, Dakota, Oglala, Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, etc etc. who had been previously stretched out over hundreds of miles of Badlands. Sometimes these bands were traditional enemies with each other, some were previously reservation Indians, some were from Canada come down to hunt buffalo in the summer, sometimes they spoke different languages. The sheer fact that they were able to unify into a singular fighting force is in itself incredible. It hadn't ever happened on the Plains before, and it didn't ever happen again. 		The charisma of leaders like Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in their ability to unite and militarize in an amazingly brief time aside, think of the sheer difficulty of maintaining a camp of 8,000 people who didn't have the pack trains/rations/government support that Custer's men had. Supplying enough grass for a pony herd that big, or sanitation for that many people camped in such a small group. The Plains Indians were usually nomadic because the land was so brutal that it could only support small groups at a time. The fact that they pulled it off is an amazing feat of management, organization, and skill.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hypocrite_deer","name":"t1_csjmhnq","parent_id":"t1_csjaro9","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435343894,"created_utc":1435340294}

{"body":"EDIT: YES I KNOW I SPELLED SIOUX WRONG IN THE TITLE. IT WAS BEFORE MY FIRST CUP OF COFFEE. I'M HUMAN. Geez, people. 		On this day in 1876, Native American forces led by Chiefs Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull defeat the U.S. Army troops of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer in a bloody battle near southern Montana???s Little Bighorn River.		Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, leaders of the Sioux tribe on the Great Plains, strongly resisted the mid-19th-century efforts of the U.S. government to confine their people to reservations. In 1875, after gold was discovered in South Dakota???s Black Hills, the U.S. Army ignored previous treaty agreements and invaded the region. This betrayal led many Sioux and Cheyenne tribesmen to leave their reservations and join Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in Montana. By the late spring of 1876, more than 10,000 Native Americans had gathered in a camp along the Little Bighorn River???which they called the Greasy Grass???in defiance of a U.S. War Department order to return to their reservations or risk being attacked.		In mid-June, three columns of U.S. soldiers lined up against the camp and prepared to march. A force of 1,200 Native Americans turned back the first column on June 17. Five days later, General Alfred Terry ordered Custer???s 7th Cavalry to scout ahead for enemy troops. On the morning of June 25, Custer drew near the camp and decided to press on ahead rather than wait for reinforcements.		At mid-day, Custer???s 600 men entered the Little Bighorn Valley. Among the Native Americans, word quickly spread of the impending attack. The older Sitting Bull rallied the warriors and saw to the safety of the women and children, while Crazy Horse set off with a large force to meet the attackers head on. Despite Custer???s desperate attempts to regroup his men, they were quickly overwhelmed. Custer and some 200 men in his battalion were attacked by as many as 3,000 Native Americans; within an hour, Custer and every last one of his soldier were dead.		The Battle of Little Bighorn???also called Custer???s Last Stand???marked the most decisive Native American victory and the worst U.S. Army defeat in the long Plains Indian War. The gruesome fate of Custer and his men outraged many white Americans and confirmed their image of the Indians as wild and bloodthirsty. Meanwhile, the U.S. government increased its efforts to subdue the tribes. Within five years, almost all of the Sioux and Cheyenne would be confined to reservations.","depth":0,"score":130,"ups":130,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_csi4frw","parent_id":"t3_3b29ge","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435235846,"created_utc":1435232246}

Making a giant monument from a landscape feature is just very against the spirit of being in harmony with the land though in the first place.

Quote:	There were 2,361 cartridges, cases and bullets recovered from the entire battlefield, which reportedly came from 45 different firearms types (including the Army Springfields and Colts, of course) and represented at least 371 individual guns. The evidence indicated that the Indians used Sharps, Smith & Wessons, Evans, Henrys, Winchesters, Remingtons, Ballards, Maynards, Starrs, Spencers, Enfields and Forehand & Wadworths, as well as Colts and Springfields of other calibers. There was evidence of 69 individual Army Springfields on Custer???s Field (the square-mile section where Custer???s five companies died), but there was also evidence of 62 Indian .44-caliber Henry repeaters and 27 Sharps .50-caliber weapons. In all, on Custer???s Field there was evidence of at least 134 Indian firearms versus 81 for the soldiers. It appears that the Army was outgunned as well as outnumbered.

{"body":"According to Nathaniel Philbrick and James and Jim Donovan's respective books on the topic, it really was a perfect storm of ignorance, circumstance, pretty (to Custer or other whites) unusual behavior on the part of Lakota. Not trying to be a Custer apologist here. I really think it's pretty easy to go back and see places where if he had made a different choice (not dividing his troop, resting the horses instead of attacking first, listened to his Indian scouts...) the battle might have turned out differently. That said, he had well-reasoned arguments for doing what he did based on years of experiences where his action would have proved the rational choice.

Your Washita example is actually some part of what I meant--he was attacking a small village (in a series of bigger villages whoops) but because of his tendency to capture noncombatants/the seeming "willingness" of villages to disband to protect their women and children instead of making a concentrated counter attack like a military unit would do, the actual literal number of Indians didn't seem important to Custer. There might be more Indians than Cavalry, but he didn't expect them all to be fighting--some would be running, some would be escorting noncoms, some would be unwilling to fight because of the hostages he planned to take a la Washita.  		Jim and James Donovan's *A Terrible Glory* makes some mention of a few attacks of hostile Lakota on much smaller expeditions and groups that Custer would have been aware of or perceived as being "won" despite numbers being against the whites. The Lakota were moving around and couldn't afford to sacrifice resources on an extended siege, so even if they had the numbers advantage, if it looked like a drawn-out firefight, they would often withdraw instead of continuing the attack.

If you want a digestible high level overview of the war, I'd recommend the Ken Burns documentary, which is 10 parts, I believe, and also has a pretty violin theme song.  Another good and entertaining documentary that comes to mind is Lee vs Grant on the History Channel.		If you want a primer on Gettysburg, you can read The Killer Angels and/or watch the movie Gettysburg, which is based off the book.  It's 4 hours and is a little dry, but it stars Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and others you'd recognize.  These are technically works of historical fiction, and they are based on an outdated narrative of the battle (e.g., many people agree now that the key action that Jeff Daniels's character was involved in at Little Round Top wasn't necessarily as pivotal as shown in the movie), but is generally pretty historically accurate (though it only shows parts of the battle that the main characters are involved in).		The best Gettysburg book I've read is "The Last Invasion" by Guelzo.  It has a great combination of the political and military situation leading up to the battle, details on the battle itself, and the aftermath.		Stephen Sears has three books I really like that provide super-detailed looks at Antietam, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg - down to the "this regiment moved to this position and was attacked by this regiment around 11:15 AM", with maps and all that, but told in a narrative style.  It also contains background and aftermath.  If you are interested in tactics, check out these three books.

There many soldiers were hit by long range fire, as there was much high ground outside their perimeter from which they had no shelter.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Seeda_Boo","name":"t1_cskwe8c","parent_id":"t1_csibnxx","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435449135,"created_utc":1435445535}

{"body":"Why take down the statue?		Custer has been a useful metaphor for Hollywood and the media to symbolize manifest destiny and the legacy of mistreatment of indigenous peoples in the U.S. Custer the man is more complicated than that. He wrote extensively with appreciation for the native way of life and bemoaning the raw deals that they got time and again from the U.S. government and BIA, he had even lamented their inevitable fate in an essay while at West Point. He did not look upon them with contempt as so many suggest, nor did he even fight them as often as popular belief would have it.		He was a legitimate Civil War hero among heroes. Custer-led units captured nearly 200 Confederate regimental colors, including 38 on  the chase from Petersburg to Appomattox alone. His men seized the first enemy colors captured in the war by the Union Army during the Peninsula Campaign and he received Lee's flag of truce on the morning of April 9, 1865 at Appomattox.		Cited for bravery in his first battle, First Bull Run. Newly promoted at the age of 23 just before Gettysburg to brigadier general, his men prevented J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry from reaching the rear of the Union forces on the final day of battle with two spectacular charges, the final of which has been cited by both military witnesses and historians as among the greatest in the history of cavalry. Later in the war at Yellow Tavern it was Custer's men who killed Stuart, dealing a major blow to the Confederacy. In the Shenandoah Valley campaign Confederate soldiers facing Custer would urge their artillery crews to fire their cannons posthaste, before he seized them. 		By the war's end he had become the (still today) youngest major general in the history of the U.S. Army and made such an impact that Sheridan purchased the table upon which Lee had signed the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia to present to Custer's wife as a gift. Sheridan's note to her stated ???Permit me to say, Madam, that there is scarcely an individual in our service who has contributed more to bring about this desirable result than your gallant husband.???","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Seeda_Boo","name":"t1_cskyuhc","parent_id":"t1_csimviy","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435454261,"created_utc":1435450661}

He might've stood a fighting chance if he hadn't alienated Captain Bentene in the months prior - Custer abandoned his own men, and later denied the men a proper burial, much to the chagrin of Bentene The tipping point was when Custer denied Bentene's leave request to visit his sick child, as revenge for publishing an excoriating letter that humiliated Custer publicly. Bentene's child died shortly thereafter and that was the final straw. At Little Big Horn when Bentene receives an ambiguously worded note from Custer calling for aid and supplies, Bentene orders his men to dismount and reinforce Major Reed's company instead, thus sealing Custer's fate.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RedRaiderATX","name":"t1_csie6iu","parent_id":"t3_3b29ge","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435254342,"created_utc":1435250742}
