{"body":"In British India there was a little problem with cobras. The obvious solution was to put a bounty on them. The only problem was that the price for each cobra the British were offering was greater than the cost of breeding and raising a cobra. The result was people breeding tons of snakes to claim the bounty. When the government realized what was happening they scrapped the whole program. People raising the now worthless cobras set them loose.		The end result was a big cobra problem.","depth":0,"score":1203,"ups":1203,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lorde_blue","name":"t1_crcdjf5","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431907335,"created_utc":1431903735}

{"body":"The Pig War was a confrontation in 1859 between the United States and the British Empire over the boundary between the US and British North America. 		But it started over a pig.		"On June 15, 1859, exactly thirteen years after the adoption of the Oregon Treaty, the ambiguity led to direct conflict. Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer who had moved onto the island claiming rights to live there under the Donation Land Claim Act, found a large black pig rooting in his garden. He had found the pig eating his tubers. This was not the first occurrence. Cutlar was so upset that he took aim and shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company to run the sheep ranch. He also owned several pigs which he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100. Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not have to pay for the pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. (A possibly apocryphal story claims **Cutlar said to Griffin, "It was eating my potatoes."** **Griffin replied, "It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig."**) When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for military protection."		The Americans dispatched **66 soliders**, so the British complete reasonable reaction was to send in **3 warships.**		**"By August 10, 1859, 461 Americans with 14 cannon under Colonel Silas Casey were opposed by five British warships mounting 70 guns and carrying 2,140 men. During this time, no shots were fired."**		"The governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas, ordered British Rear Admiral Robert L. Baynes to land marines on San Juan Island and engage the American soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Harney. (Harney's forces had occupied the island since July 27, 1859.) Baynes refused, deciding that "two great nations in a war over a squabble about a pig" was foolish.		Local commanding officers on both sides had been given essentially the same orders: defend yourselves, but absolutely do not fire the first shot. For several days, **the British and U.S. soldiers exchanged insults, each side attempting to goad the other into firing the first shot**, but discipline held on both sides, and thus no shots were fired."","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yorkton","name":"t1_crceb8w","parent_id":"t1_crc3l7t","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431908916,"created_utc":1431905316}

The games were actually a part of the World's Fair that year, and along with that came all sorts of exhibitions.  From Slate:  		> One of the centerpieces of the fair was its Philippine village, featuring live specimens from America's newly acquired territory in a replicated "native habitat" that spread out over 47 acres. Smaller villages were constructed to house Pygmies from Central Africa, American Indians from Mexico, Syrians, Turks, and other "savages"; visitors could gawk at them as they simulated a normal day back home. 	... 	> They would hold a "Special Olympics" (Sullivan's phrase) during the plain-old Olympics in which the "savages" would mimic their white counterparts. For Sullivan, it would demonstrate the inherent inferiority of the world's indigenous peoples. For McGee, it would create a body of data that would help him make his mark in the emerging field of anthropology and help him develop his pet bit of quackery: a complete racial hierarchy.		>The Special Olympics were harder to pull together than they expected. Despite the fact that the folks in the human zoo were in quasi-captivity, they were paid professionals. With agents and everything. Very few of the "primitives" had any interest in participating in an amateur competition: The Ainu people of Japan might have stooped to climb trees for fair-goers, but that was because they got paid for it. Some, too, seemed to balk because they thought the Olympic sports were ridiculous. Water polo???no joke???was quickly scratched from the program. But eventually, whether due to coercion or curiosity, contestants were secured and the bizarre games within the games began.","depth":2,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CeruleanRuin","name":"t1_crcobed","parent_id":"t1_crc5grp","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431929819,"created_utc":1431926219}

Most nose bleeds happen from the lining of Little's area on the nasal septum towards the front of the nose (the plane of cartilage separating both sides of the nose) so pinching the soft bit of the nose (closing nostrils) firmly for 20 mins straight will usually stop it.		A minority of nosebleeds are posterior (further back than the area you can reach with a pinch) and as the nasal passages go straight into your head at 90 degrees as opposed to up toward the brain (a common misconception) posterior bleeds will often result in blood trickling directly down the throat from the rear part of the nasal space.

The driver was basically confused about where he should go and was going very slow over the bridge and Princip was able to run up to the car and shoot them.

And let me know if you got any questions so i could be more clear. So, a common misconception about that battle is that the war was over because the treaty was signed. This is only partially true. A modern day example would be: imagine writing a check. You then hand it whomever. It isnt normally going to hit until a business day. Back to 1814, The treaty of ghent was signed but not yet ratified. Even though both sides had reached agreement, the war was not over before the battle took place! So when the british marched towards the rampart, america fired from the other side of the river with motars flanking them on the battle field. The blue cannons behind the rampart eventually ran out of cannon balls and gunpowder. So they improvised and used forks, spoons, pellets, pretty much whatver they had in their pockets to use as a weapon, and as for gunpowder, they used bat dung. Eventually the british fled.

{"body":"In the 1600s, Prince Charles of England and the Spanish princess Maria Anna were supposed to be wed, as a huge diplomatic deal between the two countries. Due to political issues the negotiations took *nine years*, Spain was essentially stalling for time to keep Britain peaceful, pretending that there were religious troubles. Eventually Prince Charles and the Duke of Buckingham sailed for Spain (in secret, on their own initiative, much to the alarm of King James of England when they vanished and the British ambassador in Spain when they showed up) in an attempt to woo the princess, thinking that it would really work. The princess had zero intention of ever marrying Charles and so they went home in disgrace.		Two years later Charles, now King, attacked Spain. The previous King and parliament had massive fallouts over this sensitive political issue, Charles assumed that by just launching an attack everything would sort itself out. The commander, Cecil, planned to raid Spanish treasure ships but missed them due to a storm. He went ahead with the invasion woefully unprepared. He attacked a port city and found many Spanish ships there, but didn't give the order to attack (thinking his fleet would take the initiative) so they escaped. He executed a very difficult and costly attack on a fort, which succeeded, then realised that was of no use whatsoever in capturing the actual city, which was one of the most heavily defended in Spain. The English hadn't brought enough food with them so Cecil was forced to allow his men to ransack the local pubs, and they all got raging drunk. The Spanish showed up and Cecil had to retreat, the 1000 men who got left behind were too drunk to defend themselves and were executed. The fleet retreated to England and missed yet another raiding opportunity. They got no loot and caused no damage to the Spanish.		Because King Charles' best mate (and probably gay lover) the Duke of Buckingham had organised this farce, Charles refused to acknowledge the colossal failure and just let it go. Parliament was outraged and impeached the Duke, but Charles dissolved the parliament, setting the tone for his entire reign. Some years later, after a lot more ridiculous conflict between the King and Parliament, civil war breaks out, the King is beheaded, and the monarchy suspended. It never regains the power it used to have and parliament runs the country forever.		TL:DR Prince gets friendzoned, British monarchy loses relevance.		This ended up longer than I thought it would but I think the context is necessary to understand what a monumental farce the whole thing was.","depth":0,"score":483,"ups":483,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ppphhh","name":"t1_crc22f2","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431885819,"created_utc":1431882219}

{"body":"There is so much wrong with this post I don't even know where to begin...		First off, Sedgwick wasn't really involved at Chancellorsville. Hooker sent Sedgwick and his corps to Marye's Heights (No Saint involved) to pin down Early's Division that Lee placed there. The Union disaster at Chancellorsville was Hooker's incompetence and loss of nerve, nothing to do with Sedgwick. Sedgwick actually pushed Early off Marye's Heights after Jackson's flank attack. Sure you could say that if he had attacked when Hooker sent his discretionary orders he might have done something but at that point he was too far away to have any real effect on the battle. 		Second it was Fredericksburg, not Fredericksville, and again it's just Marye's Heights. Burnside's initial plan at Fredericksburg, after the timing got thrown to shit, was to put just enough at those heights and the stone wall to keep those troops there while other troops attacked further south. Meade's division actually broke through AP Hill's line early on but the attack went unsupported and the Union troops were pushed back as the fight shifted to Marye's Heights. 		The reason there was so much screwy with the early Civil War is that both sides basically started handing out commissions to anyone who would raise a regiment of men. Gathered about 1000 dudes and equipped 'em? Congratulations you're a colonel. Naturally this meant that those who could afford to do this, the rich older dudes who dreamed of the glory of war, wound up as the commanders. McClellan was different though. McClellan seems to have cared a bit too much for his men and didn't want to send them into battle. After Seven Pines he was so troubled by the losses that he lost his nerve some. Plus he  was getting troop numbers from the Pinkerton's who took whatever they heard as the word of God so the number they provided were inflated already and once McClellan got 'em he doubled it. It got to the point where McClellan was claiming the Confederates had more troops in Northern Virginia than there were eligible men to serve. But for all his failings on the field off the field McClellan did do a lot of good. He got the Army of the Potomac trained and organized, and also made camp life more bearable. 		Burnside at least knew he was unfit for command of the Army and declined it until he learned Hooker would be given it. The two were rivals so he took it and came up with a good plan to get around Lee but when the timing got thrown off led to the Battle of Fredericksburg. Hooker lost his nerve at Chancellorsville and never found it again. Meade did well enough but wound up with Grant watching him like a hawk so he wasn't on his own as much. The Confederacy also had it's share of busts. AP Hill was sick more often than not by the end of the war, Dick Ewell never recovered his fighting spirit to what it once was after he lost a leg at Manassas. John Bell Hood systematically destroyed the Army of Tennessee after Bragg bungled it along for three years. Beauregard was Forrest Gump in that he had a tendency to show up where things were going to happen (Ft. Sumter, Manassas, Shiloh, Petersburg). Gettysburg was just one Confederate mistake after another.		But in the end it came down to old men fighting a new kind of war in the old ways. Rifled muskets made the massed volleys unnecessary but they happened anyways because that was how the Generals had been taught. And in the end it was the men on the lines who had to pay for that.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RockdaleRooster","name":"t1_crcplhd","parent_id":"t1_crcjkhz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431933596,"created_utc":1431929996}

So the king shows up, and of course FDR hasn't done anything about the cartoons.  His mom hopes the king just doesn't notice, and of course the king makes a beeline to them and starts reading.  He spends a few minutes going through each one, and then he turns back to look at FDR and his mom, as they're already planning on how to handle the fallout from this international incident.

At noon, on the day of secession, at Mallory Square in Key West Florida, Mayor Wardlow read the proclamation of secession and proclaimed aloud that the Conch Republic was an independent nation separate from the U.S. and then symbolically began the Conch Republic's Civil Rebellion by breaking a loaf of stale Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a U.S. Navy uniform.

{"body":">Battle of Kar??nsebes-	On 17???18 September 1788 Different portions of an Austrian army, which were scouting for forces of the Ottoman Empire, fired on each other by mistake, causing self-inflicted decimation. The army of Austria, approximately 100,000 strong, was setting up camp around the town of Kar??nsebes (now Caransebe??, in modern Romania). The army's vanguard, a contingent of hussars, crossed the Timi?? River nearby to scout for the presence of the Ottoman Turks. There was no sign of the Ottoman army, but the hussars did run into a group of Romani, who offered to sell schnapps to the war-weary soldiers. The cavalrymen bought the schnapps and started to drink.	Soon afterwards, some infantry crossed the river. When they saw the party, they demanded alcohol for themselves. The hussars refused and, while still drunk, set up makeshift fortifications around the barrels. A heated argument ensued, and one soldier fired a shot. Immediately, the hussars and infantry engaged in combat with one another. During the conflict, some infantry began shouting "Turci! Turci!" ("Turks! Turks!"). The hussars fled the scene, plus other minorities, many of whom could not understand each other, thinking that the Ottoman army???s attack was imminent. While it is not clear which of these groups did so, they gave the false warning without telling the others, who promptly fled. The situation was made worse when officers, in an attempt to restore order, shouted "Halt! Halt!" which was misheard by soldiers with no knowledge of German as "Allah! Allah!". As the cavalry ran through the camps, a corps commander reasoned that it was a cavalry charge by the Ottoman army, and ordered artillery fire. Meanwhile, the entire camp awoke to the sound of battle and, rather than waiting to see what the situation was, everyone fled. The troops fired at every shadow, thinking the Ottomans were everywhere; in reality they were shooting fellow Austrian soldiers. The incident escalated to the point where the whole army retreated from the imaginary enemy, and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II was pushed off his horse into a small creek. Two days later, the Ottoman army arrived. They discovered 10,000 dead and wounded soldiers and easily took Caransebe??.","depth":0,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Syphonotan","name":"t1_crccwxw","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431906096,"created_utc":1431902496}

There was a dispute of land in the San Juans between the USA and Britain in the mid 1800s that eventually resulted in the Oregon Treaty in 1846.

Thus ended the second tyranny of Peisistratos, run out of Athens by his father in law.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"principe_di_gatti","name":"t1_crcfxgv","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431912178,"created_utc":1431908578}

Nobody had ever seen anything like that before, but everyone was sure it was genuine, since, quote unquote, "nobody to date has the taxidermy skills to effect such a beautiful fraud." But some people also noticed that the face of the creature looks an awful lot like a customs officer that Waterton had run into trouble with in the past. So, as it turns out, while in South America, Waterton got a monkey's ass, with taxidermy turned it into an animal resembling a customs officer he had a grudge against and presented it as a real animal he found. Once that got out people completely rejected the idea that the recently discovered platypus is real, as it is surely another joke.

{"body":"Socrates essentially trolled everyone in Athens to the point where they had him executed.		As a teacher, he would go to the marketplace and harangue prominent citizens with difficult or abstract philosophical questions, making them look foolish in front of his students.  He proclaimed himself the "gadfly" of Greece, which continually stings and pesters the horse, prompting it towards action.		A common example of one of these exchanges was that Socrates approached a man in fine robes and said "excuse me sir, you look rather wise.  Are you a wise man?"  To which the man responded "yes, I think I am fairly wise."  Socrates then said "great, can you tell me what Wisdom is, for I have struggled all day to come up with a definition for it."  After some thought, the man would say "Wisdom is a rather difficult concept to define..."  To which Socrates would say "well, if you don't know what Wisdom is, how can you claim to have it?  A wise man would not claim to be wise if he didn't know exactly what Wisdom was, so therefore you must be a very foolish man."  Then, he and his students would walk away.		This continued until Socrates had angered a substantial number of influential citizens, and so he was brought to court on charges of corrupting the youth and defaming the gods.		In court, many witnesses testified that he was a very intelligent person with a large amount of influence.  To this, he had his friend go to the Oracle at Delphi and ask if he was indeed the smartest man in Athens.  The Oracle stated that "There are none wiser."  To this Socrates said either that meant he WAS very smart or, more likely, that NOBODY knows anything, which means they are all equally stupid and nobody is wiser.		Next, on the charge of defaming the gods, he got the primary accuser to admit that Socrates believed in the gods, but was an atheist.  Socrates pointed out that this was a contradiction and asked if this was simply some elaborate intelligence test.		Finally, after the guilty verdict was read, Socrates was asked what he thought a suitable punishment would be.  To this, he said that it was obvious that he had done a lot of good for Athens in exposing them to their own stupidity, and as such he deserved to be brought meals in the Pryteneum, an honor reserved for winners of the Olympics.		Later, in jail, his supporters came to him and said that they had arranged an escape.  He could get out, everyone would turn a blind eye, and he could live freely away from Athens.  Socrates refused, however, citing principles.			So they killed him.  By making him drink hemlock.  Just to be rid of him.		His last words to his students who had dedicated their lives to studying his teachings were "I know now that I know nothing."		Most of this is recounted in Plato's Apology and his work Phaedo.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Crede777","name":"t1_crcptig","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431934310,"created_utc":1431930710}

The hussars refused to give them any of the schnapps, and while still drunk, they set up makeshift fortifications around the barrels. A heated argument ensued, and one soldier fired a shot.	Immediately, the hussars and infantry engaged in combat with one another. During the conflict, some infantry began shouting "Turci! Turci!" ("Turks! Turks!"). The hussars fled the scene, thinking that the Ottoman army???s attack was imminent. Most of the infantry also ran away; the army comprised Italians from Lombardy, Serbo-Croatians, and Austrians, plus other minorities, many of whom could not understand each other. While it is not clear which one of these groups did so, they gave the false warning without telling the others, who promptly fled. The situation was made worse when officers, in an attempt to restore order, shouted "Halt! Halt!" which was misheard by soldiers with no knowledge of German as "Allah! Allah!"","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gibblemygoblet","name":"t1_crct9h7","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431949084,"created_utc":1431945484}
{"body":"The Cadaver Synod is pretty great.		So we've got this 9th-century bishop, right?  Overall, people are a pretty big fan of him, especially in Bulgaria. In fact, the people of Bulgaria love him so much, they request him to be their own bishop. Everybody is cool with this bar the current Pope, Nicholas I -- he doesn't let him out of Porto, where he currently is. Oh well.		A decade or so later, there's a new Pope -- John VIII. John VIII fucking *hates* this bishop, because the Bulgarians like him so much they won't stand for any other bishop. The bishop gets excommunicated, and runs away.		Fortunately for the bishop, this all blows over when John dies in 882, he goes back to being bishop of Porto, and everyone loves him again so much that he gets elected pope in 891 as Pope Formosus (despite having been excommunicated less than a decade ago).		This all goes wonderfully, and he does a great number of good things for spreading Christianity to Eastern Europe, and then he dies beloved.		To everyone but his successor, Pope Stephen VII.		Being a rather big fan of John VIII, Stephen has Formosus' body dug up, and sits his corpse down in a chair to stand trial. I'll just quote Wikipedia here, since it does a better job of describing what transpired than I can;		>Formosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. Eventually, the corpse was found guilty. Liutprand and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cruelly tortured the corpse by cutting off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus's acts and ordinations (including, ironically, his ordination of Stephen [VI] VII as bishop of Anagni). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the Tiber River.		This reveals to pretty much everyone that Stephen is completely batshit; and he is usurped, imprisoned, and strangled shortly thereafter.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BurningLed","name":"t1_crcut5b","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431954732,"created_utc":1431951132}

Within a week, 34 others had joined, and within a month, there were around 400 dancers. Some of these people eventually died from heart attacks, strokes, or exhaustion.[1]		Historical documents, including "physician notes, cathedral sermons, local and regional chronicles, and even notes issued by the Strasbourg city council" are clear that the victims danced.[1] It is not known why these people danced, some even to their deaths.		As the dancing plague worsened, concerned nobles sought the advice of local physicians, who ruled out astrological and supernatural causes, instead announcing that the plague was a "natural disease" caused by "hot blood." However, instead of prescribing bleeding, authorities encouraged more dancing, in part by opening two guildhalls and a grain market, and even constructing a wooden stage. The authorities did this because they believed that the dancers would recover only if they danced continuously night and day. To increase the effectiveness of the cure, authorities even paid for musicians to keep the afflicted moving.[2] Some of the dancers were taken to a shrine, where they sought a cure for their affliction.[citation needed]		Historian John Waller stated that a marathon runner could not have lasted the intense workout that the men and women died from hundreds of years ago.[3]","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WDE45","name":"t1_crc8bf0","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431897613,"created_utc":1431894013}

This official declaration of war was forgotten until it was discovered by a local historian in 1981, followed by the signing of a peace treaty on 11 November 1981 by the city mayor and the Ambassador of Denmark. Not a single shot was fired during the 172 years of war, and nobody was killed or injured.		Also, the history of Sealand is absolutely hilarious. A British fort was taken by pirate radio broadcasters, ejected by a British Major who also happened to be a pirate radio broadcaster and subsequently declared his independence. In the 70s, Alexander Achenbach declares himself the Prime Minister of Sealand and hires mercenaries to take the fort, but they are defeated by Prince Roy's son Michael (though at one point he was a hostage). Achenbach had accepted a Sealand passport, and was therefore held on charges of treason until Germany negotiated for his release. There is now a government in exile, the Sealand Rebel Government, that claims they are the legitimate owners of Sealand instead of the family of Prince Roy. To this day, the fort has not been officially recognized, and consists of two hollow towers with a platform on top of it.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"unrealdonnie","name":"t1_crcc3lk","parent_id":"t3_369te7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1431904616,"created_utc":1431901016}

One challenged the other to a duel, and they quickly arranged a time and place. No one else was present that morning except the two men's seconds. Dooley and Healey were determined to proceed in the 'honourable' way, but as they stood back-to-back with their pistols raised, they must have questioned what they were doing. Nerves gave way to terror as they slowly began pacing away from each other. When they had counted off the standard ten yards, they turned and fired. Dooley hit the ground immediately. Healey, believing he had killed Dooley, was seized with horror. But Dooley had merely fainted; the seconds confessed they had so feared the outcome that they loaded the pistols with blanks.
