{"body":"Edit2: I've created a subreddit for discussion on the channel /r/TheGreatWarChannel, and with luck might be able to get the creators involved so they have another platform to interact with fans. Come on over!		This Youtube series I discovered recently is undertaking a mammoth task - covering WW1 as it "unfolds", on its 100th anniversary. Yet in my opinion they're very much lacking in followers for the quality and ambition of their project. I just want to bring them to the attention of other history-lovers who may well be unaware of this little-known channel.		I'd also love to hear what any history buffs think of it. I can't personally attest to its accuracy but it certainly seems thoroughly researched and well-presented. They also maintain an active interaction with commenters, and so will actually respond to valid criticism. From what I've observed, they're really trying to take on feedback to develop the series as it progresses over the next four years.		Edit1: PS this is also an x-post from /r/videos, where I was advised to post it here too. Hopefully some more history fans will appreciate it.","depth":0,"score":349,"ups":349,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eigenvectorseven","name":"t1_clwjn3h","parent_id":"t3_2lnzj2","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1415444849,"created_utc":1415444849}

Whilst the presentation is, obviously, designed to appeal to a mass audience, the details are solid, and I think the episodes dealing with the history of Austria/The Balkans, especially, will be very useful for anyone trying to get a grasp of the factors leading up to the war. 		Certainly in England, education in school tends to focus tends to focus on the British/German relationship to war, and the east is only treated as a side note.		Given that this is a programme with potential mass appeal to students of history etc, I think they ought to be doing a better job marketing it...!","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lordzoot","name":"t1_clxek70","parent_id":"t3_2lnzj2","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1415537483,"created_utc":1415537483}

For a start you claim that 'Americans are better than that', which is a claim which has no evidence to back it up. Additionally, this statement suggests some sort of cultural superiority, which was one of the main flaws of all the belligerents in WW1 - Europeans have learned the hard way about the dangers of such nationalism.		Fundamentally though, this comment is just ridiculous as it suggests that it would have been possible to dispose a government in the situation both France and Germany were in (and you don't actually say which side you're suggesting would dispose their government, either). If you refer to the French, I'm pretty damn sure that Americans would not dispose their government in the middle of a war being fought in their own country. If you refer to the Germans, the consequences of overthrowing the state would have been catastrophic for the country (more so than the eventual terms of Versailles) - things had simply gone on too far.		It's all very well trumpeting what Americans would do but, ultimately, you've never fought a war on your home soil since independence and, additionally, you are not bordered next to a country with similar power and competing interests to your own. Furthermore, in spite of your claim, the American people have allowed their government to dictate terms to them - see Vietnam and Iraq as recent examples.

You know what I mean anyway- talking about the the civil war isn't really relevant in the context of this discussion and the only foreign wars I'm aware of are 1812 (which was a tiny war) and the Mexican war, which, as far as I'm aware, was an expansionist steam roller as opposed to a war fighting for US soil. 		>This is my point, WWI happens because Russia is losing the arms race, because Germany is winning the arms race, because France and Britain are adhering to Bismarck's treaties and Bismarck is dead.

The same argument could be applied to any war, including those that have involved the US. 		>And it's just like the whole of European history everyone follows their king or queen.

Also, suggesting that patriotism is something unique to Europe when the United States is one of the lead nations for it is amusing. Yes, millions died for no reason, but a war akin to WW1 was almost inevitable as soon as the modern nation state started. The soldiers that died in it weren't heroes, they were victims. The best thing we can do is learn from it, which includes not passing around naive statements like 'this wouldn't happen in America because of the nature of the American people'. 		>And Americans at the time were weary from the shit happening in the Philippines 		Again, that's just not comparable.		>and they wouldn't have stood for that and they wouldn't after the fact romanticize it the way I think most Europeans secretly do.		Define romanticising. Yes, soldiers are called heroes by their various states, but is that really a surprise? What else could they have said to avoid mass rebellion?
