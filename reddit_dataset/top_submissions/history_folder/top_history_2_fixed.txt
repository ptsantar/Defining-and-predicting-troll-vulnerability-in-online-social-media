What made Gallipoli so bad was that it started as a naval operation to capture the Bosphorus straights and open up a supply route for the Russians. According to Churchill (whos account is highly biased) the navy was too timid in its actions and afraid to take casualties when pushing the straits, even though most of its ships were obsolete anyways. The initial plan never called for many boots on the ground save for some marines here and there to take out guns, but one thing lead to another and a major invasion was planned to help the navy.  This meant taking time to train new troops, since veterans from the western front couldn't be spared.  Combine this with having zero radio communications and you end up wih green troops landing having to clue what to do, where to go, etc. sometimes being shelled by their own navy. They also underestimated the Turks resilience. While they had no resources to mount offensives, they were more than capable of fighting fanatically on the defense, especially right outside their capitol of Istanbul.

{"body":"Here is the type of speech the soldiers would hade heard before going Into battle. This is General Patton's speech to his third army. 		Be seated.		Men, all this stuff you hear about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of bullshit. Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.		You are not all going to die. Only two percent of you right here today would be killed in a major battle. Every man is scared in his first action. If he says he's not, he's a goddamn liar. But the real hero is the man who fights even though he's scared. Some men will get over their fright in a minute under fire, some take an hour, and for some it takes days. But the real man never lets his fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.		All through your army career you men have bitched about what you call 'this chicken-shit drilling.' That is all for a purpose???to ensure instant obedience to orders and to create constant alertness. This must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a fuck for a man who is not always on his toes. But the drilling has made veterans of all you men. You are ready! A man has to be alert all the time if he expects to keep on breathing. If not, some German son-of-a-bitch will sneak up behind him and beat him to death with a sock full of shit. There are four hundred neatly marked graves in Sicily, all because one man went to sleep on the job???but they are German graves, because we caught the bastard asleep before his officer did.		An army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, and fights as a team. This individual hero stuff is bullshit. The bilious bastards who write that stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real battle than they do about fucking. And we have the best team???we have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit and the best men in the world. Why, by God, I actually pity these poor bastards we're going up against.		All the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters. Every single man in the army plays a vital role. So don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. What if every truck driver decided that he didn't like the whine of the shells and turned yellow and jumped headlong into a ditch? That cowardly bastard could say to himself, 'Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands.' What if every man said that? Where in the hell would we be then? No, thank God, Americans don't say that. Every man does his job. Every man is important. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns, the quartermaster is needed to bring up the food and clothes for us because where we are going there isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last damn man in the mess hall, even the one who boils the water to keep us from getting the GI shits, has a job to do.		Each man must think not only of himself, but think of his buddy fighting alongside him. We don't want yellow cowards in the army. They should be killed off like flies. If not, they will go back home after the war, goddamn cowards, and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the goddamn cowards and we'll have a nation of brave men.		One of the bravest men I saw in the African campaign was on a telegraph pole in the midst of furious fire while we were moving toward Tunis. I stopped and asked him what the hell he was doing up there. He answered, 'Fixing the wire, sir.' 'Isn't it a little unhealthy up there right now?' I asked. 'Yes sir, but this goddamn wire has got to be fixed.' I asked, 'Don't those planes strafing the road bother you?' And he answered, 'No sir, but you sure as hell do.' Now, there was a real soldier. A real man. A man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how great the odds, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty appeared at the time.		And you should have seen the trucks on the road to Gab??s. Those drivers were magnificent. All day and all night they crawled along those son-of-a-bitch roads, never stopping, never deviating from their course with shells bursting all around them. Many of the men drove over 40 consecutive hours. We got through on good old American guts. These were not combat men. But they were soldiers with a job to do. They were part of a team. Without them the fight would have been lost.		Sure, we all want to go home. We want to get this war over with. But you can't win a war lying down. The quickest way to get it over with is to get the bastards who started it. We want to get the hell over there and clean the goddamn thing up, and then get at those purple-pissing Japs. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we go home. The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo. So keep moving. And when we get to Berlin, I am personally going to shoot that paper-hanging son-of-a-bitch Hitler.		When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a Boche will get him eventually. The hell with that. My men don't dig foxholes. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep moving. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and showing the Germans that we've got more guts than they have or ever will have. We're not just going to shoot the bastards, we're going to rip out their living goddamned guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun cocksuckers by the bushel-fucking-basket.		Some of you men are wondering whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you'll all do your duty. War is a bloody business, a killing business. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them, spill their blood or they will spill yours. Shoot them in the guts. Rip open their belly. When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt from your face and you realize that it's not dirt, it's the blood and gut of what was once your best friend, you'll know what to do.		I don't want any messages saying 'I'm holding my position.' We're not holding a goddamned thing. We're advancing constantly and we're not interested in holding anything except the enemy's balls. We're going to hold him by his balls and we're going to kick him in the ass; twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all the time. Our plan of operation is to advance and keep on advancing. We're going to go through the enemy like shit through a tinhorn.		There will be some complaints that we're pushing our people too hard. I don't give a damn about such complaints. I believe that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder we push, the more Germans we kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing harder means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that. My men don't surrender. I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he is hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight. That's not just bullshit either. I want men like the lieutenant in Libya who, with a Luger against his chest, swept aside the gun with his hand, jerked his helmet off with the other and busted the hell out of the Boche with the helmet. Then he picked up the gun and he killed another German. All this time the man had a bullet through his lung. That's a man for you!		Don't forget, you don't know I'm here at all. No word of that fact is to be mentioned in any letters. The world is not supposed to know what the hell they did with me. I'm not supposed to be commanding this army. I'm not even supposed to be in England. Let the first bastards to find out be the goddamned Germans. Some day, I want them to rise up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl 'Ach! It's the goddamned Third Army and that son-of-a-bitch Patton again!'		Then there's one thing you men will be able to say when this war is over and you get back home. Thirty years from now when you're sitting by your fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks, 'What did you do in the great World War Two?' You won't have to cough and say, 'Well, your granddaddy shoveled shit in Louisiana.' No sir, you can look him straight in the eye and say 'Son, your granddaddy rode with the great Third Army and a son-of-a-goddamned-bitch named George Patton!'		All right, you sons of bitches. You know how I feel. I'll be proud to lead you wonderful guys in battle anytime, anywhere. That's all.","depth":0,"score":78,"ups":78,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rokhard82","name":"t1_crxeafn","parent_id":"t3_38r9rn","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1433587220,"created_utc":1433583620}

One, is the view of a bunch of men running up a beach, and the other is that old man you knew growing up that lived just down the street and your grandparents. These images are often very separated.		You have to think of that old man, not some grizzled veteran, but a boy. Maybe 18, sitting in a small boat. Not some great warship riding the open seas, but a minuscule landing craft in horrid conditions. Bullets flying overhead, wondering if the next will be his. Watching, waiting, hearing artillery sink the boat next to him, full of his friends. His true family that day.		A boy that finally hear the sand crunch as the boat lands, and watches the boat open. Not to a beach, not to a clean video game visage. But hell it very self. He hopes a machine gunner doesn't already have his boat in sight, tearing people apart before they even step out.		If he makes it out of that boat, to wade through water that isn't blue nor brown, but the red of his friends. To watch as those near him are struck and drown in the water next to him, unable to stop and help, but only run faster towards this hellish landscape. Tank traps, barbed wire, and the cliffs filled with those many thunderous machines rendering his friends to pieces. He runs past the dead, the dying, and the pieces of people he loved.		Boys, running straight into hell. Boys that survived this didn't get tomorrow off, they only were given the privilege of more. We see old photos of them and their war buddies.

In terms of human capital, so many new industrial workers were created, our factories were bigger than ever, and with Europe torn to shreds our Exports were bigger than ever.  Not that we needed it though, with young men coming home ready to start new lives, and rations ending.  Our economic  potential was crazy.  While the rest of the world was licking their wounds, we were sprinting ahead.  It's a large reason why America became a superpower.		The war was also a very unique case of something that seems very clear cut.  It's really hard to argue (and maybe this is just a historical filter of perspective?) that the Nazi's were anything other than evil.  To Americans WW2 represents a gold standard in wars.  We were the good guys, we had a clear objective (take down Hitler!), and had a clear victory.  When everything was over we got to fly back home to our in-tact homes.  		It's also probably why we don't spend a lot of time discussing how Japan ended.  The moral superiority in that situation is beyond ambiguous.   The act is justified as a means to save lives, but a large portion of the deaths were civilian, which makes the justification kind of a mute point.

{"body":"I will say that Soviet Leadership was incompetent at the beginning of the war because of Stalin's repeated purges. Millions of Russians died because millions were captured by the Nazis during Barbarossa. Entire divisions were encircled and surrendered. As Timothy Snyder discusses in *Bloodlands*, the Nazis places Soviet soldiers in "camps" that were nothing more than open areas of land surrounded by barbed wire and fences on four sides. They're hardly given food and water, and what they were given was not enough. Millions of Red Army soldiers died in captivity. Millions more died in the initial stages of the war when the Red Army was in disarray. 		When the Red Army went on the offensive they were able to inflict devastating losses on the Wehrmacht, with the crowning achievement of Operation Bagration. The Red Army completely outmaneuvered Nazi leadership and utterly destroyed Army Group Center.

Souce http://www.historynet.com/did-russia-really-go-it-alone-how-lend-lease-helped-the-soviets-defeat-the-germans.htm		"According to research by a team of Soviet historians, the Soviet Union lost a staggering 20,500 tanks from June 22 to December 31, 1941. At the end of November 1941, only 670 Soviet tanks were available to defend Moscow???that is, in the recently formed Kalinin, Western, and Southwestern Fronts. Only 205 of these tanks were heavy or medium types, and most of their strength was concentrated in the Western Front, with the Kalinin Front having only two tank battalions (67 tanks) and the Southwestern Front two tank brigades (30 tanks).		Given the disruption to Soviet production and Red Army losses, the Soviet Union was understandably eager to put British armor into action as soon as possible. According to Biriukov???s service diary, the first 20 British tanks arrived at the Soviet tank training school in Kazan on October 28, 1941, at which point a further 120 tanks were unloaded at the port of Archangel in northern Russia. Courses on the British tanks for Soviet crews started during November as the first tanks, with British assistance, were being assembled from their in-transit states and undergoing testing by Soviet specialists.		The tanks reached the front lines with extraordinary speed. Extrapolating from available statistics, researchers estimate that British-supplied tanks made up 30 to 40 percent of the entire heavy and medium tank strength of Soviet forces before Moscow at the beginning of December 1941, and certainly made up a significant proportion of tanks available as reinforcements at this critical point in the fighting. By the end of 1941 Britain had delivered 466 tanks out of the 750 promised."","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BigDaveTheMountain","name":"t1_crxhlz3","parent_id":"t1_crxdu4g","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1433600645,"created_utc":1433597045}

Some not so nice things I remember him telling me:		At one point they were so deep into France/Belgium and were without supplies for so long, he was forced to take boots off of a dead soldier.

{"body":"My father-in-law lived in Holland during the Nazi occupation. He also holds a special place for America because they liberated  him. I believe he was around the ages of 8 to 12 during the occupation, so it is something he clearly remembers.  He tells stories about how at eight or nine years old he weighed under 40 pounds, and how he and his father would ride a bicycle with no tires over 10 miles to get rotten potatoes from farms outside of Rotterdam.		One story that comes to mind which hit me hard, was; he lived in a row house in Rotterdam, and had a crush on a 10-year-old girl who lived in the rowhouse at the end of his street. The Nazis 	commandeered the girls house because it had the best vantage point on the town. One day he saw the girl try to sneak into the back of her old house to steal bread from the pantry because everyone was starving. A nazi shot her from her bedroom window. 		I Believe he lived under occupation for a few years. He said it was crazy, there was no food, fuel etc. He said there were no pets anymore and that people at basically pulled all the trim off of their houses to heat them during the colder time.		I was at his house a few months back having a glass of wine and talking to them about it, and he took out some pictures. In the picture book he found the flyer that the Allied forces had dropped over Tue city to inform citizens that the Germans had capitulated and that the war was over. He burst into tears and said it was the happiest day of his life. It still gives me shivers to this day to think about it.

In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.		Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.		But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.		I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.		Good Luck!

Nazi Germany would like a word with you:   	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa		>Over the course of the operation, about **four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded Soviet Russia along a 2,900 kilometer front**, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare.		I'm also pretty sure that a lot of East Asian countries would like a word with you. The Mongols and some Chinese emperors had armies in the size of many millions and used them quite often.		For example the Sui invasion against the (now) Korean peninsula:    	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo%E2%80%93Sui_War		>The force gathered by year's end was one of the greatest according to the Book of Sui. Allegedly **1,133,000 troops were mobilized**. This does not count the number of laborers and soldiers that were required to carry provisions to support the massive army. Some argue that the **Sui dynasty deflated the army size** when keeping record after the war. **This leads to an estimation that there were about 2,000,000 if the supporting soldiers were also counted**.		A hundred thousand of those were directly led in a naval assault against the city of Pyeongyang alone (out of 505,000 dispatched to the city).		>The new strategy was to keep the fortresses of Goguryeo in Manchuria at bay, while sending a contingent of army and navy to take Pyongyang, Goguryeo's capital. An army contingent, allegedly with a strength of 305,000, and a naval fleet of some 200,000 were dispatched.				That invasion included the largest verifiable battle in human history:   	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salsu		>This led to an **overall campaign loss of all but 2,800 Sui troops out of 350,000 men**","depth":0,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"emuparty","name":"t1_crxh53h","parent_id":"t3_38r9rn","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1433599169,"created_utc":1433595569}
