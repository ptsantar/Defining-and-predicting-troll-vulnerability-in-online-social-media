{"body":"You have to remember that propaganda during the First World War had greatly exaggerated - actually, pretty much invented - all kinds of atrocities by "The Hun" that were shown to be untrue.		The Allied governments didn't want to risk their credibility again by pushing unbelievable propaganda.		And you can see from the reaction of even top level leaders like Eisenhower (who was so horrified by the concentration camps he rounded up German citizens and forced them to see for themselves) that the Allied leadership really didn't know much about what was going on.","depth":0,"score":376,"ups":376,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jgelling","name":"t1_cp84lfb","parent_id":"t3_2yc0no","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1425826755,"created_utc":1425823155}

Stolen Jewish gold and other income certainly didn't compensate for the huge loss of potential work force and brain force.

On the other hand, it did provide shitty labour by millions of starving inmates who want you dead and do everything they can muster to sabotage production (leading to malfunctioning parts, malfunctioning munition and other fun stuff to have in a total war). 		In addition it also bogged down resources that could have fought elsewhere, and proved to be highly demoralizing for many Nazis who participated. Himmler himself begged Nazi HQ not to use his SS troops for mass-shooting civilian Jews, as they became destroyed mentally and much less useful as troops after.

{"body":"No worries, it just seemed like an odd question. Not sure where you got that idea. It's understandable though. Japan is somewhat like that. After the Second World War, they were forbidden by their own constitution (written by the occupant Americans) from posessing a military. They still have a 'Defense Force' but they are not able to operate beyond their own territory. 		In terms of neutrality, often the only way to mantain neutrality is to have a big military. Little countries like Belgium aren't going to be able to resist the might of a great power like Germany or France, but they maintain what defensive capabilities they can as a form of detterence. This didn't work out for them - they were invaded by Germany in both world wars, and devastated, but in the case of Switzerland it worked fantastically. They were prepared to destroy every bridge and tunnel and road leading into the country to slow a German incursion, and to take to the hills for a drawn out guerrilla battle. They ended up staying neutral, as the Germans believed it was more in their interest to have a neutral Switzerland than the trouble of invading it. 		Countries that aren't neutral actually can have less military, relying on their bigger allies to fight for them. For instance, France, during the Cold War, wanted to maintain some autonomy from both the Soviet Union and the USA, so they kept up a large military and nuclear arsenal, to ensure they couldn't be bullied by either power.		To this day every Swiss citizen must serve in the military (except in cases of conscientious objectors and the like, who are able to perform another form of civil service instead). I've heard every Swiss citizen must keep a rifle in a locked and sealed case in his or her house, only to be used in case of invasion or utmost emergency.

To the Germans the idea of non-uniformed civilians shooting at them was just repugnant and they viewed them as nothing more than criminal terrorists. 		So when they invaded Belgium in order to outflank the French armies and met heavy resistance, as well as sporadic guerilla resistance, they started a "policy of frightfulness" to awe and frighten the civilians into staying out of their way. There most likely was some guerilla activity, but there was also a large amount of unfounded paranoia on the German side. They'd be marching through a town, hear a shot, and assume they were under attack by guerillas. 		Their plan had a strict timeline. They felt they *had* to defeat the French within forty days. So when the Belgians put up their fierce resistance and blew their bridges, that put the Germans into a still more unforgiving mood.

Speer himself was worried especially about oil facilities being bombed.

When Adolf Hitler was named chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Wise organized a mass protest rally at Madison Square Garden, in New York City. He accomplished this despite the opposition of the German government, the US State Department, and conservative Jewish organizations. The American Jewish Congress continued to organize protest rallies throughout the 1930s and 1940s.		>In August 1933 the American Jewish Congress led a general boycott of German goods. Although active in protesting Nazi mistreatment of German Jews, the AJC abstained from publicly calling upon the US government to admit additional refugees from Germany. In this stance, they shared the views of other American Jewish organizations, which feared that such a demand would lead to further restrictions on immigration and an increase in American antisemitism.		>In August 1942, Rabbi Wise received a cable from Gerhart Riegner, the WJC representative in Switzerland. Riegner reported that the Nazis had planned and were implementing a policy to murder the Jews, ([The Final Solution](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007328)), of Europe; the cable also referred specifically to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. After the State Department confirmed the accuracy of the information in the cable, now known as the "Riegner telegram," the AJC convened a Joint Emergency Committee. The committee sought to coordinate the major Jewish organizations in the United States to lobby the Roosevelt administration to take more steps to rescue European Jews.		>In December 1942 the American Jewish Congress established a Planning Committee, which sought support for a variety of rescue proposals. The committee was never more than marginally successful in mobilizing American public support for rescue efforts. The most impressive of these projects was another rally at Madison Square Garden.

An accurate review of your book:		>That was the authors' objective and it would have been a valuable publication for those interested in learning more about the war and the Wehrmacht. Instead of letting Axis soldiers speak for themselves, however, the authors chose to add a lot of invidious, confusing commentary of their own. For example, they quote a German sailor named Horst Minnieur, who describes the sexual exploitation of a "pretty Jewess" and other female prisoners, who were brutally raped then executed (pp. 164-166). Minnieur wasn't a member of the SS or involved with any of its murderous Einsatzgruppen, or mobile death squads.		>Rather than explain the significance of that, the authors note that "Historian Bernd Greiner has documented similar cases in the Vietnam War." (p. 166). Indeed he has in KRIEG OHNE FRONTEN: DIE USA IN VIETNAM (2007). An adjunct professor of history at the University of Hamburg and an associate of the Institute for Marxist Studies and Research and the Center for Marxist Peace Research, Greiner's book is a detailed summary of My Lai and the atrocities committed by American soldiers under Lieutenant William Calley. Greiner studied in the US during the Vietnam War and writes like a devoted Leftist. He makes no mention whatsoever of any Communist atrocities, such as Hue, nor does he emphasize the fact that Calley was stopped by other American soldiers and then court-marshalled for violating American policies about respecting the rights of non-combatants. Had Calley been a Communist officer, for example, his conduct would have been exemplary if it was noted officially. He certainly would not have been court-marshalled during a time of war for it. To attempt a comparison between American soldiers in Vietnam and Werhmacht soldiers in WW II simply clutters up the narrative. Seaman Minnieur's complicity in rape and murder was consistant with Hitler's policy of depopulating Poland and annihilating the Jews. Lieutenant Calley violated American policies and was punished for it, a point Adjunct Professor Greiner and other America-haters fail to mention.		>This could have been a much more valuable book if the authors had been more objective and included more wheat and less chaff in its pages. It did have some material about Axis soldiers I haven't seen before, but it also included a lot of Communist-era drivel that I've seen for decades on the extreme left.
