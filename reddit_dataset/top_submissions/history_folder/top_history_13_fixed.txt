{"body":"I only know things about tanks, and [the list of tank aces is absolutely dominated by Nazi Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aces_of_aces#Tank_aces). On Wikipedia [the Germans have their own list.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_Panzer_aces_from_Germany)		They were pratically all part of the Schwere Panzerabteilungen (Heavy Tank Divisions), where the best tankers were pooled once the heavy tank Tiger came into action in 1942. Most lived long enough to switch to a [Tiger II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_II) in 1944-45.		Even though the top three aces of all times were all in the Wehrmacht, the tank ace that is most known about is unarguably [Michael Wittmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wittmann) of the SS. This had propaganda reasons: The SS units were not really part of the military, but a political unit. The aryan dream of the top nazis. So they used Wittmann as a prime propaganda asset. [He also undertook the probably most famous single tank attack of history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Villers-Bocage#Wittmann) when he rolled into a French village and destroyed a hell of a lot of British armour and equipment. However the Wehrmacht called him in a report "a danger to his crew, unit, and the entire front" due to his daring actions - which was typical of the SS tankers and their behaviour.		Meanwhile there is incredibly little known about the number one tank ace of all times, Kurt Knispel. And there is at least a rumor why: Because apparently he wasn't good with the Nazis and higher-ups. Rumor says he protected soviet POVs. His direct superiors proposed him for medals over and over again which much less achieved tank aces had easily received, and yet Knispel kept getting rejected. And amongst impressive numbers like Knispel's estimated 168-195 kills, these are *only tanks*, not counting self-propelled guns, tank destroyers, and other weapons and vehicles. It's absolutely insane. 		About the original title, [this is how tankers counted their kills](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/wittman2.jpg) (this is a picture of Wittmann and his crew in Russia, Wittmann to the very left) - they first painted one ring on the barrel for each kill, then switched over to one ring for ten. On this they counted more than just tanks though, it includes anti-tank guns and the like. Wittmann himself found hidden anti-tank guns to be a much greater danger than allied tanks.","depth":2,"score":42,"ups":42,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Roflkopt3r","name":"t1_cnw6cfn","parent_id":"t1_cnw0835","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1421858756,"created_utc":1421858756}

The US soldiers were getting slaughtered, and the lead tank couldn't get traction going up the hill. The entrenched Germans took the tank out, but their fire didn't kill the men in the tank. The Lt.

{"body":"In fact, in the US, actual combat vets and their families tend to view the military in precisely the terms that you describe above.  The real difference is that here in the US there is a very aggressive and politically powerful element of society that has never actually been to war, that fundamentally believes in the military supremacy of the US as a guiding principal in foreign policy and "defense," and that is quite willing to glorify something that it has no real knowledge of at all.		In my family, despite the fact that I come from several generations of combat vets, in common with what you describe as the Australian experience, war and the actual experience of combat was never openly discussed at all.  		But I am not entirely happy with that either.  To paraphrase Karl Mylantes in his excellent excellent book, "What it's Like to go to War," a people ought to know exactly what they are asking of their young men before they send them off to war.  One of the best ways of doing this is to have combat vets share their experiences as opposed to locking them away as if they were meant only for the brotherhood of fellow combat vets, as if it were some kind of exclusive club that one can only be told about if they too have gone through the fire.  		My recently deceased father was a UH1 crew-chief/door gunner in Vietnam.  At some point during his second tour his helicopter was shot down in the middle of a fierce battle in the Central Highlands.  We know absolutely nothing else about what happened that day other than that he was wounded, decorated for valor, and that after an extended hospital stay, he would never return to combat again.  		My father never spoke about what happened.  He was married to my mother for ten years after the war, and only ever told her that he'd had a desk job in Saigon, that he'd never been in combat.  		Clearly, he lied as a protection mechanism.  He did not want to expose his wife and young family to the horrors that he had experienced, which is laudable on its face, but which in the long run led to him suffering from long-term pathologies together with denying society the obligation to face what really happens in combat. 		So, while I admire some of the "quiet veteran" aspects that you've idealized above as being superior aspects of Australian society, I do not and cannot swallow the thing whole.  While understated dignity is no doubt preferable to the kind of obnoxious jingoistic chickenhawkery so prevalent here in the states, I don't think that it's really ideal either.  		That said, I highly recommend that anyone who's interested in this sort of thing read the above-mentioned Mylantes book as in it he goes into great and eloquent detail on the need for contemporary societies to treat war responsibly.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JudgeHolden","name":"t1_cnwvtwt","parent_id":"t1_cnwnlkw","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1421900517,"created_utc":1421900517}
{"body":"Sorry JudgeHolden, I think you really haven't got the point of our cultural difference. I find that statement, that you are 'not entirely happy with' solemn silence, to be extremely disrespectful. As Australians we share the burden of war in silence. Heart to heart. It's not something so logical that words can express it. The violent brutality of man and nature, and the necessity to counter-act it, does not bear explanation. It is a large part of our culture not just limited to war. The specifics are not relevant to the burden - the respect is universal, as it must be. Whether you are a desk worker, a general, or a soldier. Rank and narrative don't matter here. Perhaps the difference is that Australia does not start wars. We respond to direct threats. Our actions are justified, measured, and honourable. There is no space for anything more. So the sorts of psychological burdens you're talking about are not a problem. We see our military workers as no different to fire-fighters, medical workers, emergency volunteers, and police. Australia is a land which humbles and strengthens the soul. We are a nation necessarily familiar with mortality and hardship. We know how to handle these things in a way that encompasses war and extends beyond it, and war is less of a shock to us because of that.","depth":2,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cnwxqk9","parent_id":"t1_cnwvtwt","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1421904535,"created_utc":1421904535}

{"body":"I understand where he is coming from. He provided a critique, but didn't really understand the culture he's critiquing. We do have a more solemn attitude. This sort of enquiring discussion, the idea that everything should be discourse, is a uniquely American and French phenomenon which has a strong tendency to rub everyone else the wrong way. The world is far more complex than discourse allows for, and the peculiar tendency for Anglo-Saxon, American, and French customs to engage in a wilful ignorance of inherent complexity, the dissonance of which is covered by a sort of grandstanding inquisitiveness; is something that offends the rest of the world quite deeply. It's a cultural attribute that destroys all cultures. If you do not understand something, that is not a cause for judgement or dismissal. Culture is the shared experience of a group of people. If it doesn't affect you, be aware of the effects of relativity - mere observation changes reality. The nature and intent of the act of observation becomes reflected as feedback, in the culture. Badly formed inquiry naturally destroys cultural complexity. Cultural entropy is the natural outcome of the sort of destructive discussion being engaged in here.

{"body":"It's not just the quiet veteran thing, I understand that's comparable across a lot of nations. It's the way the military is viewed internally as well as by outsiders. The military is very much ingrained in our cultural identity (in particular Gallipoli and Kokoda- there's a lot of pride in our history), as with the USA, the emphasis is just on different aspects. The difference is there's no 'thank you for your service' like you see on every reddit post by a US veteran for example, you don't wear your uniform out and about, there's no celebration of our military or our capabilities. Our military holidays etc are very somber and quiet, our veterans are seen as men who stood up when they were needed by their mates and sacrificed so much, often supporting allies rather than directly defending our soil. You have to remember how quickly we went to the aid of the UK in both major wars even though we were not really involved initially. The emphasis is on mateship/standing by our mates when they need us, sacrifice and not on glory. We will remember them, lest we forget, etc.		Another modern example is in comparing the SASR or Commando Regiment against something like Seal Team Six. The movies, glorification of battles, interviews etc with former members. The SASR and Commando Regiments are considered elite (as you would expect) but there's none of the commercial element of it.
