This friend before the game injured in a game, so he didn't flew with the rest of the team and it supposed that Eliseo wasn't going to travel neither, because he wasn't able to play because he hadn't all the papers signed, but he travelled anyway because the managers of the teams invited him to travel to know the beautiful south of Chile. 			Edit2: The players and managers of the team flew in two separate flights, one of the people of the Coaching staff insisted in make the travel back in train, but the rest of the team laughed of him. This guy at the end flew in the accidented plane, because it was the bigger and most comfortable. 			Edit3: The money to signed a such an important (and expensive) player Eliseo Mouri??o came thanks to the president of the club Fernando Jaramillo who was also a high employee of the Bank of Chile, one of the responsabilities of Jaramillo was burned the money that wasn't able to circulate any more, a big part of that money ended in the soccer team.
