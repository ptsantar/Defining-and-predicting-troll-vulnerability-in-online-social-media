{"body":"Fascinating... excerpts from Wiki:		He was a second cousin to President John Adams.		He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights.[30] He cited the decline of the Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.		Samuel Adams emerged as an important public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the Seven Years' War (1756???1763). Finding itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to directly tax the colonies of British America.[41] This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.

Sam Adams was brought on as a partner in the malthouse as a favor to Sam Adams who was having money problems, but he never really had a passion for the business, he was always more focused on politics.  		Secondly, I don't think Sam Adams was personally responsible for making Washington give the troops beer.  I say this because it was an act of the Continental Congress, not a decision of Washington to give them beer.  It wasn't some lobbied for action, 1 qt of beer or cider was specified as part of the original list of rations.		George Washington is better known for both drinking and producing alcohol than Sam Adams.  Sam Adams is pretty uninterested in the family malt business while Washington has very profitable whiskey distilleries.  		Sam Adams is known for advocating beer drinking mainly because it is a domestically produced product, an alternative to imports.  He is known for his political action in Boston, part of which was organizing anti-importation groups which encouraged drinking domestically produced drinks (including beer) over imports, such as tea.  Beer spoiled very quickly, it was not the product that sits for months in a bottle as we have it today.

While they did the lion's share of writing the Declaration of Independence, Adams and Jefferson were both out of the country during the Constitutional Convention (Adams was the US Ambassador to Britain, Jefferson to France, at the time). Madison on the other hand had plenty of involvement with the Constitution, while having nothing to do with the Declaration of Independence (he was only 25 when the Declaration was signed).		As far as writing about the Constitution, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay published many papers on the subject and in defense of the Constitution. Despite common belief today, it was a very controversial document and many were firmly opposed to its adoption. So, they defended it in the [Federalist Papers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers), which is well worth a read if you get a chance. The go into great detail about their reasoning of every part of the document. The Supreme Court has even referenced the Federalist Papers in the past when making decisions about Constitutionality.		As for the 2nd Amendment, at the time of the Federalist Papers, those three would have opposed it, but not for the reasons you might think. Both Hamilton and Madison initially opposed a Bill of Rights, as they felt that the Constitution should basically allow whatever is not prohibited by it to be a right. By saying "We have these 10 rights." they felt it would be easier for the government to say, "Well, I guess we can do this other thing, since that's not on your list of 10 rights." You have to understand that these people just fought a war against a government they felt was overstepping their bounds and not recognizing their rights. They were apprehensive to give them up again to a new government on this side of the Atlantic.		Seeing as Madison later wrote the Bill of Rights, from which the first 10 Amendments (and the 27th, oddly enough) come, he changed his mind eventually.","depth":4,"score":50,"ups":50,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"captmonkey","name":"t1_cms95yi","parent_id":"t1_cms7noq","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1418337973,"created_utc":1418337973}

{"body":"Not only taxation, but it didn't allow for the federal government to do much of anything. Under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government was weak and most of the power rested with the states. This led to all kinds of issues. The biggest of which were the inability to regulate trade and the lack of a federal army.		The trade part became a problem because of two reasons. First, states would purposely hinder the other states and do things like not allowing trade from other states to pass through rivers that ran through their state without forcing merchants to pay state taxes. Imagine if you had to pay taxes on stuff that you wanted to transport on another state's roads. That was a bit of a problem. Secondly, the states would try to make international trade deals themselves. So, Britain might give New Jersey a better deal than Virginia, because New Jersey happened to secure a better trade deal.		The army part was also a big issue because coincidentally, there had just been a [large rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion) in Massachusetts that had been a problem to put down. Massachusetts couldn't field enough troops on its own to fight the rebellion and the federal government didn't have the money our resources to create its own army, because like you said, a like of tax money. Since this rebellion happened just before the Constitutional Convention, delegates who would have otherwise been against it became more open to the idea of creating a stronger federal government.		Another issue was that laws at the federal level had to be passed unanimously. If one state dissented, it didn't pass. Can you imagine how little would get done if that was the case today?		In short, under the Articles of Confederation, the US acted like a bunch of small, loosely-associated countries. A loose association can work in cases like the EU, where the countries are larger and more established. However, it was a major problem for these tiny newly-independent republics that existed on this vast, untouched continent. The Constitution was needed to form a single, united republic that would be able to be strong together, rather than these tiny bickering states.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"captmonkey","name":"t1_cmsh7u2","parent_id":"t1_cmsg126","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1418353735,"created_utc":1418353735}

There are pretty good records from the time. Just read the Constitutional Convention debates, the personal letters of the founders and previous state constitutions. 		It's pretty clear what they meant by it. 		Some examples:		>The constitution shall never be construed...to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms		-Alexander Hamilton			>Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property...Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.		>[The Constitution preserves] the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.		James Madison		>A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies		-George Washington 		>That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.		-Pennsylvania State Constitution 	 	>That the people have the right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State 		Vermont State Constitution 		>That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public inquiry from individuals.		-Pennsylvania Delegation to Constitutional Convention		>And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.		-Massachusetts Delegation		>Congress shall never disarm any citizen, unless such as are or have been in actual rebellion.		-New Hampshire Delegation			EDIT: Holy fuck gold.

{"body":"According to ratebeer, the Samuel Adams tripel is very good. I wouldn't mind trying one of those. I know a nice liquor store that might happen to have them. I dare call myself a beer lover, and most of my favourites are tripels and quadrupels. Westvleteren 12, Chimay Blue, La Trappe Quadrupel. Good stuff. Although the Samuel Adams tripel is described as dry, so perhaps it's more comparable to Westmalle. While I respect Westmalle, I'm not very fond of them. On the other hand, La Trappe Bock surprised me a while back. Much drier and less sweet than I usually like, but I can't get enough of it. A very nice and balanced flavour that somewhat reminds me of dark chocolate.
