{"body":""It is a remarkable fact that Indian people served the United States long before they were even given United States citizenship. In fact, between 1917 and 1918, over 10,000 Native American people enlisted into the armed services to serve in World War I. Although this was the greatest number of enlisted peoples from any one ethnic culture, citizenship (with the right to vote) for Native Americans was not granted until 1924."		To think of the troubles that came before them, and they still wanted to serve in WWII. Amazing people.		"Contrary to the Hollywood war movie Wind Talkers, the practice of securing battlefield communication by having Native Americans transmit messages in their own languages did not begin during the Second World War. The tactic was initiated amongst Choctaw National Guardsmen in the Battle for Blanc Mont Ridge in the Champagne Sector of France in October 1918.		Joseph Oklahombi was one of these code talkers. But this particular code talker was also a mighty warrior; one of the greatest of the doughboys. He reportedly captured more men in the Champagne than Sgt. York did in a comparable and more famous event in the Argonne Forest [132 men captured] two days later.		During World War I, Joseph Oklahombi exemplified the courageous fighting spirit of the American Indian. Joseph Oklahombi, from Wright City has been lauded as Oklahoma's greatest war hero of World War I. He received battle citations from General John J. Pershing and French Marshal Pertain the Croix de Guerre for his actions in the St. Etienne sector in France."

{"body":"Here's where it gets interesting - Hitler knew about the efforts of the Choctaw code talkers of WWI and sent people to study Native American languages before the outbreak of WWII.  Though the German "anthropologists" couldn't learn many of the languages, the Allies' knew that Germany had made the attempt and this discouraged the commonplace use of Code Talkers in the European theater though they did serve with distinction in Europe and North Africa.		Also, technically, they used both code and encryption (though I'm sure this will start an argument), and did so cleverly.  The code was using a set of words for battlefield objects (eg "Turtle" = tank) and the encryption was to put it into a language that wasn't translatable - it was effectively random noise to someone who didn't speak the language, even though it didn't involve the explicit mathematical algorithms we associate with encryption.		To keep from repeating code objects enough that the resulting "encryption" could be unraveled by analysis they'd use a shifting set of code words for alphanumeric "spelling out" of some things.  So while we use a common and fixed pattern like "alpha, bravo...zulu" etc. to spell things, they might use the translation of "Apple, Antelope, Afternoon..." in random order for "A" just to keep things mixed up to an eavesdropper, since few of the words would actually start with "A".","depth":1,"score":28,"ups":28,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LateralThinkerer","name":"t1_cqrc653","parent_id":"t1_cqqrlir","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430225383,"created_utc":1430221783}
