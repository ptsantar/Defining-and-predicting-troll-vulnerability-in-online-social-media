There is a certain amount of luck that needs to occur for a no hitter to happen.

While the manager may not pull you during a no hit performance, it is pretty damn hard to continue retiring every batter when you have thrown over 100 pitches already.

It was mainly other people who would joke and brag for him. Howard said he got the impression that Ellis felt embarrassed or ashamed by it, like his being high took away from his accomplishment. My guess is that he probably bragged about it a lot before he got sober. He expresses a lot of regret in the documentary about not being able to remember some of his best games because he was so high.

A pitcher's job is to get outs, and keep guys off the bases.  ~~The difference between a walk and a single is minimal (a single is more valuable with men on base, obviously, but averaged out over a ton of plate appearances singles produce a scant few more runs than walks),~~ so why would allowing 3 walks and no hits be a better game than allowing 1 hit and no walks?

{"body":"yeah, by all accounts, that no-hitter wasn't a very beautiful one. He walked 8 guys during that game and he hit a guy, which is pretty bad. Dock Ellis averaged a little less than 2 walks per game during his career, which makes the 8 during his no hitter a clear outlier. The only real benefit I'd argue that he got from the LSD was that in interviews about it he's said that he used LSD to deal with the fear of failure. Now if he had pitched a perfect game (27 up, 27 down) or if he only had 1 or 2 walks during his no-hitter, then I'd say you were on to something, but I remain unconvinced.		Plus the guy nearly killed his wife because of his drug and alcohol problems, and later in life he beat his addiction and helped inmates with their addiction problems, and would look back at his no-hitter with a bit of embarrassment because he did it on LSD. Dock Ellis is hardly the guy you'd want to hold up as an example of drugs being beneficial to their users. They nearly ruined his life.
