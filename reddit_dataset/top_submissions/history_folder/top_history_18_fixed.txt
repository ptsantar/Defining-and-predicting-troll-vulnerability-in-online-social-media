{"body":"[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Californian)		>On deck, Third Officer C.V. Groves also saw the lights of another ship come into view on the horizon 3.5 points above Californian's starboard beam. He first saw it at 11:10pm when 10 or 12 miles away. At the time Californian was heading North East. It finally stopped 6 miles away at 11:40 pm. To him, she was clearly a large liner, as she had multiple decks brightly lit.		>Fifteen minutes after spotting the vessel, Groves went below to inform Lord. The latter suggested that the ship be contacted by Morse lamp, which was tried, but no reply was seen.		>**Titanic 's on-duty wireless operator, Jack Phillips, was busy working off a substantial backlog of personal messages** with the wireless station at Cape Race, Newfoundland, 800 miles (1,300 km) away, at the time. When Evans sent the message that they were stopped and surrounded by ice, the relative proximity made Californian's signal loud in Phillips' headphones (both radio operators were using spark gap wireless sets whose signals bled across the radio spectrum and were impossible to tune out). As Evans attempted to transmit his ice message, Phillips was unable to hear a separate, prior message he had been in the process of receiving from Cape Race, and **he rebuked Evans with: "Shut up, shut up! I am busy; I am working Cape Race!"[2] Evans listened for a little while longer, and at 23:30 he turned off the wireless and went to bed.**		>**Ten minutes later, Titanic hit an iceberg.** Ten minutes after that, her lookout, Frederick Fleet, spotted a nearby ship.

{"body":"Not quite. Like I said in another message, Evans didn't use the proper prefixes when sending the message, so Phillips assumed it was chatter and nothing substantial. 		Phillips also forgot to deliver an ice warning to the bridge earlier in the evening, which Second Officer Lightoller would definitely have shown to Captain Smith and the ship would have slowed substantially in such a dangerous area. 		Smith's last orders for the night were to slow down if any other warnings were received. The two warnings that could have saved the ship never made it to the bridge. 		*Californian* was also at least 10-20 miles away from *Titanic* during the disaster, this is true. However, stopped for the night and with most of her boilers out, it would have taken quite a bit of time to get the ship moving. With a top speed of roughly 12 knots, it would have taken at least 90 minutes to get to *Titanic's* side. Then a rescue operation needed to be perfectly coordinated to control panic alongside two floating buildings, one of which was extremely unpredictable and in the dark no less on a night with no moon, in a time when the average lighting was 1.6 foot-candle power, or about as bright as a couple candles in a bedroom.

{"body":"The majority of abandon ships (at least large cargo ships) are way out in the middle of the ocean where the weather is much worse than it is when it nears land. Typically the ship is not ballasted properly which causes the vessel to either bend/snap as well as take on too much water on the top decks. 		Ballasting is the most important aspect of keeping a ship stable in bad weather. It is the process of flooding large tanks on the bottom of the ship to lower the center of gravity.		To give you an idea of how important ballasting is, I went to a 4 year maritime college (which thoroughly covered ballasting) and have been working as a mate on merchant vessels for 1 year. It will take at minimum another 6 years before I will be in charge of that operation.		The other factor that comes into play is daylight. During the day, the captain will be up navigating the vessel on the best possible heading relative to the sea and swell. At night, especially during a storm, we can't see shit to put it bluntly as things are pitch black. All it takes is a few minutes on the wrong course to take on enough water to make the ship top heavy enough to become unstable. Couple that with a less than satisfactory ballasting job and we're screwed.		Now think about how wild it is that a 900 foot ship can't take the seas, and now imagine a 50 foot lifeboat jn the same situation.

{"body":">No crew needed training to know to fill the lifeboats to capacity		Not necessarily, one of the reasons, or at least suspected reasons based on the U.S. Inquiry and Lightoller's testimony, as to why the boats were not lowered full, was that some officers still held the concept of lowering capacity vs total capacity. Earlier built boats on other ships could run the risk of buckling under the weight of their passengers if lowered fully loaded with wooden keels, as such it was considered acceptable to lower the boats partially loaded, then load them to capacity later once in the water. Most of the officers and crew, as discovered in the inquiry, had not been made aware that the boats had a steel reinforcements in their keels to prevent buckling, and that H&W had tested the boats with a large group of men in them. Aside from passenger reluctance to enter the boats early on and a lack of communication as to the seriousness of the situation, the crew had not been adequately trained as to the specifications and capabilities of the lifeboats.		http://www.titanic-titanic.com/analyzing_lifeboat_loading.shtml","depth":11,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MGY401","name":"t1_cqd7g83","parent_id":"t1_cqcy3v7","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1429115364,"created_utc":1429111764}

{"body":"Well there wasn't anything inherently wrong with the boats, they had steel reinforcement the crew didn't know about (at least according to testimony) and the crew assumed it was just a wooden keel. A boat with just a wooden keel can run the risk of buckling if too many people are in it and it is just supported by attachment points on the bow and stern as during lowering, a boat is designed to have its weight supported by the water along its keel and not by two small points. It is why boats and even some ships have had they "backs"/keels broken when caught in the trough between two large waves in rough seas, the bow and stern are supported but the center is not.		>It seems ridiculous in terms of safety that not only were there not enough for every passenger		Looking back it most certainly is absurd. But given the time, a loss of a ship up until recently had meant the loss of all on board, without wireless communication it could mean days, weeks or even months before a ship was noted as being delayed or lost, and even then it wouldn't be known exactly where it had gone down. So even with a lifeboat as a last resort the odds of survival were negligible without wireless, so the prevailing attitude that they were largely unimportant can be understood. With the introduction of bulkheads, large steel ships, and ultimately wireless, engineers and leaders in the ship design world believed that ships could act as their own lifeboats until help could arrive thanks to wireless, and that lifeboats would only be needed to shuttle the passengers between the main ship and the rescue ship. This belief was reaffirmed with the loss of the RMS Republic in 1906. The Republic stayed afloat long enough for help to be summoned and all passengers to be safely evacuated to other ships via the lifeboats. This mindset unfortunately wasn't seriously challenged in the industry until Titanic showed the need for lifeboats in addition to wireless should help not be close enough to get there in time. It is just human oversight in the face of new technology, we focus so much on the rewards of a new tech that we overlook the importance of an old tech. It is like when we (the U.S.) sent F-4s into Vietnam with only missiles and no guns because we considered guns and dog-fighting to be obsolete...quite a few F-4s were lost as a result of the assumption. There isn't so much a sinister motive as just not considering all the options and not fully understanding the strengths, and more importantly, the weaknesses of the technology now at your disposal.

{"body":"[Credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2e12xa/what_is_a_myth_that_everyone_thinks_is_true/cjvfrm1?context=3):		The myth that Titanic was in any way badly designed, badly built, or badly operated by the standards of the time. In fact there are so many ridiculous inaccuracies surrounding Titanic that it's hard to list even a fraction of them here.		* She was an incredibly seaworthy ship - much more so than any passenger ship around today. The iceberg tore a gash almost a third of the way down her side, and she still stayed afloat for more than two hours!		* In that time, all but two of her lifeboats were launched - there wasn't time to launch any more. She could have had a hundred more lifeboats on board, but that wouldn't have helped without vastly more crew to operate them.		* Titanic's passengers genuinely did believe that she was practically unsinkable. When the time came to begin loading the lifeboats, many thought they would be safer staying on Titanic. There wasn't time for the crew to wait around convincing more people to get in, so when a lifeboat was ready, if there was no-one else waiting to get in, it had to go. This is why so many of Titanic's lifeboats left only half-full - the crew weren't worried about over-filling them.		* Titanic wasn't travelling too fast for the conditions - by the standards of practice around at the time. Further precautions were put into practice after the incident, but no-one on board can be blamed for doing what anyone on any ship would have done the same.		* Titanic was by no means a fast ship - nor was she ever intended to be. The White Star Line (Titanic's owners) were in competition with one other big shipping line, Cunard. Cunard's liners were the fastest in the business. To combat this, instead of fighting for speed, White Star decided to try to make their liners the most luxurious in the world. Olympic and Titanic were famed for their splendor and comfort - passengers said that it was easy to forget that you were at sea, as there were very few vibrations from the engines, and the ships remained stable even in fairly rough seas. By comparison, Cunard's liners were very fast, but their quadruple-screw configuration made vibration more apparent. It's a myth that Titanic was ever trying to make record-breaking speed across the Atlantic.		* She wasn't built using sub-standard materials. This rumour goes around a lot these days because of an article that was written some time ago - what the article is supposed to mean is that there is much better quality steel available today. This was not the case in 1909. Additionally, Titanic's builders were paid on a fee plus materials basis - they were given a set fee to construct the ship, plus the cost of all materials used. There was no incentive to use anything but the best steel they could get their hands on. The shipyard had an excellent reputation and would not risk tainting it by using bad steel, which could easily be noticed on inspection anyway.		* Titanic and her two sister ships Olympic and Britannic were also surprisingly maneuverable for their size - much more so than was expected. Some will tell you that Titanic's rudder was too small, but this simply isn't true. In fact, Olympic's wartime captain marvelled at her manoeuvrability, and was even able to throw her into a sudden turn, ramming (and sinking) a German U-boat. Olympic was the only merchant vessel throughout the First World War recorded to have sunk an enemy vessel.		* Binoculars - While it's true that the lookouts' binoculars were misplaced (or rather, locked away in a cabinet that no-one on board had the key to open), this made no difference to Titanic's fate. The images of sea captains and pirates scanning the horizon through telescopes, while common in films, has virtually no stead in reality. Binoculars and telescopes narrow your field of vision down to a fine point, making it harder to spot anything. Lookouts on real ships will use their eyes alone to search for objects of interest, and once they've been spotted, will use a set of binoculars to further inspect it. Titanic's lookouts would not have been using their binoculars to search for iceberg even if they'd had them.		* Third class passengers were never trapped below decks - the big metal gates you might remember from the film never even existed. The only time passengers were kept below decks was near the beginning of the disaster, when the officers needed time to prepare the lifeboats. First and second class passengers were allowed on deck, but as there were so many more third-class passengers the crowd was asked to stay below for a short while, until the officers were ready to start loading lifeboats. No-one was ever locked up. In fact a higher percentage of third-class males survived the sinking than second-class males.		* Titanic was the largest ship in the world, but not by much - her older sister Olympic was identical in almost every way. A few changes to Titanic's layout (including the covering up of some promenade decks, making them count as "interior space" made her technically larger, but both ships were exactly the same length, breadth and height. Olympic had a GRT (gross registered tonnage) of 45,324 gross register tons. Titanic's GRT was some 1,000 tons greater. After the disaster, Olympic received a refit, after which her GRT was up to about 30 more than Titanic's had been. But Titanic's younger sister, Britannic, which was launched after the disaster and had been modified during construction as a result of it, was about 2 feet wider than her sisters and had a GRT more than 2,000 tons greater than Titanic's.		* White Star Line's owner, Bruce Ismay, likely had nothing to do with the incident. Another myth popularised by the film is that Ismay had convinced Captain Smith to sail faster and try to get to New York in record time. He's also portrayed as a bumbling idiot, and sneaks onto a lifeboat when the officers aren't looking. While we'll never know whether or not Ismay really did discuss Titanic's schedule with Smith, it's incredibly unlikely - Smith was looking to retire after commanding Titanic, had an extremely good reputation, and was a much-loved public figure. Passengers scrambled to sail on a ship under his command. He is unlikely to have been swayed to make rash decisions based on Ismay's need for Titanic to make headlines. Ismay himself played an active role during the sinking, helping passengers into lifeboats and doing what he could where possible (one officer recalled telling him to get out of the way as he was making a nuisance of himself by getting involved, but testified that he was trying to help). Ismay stepped into an empty spot on one of the last boats to leave the ship, just as it was preparing to lower. He didn't take anyone else's space. Unfortunately the media needed a scapegoat, and he was the highest-ranking official to survive the disaster. He adopted a secluded lifestyle after the disaster, funding several naval charities but otherwise staying out of the public eye.		* Higher watertight compartments or compartments sealed at the top would have saved the ship - Most people could tell you that Titanic sunk because the weight of the water in the foremost watertight compartments pulled the bow down, allowing the water to spill over the top into more compartments, and so-on throughout the ship. But had Titanic's watertight bulkhead walls run all the way to the top deck, she might actually have sunk faster - with so much water contained in the front third of the vessel, she would have begun to tilt forwards much earlier, and possibly have broken in two sooner than she did. Sealing the tops of the bulkheads to prevent water from spilling over is actually illegal, and still is today. The International SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) Regulations state that no civil (non-military) vessel can have any obstruction above watertight compartments that could impede a passenger's escape. The bottom line is that Titanic was damaged beyond her specifications, and was doomed from the moment she hit the iceberg.		* "Full Astern" - There's a belief (popularized by the film) that Titanic's engines were thrown full astern on sighting the iceberg, and that this may have hindered her ability to turn away from it. This rumour started because of evidence given by the fourth officer, who who wasn't even on the bridge at the time of the collision. The only survivor who was present was the quartermaster, but from his position in the wheelhouse he couldn't see the commands sent to the engine room on the bridge telegraphs. Survivors from the engine room and the boiler rooms attested that the command was "stop" rather than "astern". Whoever you choose to believe, when you think about the timescale it really makes very little difference. There was less than 40 seconds between the iceberg sighting and the collision - and in that time, the lookouts had to ring the bell, pick up the phone, wait for 6th officer Moody to enter the wheelhouse and answer it, and alert him to the iceberg; then, Moody relayed that order to the most senior officer on the bridge (1st Officer Murdoch); Murdoch ordered the turn to port, then crossed to the telegraph to send the order to stop. Try acting that out in real time, and work out how long the engineers had to act on the "stop" order - not long enough. There's a really good article explaining exactly what went on in the engine rooms [here](http://www.uco.es/~ff1mumuj/titanic1.htm); this goes into a lot more detail than I can, and comes to the same conclusions. Long story short - there wasn't even enough time to stop the engines, let alone put them in reverse. Slowing down or keeping full-ahead would have had no difference, as the turning circle stays the same. Leaving the starboard engine running may have turned Titanic's bow away from the iceberg, but it would have made it more difficult to keep the stern away.","depth":0,"score":125,"ups":125,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"super_pickle","name":"t1_cqcl3lt","parent_id":"t3_32kqtd","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1429059933,"created_utc":1429056333}

You may know him as being portrayed in James Cameron's Titanic as the priest who is seen at the end reciting the "Our Father" with the passengers. He is credited in the film's credits. It is reported that Father Byles gave up a chance at a lifeboat seat at least 2 times. Just recently, there has been a push to have him [Sainted.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-32274691)		Fun Fact: Father Byles wrote a letter while on board the Titanic on White Star Line Letter head that was sent to his house keeper.

But I do have one question, if you wouldn't mind answering. How has his legacy been treated by your family? During the big Titanic craze of the 90s, was it a weird experience for your family? Is his story like a familial heirloom, each generation turning around and telling it to their kids?","depth":1,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"doctor__jesus","name":"t1_cqcfhk0","parent_id":"t1_cqcboms","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1429050300,"created_utc":1429046700}
{"body":"I know what you mean but you have to understand that this was the first uncle of my grandmother. All of her life she was brought up learning about her uncle who had payed that sacrifice and in turn teaching it to my mother. My Grandmother's parents are who were to be married by Father Byles. Instead, they had a funeral and a wedding on the same day. This was front page news in the NYT. 		So as far as my families experience. My mother was in possession of the original letter that he wrote on board. I held this with my own hands. When she found out the movie was coming out, my mother wrote a letter to James Cameron explaining the story of Father Byles which can all be cross referenced in the historic New York Times. Cameron really put a lot of effort into making the movie accurate and included many of the notable people on board. After the movie was released, she received a letter from Cameron's office thanking her for the information. So that's pretty cool but no big deal. No body really knows about him so I wouldn't say it's weird. It definitely sparks people's interest when I tell them about it though.		We have certainly made it into a family heirloom. I have many younger cousins whom will call me or my mother to ask questions about father Byles for their school assignments. I am also in possession of letters written by him that precede his voyage on the  Titanic including the one where he informs his brother that he will be boarding the RMS Titanic. This is a great look into my families history which has been pretty well documented by other ancestors as well. 		I full well plan on passing this down to the younger generations in my family. I always encourage my friends to speak to the elders in their family before it is too late because everyone has some very interesting stories somewhere in their families history and links to the past die everyday.

It was the first large ship like that with water tight bulkheads. Someone had to be first. Nothing is perfect. They thought they were high enough. 20/20 after the fact shows that they were not. This is the early 1900s we are talking about. There are no computer models, there was no previous data. There was just them doing what they thought was best. If the titanic wouldn't have had those bulkheads, most likely only a handful of survivors would have made it off the ship.	4. The amount of life boats was indeed not enough, but with wireless, the water tight bulkheads, other ships in the common shipping lanes etc, it wouldn't have really been an issue. A lot of the lifeboats went out half or almost completely empty. Any life boats were an improvement where in the past boats didn't even have life boats. 20-30 years earlier, everyone would have just sunk with the ship.	5. they couldn't have just "gone back" and picked up passengers that easily. It's a tall boat. Have to lower the boats down to the water. You expect women and children to fast rope into a life boat 50+ feet down? 	The Titanic was a huge disaster.

The Britanic still sank, even faster than the Titanic, even though it had improved and higher bulkheads. They were not under the same circumstances, and the Britanic had more survivors, but it also was sunk in warm water and the passengers were more well prepared.

{"body":"Implying that Ismay was a bad person?		I think that story has played its course. He didn't have the ship sped up, he wasn't the total asshole the film portrayed him to be, he didn't steal a seat on a lifeboat, and he suffered something of a nervous breakdown en route to New York aboard *Carpathia.* 		The morning of the 15th he had to first give orders that *Olympic* turn around, as he didn't want already shocked survivors to see a nearly-identical ship suddenly on the scene. Then he spent the rest of the time in the doctor's cabin, not eating. 		Only to get into New York on the 18th and be summoned to Senator Smith's investigation, which started almost as soon as survivors stepped foot onto the pier. 		The poor man spent the rest of his life defending himself from the media's portrayal of him and lived in seclusion, hating the thought of even discussing *Titanic* with anyone. 		Everyone wants to look for a scapegoat in these situations, but there is no one evil person. The captain would have slowed if he had received all the radio transmissions warning of ice. The radio operator would have taken down the last warning if it had started with proper protocol and had the radio operators delivered the other ice warning to the bridge earlier, the ship would likely have slowed down.

According to the Board of Trade regulations at the time, the number of lifeboats exceeded existing regulations which were based on tonnage, not the number of persons aboard.		The lookouts didn't have their binoculars because they were accidentally left ashore.		The bridge officer in charge at the moment of the crash did what he had been trained to do: reverse engines and turn the ship away from the iceberg. A more experienced officer might have realized the best action with a ship of Titanic's size was to reverse engines and stay the course: crash head-long into the iceberg and suffer minimal damage to the bow. The water tight compartments would then have saved the ship as only at most two would have been compromised.		There was less Atlantic traffic at the time, due to an ongoing UK coal strike. Many smaller ships had their coal stores sent to Titanic and were stuck in port. Less chance for rescue from ships sailing west from the UK.		Junior officers in charge of lowering the lifeboats were largely unaware that tests had been performed to ensure full and overfull loads could be safely lowered. At some point "women and children first" became "women and children only".  		The gates that kept the steerage passengers from reaching the boat deck were locked not to keep them below during the emergency, but because they were always closed and locked at night. During the day they were open, although some areas had a velvet rope and small sign indicating what class area lay beyond.

{"body":"Rostron is one of the main hero's of the story, aside from his supreme sense of duty and quick decisive actions (Example, telling the crew to turn the Carpathia towards the Titanic immediately upon hearing of the distress signal and then asking for confirmation AFTER changing course) he was thorough in his preparations for the disaster and prepared his ship for entering the ice field in ways that may have very well saved the Titanic had Smith done the same. His testimony to the U.S. Senate Inquiry can be read [here](http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq01Rostron01.php) and it shows what kind of man and captain he was. (Below is the list of orders given on the night of the 14th as read by Rostron before the U.S. Inquiry.)		One of my biggest complaints about the 1997 movie "Titanic" was the failure to mention and tell the story of Captain Rostron and the Carpathia. Many parts of the sinking and rescue were left out of that movie, but that is one part that should have never been left out, and leaving it out was a disservice to Rostron and his crew. In terms of movies I love "A Night to Remember" because it does tell the Carpathia's story and in terms of books I highly recommend  Walter Lord's book by the same name (No relation to Captain Stanley Lord), and "The Other Side of the Night" by Daniel Butler focusing on the Carpathia and Rostron.		He was also awarded a [Congressional Gold Medal](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Sir_Arthur_Henry_Rostron_Congressional_Gold_Medal%2C_Merseyside_Maritime_Museum.png/630px-Sir_Arthur_Henry_Rostron_Congressional_Gold_Medal%2C_Merseyside_Maritime_Museum.png), the American Cross of Honor, a medal from the Liverpool Shipwreck and Humane Society, and a gold medal from the Shipwreck Society of New York.		Captain Rostron was very highly praised for his efforts in both the American and the British inquiries into the disaster.	_________________________________________________		Captain Rostron's list of orders preparing for the rescue of survivors as read to the Senate Inquiry.		> As a matter of fact, I have them all written down here.

{"body":"Have to clarify a few things here-		1. They were steaming at full steam, but were not ahead of schedule. One of the many myths of Titanic is that she was trying to set a speed record, which she was not. The reason Titanic was at full steam was, despite the cold, the seas were incredibly calm and clear - unusually so. To go full steam in these conditions was standard practice. 		2. Iceberg warnings were not ignored. They were given to the bridge, with one given to Ismay. There is the famous story of Jack Phillips cutting off a warning from The Californian due to it???s proximity blasting his ears off with noise, and his backlog of personal mail but no one ignored iceberg warnings- which were considered advisory. Once again, nothing unusual here.		3. False, they actually extended very far above the waterline but just not far enough for the damage she received. The key to the understanding of Titanic is an unusual ship, placed in unusual circumstances but built, run, and sailed by people who were used to the usual. Which leads me too-		4. False(ish). Titanic was equipped to carry 64 lifeboats for around 4,000 people. LEGALLY she was only required to carry 16 (but had an addition 4 collapsibles, so in the eyes of the law, she was above requirements). A lot of this had to do with the boom in shipbuilding and ship size not keeping up with the law. By 1912, shipbuilding had become so advanced - more so than in any time previously- that the law was not fast enough to re-regulate for ships the size of Titanic. So the safety laws of 20 years previously - which Titanic went above and beyond- were not good enough for her, yet were legal for her, and not at all unusual.		5. Yes		6. Yes		A lot of the Titanic myth has to do with hubris, ???God himself could not sink this ship??? and so on. In reality, the truth is a little less mythical. Titanic was, at the time, the biggest and safest ship in the sea. Her watertight bulkheads, extending to E deck and controlled electronically, were the height of technological advancement. What happened to her happened because she was suffered the EXACT damage she could not survive, because of the EXACT conditions which would cause that damage (calm sea, no moon, clear night - i.e.: no ability to see icebergs) along with an unfortunate mixup resulting in no binoculars in the crows nest. All of this was incredibly unusual, but Titanic was steered by the best the WSL had to offer. They were simply facing forces that none of the could foresee or control.		EDIT: A quick edit for reference. Look at the Turbina (1894) and the King Edward (1904) and compare them to Titanic (1909). They are minuscule, with Turbina coming un under an 8th of the length of Titanic and yet these ships were handled under the same shipping regulations. I would say it???s absurd, but the comparison shows exactly how fast shipbuilding boomed. It was impossible to keep up. Remember, Titanic was only due to be the biggest ship afloat until Brittanic come along shortly after. Both of them were beaten by the RMS Imperator (1913) who clocked in over 20 feet longer than either.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CaptainBrando","name":"t1_cqd8aap","parent_id":"t3_32kqtd","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1429116648,"created_utc":1429113048}
{"body":"*"They went full speed ahead at night in a known ice field though they were ahead of schedule."*		This was standard practice at the time for all of the big transatlantic liners.			*Ignored iceberg warnings*		This was also standard practice at the time for all of the big transatlantic liners. Smaller ships like the Californian and the Carpathia would typically stop or proceed slowly; big ships like Titanic proceeded full speed, as it was believed that even in the worst case an iceberg collision posed little threat to a modern liner with a compartmentalized steel hull.			*The ships water tight bulkheads were deliberately made too short.*		"Deliberately" in the sense of it being a design decision, not "deliberately" in the sense of the ship being made intentionally more vulnerable to sinking. Moreover, the height of the bulkheads was a complete non-factor in the sinking of Titanic; taller bulkheads would have made little to no difference, as by the time she was low enough in the water for spillover to be an issue, she was only minutes from sinking anyway.			*Far too little lifeboats for a ship of this size, done deliberately to make the deck less crowded.*		More lifeboats than the law required at the time, and sufficient lifeboat capacity by the safety philosophy of the time (which was that lifeboats were for transfer rather than survival). The flaws in said philosophy were only evident in retrospect.			*Extremely under loaded lifeboats that refused to go back to pick up more passengers despite captains orders.*		The orders to the lifeboats were to row to the *Californian* and drop off passengers, then come back for more. They never reached the Californian since she was further away than she looked and did not move to Titanic's aid.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DesiArcy","name":"t1_cqeleyi","parent_id":"t3_32kqtd","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1429212812,"created_utc":1429209212}

{"body":"I'm numbering each point for convenience		1) True		2) It wasn't under Smith's command, but under the dock's pilot		3) Wasn't Smith's fault. The insurance didn't pay out because there was a minimum threshold that the damage did not reach. In other words, the damage was too insignificant to be covered.		4) Not true in the slightest.		5) Completely wrong		6) Smith was their employee. He was also in charge of the vessel and didn't tolerate interference from Ismay as he was just an inexperienced passenger.		7) Straight-up impossible. You're claiming they were trying to hit the prow of a ship in the dark with no lights on and with navigation equipment that didn't allow one to know where they were within a few feet. There were also inaccuracies to everyone's recorded position. The supposed ship would have been demolished by Titanic anyways given that it weighed 52,000 tons (in salt water) and was travelling at 25 mph. The prow simply would not inflict any damage. Read Olympic vs Nantucket Lightship for further references.		8) Olympic was struck behind the aft well deck. Titanic was struck across the bow to just behind the bridge. There's a difference of a few hundred feet. Literally opposite ends of the ship.		9) Claim of no substance. In fact, it's a well-known bit of trivia that Titanic's passengers consisted of many transfers from cancelled voyages. WSL increased those at risk.		10) Insurance that only covered 2/3rds of the ship's value		11) Olympic did indeed		12) White Star Line undergoes significant financial difficulties and smears against Ismay led to him being kicked out of the company. Work on Britannic slows to a crawl until it's called into service. Britannic end up being the largest ship ever built by WSL and it never saw a paying passenger. Olympic was the grandest and was scrapped prematurely when WSL was forcibly merged with Cunard.		TL, DR; switch theory hogwash.
