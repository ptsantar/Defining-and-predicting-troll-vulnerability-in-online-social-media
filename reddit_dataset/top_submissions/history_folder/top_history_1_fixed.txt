{"body":"> Some of the sacrificial practices have been exaggerated by the Spanish		I am by no means someone to trust what Christians of that era had to say, but you have absolutely no proof of your statement.		> cannibalism was a rather rare 		Wow - not according to any of the Aztec codices at ALL.		I tend to trust a lot of these codices because behind all the 'tut-tutting' of the people who produced them under the watchful eyes of Catholic Priests, you can tell they actually had a lot of pride in the 'greatness' of the Aztec empire. The very specific and elaborate descriptions of rituals hardly seem to be pure fabrications.		You might want to especially go to a library and check out all the volumes of the Florentine Codex. As with a lot of history, whether you 'believe' what you're reading is based on your own gut feeling is truthful or not.		According to the codices, Aztecs were not throwing arms and legs down the pyramid, they were entire bodies (minus hearts). The bodies were not given to just any 'average joe', they were returned to the people who captured them and were then put through elaborate rituals, which included cooking them and portioning out body parts in a very specific way.		Cannibalism seems to be a phase that many civilizations go through. DNA evidence suggests most Europeans participated in cannibalism in a pre-historic time. Indeed, many myths of very early ancient Greeks indicate a turning-away from cannibalism of an earlier time. It is also thought that (for example) pre-Roman British Celts engaged in human sacrifice and ancient Roman writers said that Germans did so.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"moxy801","name":"t1_ct0ue28","parent_id":"t1_ct0pplb","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436727563,"created_utc":1436723963}

We visited one lean-to that contained a stone jaguar and two stone guards that were literally only protected by a chain link fence some cinder blocks and a ten year old shoeless boy that was looking for donations.  His dad dug it up while farming, it would seem.  They are now in a museum (the artifacts, not the family), but at the time I was blown away by the fact that something so ancient and so precious were not guarded more carefully.","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThorHammerslacks","name":"t1_ct0cpnl","parent_id":"t1_cszwrxt","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436676780,"created_utc":1436673180}

{"body":"I read a really interesting ~~paper~~ book (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3cwors/largest_pyramid_in_mexico_has_been_found_bigger/ct01nk7)) where the author parallels the incredible frequency of public executions in Europe at the time to human sacrifice. When you strip away the various ceremonies and justifications, they serve roughly equivalent purposes, in sociological terms (reinforce the power of the state, physically purge the sins to ensure society everything will be OK). The public executions, in both cases, *were* intended to "actively trying to keep a (relatively) peaceful society." The large mesoamerican capitals were comparable in size to contemporary European cities; most people were farmers, merchants, and (while we are shaky on a lot of this scholarship due to the Spaniards' love of destroying records that could give the natives any ideas about their worth) most sacrifices came from tributary states, soldiers of defeated enemies, or criminals. The vast majority of people did not live "steeped in war, blood, and fear" at all, and the thought that they did is largely a Spanish invention to justify their own colonial reign of blood, war, fear, and enslavement. 		Hell, if you go by percentages (and even using the lower end of the admittedly disputed population estimates for Tenochtitlan), in the 1500s London was publicly executing more people per capita than Tenochtitlan was. I guess you can say hanging is more humane, but it wasn't any less of a spectacle--thousands of people would turn out in either case to see it happen. There's also the notion that one was required by the state and the other by religion, but the line between state and religion is pretty fuzzy at that time on either side of the Atlantic. 		One of the things that consistently bugs me when modern people learn about premodern ones is that they tend to assume Europeans think and act like we do now, while everyone else were barbarians. By many modern standards, premodern Europeans were barbarians as well. By many other modern standards, nobody was a barbarian, they just used (and had access to) very different means to achieve the same ends that we try to.

{"body":"When I visited Tullum a week and a half ago the guide told us there has been evidence of a drought toward the end of the Mayan civilization as we know it that could have really done them in. The coolest thing I found was that there was a diverse culture in central america, to the extent of like 30+ different tribes all different in culture. The Mayans, and most of the cultures around this era and area all were advanced in engineering and were just advanced in general for their time.		It was apparently a common belief of the people that the drought was caused by a change in religious beliefs. Basically they went from worshipping nature (the thing that gave them wind, rain etc) to a winged serpent god. (For anyone that has played smite I actually got to answer the guide when he asked the name, KulKuKan or however that is spelled haha)		The entire culture is fascinating to me. One of the most interesting things was the guide mentioned a debate happening about what happened after their famous ball game. Someone was sacrificed. But who is sort of unknown. It was definitely the "captain" of the team, but whether it was the winner or loser is questionable. If we look at it from a military standpoint, the loser would be sacrificed because he was weaker or...well the loser. If we look at it from a religious standpoint, the winner would be sacrificed because only the best could be given to their god.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"e-mulsion","name":"t1_ct0jewj","parent_id":"t1_cszu0od","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436696919,"created_utc":1436693319}

{"body":"Article pointed by /u/reallynotvegan in Spanish from [La Jornada](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/05/14/cultura/a03n1cul)		*Google translation with some errors fixed*		> * Ana M??nica Rodr??guez	> * Newspaper La Jornada	> * Friday May 14, 2010, p. 3	> 	> A pyramid of 75 meters high, larger than that of the Sun in Teotihuacan, is explored by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) on the acropolis of Tonin??, Chiapas, which is 1700 years old.	> 	> Emiliano Gallaga, director of the archaeological zone, explained that this work has been done for two years and with the help of a three-dimensional map was found that in the northeastern part of the site is "one of the largest buildings in Mesoamerica, only comparable with others in the Maya area located in Tikal and El Mirador in Guatemala."	> 	> Another feature that makes it unique to the pre-hispanic structure is that the seven platforms that integrate it were specific places for palaces, temples, housing and administrative units. "It is one structure for various specific functions within the social, political, economic and religious organization, it is not repeated in any other archaeological site of the Mayan world," INAH researcher said.	> 	> "It's a big surprise to see that the pyramid was done almost entirely by the prehispanic architects and therefore is more artificial than natural."	> 	> "This is because it was believed that almost the entire pyramid was a hill or a natural mound, but recent evidence has revealed that it was almost entirely built by the ancient inhabitants."	> 	> "Tonin?? ??? he said - is bigger than we suspected. Pyramids are connected by roads located on top of the surrounding elevations. "	> 	> In addition, Gallaga said that after this evidence from the pyramid of Tonin??, it was also confirmed that it is higher that the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuac??n, Mexico State, which measures 65 meters.	> 	> Thus INAH specialists have determined that the city center has an architectural continuity between 10 and 12 hectares, double of the previously known which corresponded mostly to the south facade of the acropolis, which is one of the most important Mayan areas.	> 	> "In fact, Tonin?? defeated Palenque, and some research suggests that in this place were taken prisoner two sons of Pakal."	> 	> In addition, the archaeologist said that this new record came during the work of consolidation and restoration that are carried out in the northern part of this mythical acropolis, after the purchase of land by the INAH, which allowed to delve into the urban aspects of this ancient city, including the fact that the pre-hispanic site is more extensive than previously thought.	> 	> The three-dimensional map was produced jointly by Juan Yadeun Angulo, director of Tonin?? Archaeological Project, and the expert Carlos Pall??n, who led a group of students in archaeology and postgraduates of the National School of Anthropology and History, who created this map where they registered structures of the northeastern sector of the site, its size and its interconnection by artificial roads.	> 	> **New hints**	> 	> A few months ago it was discovered on Tonin?? a stone sarcophagus dating from the years 840-900 AD, which may help explain the collapse of the Mayan culture. Inside the tomb, bones and pottery were found, and according to experts, this finding is comparable with that of the Red Queen of Palenque. "At this time, the evidences found are at the laboratory stage and subsequently DNA studies will be conducted, among others, which may offer us information to know the identity of that character."	> 	> Also in Tonin?? it was discovered a few months ago a wall with a hieroglyphic text that includes the full name of the Mayan chief who forged the most important military manors there, K'inich B'aaknal Chaahk, sixth ruler of the 14 (known up to now) who led this ancient city; it was even found his portrait made in stucco.	> 	> "It is important to stress that the information disseminated about Tonin?? has been very limited, and it is necessary that this place is known for the relevance that it had and because it is also one of the greatest Mayan cities of Chiapas such as Palenque and Bonampak," pointed Emiliano Gallaga.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dyskette","name":"t1_cszyk7c","parent_id":"t3_3cwors","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436647670,"created_utc":1436644070}
