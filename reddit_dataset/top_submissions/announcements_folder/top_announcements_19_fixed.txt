{"body":"Some security tips to prevent getting infected in the first place:		[Turning on DEP](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-Data-Execution-Prevention-settings) pre-emptively mitigates a large majority of these exploits. Go ahead and do it now, since it's off by default in the name of compatibility (you can whitelist any old games or programs that you need to). Contrary to some beliefs, this won't slow down your PC.		The root cause of the majority of drive-by exploits is insecure software on your PC which should be patched. Make sure anything that interacts with your browser - Flash, Java, PDF Readers, Shockwave, etc are all up to date. Adobe products in particular have a terrible security history and don't always auto update very well. You can use [Secunia PSI](http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/) to scan your hard drives for vulnerable software and get links to fixed versions or use Mozilla's [plugin checker](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/) to scan common browser plugins.		Uninstall old versions of Java, unless you're running terribly written java code, you only need the latest version on your PC. This prevents malicious code requesting to use an old, vulnerable Java install.		Open up your browsers plugins and extensions menu. Disable all that crap that you've rarely / never used or have no idea how it got there. Most plugins have poor auto updating and poor security. Do you really need to read PDFs inside your browser window, or is clicking "Open" after downloading an option?","depth":0,"score":63,"ups":63,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"notR1CH","name":"t1_c15vdqc","parent_id":"t3_e7988","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1289986763,"created_utc":1289957963}

{"body":"From: [Microsoft's Malware Protection Center](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Backdoor:Win32/Cycbot.B&ThreatID=-2147328481)		*Backdoor:Win32/Cycbot.B is a backdoor trojan that allows attackers unauthorized access and control of an affected computer. After a computer is infected, the trojan connects to a specific IRC server and joins a specific channel to receive commands from attackers. Commands can instruct the trojan to spread to other computers by scanning for network shares with weak passwords, exploiting Windows vulnerabilities, or possibly spreading through backdoor ports opened by other families of malicious software. The trojan may also allow attackers to perform other backdoor functions, such as launching denial of service (DoS) attacks and retrieving system information from infected computers.*		*The following system changes may indicate the presence of this malware:*		**The presence of the following files:**		* c:\documents and settings\administrator\application data\microsoft\stor.cfg 	* c:\documents and settings\administrator\application data\microsoft\svchost.exe 	* c:\documents and settings\administrator\application data\microsoft\windows\shell.exe 	* c:\documents and settings\administrator\local settings\temp\dwm.exe 		**The presence of the following registry modifications:**		* Adds:	        "svchost" value	          to -> "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"	           with -> "c:\documents and settings\administrator\application data\microsoft\svchost.exe"		So, your best bet is to check your directories for the objects listed. Next step, open up your task manager, CTRL+ALT+DEL, and locate the **svchost.exe** file that has been run under your username, rather than System. Just open up the task manager and click the 'User Name' tab to sort by username. Look for whatever username you are logged into, probably Owner or something along those lines, and shut down the svchost.exe program. Next, delete the file from the directory and remove the registry key. NOTE: You shouldn't be doing this if you're not very familiar with computers. If this doesn't solve it, try using a Malware scanner that is available on a boot CD, like [BitDefender](http://www.techmixer.com/bitdefender-rescue-cd-with-auto-update-virus-definition-features/) or [F-Secure](http://www.techmixer.com/free-f-secure-rescue-bootable-cd-to-clean-virus-and-malware/).

The fact of the matter is that even the best AV won't stop something it doesn't know about and since the virus coders have been working overtime this year the chances are pretty good that you will get infected even with a fully up to date AV program. The key to not getting infected by the overwhelming majority of viruses out there is knowing what they are targeting and what methods they are using.		Virus coders are very selective in what they target and that "target" is usually a relatively large source of "users" (the more people they can infect the better). Facebook is a huge source of people to infect and Facebook seems perfectly happy with having an interface that screams "just click here for virus download and installation...errr, I mean publish".

So even if you have the code in front of you to put in your analysis software (which ignores the type of malicious code that can take hold of your operating system and obfuscate any data you request from your own hard disk / memory / anywhere) and you assume that this is not self modifying code (as many of the most successful pieces of malicious code are) then it's STILL impossible to logically prove that the code is malicious and must be deleted.		I'm not saying anti-virus, malware protection, fixing security flaws, etc do not *help,* but they are not something you can confidently rely on to keep your computer 'safe and clean.'

{"body":"According to the link in the title, the affected directory isn't for Windows 7, so, not even sure if it affects Windows 7. Probably doesn't affect Vista either. Would have eased a lot of people's tensions.		Second, unless your using IE6, it's very unlikely a program "just installed" itself while you were casually browsing. Most likely, a popup or bar showed up asking you to install additional software. If you didn't, then no worries, if you did, then lesson learned. If you need software, find out what it is, flash, java, acrobat, or whatever, and go to the website to get the latest update. Better than that, set the software up to auto-update itself, then you know the popups are a scam.		Third, if you are using Vista or 7, leave UAC on and a little box will pop up in the middle of your screen asking if you want to install software. There is no point in time you should need to install software when casually surfing the web, if you do need to install software, then see my second point above.		And finally, quoted directly off the Microsoft webpage,		> Limit user privileges on the computer.		Don't surf the web with administrator privileges. In XP, if you need to install software, do it all at once while logged into an administrator account, then log back into your other account. In 7/Vista, the UAC thing will pop up asking you to put in your admin password before you install any software, which makes it very easy to install software under an administrative account while using your computer with limited privileges in day to day use.		P.S. A hardware and software firewall are a good idea as well, Windows has a built in software firewall, so just get a basic router with a hardware firewall and you're set. Note that at no point did I suggest installing antivirus bloatware on your computer. If it worked, then nobody would have gotten a virus today.

Admittedly, Professional is only $299 retail, so I don't know why the price is jacked up that much. In any case though, as long as you're willing to be only *mostly* compliant with your licensing (meaning getting a student upgrade when you're neither a student or upgrading), you can still get it fairly cheaply. There are a few other ways of getting a somewhat legit license, but they get shadier the cheaper you go. (For example, there are places that resell OEM licenses. Essentially what they do is they take the license off, say, a Dell computer that a business purchased, but had shipped with Home Premium, and then used their VLK for Professional on. It isn't necessarily *legit*, since technically the OEM licenses shouldn't transfer that way, but it is of dubious legal standing (courts in the US have both held up the practice and said no to it).

But it's not like you reach a point in your operating system where it says "*Congratulations, you've completed Windows XP!*" and the credits start rolling!

Whereas installing a game off steam generally just means clicking two or three buttons, waiting for a download to complete (often faster than a torrent downloads), then clicking Play.

Actually, what we also have is an example of reddit delivering malware. I can't recommend you install redditblock...

One example can be used to prove anything. Including that sufficiently paranoid people will now stop browsing reddit. 		Finally, I think this isn't the point we should take away from this.

If you are, these programs will have full access to your computer. Creating a user that you can use with limited rights can save you lots of trouble. See: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/279783		3) Always back up your data (common sense) as frequently as possible. If you can, get an automated service to do this for you.
