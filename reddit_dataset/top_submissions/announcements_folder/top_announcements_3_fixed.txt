{"body":"Found on [Lamar Smith's website](http://lamarsmith.house.gov/Multimedia/?VideoID=uXY8gcRTKv8): streaming video of copyrighted materials.  No mention that permission was given.		**Edit**:		I've sent an email to the television station whose content Smith is streaming inquiring whether he has permission to do so and tipping them off to the hypocrisy angle if not.  		With some help from IronHymen, bestnottosay, groovitude, and darthcorvus, I've gone through the list.  Many of the ones I've marked "y" have multiple other infringing videos.  If you want to join in, look through the ones I've marked "n"; my searches have been fairly cursory.  Some of them don't seem to have any videos up, though, and some of them only have C-SPAN videos (which they are allowed to use).		Now, I'll try to contact local media in their area to get them interested in the hypocrisy angle.  If you are a reporter or work for an anti-SOPA organization and want to take over from me at some point, leave a comment or PM me.  If you want to take your own congressperson, please leave a note saying who you've contacted about it.  (I'm only including media contacts, not contacts of Representatives in the chart, as that's what I'm more interested in tracking.  Both are awesome of course.)		EFF [tweeted this list](http://twitter.com/#!/EFF/status/136844991048847362).  I love you EFF!		And a reminder, to take action go to [sendwrite](http://sendwrite.com/sopa/), [american censorship](http://americancensorship.org/), or [wired for change](http://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173).		** IMPORTANT EDIT:** I've been in touch with a tech news site, who sent the story off to a couple lawyers.  I want to give them a chance to hear back from the other lawyer, but I'm feeling guilty seeing karma rack up without warning y'all: the first lawyer was skeptical that these videos would be criminalized, arguing that the Congresspeople could claim a good faith belief that their uploads were fair use.  I still think the law is awful and the contrast between the Congresspeople's rhetoric and actions striking, but I'm going to wait until I get more information to decide if there's a story here.		** IMPORTANT EDIT 2:** There will be a story on this soonish (today or tomorrow).  I'm retiring from coordinate letters to local press today, but depending on what the story says when it runs, hopefully we can use it to crowdsource efforts to contact local media tomorrow.		** Edit 3:** As KB1RMA points out below, [ars technica](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/11/on-wednesday-reddit-which-like.ars) has an article out.  There will probably be another soon.  Based on this, I'm not planning on pursuing this further.  If somebody else wants to, feel free.  I still think the hypocrisy is there, but I'm a bit sad to have led a lot of people down a path when there are so many other obvious problems with the bill.  I hope everybody is out there writing their reps.

{"body":"I'll probably get lost in the deluge, but I'd like to share my email to both reperesentives from Florida who sponsored this bill.		>Dear Congressman/Congresswoman _____________ :		>I understand you have significant experience in law. As such, you probably thought that the Stop Online Piracy Act you sponsored in Congress was a good idea. It's intended to finally crack down on intellectual property theft, and help to encourage intellectual property holders to continue to create.		>However, as someone who is more than proficient in Internet technologies, culture, law, and practices, I fear the bill you're supporting would be a significant threat to everyone's freedoms.		>After reading the text of the bill, my understanding of it is that it would not only hold site owners responsible for the content users post, it would also require various internet services (DNS, advertisement companies, and ISPs) to cease all business with and revoke access to sites that are only accused of hosting infringing material. This, I feel, would violate due process, restrict free speech, and cause a significant chilling effect in new ideas/designs.		>Please, consider the following: suppose that you and I both own web services. If we are in competition, anything that I can do to get more traffic than you would be a bonus to my profits. Under this bill, the easiest way for me to get an advantage would be to upload my intellectual property to your site (using proper obfuscation technologies, like a VPN or TOR), and then accuse you of hosting illegally obtained material. You, without the benefit of a court to defend yourself, would find your site's name removed from American DNS servers, would lose significant ad revenue, and would be locked out of your site until you could find and delete my material. It would be so easy to repeat that, once you were operating again, I could use the same trick. There would be no defense against this attack, and it would be completely legal. In fact, the terms of this bill are so broad that I wouldn't even need to actually upload my material to your site! I could just accuse you of hosting my material. You would have no opportunity to dispute my claim, and you would have the onus of proof of your own innocence, instead of me having the onus to prove your guilt.		>If these two scenarios seem farfetched, I ask you to refer to the recent actions of Warner Bros. They sent false take-down requests to Hotfile, and even used Hotfile's anti-piracy programs to remove protected materials they didn't own. 		>I assure you, this is common practice on the internet. If all I need to do is accuse you of doing something, and you are assumed guilty until you can prove your innocence, our entire system of justice and due process is undermined.		>This bill would also causes a chilling effect on the production of new ideas. If all it takes is one jealous competitor, or one sloppy rights-holder, to permanently remove my ability to produce, I would refrain from doing so.		>If you now consider the current system, you'll see that the DMCA has sufficient power to protect ideas. It may have flaws, and its jurisdiction may not apply to foreign sites, but that is the nature of international law. America, though we are a great nation, can neither enforce our standards upon other countries, nor can it undermine its citizens' ability to freely access all material online. However, the DMCA is sufficient to discourage piracy as well as compassionate enough to allow new ideas to come to light.		>In conclusion, this bill you have sponsored would not solve any problems, and would only further tarnish America's reputation abroad. We would engage in the same louche practices we condemn China for practicing.		>For this reason, I do not support your decision to sponsor this bill. Further, I think that your sponsorship of this bill shames the Democratic party, as well as the great state of Florida. You should be ashamed.		>Sincerely,		>Light-of-Aiur		I doubt it'll ever be seen by my representatives, but I think I did alright.","depth":0,"score":61,"ups":61,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Light-of-Aiur","name":"t1_c30855m","parent_id":"t3_me5e9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321482492,"created_utc":1321453692}

{"body":"I work in the office of a congressman. There are two ways to get our attention: (1) mass phone calls and (2) form issue mailings. 			1. Phone Calls: Your best bet is to call the D.C. office as they handle more of the policy related matters. When I worked phones, I kept a legal pad in front of me and kept track of the issues that we got a lot of calls on. If an issue got hot [over 25 or so calls], I would let a policy adviser know. I don't know how other offices worked but my Congressman kept tract of the issues that got hot. Here's a little tip for the phone calls though: the person on the other line isn't a miracle worker. No, they can't tell you why the Congressman supports or doesn't support that bill unless the policy advisers have told them to do so. No, they don't care why you think the Congressman is a dumbass for doing this or that. And no, you cannot talk to the Congressman. Keep the call short, tell me which bill you support or don't support, and be polite. If I get three callers yelling and cursing at me and the fourth is polite and thanks me for my time, you can guess which caller I'm going to go the extra mile for. Also, they will usually ask for your name, number, and address before you get off the call. This isn't part of some grand government conspiracy to steal your lunch money. It's so we can keep up to date on the issue. Your info goes into a program which lets us keep tract of constituents by issue so we don't waste our time going through legal pads of caller info when we send out a letter about how the issue got resolved. This program is NOT accessible to the campaign and it would be a violation of federal election law to do so.		Protip: This may get you on a fundraising listserv but calling the campaign office with your policy concerns will ensure the topic is addressed.		1. Mass mailings. There's a commonly held belief that elected officials give letters more weight than other communication. This is only partially true. Some people send us a letter about every topic that ever crosses their mind. And I mean EVERY topic. If you always write us, we barely pay attention to you after a while. I would say that 80% of the letters we receive come from 5% of the people who ever send a letter to our office. If it's the first time you've contacted the office, you'll get more attention. That being said, when I handled mail, what really got my attention was receiving several form issue letters everyday over a sustained period of time. When I say form issue letters, I mean the things that say "DEAR CONGRESSPERSON, I [INSERT YOUR NAME] SUPPORT H.R. OVER 9000 AND URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT TOO." For example, I remember receiving a couple of these form letters concerning the funding of a local military base on a Monday or a Tuesday and basically ignoring it. However, as the week progressed, the number we received went from a couple to several dozen per day. You bet your sweet ass we addressed that issue as soon as we could find a camera.","depth":0,"score":1221,"ups":1221,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"holdmystaffer","name":"t1_c3075yk","parent_id":"t3_me5e9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321466228,"created_utc":1321437428}

{"body":"Here is the letter I just sent to my congressman:		Dear Congressman %$#*:		I am writing you today about a provision in the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) introduced on Oct. 26, 2011. It seems to me that this legislation had the effect of creating an American internet firewall, one that could severely restrict the ability of Americans Citizens to access the internet similar to the regressive policies of countries like China. In June of this year, the United Nations declared that access to the internet is a basic human right, and unfettered access to information was crucial in the recent Democratic uprisings in the Middle East. It is very disheartening to learn that the US Congress is considering the restriction of a resource so vast and important that it has completely changed communications, access to informational resources and the expression of all of our freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution.		Specifically, the SOPA does two things that promote the censorship of the internet in the USA. First, it would allow for suspension of service prior to being found guilty by holding any site with user generated content. Currently, websites such as Google, Twitter and YouTube operate under a "safe-harbor" provision in the Digital Millenium Copyright Act that, if invalidated, would force these sites to suspend user access before determining whether the users were actually guilty of copyright infringement. This is frankly a usurpation of due process established by the 5th & 14th Amendments to the US Constitution. Second, Section 102 of the SOPA allows for the Blacklisting, by the Attorney General's Office, of any website accused of harboring a copyright infringement, again without the prior establishment of guilt under due process. The ability of a government agency to ban user access to an online site or service without due process is simply a reprehensible act of censorship and nothing less.		Online piracy can indeed be a problem, although in some cases piracy can lead to an increase in visibility for software or an online service that ends up creating more revenue for the developer, artist or creator of the product. The issue of copyright infringement pales in comparison, however, to the idea that American access to the internet could be disrupted, censored or denied without first establishing guilt. Free and unrestricted access to information is the arbiter of a Democracy; restricting the access of American Citizens to the vast resources of the internet in any form goes against the very values enshrined in the Democratic spirit of our Country.

{"body":"In the spirit of the internet, i wrote my own. I tried to keep it logical, but  I know I came off as standoffish in quite a few places. But, this is what I sent, omitting a few minor swaps of content. And yes, my representative is a Congresswoman. So much for having Congress and the HR separate.			Dear Congresswoman $$$$$$$,		> My name is $$$$$$, and I am a student of Software Engineering at $$$$$$, and a resident of the $$$$$$ district of the city of $$$$$$$$$. Yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee held a scheduled hearing on SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, also known as H.R.3261. (For reference, the text of this article is available here: http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf). The intent of this act was to allow the Attorney General to seek injunctions against foreign websites (Sec. 102(a)), allowing the legal right of the court to order Internet service providers to block access by subscribers to such websites, in addition to previous acts which allowed the court to issue cease-and-desist orders to domestic websites (hosted in the United States or maintained primarily by domestic United States residents). The bill also allows the court to order payment networks (eg. PayPal) to cancel or prevent electronic transactions concerning foreign sites, and to order advertising websites to cancel or prevent advertisements relating to such foreign sites from appearing in search results or in-site advertisements (eg. Google Web Search/Google Ads). The overall goal of this bill is fairly clear and understandably noble: To prevent piracy or illegal distribution of intellectual property, including confidential information, salable media content such as music, image, or video content, software, electronic documents, and other information which may be damaging to individuals or groups, financially or otherwise, as in the two separate notable scandals concerning the websites Napster and Wikileaks.		> There are several issues with this act that I would like to identify, at least from my individual perspective, which may or may not represent the views held by my peers. I would also like to echo some common concerns which I have observed from people similarly affected by this act. First, there is a personal concern that this means of forceful blockage of access to foreign sites may be misused in cases where the severity of the punishment greatly exceeds the severity or intent of the crime; this stems from a striking similarity to acts imposed by the Egyptian government which led up to the internationally-recognized, government-enforced telecommunications blackout of the past year. In the case of Egypt's citizens, they were simply attempting to describe their lack of personal freedom to the world, and were being prevented from doing even that. In a volatile world situation, where Internet usage has become synonymous with freedom, an act by the United States which allows the government to censor Internet sites at its own discretion is, to the public eye, an act against the founding beliefs of freedom of thought and speech. Such an act in its current form could be met with sheer public aggression, on the scale of the Occupy rallies.		> The second, and probably the key concern, is the sheer amount of information currently being shared by typical users of websites such as Google, YouTube, and Facebook, for the sake of intellectual, artistic, political and social means which, by the terms of this act, qualifies as affiliating with illegal foreign websites. One striking simile was that this act essentially provided an electronic equivalent to arresting someone for writing a school report on a Mexican drug cartel, because they were affiliating themselves with the drug cartel. By the terms described in the act, even the websites of the committee members who drafted the act would be subject to court orders, as was discovered by independent researchers centralized here: http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/me5e9/american_censorship_day_stand_up_for/ . The concern is that this could easily be used as a tool to restrict rights of individuals or groups in similar fashion to the tactics employed by former U.S. Senator McCarthy during the Cold War, or the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its precedents. 		> A third significant point I would like to bring up, being a software engineer currently both in study and in employment at a software company, is the relative complexity of suddenly imposing such a specific restriction onto an existing, complex telecommunications network such as the Internet (and constituent technologies, including Domain Name Service (DNS), Dynamic Host Controller Protocol (DHCP), and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)), in which many methods for circumventing existing security systems are already being discovered and utilized regularly. The core technologies which make up the Internet are internationally standardized by organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and ISO, and are maintained and updated by working groups which vote upon, design, implement and test any additions or ratifications to the core functionality of their standards. Following a standards update, there is usually a significant time lag before technology developers can produce new, stable, standards-compliant products or software, and following that, there is another lag before those products can be adopted for use in existing telecommunications systems. By the federal court system imposing modifications to DNS services (as stated within the act,) for example, they would effectively be providing the courts a federal denial-of-service (DoS) system, and would deliberately violate the design considerations of DNS technology that seeks specifically to avoid denial-of-service as much as possible. This addition of a federal "backdoor" is simply not feasible or realistic to  at worst, and would be easily circumventable or maliciously exploitable at best, through the use of existing methods based on benevolent software and hardware currently available to the average US citizen.		> My request to you is that when deciding upon this act, you perform further research into this subject and take into careful consideration the concerns I've covered here. If nothing else is accomplished, at least make sure that the concerns are made known among the House of Representatives as best you can. I succinctly hope that I am not the first, nor the last to send you a letter on this subject, and I pray that you act as would befit a true representative of the state of $$$$$$$$$$ and the country of the United States of America.

As you know, this act would give intellectual property owners the power to shut down any website's revenue flow with nothing more than a letter, requiring the website owner to file a petition if they wish to overturn this - of course, who knows how much income the website owner will have lost along the way?

The bill also give government lawyers, Internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, and payment processors the ability to block any site at their own volition.

{"body":"Here is mine, written to Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz (D-FL)		Good afternoon,		  I am writing today to express my concern over rights of television news channels and the unapproved use of their televised video content.	  	  Upon viewing Congresswoman Schultz's YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz) I noticed several useages of network news video clips.

Given Congresswoman Schultz's co-sponsoring of H.R.3261 (the Stop Online Piracy Act), she of all people would be keenly aware of the need to receive proper copyright holder approval for All media usage. I am here-by requesting copies of the required copyright holder approvals for all of the above listed copywritten videos posted by her administration to YouTube.	  	  If such written approval cannot be shown, then it is Congresswoman Schultz's legal obligation to remove all noted videos and any others which may be in violation of copyright law, or else face all appropriate punishments as laid out in current law.

{"body":"Yes and no. Thomas and Scalia were still there and are largely considered to be by far the most conservative justices in history, and are still there. Rehnquist came in at 3rd and is now gone, Roberts is his replacement and is more or less equal, but is also much more intelligent and more reasonable. O'Connor's been replaced by Alito, who has shown he can be moderate when he needs to be, and Kennedy is always a toss-up, especially on technology.

{"body":"Both Jkun and Potrebno above have very good points.  There's a technical reason as to why this may affect the rest of the world, as well.		From what I understand, a site takedown under SOPA will only require its DNS entry to be removed and that financial institutions (Visa, etc.) cease all payment to the site's owners within five days.  In case you're not familiar with DNS (Domain Name Service), you communicate with servers via IP Addresses - a set of numbers that is pointless to memorize.  When you type, say `reddit.com` in your browser's address bar, the first thing your computer does is look up the IP address (using DNS) so it knows where to go.  The data will still exist on the server, but few people will know how to access it.		The issue is that the primary DNS servers that hold IP addresses for all .com, .org, .edu, and several other such "top-level domains" are located in the United States.  If an American-owned and hosted site gets taken down, people in others nations will be unable to access it as well.  Similarly, a foreign website that uses a .org at the end would likely have to abide by SOPA, but it is unclear yet as to how it would be enforced.  The same kind of thing applies for domestically-based companies which hold foreign servers; does an American company have to ensure their server in France has only SOPA-safe data?  Similarly, does a German company who simply wanted a .com address have to abide by SOPA?  Their DNS entry is rooted in American machines, after all.		As far as the financial aspect goes, it will simply bankrupt companies that get hit with an infringement claim.  There is no due process on the path to getting taken down, and the appeal process is (from what I've heard) slow, containing a few "gotcha"s.		It's all incredibly ambiguous.  If it passes, I expect the Internet to essentially destroy itself within a week or two.","depth":2,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_c307vem","parent_id":"t1_c3077pd","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321479405,"created_utc":1321450605}

{"body":"That's a very interesting idea, and one that could certainly help.  Moving sites to non-US owned top-level domains (.co.uk, .me, etc.) would at least keep those DNS records off of American soil and make it an international issue to remove an address from the global DNS records.  If things got ugly enough, all traffic to foreign addresses could theoretically be blocked - there's only a few ways for data to get "across the pond," so it's a pretty easy choke point - or they could block DNS lookups for foreign domains.  However, that's a very bold move, even for the group sponsoring this bill.		A move to international domains won't, however, stop a funding block.  For example, if wikipedia.org were to move their information to a completely foreign location (i.e. servers, domain, and employees) but still service the United States, a copyright infringement claim would still force financial institutions such as Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal from processing transactions for them.

You only have to look at how quickly the Pirate Bay was functioning after the Swedish police seized their servers (almost immediately, they already had mirrors prepared for when it happened) and how effective the (US) court ordered take down of Wikileaks was (in the Julius Bar case) to see how impossible it is to actually stop people hosting websites if they are prepared to defy the courts. 		I read about the Wikileaks thing about 6 hours after the court decision and, although their domain name was not resolving as ordered by the court, I was able to find a mirror and get a copy of the document the judge had taken exception to them releasing (details of clients of a Swiss bank hiding their money in a tax haven) in minutes. 		Despite the enormous amount of money the RIAA and MPAA has spent, The Pirate Bay is still online and still serving torrents (though I think it's rivals have overtaken it in terms of popularity), it's founders are still free and haven't paid any fines and, given that one of them (anakata) has definitely left Sweden, he isn't looking like he's going to be doing so any time soon. 		If even the most notorious proponents and enablers of piracy the world has ever seen were able to openly mock the legal system, for years and still continue to do so after their much publicised trial, I don't think this is going to be the end of it. It'll simply be a crushing legal burden for legitimate sites, run by commercial interests, that won't just defy the courts. 		I don't think this is an attempt to crush the little guy, I think the MPAA and RIAA are just stupid enough to think this will help them in their demented quest to get piracy stamped out and don't care who they piss off in the process (even if the people they are annoying are the ones they are trying to sell stuff to and they are just pushing more people to piracy). 		Personally, I'm already tired of their shit and have decided to stop buying movies before this happened (ironically, I think it was being forced to sit through one of those anti-piracy adverts at the beginning of a DVD I'd bought that made me decide to stop buying them). I'm not planning to stop watching them. I could but, frankly I don't want to and, after the crap the RIAA and MPAA have pulled, I couldn't care less about their rights anymore and am perfectly willing to infringe them if I feel like it. 		Music I still pay for. Buying it's just easier than pirating it. The RIAA seem to have realised that they can't stand in the way of online distribution, and that they are better off finding a sensible way to charge for it, soon enough. The MPAA are probably too late, it's already so easy to download movies illegally that it's hard to see them making a legitimate service that is as easy to use which, given it's always going to cost something, is probably going to be necessary if they are going to get people using it (and so paying for their movies).","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sipos0","name":"t1_c30d4q0","parent_id":"t1_c3096lg","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321514411,"created_utc":1321485611}

{"body":"You think that's strange? Back in college my linguistics professor had a long-running, optional assignment in which any student attending the school could participate. We were allowed to work on it for the entire four-year span in which we attended, and could turn it in for a mysterious and unexplained "extraordinary credit bonus" at any point in time before the last four weeks of our senior year. We were to make our best attempt at creating our own language, and learn to speak it well enough to carry on a detailed conversation with him on stage at a free assembly to be attended by any current or former student or faculty members who wished to come.		Well, I was never one to back down from a challenge, so I started working on my language that same night. I finished the assignment six weeks before graduation, turned in the requested language bible I had created, and spent the next few weeks preparing for the coming conversational exam extravaganza. The day came, and there were hundreds of people in attendance. The professor took the stage and explained the premise of the exercise to everyone, then introduced me to a round of applause. Nervous, but determined, I made my way to the stage. 		I had expected this exercise to simply consist of him asking me various questions in English and me replying in my language; I was leveled, however, when he began the conversation by speaking fluently in my created tongue. The conversation went as follows:		> Him: "Ror grubburg, mossom non lil tomot dud. Ses nin?" (Good morning, my favorite student of all. Are you ready to begin?)	> Me: "Oho ror grubburg, klinenilk. Ses." (Good morning to you as well. I am.)	> Him: "Ses ror asasa hoh ririr ana gooloog momom sis dered ini sopa?" (Are you aware that I found this language of yours on the 'sopa'?)	> Me: "Istsi sunus sopa? Roor goonoog non ses isi dodod lel boddob reder gooloog." (What is a 'sopa'? That word does not exist in my language." 		From here on I will just type what we said translated into English.*		> Him: "The sopa is a worldwide system of computers and servers connected by data transmission cables. The sopa enables its users to communicate and share files and information with each other over long distances."	> Me: "Oh... That."	> Him: "The sopa is also where last year I, under a pseudonym, published a manual--much like this one of yours--designed to teach readers how to speak a language invented by me which features only words that are palindromes." 		Yeah, I thought I was slick copying from the internet back in the early days when you almost always got away with it. And not only did I get caught, it turns out I had accidentally stolen the work of the same professor who gave me the assignment. I had found the manuscript on the net and spent the last four years becoming fluent in this language, the existence of which I had believed no one else could have possibly discovered. The audience had no idea what we were saying; though, they had to have known I was feeling very nervous and embarrassed about something. Sweaty, nervous, and knowing the jig was up, I decided to continue the conversation in hopes that he at least would not let everyone in attendance know what I had done.		> Me: "So, if 'sopa' means 'the internet', why is not a palindrome?"	> Him: "Because it's an acronym for 'ses oo pep arapepooses', which means 'You win the prize."		It turned out the whole assignment had been a trap he set years ago in an attempt to trick some clever-yet-lazy student into not only learning to speak his made-up palindrome language fluently, but also to serve as a school-wide example of how the coming internet boom would soon make the act of plagiarizing material for college assignments all but impossible. I marveled at his genius and or insanity. The man invented an entire language based on an arbitrary and bizarre rule for the sole purpose of an endgame that not only might never occur, but, if seen to fruition, would end up costing him tons of money. The professor, still speaking our secret language, then informed me the SOPA prize was a full-honors recommendation to any university of my choosing, with my whole first year's tuition, housing and supplies paid in full by the professor himself. 		As I stood there trying to pick up my jaw from the floor, he explained everything to the audience--the genesis of his plan, the trials of creating the language, how I fell for the trap, our conversation on stage, and my prize for being the now multilingual butt of his joke. They loved it. Everyone was cheering and a bunch of my friends started chanting my name, which spread over the whole audience. It was one of the greatest moments I had ever experienced. 		After the show ended, the professor took me out to lunch. As we sat there eating a king's feast at a restaurant much fancier than any I had ever seen before, a thought occurred to me. I asked him, "Did you really plan this whole thing in advance? I mean, is that why you created that language in the first place; or did you create the language, then later on hatch this idea to use it for this assignment?" He stared at me blankly for a few moments, then replied, "You can't stop the internet, Steve." I said, "Huh? My name's not Steve, it's..." Before I could finish, his eyes started rolling in the back of his head, and he went into convulsions. 		Panicked, I went over to him to try and help him, not knowing what I should be doing. He stopped convulsing and told me everything was okay--that every once in a long while he would have some kind of fit like that. Right before one happened he would become confused and briefly lose touch with reality; but everything would return to normal after a minute or so. Relieved, I sat down and asked him the question again. He never answered. He just stared out of the window and sipped his wine. 		I thought maybe he was about to have another fit. He just sat there staring off in complete silence, as if I had not been there. After about ten straight minutes of this awkwardness, I started to realize I had been had. This old son of a bitch had been playing games with me. There was no paid tuition. There was no prize at all. This was just some old weirdo with a brain condition that made him fuck with people. I had just been bamboozled by a sociopath who was now sitting across from me pretending I was a ghost. 		I had gotten myself so worked up that I was just seconds away from flipping over the table and screaming obscenities at the crazy asshole. At the last moment, I stopped myself, thinking it better to just walk away than to make things worse by falling into whatever sick endgame he might have planned that involved him using mind-games to make me so angry that I would assault him in public, go to jail, be raped by people in there he paid with cartons of cigarettes, and so on and on.		I found out later that night that all of that was just in my head. Trying to make sense of his bizarre behavior, I had let myself slip into having thoughts even more bizarre than anything I had experienced that day. He came to my dorm at about 9 PM and proved to me that he wasn't just some crazy, old man. He was, in fact, a rapist. And he raped me. Over and over, he raped me. He raped me until I completely blocked out the last four years of my life to ensure I would never remember anything about this hours-long raping. He raped me so hard my brain actually invented a full four year's worth of fake memories to hide this incident behind. And to this day I still can't recall anything that happened to me during those four years; though, I do remember being raped repeatedly on that cold, dark September night. 		Every year on that night I sit outside looking at the moon--wondering if maybe somewhere out there, someone is being raped on the moon, or raped by a moon, or just a good old-fashioned guy named Steve, who had the good sense to take his raping operation to the moon, where cops can't go yet because flying cop cars is a silly thought, and they would use too much fuel to justify their existence. Good for you, Steve. Rape 'em good, boy. Rape 'em for me.		--The Professor","depth":3,"score":1622,"ups":1622,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"darthcorvus","name":"t1_c30c7il","parent_id":"t1_c307396","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321508533,"created_utc":1321479733}

{"body":"Some colleges give preference to upper classmen for better dorm accommodations (that's how my school did it).		We were weird and had a house system similar to Harry Potter, and the preference for each class was different for each "house".  At my house (we called them colleges), next-year sophomores had lowest priority for housing, and people who had lived off-campus that year got an extra half-point added to their "score".  Room assignment order and picking was based on the average score of the people choosing to live together, and it was done in the Spring semester in preparation for the next Fall.  So if you were an up and coming sophomore, you wanted to try to get in good with a couple of up and coming juniors or seniors to bump up your average score and get a higher chance of getting a room on campus.		Incoming Freshmen were guaranteed a room.		Some people would say "Why would you want to live on campus?" and I would say: Because living on campus at my school was a hell of a lot of fun.  Parties (it was not a dry campus, and in fact, had 2 pubs: undergraduate and graduate), social events, the delicious college cafeterias, rather nice rooms, being able to roll out of bed 20 minutes before class (small-ish campus), quick and easy access to the Lightrail if you needed to go get groceries or something.

It got a further boost when Herman Gertner hired Klitting, for his Gertner's restaurants in Manhattan. Popularity for the pastry soared at this point, with it becoming the go-to treat for anyone on Broadway. Sales were so good, Gertner hired more bakers and converted his restaurant chain to selling pastries wholesale.		While the boon between 1915-1920 was the most influential for danish influence in America, by 1940 it was a household name and household pastry. Proctor and Gamble even promoted some scientific experiments to provide the best danish recipe and baking methods.		...So, I'm good there, right?

{"body":"Invest in a good pen. Contrary to popular belief, 'good pens' do not have to have sharp nibs, made from eagle feathers and have to be dipped in kraken ink.		For this one, I used a Uniball eye fine, though I often like a pilot G-Tec-C4. Both have fantastic ink flow and thicknesses and they're the only pens I really enjoy using (that and black and lime sharpies). These pens are both under £3.		Paper quality is also important - but you can get a good effect with cheap printing paper by writing on top of a stack of 10+ paper. Writing on a hard surface really really feels bad. Paper needs a certain softness, padding and 'give' behind it to get a nice flow without pen scratching.		To answer your actual question - Just write until you're comfortable, and write often. My 'd's are like up-side-down 'p's, for example. This gives a nice flick and flow because you're carrying the momentum of the pen around the bend of the d.		...Anyway. I like working with pens and paper. I'm a tour guide for an old mill, so it doesn't have any bearing on my job.		**TL;DR I like writing and drawing.

Everyone who's against this bill should have a good answer, so they aren't written off as an unrepentant pirate or whatever.		Because they don't even have to prove it's copyright infringement.  If a company doesn't like your commentary, parody, or criticism of their work, even if it's legal Fair Use of their copyrighted material, they will likely be able to remove it.  Companies have already done this with DMCA takedown requests, but this process will give them more power to do so in more different places.		The other major problem is the existence of a simple process for removing *anything* posted on the web.  In the past, people and companies have spammed frivolous DMCA requests as a filibuster of sorts: to keep content off the web for as long as it takes to sort out all the DMCA requests.  They will be able to use SOPA the same way, but against any website who has any users who so much as link to something that might be questionably Fair Use of your content (i.e. anything on any site with user-generated content).  And not just to remove their content, to remove the entire website if their content isn't pre-censored-out.		Example: Say I posted a link to a parody of a pop song in this comment.  The artist could then shut down *all of Reddit*, forcing search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with Reddit.  All before anyone bothered to prove that it wasn't Fair Use.","depth":4,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"xazarus","name":"t1_c308ltd","parent_id":"t1_c3081wj","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321486398,"created_utc":1321457598}

There are other ways of stopping the people who sell pirated content , that is what i don't understand.  		But correct me if I'm wrong , but no torrent tracker will be closed  , because it does not have any files with "pirated content" , to my understanding it is just a link for p2p networks. So , if they will be willing to "censor all the internetz" they will have to cut the cord of nearly ALL internet users , therefore killing the whole PC industry at once.

{"body":"The difference is that if we as a community at large decide that reddit (inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Advance Media) is no longer good for what we want, we can move our participation (and ad-viewing eyeballs) to another forum, either user-created (as reddit was originally) or privately-owned. If the government can shut down sites with user-generated content that people use for not-so-legal purposes (such as copyright infringement), that choice becomes irrelevant.		The whole idea behind the DMCA is to protect and promote the spreading of information (and music, art, etc.). Just because a site *can* be used for something illegal doesn't mean it should be shut down or punished. That discourages site operators from allowing the free exchange of ideas, information, and media. As it stands now, the onus in the case of copyright is on the owners of the content.		As a society, we have chosen to lean on the side of free speech, because that open exchange is important to us. This is especially true in the age of instant information where cell phones now share in serving the function of traditional journalism. While trying to stop torrents of *The Walking Dead* isn't really a legit reason to call your congressman, forcing providers to "cover their asses" by erring on the side of censoring users is fundamentally detrimental to the kind of information exchange that has become pivotal in our world. (If you need examples, two off the top of my head are the overthrowing of governments in the Middle East and the reversal of debit card fees.) Worse yet, instead of allowing providers to handle claims of infringement on their own, the entire site (thus, the entire medium for exchange and expression) can be taken down because of a few people who don't want to pay $10 to see a movie.		I know you weren't necessarily arguing in favor of this legislation, but my point is that it doesn't really matter if reddit or any other site decides to take down something because it threatens its integrity; that's not the issue. We don't want the government restricting an entire medium because entertainment conglomerates are having to navigate a modern world where they don't make as much money as they used to. Pirating media and software is already illegal, and most respectable outfits (like reddit and YouTube) readily comply with legitimate requests with respect to copyright infringement and other illegal activities.

If you are not from their district, they ignore the letter and it is instantly deleted.	I am from New York, but their web forms are coded to delete my letters because I'm not technically a constituent.		In effect, those who are trying to pass a bill that effects ALL OF US, are IGNORING THE OPINION OF ALL OF US.		Therefor, I post my entire letter here, for anyone else to use. If you don't know what to write, and yet you ARE from their districts, you can use mine:		Hi, my name is REPLACE YOUR NAME HERE. I'm from WHERE YOU ARE FROM. I don't normally write to my congressman, but this is vitally important to the integrity of all that America stands for.		The Stop Online Piracy Act goes way too far, giving too much censorship power to those who would abuse it without any regard to the consequences such as collateral damage that will effect hundreds of thousands of websites. Not just the very few websites that host illegal content, but every single website, even the WhiteHouse.org		Any user could post in a forum, message board, or comment field, a link to a questionable website. If SOPA passes, by law WhiteHouse.org would have to be blocked after an infringement claim.		The very foundation of America is based on free information exchange and freedom of speech. This bill goes against everything that defines America, and it serves nothing but to perpetuate and assist old broken business models that refuse to embrace the internet and adapt. The RIAA and MPAA keep influencing Congress to adapt these draconian measures to help them survive with zero regard for how it effects all Americans.		The Safe Harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act has enabled many vital and internet defining websites to function such as YouTube. Without the Safe Harbor provisions, a single bad upload by any user to YouTube could shut down the entire site based off an infringement claim. The DMCA already provides adequate legal means to take down infringing works from a website. This system has worked for over 10 years, but SOPA has measures that will effectively kill the Safe Harbor provisions of the DMCA, which would stifle innovation meaning no more sites being created such as YouTube and Wikipedia, and leading to less job creation in the IT and Web Development fields.		This is the absolute worst bill I've ever seen, and I am appalled that it would even be considered. I am not alone in my sentiment, hundreds of thousands are appalled, and millions of Americans will be stunned if such an act should pass. If you truly care about America and the freedoms we share and proudly show to the rest of the world as an example, you'd know what you must do.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"evolvedant","name":"t1_c30bw57","parent_id":"t3_me5e9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321506674,"created_utc":1321477874}

{"body":"I just wrote this to my rep, but you're free to use or modify this for your own rep:		I'm writing to register my STRONG opposition to SOPA, the so-called Stop Internet Piracy Act that congress is currently considering. While strongly liberal, I firmly believe that the internet should *not* be legislated or regulated, unless that legislation or regulation acts to strengthen the freedoms available to citizens who make use of the internet. Privacy, the free flow of information, ease of access, and unhindered (read: uncensored) communications are what make the internet what it has been for the last 15 years: an ever-expanding segment of the economy and an engine of growth and human development.		We only have to look at the last year to see the impact the internet has had. Free flow of information allowed protests in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere to reform if not overthrow despots in their countries, bringing democratic reforms. The internet as it exists today allows genuine democratic action and organization by otherwise powerless people. It literally empowers people with democratic capabilities; self-publishing, organization, privacy, etc. America should not set an example for other nations to follow by restricting internet use for purposes that it deems unacceptable, especially if those reasons are economic--and do some research here, there are very strong arguments to be made that piracy does NOT harm the economy.		Sure I'm paving a slippery slope argument here, but how big of a leap is it for us to say that today we're going to ban websites that hurt the economy by allowing piracy, and tomorrow we're going to ban websites that hurt the economy by promoting unpopular taxation measures. Will the Occupy websites, on the internet of tomorrow that SOPA would help shape, be censored? The Tea Party's website? Rick Perry's? The internet doesn't kill people, you actually can’t kill people online unlike the real world, it is a unique territory that should be treated as such. The government must keep its HANDS OFF so that humanity can learn how best to use the net going forward, to bring new economic, political, or other opportunities we can't yet imagine to future generations.		I hope that, if or when Congresswoman McCollum has a say on SOPA, that she votes no. Further, I hope she takes a stand before the bill comes to a vote, and that she goes on the record in support of a free and open internet. (This isn't to say that I don't support Net Neutrality, that's an issue of corporations providing access to the internet, it's a simple logical leap to see why I believe they shouldn't be allowed to censor or restrict the internet, either!)","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mardish","name":"t1_c30easu","parent_id":"t3_me5e9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321522643,"created_utc":1321493843}

{"body":"We somewhat do, there are many smaller ISPs that buy from the larger ones. However, generally speaking, the majority of the Internet all passes through a handful of companies pipes (or series of tubes if you will). These will remain separate for legal monopoly reasons, but technologically we can split it up even more... it just takes billions of dollars and a company wishing to break into the ISP realm. It's the same reason why power companies don't spring up all over the place, very steep investment to start it up, and ROI's are normally projected for years down the line. Main thing is fiber pipelines cost insane amounts of money to lay on the ocean floor, but ISPs are constantly encourage to lay more cable, as it cheapens bandwidth costs over time. 		So in a short, yes we can quite easily scale our existing major centers, it just takes buckets of money.

{"body":"Here's what I wrote in case any of you don't know what to say:		Representative, I am writing to you today regarding your sponsorship of the "Stop Online Piracy Act". This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. Part of this act would undermine the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, which would make sites like Reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. Holding site liable for user created content essentially dismembers what may be the most culturally significant factor of the internet today. Consider the ramifications if a state such as Egypt had similar provisions and power over the content on the internet during the Arab Spring. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them. This act does not protect online businesses, it shackles them. Services such as Google, Ebay, and Youtube could be held responsible for user-created content. Which is why these California based firms have stepped out in opposition of this measure. Meanwhile, media giants such as Viacom support the measure because it opens up a plethora of potential lawsuits against billion dollar internet-based firms. Protect our California-based internet companies from media giants, and please, help keep the internet a public forum.

The creators of the content need to be compensated but how much? My basic market theory knowledge tells me they want the most the consumer is willing to pay. I think because digital content can be effortlessly and endlessly duplicated, the value to the consumer goes down. 		Content creators complain because this is not what they want, but guess what, times change and so does the way we do business with one another. There are many ways artists can make money even if they give out their songs for free. In the end you just want to make a living off of what you do, and that is possible!

We are not alone in our concerns. Earlier this week, we joined eight other Internet companies -- AOL, eBay, Facebook, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twitter, Yahoo!, and Zynga -- in a letter to Congress, echoing concerns voiced by industry associations, entrepreneurs, small business owners, librarians, law professors, venture capitalists, human rights advocates, cybersecurity experts, public interest groups, and tens of thousands of private citizens.		Google takes the problem of online piracy and counterfeiting very seriously, devoting our best engineering talent and tens of millions of dollars every year to combat it through our Content ID system on YouTube, our efforts to make copyright work better online, and our work to keep counterfeiters out of our ads system.		Katherine’s testimony will offer recommendations for more targeted ways to combat foreign “rogue” websites that are dedicated to copyright infringement and trademark counterfeiting, while preserving the innovation and dynamism that has made the Internet such an important driver of economic growth and job creation."","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pillowplumper","name":"t1_c308dkm","parent_id":"t3_me5e9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321484655,"created_utc":1321455855}
{"body":"Copyright law is the biggest scam on Earth, and it hasn't been around that long.		Copyright law today is not written to protect creators, it is not written to promote sharing ideas, and it is not written to secure the future creations of material.  Copyright law is written specifically to financially benefit a small handful of very large corporations.		How disgusting copyright law is, becomes very obvious when you compare it to patent law.		Patents are for inventions, and usually take years and lots of money to secure the patent.  Patent protection runs between 8 and 20 years, with some ability to extend it.  Copyright law on the other hand, is automatic when the property is created, then the protection runs the life of the creator(s) plus 70 years or 120 years if it is a corporate creation.		The whole point of having copyrights and patents expire, was so the creators could make money at the start, and then share it with the world.  With the length of copyright, material will have little to no use once the copyright expires.		"Happy Birthday to You" was sort of written in 1893, but under the name "Good Morning to You" with slightly different lyrics, and based on songs that were in the public domain at the time.  Later on a group of children changed some of the words and it became "Happy Birthday to You".  It wasn't officially copyrighted until 1935 and doesn't end in the US until 2030.  The original creators and their heirs are not benefiting from the copyright, restaurants can't even sing the song to patrons, and any movie or TV show needs to pay royalties to Time Warner if they want to use it.		It should also be noted that every time copyright is extended, it coincides with when Mickey Mouse is about to become public domain.

{"body":"I never said I agree with them, an in that sense I am glad the sub/r/ is gone, but where do you draw the line?  		A lot of people felt that it was disturbing and disgusting, unethical, illegal, and would sicken most of the general public, and when you said that,  you were right.  But many would say that children going to a bible camp/military camp/young republicans & democrats is, essentially, doing the same thing by exploiting of young people before they have the common sense to know what they're doing.  So let's shut those down.		China blocks pornography because it feels that it's immoral and a detriment to productive society, just as they block IMDB (for some stupid ass reason, pisses me off...) and parts of the Wikipedia.  They are so afraid of the public opinion turning sour and rebelling against them that they do something like this.  		How about this?  I will bet you that all of the pictures on /r/jailbait were probably pulled off of facebook or myspace.  Ok, maybe only 90%.  So let's shut those down, because they're hosting the same thing.  Are they ok because of the context of the sites?  Who determines what is a correct context?  They are the same pictures, same pedos looking at them, if not more.  		Here's another example someone else used.  P2P file sharing was being used to shuttle child porn, so they should censor that.  Or better yet, the internet in general is being used to trade CP.  Let's censor the whole thing.  You could also use the USPS to send CP to someone else, so let's scan all packages and open anything suspicious.  I heard that you could also get CP into the country in your checked baggage, so let's put people at the airport to search all luggage for CP and anything else we deem offensive.  I think people are talking about meeting times for CP, so let's wiretap all telephones in the country in order to find those disgusting horrible pedos.  We should also monitor streets and alleys with cameras to catch them trading pictures and videos by flash drive.  Don't complain!!!

Also, it has nothing to do with the current conversation.		Also, China is perfectly justified to block pornography because it is illegal in their legislation. And are justified to block certain things on the web because their legislation permits them to do so.		Thirdly, your slippery sloppe argument doesn't work, because the only point of r/Jailbait was to distribute in a sexual context pictures of children who they do not know. This is the big difference, pictures on 		Facebook pictures are: 1. Of the immidiate family. 2. Used in a family context with no bad intentions. 3. Used for thousands of other things.		This is very different then r/Jailbait.		Also, I'm pretty sure there currently are sting operations against pedophiles in most countries, but those follow the applicable legislation, and so cant go overboard.			Finally, there were exchanges of actual sickening, disgusting bona fide CP on r/Jailbait. And that is 100% illegal pretty much everywhere in the world.

SOPA's careless and vaguely written legislation is sure to ruin the fabric of the internet and have harmful effects on American society as a whole. I urge you not to support this bill as it is not in the best interests of the people you were elected to represent. As a government official you were elected to do your best to adhere to the concerns of the American public and your constituents. Your job is to protect the freedoms upon which our nation was founded. Therefore, I implore you not to vote in the best interests of specific corporate entities (The MPAA, RIAA, Viacom, Netflix, Macmillan Publishers, etc) but instead choose to recognize the adverse effects this law will have on the vast amount of other industries to which the internet is vital as well as American society as a whole.		The aforementioned associations themselves are attempting to push this bill because they are having difficulties adapting to the quickly changing technologies that human innovation and progress are blessing us with. I ask you not to stifle this progress but rather demand that these associations progress themselves and find ways to make themselves and their industries profitable as we move continually into the future. Technology and society will forever change and evolve. It is our job as human beings not to continually attempt to fight these forces, which has throughout history proved to be futile. Instead we should attempt to evolve ourselves as well and adapt to these changes.

{"body":"To be honest, whilst I think that this will be a terrible bill in the short term, I think it will be awesome for all of us in the long term. A lot of the companies protesting against this bill have a strong interest in a highly centralised Internet. Google, Facebook, et. al. all "control" parts of the Internet that - rightly or wrongly - have become very important to us in day to day use. Key parts of critical Internet infrastructure, such as DNS, are essentially controlled by the US government, and whilst that is nice for the US Government, we have already seen many times that they are rather clueless when it comes to managing DNS, with judges ordering ridiculous "bans" and whatnot.   	   	I personally think (hope) that when this bill comes to pass, the "community" will swiftly and effectively find a way to route around these idiocies, and other Governments will finally wake up to the fact that they have exactly zero input or say in how DNS is done. I am convinced that this will lead to a very quick liberation of DNS and a more de-centralised manner of running DNS overall. In fact I believe that it is inevitable that this would lead to the media calling once again for a ban on peer-to-peer, as I think it wouldn't make sense to run DNS in any other way. Think "consensus-based, peer-to-peer DNS decision making".   	    	Same will go for search, hosting content, and many of the other issues at risk and threat here. What if the TOR network would not only route traffic, but also host content? What if the "Cloud" was not a euphemism for "pay a lot more money to a hosting firm for a crappier service where downtime is now a fact of life" but instead would really be a true "cloud", where bits and parts of content live on different home PC's and servers, replicated randomly all over the place, therefore impossible to censor or shut down?   	   	The technology is already in place, and all it needs is a catalyst. This ridiculous bill is exactly that, and I say let the US Government pull this crazy-ass shit. Let them deny access to "other side" at these hearings. Let them pervert the last remaining shred of credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world. Is anybody actually *surprised* at this at all? This bill is a catalyst to drive a better, decentralised Internet. Let it come, because we need it.

I will address your points, regardless that you did not offer me the same courtesy. You're delusional if you think "the government can't do anything right". For instance, look at our military. It's extremely effective, especially in deterring action. It's enormity cannot be understated. Before you mention Iraq and Afghanistan, please consider that these are errors of strategy and policy rather than the military system itself. 		It's very popular these days, if perhaps only on Reddit, to express an anti-government sentiment. This is potentially the one thing that young liberals like myself share with the shrewder conservatives of the modern political discoure. But just 10 or 15 years ago under Clinton the trust in government was much, much higher.

Lastly, the media companies supporting Protect IP and SOPA are not concerned with the amount of money it will cost to enforce these copyright regulations. Why would they have a reason to care what it will cost? That responsibility will fall on the shoulders of the judges ordering the IPs to be blacklisted and whatever law agencies are performing followup.

If you read the first amendment, you'll see that it relates to congress passing laws to prevent speech - the key words are "congress" and "laws." Reddit isn't congress. 		I think people get confused about this because it's so easy to post ideas on the internet. But, speech isn't protected on privately owned platforms, including sites like Reddit. Instead, you have the freedom to create your own platform.		The distinction between the jailbait event and SOPA is that Reddit removed part of the site it owns. SOPA gives companies the power to remove sites they do not own from the internet.

{"body":"The Digital Millennium Copyright act grants certain websites such as YouTube exemption from responsibility if users upload illegal and/or copyrighted content. Provided of course that they remove said content when notified that it exists. It’s call the ‘safe harbor’ and it is vital to enable websites like YouTube, Digg, Reddit and so forth to operate. The amount of submissions that these sites get is astronomical- it is simply not possible to vet every last submission. Not without employing so many people you’d be bankrupt pretty much right away.		The system isn’t perfect. For one thing it means someone has to actually notice and report the content, and then the site has to take it down. By which time the content has spread to a dozen other places and been accessed by thousands of people. But can you think of anything better? The supporters of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) think so.		They want to do away with the ‘safe harbour’ part of the DMCA, forcing sites to vet every last submission or risk being sued into the ground. Oh, and on top of that they will censor any site that hosts, shows or links to pirated material or- and here is the kicker ‘counterfit gooods’. Censor as in- you will not be able to access this is you live in the US. At all.		So, basically this act, should it pass would trigger the following: YouTube as we know it would be killed.

However, it will do the exact opposite.  I obviously do not have the time to read the entire bill, but I feel its more then unnecessary. Part of this act would undermine the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act which would make sites like Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, and millions of other sites liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them.  In short, this bill is honestly disgusting.  The amount of censorship to come out of this bill is ludicrous to even consider.  Has the US government forgotten that this is the "Land of the ______." I hope you don't have any trouble filling in that space.  I could go on and on about why this bill is unnecessary and why it wouldn't help even if it was, but I don't want to waste your time.

{"body":"There used to be a thing called 'fair use' that the DMCA did away with. Our founding fathers knew that exceptions existed to copyright law for a reason of parody, education, non-profit use, and after so many years will enter public domain. Well over time the number of years to enter public domain was increased and missing a renewal of copyright can be amended to avoid falling into public domain.		If you have to wonder, it is the patent laws that are killing our economy and putting companies out of business. Not because they violate patents or not, just simply because they cannot afford the legal fees to defend themselves and either settle out of court or end up going out of business as the legal fees keep going up and court costs. I used to work for corporate lawyers so I know this to be true. The MIAA and RIAA sue by Dynamic IP address and often get grandmothers who don't pirate files but got the IP address after someone else used it and thus she gets sued.		The DMCA is Unconstitutional as it takes away consumer rights and gives them to the corporations. The consumer no longer owns the product, but buys the right to use it, which can be taken away for no reason at all. You don't own the songs or movies you buy, you buy a license to view them. Before the DMCA you bought an audio CD or DVD or VHS tape it belonged to you, you could lend it to a friend or make a backup of it. The MPAA vs. Sony over the BetaMax is an example of what I am talking about. The MPAA lost that as consumers had a right to tape movies and TV shows to the BetaMax VCR because of the US Constitution and the Copyright law and 'fair use'. That is why the DMCA was passed to take away those rights. Now we pay for it with a bad economy and also now censorship. It is not Capitalism, it is not Communism, it is Corporalism where corporations run our government and take away our rights and freedoms for their profits. They use lobbyists to get the votes in Congress and the White House to approve it.		I've wrote Congresspeople over it, they refuse to do anything about it.

There are plenty of laws in place that govern the dissemination of copy written material, and we don't need any more.  Forcing site owners to police the content of their communities' at the behest of copyright holder will only stem creativity and restrict freedom of expression.  Big copyright holders have pockets deep enough to police the use of their own content.  They should adjust their business practices to encourage purchase, and not work to further punish their customers.  Let the free market determine who will win, not the legal system.

{"body":"I agree that copyrights are important.  I don't pirate media.  I know a lot of people on Reddit try to explain why piracy is okay, but I just don't think it's fair to artists.		The problem with this bill is that it goes after search engines and social media sites like Reddit.  If someone comes along and posts a link to pirated material on Reddit, then Reddit becomes responsible; not just the site hosting the content or the user who uploaded it.  This is completely unreasonable.  How many posts or comments does Reddit get per day?  At least tens of thousands; and perhaps even hundreds of thousands.  Search engines index billions of links.  It's completely unreasonable to hold them responsible if a single link hosts copyrighted material.		Nothing will ever stop piracy anyway.  The best you can do is make your content easily accessible so people won't feel a need to pirate.  Netflix and Steam figured this out.  By providing easy access to content at reasonable prices, they've pleased a lot of people.		Meanwhile big media has been forcing DRM down people's throats.  It's ironic though because it doesn't stop piracy since the DRM scheme is always broken.  It only causes headaches for legitimate customers.  The result is that it makes piracy more tempting.  I don't want to sit through 15 minutes of unskippable content on a movie I purchased.  So that tempts me to pirate.  Netflix and Steam have the right business model.		> “One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. It’s a service issue.  The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work.

She only gets a few hits, gets called out by two trolls, essentially doesn't earn anything from it. Unfortunately the record company sees it and decides that the use of the song as background music infringes on the copyright. 		In the past, all Youtube has to do is to take down that video; the worst that can happen is that girl's account gets banned or something.		If the law is passed, not only will the girl have to face legal action, but Youtube in entirety would be forced to shut down - including all the big chunks of it that's made of original content - all because of a video that no one really watched.

{"body":"You know what? Fuck it. I doubt this comment will even get *seen* let alone downvoted, but here goes anyway.		This isn't about censorship, or free speech, this is about the privileged majority being able to oppress a minority and government taking steps to stop that, and the privileged campaigning against having some of their unfair privileges taken away from them.		What do I mean? I mean the fact that getting pirated shit has become so easy recently, and we like getting shit for free, and then we come up with nonsense to back up why just taking shit for free is somehow a good thing, and that people trying to stop us are the bad guy and are oppressing us, even though it's just about GETTING SHIT WE DON'T NEED THAT COSTS MONEY TO MAKE, FOR FREE. 		Well boo fucking hoo. Your casual attitude towards piracy made this happen. Guess what? You aren't going to be able to get whatever the fuck you want for nothing any more, because the people who make it are daring to be so 'greedy' as to ask for money in exchange for it. If you don't like something - fine, you don't have to pay for it, you don't have to have it. But if you want something, and the person who made it wants something in return then GIVE them that thing in return or DON'T HAVE IT.		Not being to get access to entertainment for free instead of paying for it IS NOT CENSORSHIP. People in oppressive regimes worldwide are being imprisoned, tortured and killed because they want to talk about things their government doesn't want them to, not because they want the new series of House right now and without advertisements for free. From all those truly oppressed people around the world: FUCK YOU.		There are far more important things in the world than you being able to get shit you want for free you selfish little fucking babies - example: EVERYTHING ELSE.

{"body":"Two things. First rights come from one another. People are ceasing to respect copyright holder's claims, thus their rights are fading. It is in human nature to share and want to be entertained. They are trying to impose their values on everyone else. If copyright was for a sane duration (e.g. 14 years), it wouldn't be quite so bad.		I used to pirate music, now I buy it because it's easier and better and the price point is reasonable. I still pirate TV shows, but I pay for cable anyways, so they're not losing anything, and the price point for TV shows is too high.		Feelings on piracy aside, eliminating the safe harbor provision is very dangerous. I understand that there are sites which only exist to share such materials, but I can easily see cases where someone doesn't like what a site is saying and posts a link to copyrighted material to have them shut down. I don't trust the federal government with a potato gun, let alone power to seize domain names, shut down ISPs and payment processors.		Perhaps its time to stop fighting technology and many people's desires and figure out a sane copyright system. Prior to the [Statute of Anne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne) there wasn't really a copyright system. Granted, things were quite different then, and copyright may have been a good idea. With fairly ubiquitous internet and ease of communication and replication, it might not be a bad idea to question whether things are different now than they were just two decades ago. There is a strong possibility of [assurance contracts](http://www.thepoint.com/) and multi-benefactors for artists (which would kind of take things full circle in a way).","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jdkeith","name":"t1_c308qat","parent_id":"t1_c307ref","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321487261,"created_utc":1321458461}

The bill completely ignores the idea that piracy can be dealt with without the use of censorship.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Greyletter","name":"t1_c30s94v","parent_id":"t1_c30gh90","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321637402,"created_utc":1321608602}
{"body":"I should get the most misunderstood redditor of the year award.		I don't support this legislation. Not one bit. It's ridiculous in every way. 		I also don't support people who feel entitled to steal other people's work. 		And I think we're pretty much on the same page. I'm fine with copyright holders protecting their IP but not at the cost of freedom of speech. And just for clarification, I don't think this bill does that in any way. This bill would be the beginning of the US Government censoring anything they don't want people reading.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_c30utyp","parent_id":"t1_c30s94v","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1321665949,"created_utc":1321637149}
