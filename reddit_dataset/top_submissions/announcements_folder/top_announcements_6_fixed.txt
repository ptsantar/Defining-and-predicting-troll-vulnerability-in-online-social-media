I'd like to see a list of things that my friends enjoyed (perhaps by their upvotes) as well as places they commented.		3. Personal Tags -- While I already RES-tag certain people with "Fuckwit -- Argues for the sake of Arguing" and so on, I'd like to be able to see comments that are considered "Funny", or "Clever", or "Informative", and so on. 		4. Please let us tag stories with "Misinformation" and "Deceptive Clickbait Bullshit", then you guys (in the background) increase the amount of upvotes the serving domains require before the story gets front-paged. For example, if Gawker gets the reputation for serving up inaccurate bullshit, maybe they need 10 upvotes to equal 1.

{"body":"Seriously, though, I don't think I would want to work at reddit.		Early on, the running gag around here was "there are only five people on reddit: you [i.e. the person on the receiving end of the gag] and four others with a bunch of alts", but as far as I understand it had a basis in truth. In an effort to set the culture on reddit, the founders supposedly created a lot of alts to set some behavioral norms for commenters with the intent of making reddit a nicer place to be.		Now, that's kind of falling apart. The user to admin ratio is so high that it's not possible to set social norms that way, and admins are resorting to banning users and subreddits to get a handle on the culture. The problem is that controlling people by amping up their fear of being ejected from their community has side effects that simply modeling good behavior doesn't, and I have to wonder whether the side effects of that (unfortunately unavoidable) shift in strategy are going to cause more problems down the road.		On a different level, there has to be some kind of conflict between the need to make reddit profitable and the need to make reddit a nice place to hang out. One requires reddit to manage users as numbers and statistics while the other requires reddit to interact with users as human beings. Working in education, I'm very familiar with this conflict as my school struggles to find the balance between providing students with a high quality education that respects their dignity as diverse learners while also "making the numbers".		So far, I don't have any magic solutions to that problem. It's not that I'm afraid of a challenge--it's that I like reddit, and I think it needs and deserves a staff who can grapple skillfully with that dichotomy in every position, from community manager to backend gremlin. The person coding up the mod tools can't just take a spec sheet from the mods and implement it as written. He or she has to understand how the mods feel and why they feel that way, and has to have a good grip on what effective subreddit moderation looks like, along with the natural, human behavioral traps that mods can fall into, leading them to engage in behaviors that draw the criticism of their users.		Also, I would spend all of my time in the kitchen.","depth":6,"score":26,"ups":26,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goatcoat","name":"t1_cua66k3","parent_id":"t1_cua4r8p","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1440148604,"created_utc":1440119804}

For all I know, the apology was sincere, because I have no reason to believe otherwise.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jeanpuetz","name":"t1_cuaulmn","parent_id":"t1_cuap0nt","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1440205552,"created_utc":1440176752}
{"body":">You don't know that. Why does everyone keep saying that? Nobody knows why Victoria was laid off except for herself and the reddit team, and it could have happened for a whole number of reasons.		While it's true we have no way to know for sure there was no "good reason", the flip side is that we know of no reason she *should* have been fired. To the best of our knowledge, she was doing an exemplary job. Sure if there were parts of her job description that didn't involve interaction with the public we wouldn't know about them, but for the parts that did, she was excelling at them as far as outside observers were concerned. 		Beyond that, when you fire someone for a good reason, you typically have someone ready to take over their responsibilities. Or a plan in place to get a replacement. Or plans to stop doing the things that they'd done for you. Or at least a solid grasp of what the fuck it is they do for your company. Reddit very clearly had none of those. They were left asking the IAmA mods "So what was it that Victoria did for you guys?" and scrambling to dig through her email for answers to questions the mods needed answered simply to keep the subreddit running. 		Since they were that ignorant of what Victoria did, the number of possible "good reasons" for firing her shrinks substantially. Most of the reasons that are left involve disagreements between the employee and management. And most of the possible sources of disagreement, are likely to be the management wanting things the users would likely object to. Or management attempting to add responsibilities incompatible with her current duties. 		In short everyone keeps saying she was fired for no good reason, because if we did know the reason, odds are fairly good we would disagree substantially with the reason. 		As for why so cynical, Reddit's burned quite a bit of good will in recent times. Lots of going back on old promises and positions, as well as promises not kept. It makes it quite a bit easier to be cynical when debacles like Victoria's firing are going on.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChronoDeus","name":"t1_cub0nmm","parent_id":"t1_cuaulmn","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1440214513,"created_utc":1440185713}

{"body":">  I'd love to hear what you'd like it to be in your wildest bestest dreams.		Okay... for starters how about "subbed:yes" or "subreddit:subbed" or something, meaning: search in the freaking subreddits I'm subscribed to. 99% of the time, when I search for something, I'm trying to find a post again that I saw recently because I want to share it with someone else. If I saw it recently, that means I was subbed to that subreddit (setting aside corner cases, like /r/bestof). But I might not know *which* sub. For certain topics, there's clearly only one or two subs. But for other topics, there are quite a few subs (did I see that on /r/Cprog, /r/C_programming, /r/coding, /r/ProgrammerHumor, /r/SoftwareDevelopment... ?). But, one of my subs. Not /r/randomshitidontread. I want to be able to exclude those results. I can't.		Also, how about "shit that got a lot of upvotes"? Maybe something like "upvotes:500" to filter for posts that got at least that many upvotes. That post that got buried in the "sorted by new" stuff and deleted shortly thereafter probably isn't the one I'm looking for. The thing that made it to the front page, or close, probably is.		Also... are we seriously sending people to the [UNIX Epoch converter website](http://www.epochconverter.com) in order to pick date ranges for filters? Seriously? Would it kill someone to find a freeware date picker/calendar widget on GitHub to swipe and use? I mean... my bank web site can use one of those...		Now: let's talk lexical analysis, tokenizing and indexing. **STOP. BREAKING. WORDS. ON. PUNCTUATION.** Also, stop "stemming" words and only indexing on the broken up bits and pieces of words.		I know exactly why you do that. It "normalizes" things a bit. It makes searching computationally more efficient. Blah, blah, blah. Map-reduce, Lucene, probabably freakin' ElasticSearch on the backend. Don't get me started. If I search for "dogs" (using an example from the FAQ search) and you find me a post with "dog" (no "s") in the title: **that's *not* what I searched for**. I know Google does the same shit. I'm not trying to argue that you're doing worse than others (at the moment, you are though). Efficiency improvements *in the algorithm* are to be lauded, so long as they deliver the same or acceptably equivalent results. When they start delivering *different* results, they are a defect. Your FAQ currently includes this item:		> Bug: When searching for a word that includes a symbol, it will 	> get split into multiple words without the symbol. As a result, 	> there may be many extraneous search results returned.		Yup. Bug. If I search for something very specific and rare because I happen to remember the exact post title, and then you tokenize and stem the damn query until it matches half the database... I get 1,000 results, and don't even look at them. I give up. Stop it. Feel free to have a "Shitty fast search" option and a "actually the thing I typed" search. I recognize that the latter will be slower. I know it uses more CPU. Do it anyway. It ain't exactly an NP-complete problem.		/rant.

Have you ever tried searching a YouTube video and then being unable to find it?

Currently, that URL has no results, even though that video is one of the most highly viewed on YouTube. Why? Because of that `feature=player_detailpage` argument. It doesn't actually make any difference in YouTube's case, but Reddit sees them as different links. However, the `v=oHg5SJYRHA0` *is* important as it defines the video to watch. How can reddit tell the difference?		Now let's consider a thread on a forum, such as http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=100&t=4868 . ([**search for this**](https://np.reddit.com/submit?url=http:%2F%2Fforum.lessthandot.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ff%3D100%26t%3D4868)). In this case, the post you're linking to is *defined* by its arguments, much like YouTube. If you changed the arguments, you'd get a different post. Should reddit automatically list every single post on this site that's been linked to on reddit?

If you order your results, you can assume that the 21st result is the result that would have come right after the last result you had before. So when you go the next page, you get the next 20 or so results after the first 20, so results 20-40 and just continue adding more to your offset.		Anyway, reddit seems to use two separate search systems, Amazon Cloud Search and Apache Solr. I'm not sure which is actually used for the search function but I'm guessing it's Cloud Search because of their advanced search features (it's in Amazon Cloud Search syntax). Both of them have pagination capabilities (though Cloud Search only allows for up to the first 10,000 hits before getting a little more complex). Looking at reddit's code for Cloud Search, they have pagination implemented, which means it's probably just a matter of changing the web page (assuming they haven't removed any other code and they didn't remove it because of some technical limitation).

It does, in fact, support *all* of those things.  Just requires a bit of tinkering to get the syntax.  Start off on the [advanced search wiki](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search), especially [cloudsearch syntax](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_cloudsearch_syntax).		Your first query is just [`bacon NOT Narwhal`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=bacon+NOT+Narwhal) and just uses [boolean operators](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_boolean_operators).		The second one is a bit more of a pain, since dates require cloudsearch.  To use cloudsearch syntax, you need to first enter your query, and then add `&syntax=cloudsearch` to the end of the URL (you'll need to re-add it each time you change your query too, though I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/pull/1335) to change that).  For the date, get a [unix timestamp](http://www.epochconverter.com/) (in your case, `1412899200`).  Then also get the one for now (or use a really big number).  So you end up with [`(and timestamp:1412899200..1440135081)`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=%28and+timestamp%3A1412899200..1440135081%29&restrict_sr=&sort=relevance&t=all&syntax=cloudsearch).  Then, for the subreddit, you need to use `or` with different options: [`(or subreddit:'conspiracy' subreddit:'nottheonion' subreddit:'SecretSubreddit' subreddit:'news')`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=%28or+subreddit%3A%27conspiracy%27+subreddit%3A%27nottheonion%27+subreddit%3A%27SecretSubreddit%27+subreddit%3A%27news%27%29&restrict_sr=&sort=relevance&t=all&syntax=cloudsearch).  For the last part, it's the same type of thing.  [`(or title:'lizard people' selftext:'lizard people')`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=%28or+title%3A%27lizard+people%27+selftext%3A%27lizard+people%27%29&restrict_sr=&sort=relevance&t=all&syntax=cloudsearch) ^(although due to the absence of a phrase search, that actually is only searching for both the words `lizard` and `people` in the post.)  		Combine it all together, and you get this: [`(and timestamp:1412899200..1440135081 (or subreddit:'conspiracy' subreddit:'nottheonion' subreddit:'SecretSubreddit' subreddit:'news') (or title:'lizard people' selftext:'lizard people'))`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=%28and+timestamp%3A1412899200..1440135081+%28or+subreddit%3A%27conspiracy%27+subreddit%3A%27nottheonion%27+subreddit%3A%27SecretSubreddit%27+subreddit%3A%27news%27%29+%28or+title%3A%27lizard+people%27+selftext%3A%27lizard+people%27%29%29&restrict_sr=&sort=relevance&t=all&syntax=cloudsearch).  Nowhere near easy to make, but it does the search.		Also, it is quite possible to add additional keywords -- they'd just need to edit [common.py](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/providers/search/common.py).

This is the type of stuff that Reddit is currently being most accused of censorship for. Please note the comment karma /u/spez ~~gained~~ *lost* as a result of his stance, and how it compares to other comments made at roughly the same time.		To put it bluntly, Reddit at large strongly disagrees with /u/spez on this matter, and [Reddit's own rules] are weirdly hidden and oddly worded - as if on purpose in order to 'trap' people into breaking them.		If indeed you have any place in policy, especially in making sure decisions are made more consistently, I - and many others - would greatly appreciate it if you would take a look at this and... Well, do *something*. Whether you simply give us some feedback, or you outright get the affected communities unbanned, or you go through and more consistently ban even more communities... I don't honestly care at this point.		I think the majority of people in these communities have moved over to Voat anyway. But what is causing uneasiness with people outside these communities, is the slippery slope that Reddit's administration appears to be sliding down.		Being the brother of /u/MrWeiner gives me hope that you will look at the issue from both sides, as your brother has not really shied away from sexual topics in his comics.

It may not be the *near-term* future of *all* manufacturing, but it likely *is* the *far-term future*. And in-between now and then, there will be a whole gradient of transition. And that transition has already begun - meaning that some things already are *far* "better" to print (for a host of reasons) than they are to produce using traditional methods.		Invisalign is a perfect example b/c it shows the strengths of the tech & its *current* niche: Highly-customized parts, made of a low number of materials, which can be generated by a repeatable process mediated by technology/computer modeling - especially where higher prices can pay for the premium involved with ushering in a new tech.		That need for higher-priced products will drop as the printing tech and work-flow issues get ironed out. Process and material science advancements will significantly reduce the materials constraints.		In the future, as more high-capability 3D printers are distributed near population centers, one of the downsides of central fabrication, transportation needs, will likely become an larger differentiation than it is today. (automated transport will mitigate this to a small extent)		That leaves us with the main advantage being the realm of things that need to be highly customized. That is a *strong* advantage.

In "Game 1" YOU set the goalpost at "There is literally no thing 3d printed that would be better 3d printed than made other ways." You got shut-out in that game. 1-0. Mostly because you created a goalpost that was 1" off the ground, and 20 yards wide - but that's on you.

You've jumped around from talking about "consumer printers" (presumably focusing on FDM ?), to "industrial printers", to current abilities to speculation about future abilities. 		Hell, if that really HAD been all you'd said, I'd agree with you. At-home FDM-based 3D printers ARE rather limited right now, and there IS a lot of hype.

{"body":"(awesome admin answer below me here. collapse my megathread for best results.)		I can't speak for Reddit, but here's some tips I know from an experienced valley felon to a potential:		- Google will hire you, then fire you a quarter later when their background check team "catches up," even though they have the data in hand when they extend you the offer -- even if you disclose it repeatedly. Recruiter told me multiple times it wouldn't be a big deal, then I got fired a quarter into working there. Womp.	- Most places, including a couple household names at which I have worked, will talk to you about it and not care. I spoke with attorneys at Apple, for example, before joining. Facebook waved me off. It's a risk assessment.	- Your conviction is undiscoverable by a third party firm after 7 years (technically, they *are* allowed depending on your salary, but companies like HireRight do not go back more than 7 years in individual contributor cases). It sounds like you're either past that or coming up on it, so stop worrying and *stop checking the box*.	- If you know what you're doing, the felony won't hold you back at all. We have a talent shortage. There's a lot of mediocre people, but especially getting in pre-Series A you need to be good and hard-working. If you prove yourself as one of those, you will get a dozen recruiters hitting you up every week.		General advice:		- **Understand valley compensation before you get here.** Read up on ISOs, 4/1 cliffs, your tax liability, AMT, cap tables, dilution, and funding series. Learn to use CrunchBase and know valley financials. When you are negotiating with a Bay Area startup it is expected that you understand equity. If you demonstrate that you do not, you will get a nanopoint at $65 strike and they'll sell it to you as a "good deal." When I sit down with a company, based on public data and private sources I have a clear picture of what the company is worth and I know what to ask. When you start asking questions like "how deep is the cap table?" or "is Greylock going to get a board seat out of the Series B next month?" recruiters will detect that you are Enlightened and level with you, because they'll realize they're unlikely to get you cheaper than you're worth. Don't be afraid to offer to give back equity in return for more base if you are not sold on the health of the company.	- Yes, this all sounds slimy and terrible. Welcome to the valley. Absolutely maintain your integrity. Respect your NDA. Don't run off to /r/apple and talk. Your integrity is the one thing you have, and people value it. Apple employs several dozen ex-government people in Global Security, and they will identify you. Once you're marked as a leaker, you will never work again. I've seen four people fail this way, with varying degrees of intent.	- Don't tell off recruiters. They're hard workers too and yes, sourcing spam sucks, but they talk. If you flip out on a recruiter it *will* get around. (I've seen it happen.) Make it plain that you understand the deal, though. They'll say they're on your side and want to get you the best possible deal. That's baloney. You know it, they know it. Act accordingly and protect your self-interest. Half the valley is underpaid.	- Almost nobody (except 18F and the USDS) drug tests in the Bay Area. I haven't been drug tested since 2007. If the Bay Area started drug testing, 60% of the workforce would be unemployable. I have smoked pot at more than one startup. I heard stories out of Twitter that Snoop lit everyone up when he was there.	- Lastly, watch *Silicon Valley*. It is a documentary disguised as comedy.		Be chill, man, come get some sun and burritos, buy a Jeep, start pulling six figures and hate your commute.		Edit: Feel free to PM me if you want cat facts. I wish I knew some of what I told you when I started.

{"body":"Not at all. I'm an SRE. Google pioneered the term and it has vast differences company-to-company, but think of it as "devops" with more focus on software engineering and architecture. [One of Google's really solid SREs, apw, has a good discussion on it here.](http://googleforstudents.blogspot.com/2012/06/site-reliability-engineers-worlds-most.html) At most companies, engineers will toss a system over the wall at operations and say "go run this, have fun on-call." SREs, OTOH, are involved early on in design and, at companies that build the organization correctly, have the power to say no to engineers in the pursuit of reliability.		I got started by chance at a non-valley shop doing what I now know to be SRE without realizing it, and I used that experience to get in at a late-stage social network here. From there, it becomes a matter of who you know.		I do not have a degree. There isn't really a degree in what I do; compsci or, to a lesser extent, compeng comes close, but half of operations is practical that you pick up on the job. There's two halves to the valley: there's the peninsula, where Google and Apple and Facebook live, who will court you straight out of college, then there's the city, where you really need to know people to play the successful startup game. I know if you're in college now hearing "it's who you know" can be demoralizing, but it can be a big part. A degree is your ticket to intern and get started entry-level in the peninsula, which is a super good path to valley success.		---		As an aside, I actually hate the term "devops" because it's an example of operations being marginalized by companies who think "why do we need operators? we'll just train the engineers to go on-call," which isn't really the right thing to do.

{"body":"The reason you're hearing advice to buy them now is tax-related. You have to hold for a year to get a better tax outcome from the IRS upon a liquidity event, so the general advice is to get them as soon as you can to sit out that year-long period. If you don't have a secondary market available to you, buying them just gives you equity without an avenue to sell it. The option is a contract to buy so often, the only considerations on *when* to buy are the tax landscape, leaving the company, and impending liquidity events like acquisitions.		Just based on your comment alone, it doesn't sound like you're too on board with the health of the company. Check your grant for expiration terms. Usually, it's really quickly after you leave (but there is growing momentum to change this to several years, notably at /u/Mart2d2's last haunt). If you understand the tax landscape, it's okay to ride them out for a bit without purchasing. Consult a financial advisor, for sure.		General advice on IPOs: after the '90s collapse, when IPO times had dropped to an average of 4 years, VCs now encourage startups to really take their time. The average is north of a decade now, and very, very, very few companies successfully IPO any more.

{"body":"Oh man. They got another one fooled 😕		Don't believe the marketing. Oracle has far less penetration in the large companies than they'd have you believe (and even where they do have Oracle, it's not necessarily anywhere near anything that needs to scale, and more likely around various enterprise solutions that require it). 		Let's be clear here: Oracle exists to sell expensive support contracts and licenses. That it's a decent database server is just a useful side effect. You only have to look to their deliberately obtuse error messages and overly complicated tooling to see this. (plus actually start dealing with them in any fashion).  It's amazing how almost every other relational database manages to be clear and concise, but Oracle isn't. Their licensing model also *really* bites you as traffic levels go up. To an insane extent, and often at the time when you need it the most. MS SQL doesn't seem to suffer from that to the same extent, but likewise isn't important for scaling.		It's worth noting that you're making some interesting assumptions that the DB layer is the bottleneck. Reddit has a whole bunch of smart people working for them on the tech side. Something as simple as the DB layer not scaling is almost certainly *not* the problem, or at least not in any fashion that replacing with Oracle would solve.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Twirrim","name":"t1_cuae16m","parent_id":"t1_cua4zfi","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1440165570,"created_utc":1440136770}

Also never buy a lenovo computer unless you love exploitable, unremovable, security holes, more of which are found every so often, which allow a hacker to MitM you and steal HTTPS data, like talking to your bank, or unremovable software that reinstalls itself from the bios after a clean reformat from a disc.		Please don't send me links to "oh lenovo said it's all fine now here's a fix", that shit should never have happened in the first place and should be ample evidence for you to lose all trust in them, especially when there are at least like 3 other brands that don't think it's a great idea to inject ads into your browsers.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goedegeit","name":"t1_cuajwba","parent_id":"t1_cuabdb0","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1440186975,"created_utc":1440158175}

Did you Google the fix? What browser were you in? Are you on any social networks?		You can't avoid people mining your data any longer, it is impossible. 		I agree with you that it sucks about the lenovo situation, not because of privacy issues but because of the potential security and stability implications of their shitty software. Luckily we can buy signature edition computers from the Microsoft store, or buy non-lenovo systems elsewhere. 		Unfortunately I suspect now that Microsoft has made it possible to include executables in uefi and have them run no matter what a lot of manufacturers are going to be following lenovo's lead. The potential anti-theft uses bring to mind Apple's recent iPhone anti-theft successes, and that is pretty exciting, but of course companies are going to use it to advertise and be shitheads. 		I am confident that we will find a way to disable it, as we always do, or at least automatically mitigate the potential negative implications somehow. Either that or someone will write an exploit that depends on that software that will be so bad they will be forced to disable it entirely. 		I'd like to think that competition in the market will reward those companies that choose not to be baddies, and I guess it is possible because the muggles who buy the most computers are avid news consumers. Frequently I am approached by normal people with very strong opinions about things they know nothing about like windows 8, or Lenovo, who have gotten their information entirely from traditional news. 		We sure as hell can't depend on them to form an informed opinion based or negative user experience caused by this shitty behaviour, because these are the people who buy a laptop and start using it fresh out of the box without moving the preinstalled garbage to begin with.

Labelling people who want to post their own original material as 'spammers' while people who mindlessly repost GIFs as 'valuable' Redactors, is just insane. Reddit is a site that hosts material. That material has to come from somewhere. What does it matter who actually posts it? I've had a previous account blocked/closed for posting mostly my own material, and am amazed it hasn't happened again, tbh. I try to comment as much as possible, but that leads me onto my next point...		2. POWER. I am really sick of the dynamic that allows people to crush discussion of a subject by down voting it so that it eventually disappears. Discussions thrive on different opinions and the circle-jerk defence against people with differing views that want to wade in is just appalling. If they don't like what I write in a post or comment, fine, that's their choice, but it's crazy that they have the power to stop other people from reading it. I'm not approaching this from an entitlement perspective ("I have the right to be heard", that sort of crap), but censorship does absolutely no one any good at all.

{"body":"As a CTO of a failing company, that is over-valued and has no viable business model, shouldn't you be doing something more substantial than trying to make low-effort nerd/social outcast humor for karma to boost your ego on your paid time under the guise of interfacing with the Reddit community?  Bloomberg ran this excoriating article about your clueless company:   	[Reddit: A Nine-Year Case Study in Absentee Management](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-08-19/the-world-s-biggest-pet-store-has-250-000-animals)		>...		>... Condé Nast’s original policy of noninterference allowed Reddit to flourish early on, but it also let major problems fester. The company declined to share any current financial data. In 2013 it published a chart tracking expenses vs. revenue—with the specific numbers removed “to thwart would-be Wall Street analysts”—which showed that while revenue had increased over the past year, the business was still losing money.		>...		>A former Condé Nast executive says that, in retrospect, one flaw with the company’s hands-off approach was an assumption that Reddit’s founders would know when and how to ask for help. They didn’t. Prior to joining Condé Nast, neither Ohanian nor Huffman had significant experience working inside a large company. Looking back, says the former Condé executive, more hand-holding would have been a good idea.		>...		>As for Reddit’s new backers, they seem inclined for now to follow Condé Nast’s example. “We ask that the company make enough money to break even, with plus or minus $5 or $10 million a year,” says Altman, the Reddit investor. “Monetization is not a big focus. The company has a lot of cash in the bank.”		>The focus for now, he says, is product development and community growth. “Once we’ve figured out better moderation tools and better policies, and once we have a billion users and a robust mobile offering, then we’ll sit down and talk about monetization,” he says. “But now is not the time to talk about it.”		If the corporate board of my employer were making nerdy jokes like posting pictures of themselves drinking a hamburger from a straw and posting the type of stupid fluff you are now for the type of ditsy audience that mindlessly consumes /r/aww and /r/pics, while they had no idea how to develop a viable business strategy, I would not be able to feel secure in my job, or my position in the world.
