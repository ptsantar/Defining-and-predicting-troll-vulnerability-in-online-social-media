{"body":"Alright. I'm at about comment #1000+ and I doubt anyone shall read this, but.. who knows. I'll put a bit of time into it.. because I care. Seriously.		Very quickly: I came from Digg.com to Reddit not too long ago. This place is amazing. The variety and the community *make* this place. So here's a few thoughts that deserve feedback, if you have the time. I am interested in keeping this place alive.		1. You are open source. Have you reached out to the talented thousands that could help you out? They are there, they are willing. Have you requested? The community here helps each other, why not Mother Reddit?		2. You have a limited staff, you say you fall behind your promising fixes because of maintenance... This is odd for me. It connects a little with #1, laterally. I think that if you said hold on, shut the site down for a month to investigate, repair, and so on and had a separate location for things such as donating, then you could gain your footing again. Check this out: You have that decoy page, if you will, filled with ads, and equipped with a donate button. Guess how many people would either set that as their homepage, donate a few bucks, or both? I would. I just got here and I can appreciate this place.		3. I'm sure we've all seen it, but what is this? [digg vs. reddit google search graph](http://www.google.com/trends?q=reddit,+digg) ... Reddit is on the rise. Digg is doing it wrong. Can't you, seriously, put together an incredible proposal to those with money and spell out your problem? This is the future of the internet. This type of aggregation-behemoth... which brings me to 4 --		4. If you're 'on the rise' and you can manage a few additional ads, a subscriber system, an easily accessible donation system, (or even a subscription system that is simply a monthly donation, where no additional privileges are given [example: 50 cents a month]) and become more efficient with use of the power of open source... I don't see where you couldn't turn a profit without ruining your site.		Just my input....		Dear 3 people that will read this. Where do you agree? Where am I wrong? a/s/l?","depth":0,"score":135,"ups":135,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jooze","name":"t1_c0twpae","parent_id":"t3_cnth8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1278741266,"created_utc":1278712466}

They also get to suggest and vote on suggestions and complain about the implementations, which you do your best to implement/correct. Then slowly you trickle these additions down to the freebie accounts. It's almost like a proprietary/paid system that over time (a few months? several months?) degrades to the public. The new and harder to implement features are offered to the payers and as they age, get released to the public.

Still in the end, you have to find a way for the site to profit, but it solves what I grok'd from the request on your blog.

{"body":"1.) [Yes, they have.](http://www.reddit.com/help/awards) (Open Sorcerer)		2.) Advertisers would shit a brick and drop them immediately if they said "Hey, we're going to eliminate our content from the internet for a month while we attempt something to possibly increase our pageviews.  No guarantees, but you'll be losing 280,000,000 page views during this month."		3.) Reddit could certainly start pulling some advertisers over from Digg, but that's going to be difficult, with Digg's track record for being a good place (from a business perspective) to advertise.  Obviously, right now, reddit's less profitable due to Digg's bigger numbers, and better advertising.  Basically, they need to get numbers.  Impressions, click-throughs, and time spent on a page are three metrics that advertisers are looking for.  All three are important.		4.) The problem is "managing the few additional ads".  Right now, Reddit seems to be pretty bone-dry on advertisers, unfortunately.  The Open Source thing is a great idea, I love it, and if I knew much more about programming, I'd be dedicating my time towards contributing to the site.		Reddit has an opportunity like no other sitting right here.  280,000,000 pageviews per month is nothing to balk at, and needs to be taken advantage of.

It’s something people *want* to buy, it’s a discrete product that doesn’t dilute or contaminate the product, and you can outsource it. You could have money rolling in by Monday. Actually, I think users would enthusiastically pre-register in the belief that you can and will make it work.		**LONGER TERM:**		My two cents is; you need to get a *very* clear and *very* honest list of the founders / principals’ values and aspirations.

I wish I had any constructive ideas except selling one product a day(woot style) or selling a reddit alien lollipop for $25.		But in any case, please do not give special benefits to Gold members, that in my opinion is a destructive tactic. 		So then, from a commercial standpoint, why would someone want to be a Gold Member........ 		Oh! and removing ads for Gold members is a good idea, but if I was a Gold member I would feel cheated, cos  reddits one of the very few sites where ads are this unobstructive.","depth":0,"score":36,"ups":36,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"redpig9","name":"t1_c0twfwv","parent_id":"t3_cnth8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1278736299,"created_utc":1278707499}

{"body":"Unfortunately, I think the problem comes down to adult content, and your tolerance of it. 		Let's do some math to see why this is the case. You guys have 280M page views. That's 280,000 CPM units, the unit advertising is purchased in. 		You have 4 engineers. Engineers fully loaded cost about $100-125K, so at top end we're looking at $500K + another $150K for server expense (10K/month seems pretty reasonable for outsourced hosting). So we're looking at $650K per year, or less than $60K/month. 		You have 280K units to sell every month to make a little more than $60K, so you have to just sell your ads for .22 cent CPM and you'd be profitable! This seems incredibly doable. 		Better yet, you currently only have ONE ad slot per page... most publisher sites have at least 3, and often 5. Add another 300x250 below the fold, then add a 728x90 at the footer. No one will notice or complain, and even if you make abysmal CPMs, you will make it to profitability. But you guys aren't doing that... and you're smart guys. 		Here's what I think is really happening, and what you're really struggling with-- most of the growth, and the bulk of the new PVs, must not be monetizable. You're drawing an enormous amount of adult traffic (jailbait, NSFW, gonewild, FUUUUUUU, etc) you don't really want, that can't have ads on it without resorting to friend finder/porn ads (which Conde probably doesn't want). Not to mention top tier advertisers are afraid of a site whose number one search term is 'jailbait'. 		So these adult reddits are now a core part of the community, and you can't kill them off without tanking traffic and severely undermining the community... but businesswise, they are only a cost center that makes your traffic look good, but doesn't let you scale revenue with growth. 		Beyond that, your audience disproportionately uses AdBlock, so your PVs and your ad impressions are wildly disproportionate. 		And finally, each user must probably churn 20-30PVs/day, which from an ad perspective is actually a really bad thing-- much better to have 20 people see an ad once per day, then one person see the same ad 20x. 		This is a tough situation guys-- you either kill off the adult stuff (or split it off to another entity) and increase your ad units, or you make a pay-as-you-go+subscription model that actually works. If you keep the adult stuff, you MUST find a way to make them pay disproportionately more for their upkeep. 		The final recommendation I'd have is that Conde + Reddit has never been a logical match. Conde should spin you guys back out to a Silicon Valley based investor that wants a top tier website with radical growth in its portfolio.

{"body":"I'd happily buy a gold subscription if it meant that you'd guarantee that I wouldn't have my IP logged or the like.  As I see it, if I'm willing to cover any costs I incur, Reddit doesn't need to cover them by selling IP addresses or other privacy-related things now or in the future.  Also, I'd rather have a hard guarantee that my name/financial information isn't going to be linked to my Reddit account and used for anything other than billing if I *do* buy this.		Also, I'd rather buy a yearly account, and would rather have the option to make it non-recurring.  I know that sales guys love forcing recurring payment, but I cancelled my (otherwise quite good) Consumer Reports subscription just because they disallow non-recurring payment.		Here's a couple of other things you could sell me:		* Some sort of computer-parseable protocol access.  For example, Google provides POP3 access to gmail.  I'd much rather use Reddit via emacs or another native client (the hell with these tiny little text fields, etc), but nobody wants to make something if they have to rely on screen-scraping.  Yeah, this kills the ability to sell ads, but if people are *paying* for their access anyway...		* The ability to create a personal profile (link to website, etc).  I wouldn't use it, but I'll bet a lot of people would.		* Select an icon to show up by the username?  Granted, I would expect to see gobs of penises, but showing icons could also be an option...		I know that this is not likely to provide an immediate return, but as a researchy thing -- it'd be nice if Reddit and other subscription sites could provide a signed certificate containing the total amount of money spent and a unique number associated with the account.		Why?		Because a hell of a lot of sites out there would greatly benefit from "expensive identifiers".  That is, if someone can just make up new identities, things like blacklisting don't work.  People can create spam.  Stuff like that.  Today, we try to use IPs (or maybe class C networks) as an expensive identifier -- if a website gets abuse coming from your class C, it gets banned.  That's not incredibly reliable, though.		What some places have done (like Metafilter, XBoxLive, etc) is to charge an entrance fee, to make the identifier you get "expensive".  In many cases, they don't need the money, but what they *do* need is the ability to make sure that you don't just make up new accounts.		You can do this by actually charging someone money, but then every single service that wants expensive identifiers has to charge.  But if someone can use certs from trusted sites like Reddit saying "this person is associated with this account and spent at least $X here", then I can get expensive identifiers without billing my userbase -- they're just purchasing stuff that they'd have already bought.  As a result, blacklisting works.  I can only play with people on, say, Quake servers if their client uploads a cert showing that they've spent enough total money on various services (Reddit, WoW, whatever, as long as they issue certs).  Those players don't need to spend money on anything that they wouldn't have purchased anyway *and* it means that we can finally ban problematic players without chasing them around IP ranges.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"crocodile32","name":"t1_c0tx42o","parent_id":"t3_cnth8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1278751275,"created_utc":1278722475}

Reddit has different types of advertising at play from what I can tell (traditional per-click and seemingly upfront fee). Without more information from their business side, it's hard to know what all their revenue streams are.		Even if Reddit's entire revenue stream were traditional per-click dollars from advertisers, it's not necessarily true that more traffic translates to more page-hits, especially as ad-blocking software becomes more sophisticated over the same chronological axis. Is the full nature of reddit's increased traffic well known? It could be a demographic less likely to click adds.		Beyond the revenue side of things, the cost side of things is not necessarily linear (I would suspect that reddit is at a point where costs increase exponentially because of network bottlenecking and whatever else). If costs are non-linear and infact increasing exponentially, profits can be falling with constant or even increasing revenue.

So just because revenue, goes up, doesnt mean they will actually be profitable. They could actually have negative profits because of the increase in reddit visits they suffer from, oh any hypothetical cost, like the amount of extra bandwidth they had to pay for was more than the increase in revenue from the ad impressions.		So what OP is saying is that revenue doubles, and not specifying whether or not reddit actually made any money, he is coming to the conclusion that they should be able to hire more staff.		But lets say reddit did make money, you still cant come to the conclusion that they should be able to hire more staff. I know we know they actually do need more staff, but what if they didnt? What if, they had an optimal amount of staff and another guy wouldnt be worth his pay even though he is a perfectly competent engineer? Should they still "double their staff?"		Or lets talk about other resources, so reddit makes a bunch of money, should they double their work space? Should they rent out another... whatever reddit is managed at? Should they buy buy twice as many donuts every month?

{"body":"No, I do NOT want reddit to turn into Something Awful's forums.  The parallels with search are bad enough.  Shitty performance, and not much action taken.  Do not charge for access to search, and do NOT do something stupid like making a "gold" account only capable of doing something essential on a social website like "private messaging."		Also, in order for that to inspire anyone to donate for that feature, they would have to actually build a working search engine.  That costs time and money, and increasing the spending of the site right now is probably a bad idea (considering the fact that they just started pan-handling).		I donated, but I do not want people to stop visiting simply because they cannot search.  Charging money for simple functions like registering an account, private messaging, and customizing your account are barriers for registration, and deterrents for people to register.  Reddit's number one goal right now should be to improve their marketing, and getting higher-paying advertisers.  They need to maximize the revenue per pageview, and to do that, they need more advertisers, and advertisers that pay more.","depth":1,"score":31,"ups":31,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"phuzion","name":"t1_c0twxgu","parent_id":"t1_c0twcel","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1278746468,"created_utc":1278717668}

At that point, an option is enabled in their user preferences panel to allow them to disable ads at their discretion, or leave them on.  After one year passes, the option is disabled, and the ads turn back on automatically.  Kind of like an upfront payment for your ad viewing for the year.		Obviously, people will still use adblock, but this will give them a "legitimate" way to do so.  The other benefit of this is the minuscule reduction of bandwidth consumed per pageview.  Bandwidth costs money, and if someone isn't viewing the ads, it's wasted money.  The only thing that Adblock does is decide not to pull the ad from the ad server, and fill its spot with blank space.  Unless the ad is served from reddit's server, there is virtually zero reduction in bandwidth (at least for reddit) when using adblock.  The real question after this gets implemented, is "Does the cost of the additional database query outweigh the cost savings of not serving the HTML for the ad?"

{"body":"Posted below but repeating here... what if reddit karma had worldly value in terms of using it to buy reddit-branded gear, but only for subscribers?  That way, none of the functionality is limited, but those who pay could then spend their karma getting free reddit gear.  1000 points could get you keychains and bumper stickers, 5000 for a tee shirt or mug, and maybe 20k for a jacket or laptop case?		That way, the users who love reddit so much that they'd like to own reddit gear can pay and get cool stuff in return, non-paying users aren't alienated by limited functionality, reddit gets free advertising from people displaying their reddit gear, and their core base of users pays to keep the site running?  		The only problem with that would be users creating multiple accounts to upmod themselves ad infinitum, but one would think a simple algorithm to look for that would suffice to prevent abuse and, in any case, only those who are paying would be able to cash it in and they're more likely to be courteous users anyhow.  Better yet, let only karma earned from other paying members count as tradeable karma, since that way only paying members' upvotes add to what another paying member can trade in for gear.  Also, link karma could be weighted to being equivalent to maybe 50 comment karma (or toss out comment karma entirely, or just give 1 tradeable karma point for every comment that has over 50 upvotes), since good links are more important than good comments.  (Self posts and relinks to other posts/comments obviously wouldn't count.)  Perhaps they could even allow for a reddit platinum where users earn double karma for paying twice as much for their subscription if they're REALLY anxious to have a reddit beach towel.  		Then, they could just set tradeable karma to zero for everyone the day they implement it (while keeping total earned karma separate).  The net result is they're not negatively impacting non-subscribers and they're giving redditholics something tangible in exchange for our subscriptions and submissions, all while spreading the reddit message of narwhal bacon liberty to all of mankind.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"repoman","name":"t1_c0txhs2","parent_id":"t1_c0twb1x","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1278762871,"created_utc":1278734071}

{"body":"Points to ponder from a "consumer" of reddit who also has academic background in behavioral economics.		- Leave the payment level entirely up to the user themselves, as well as the payment frequency.  Make it truly a donation, and not a payment for a service.  People really like to be altruistic.		- Keep track of the average size of a donation and display that figure on the donation page.  There have been a lot of psychology studies that have looked into maximizing charitable donations, and this is one way to do it.		- Keep the "perks" fairly small -- people who don't/can't donate shouldn't feel like they're missing out on major functionality; this again has to do with ensuring it's a donation and not payment for a service.  Our brains go to very, very different places socio-emotionally for those two categories.		- Seriously, really don't make a minimum value.  If I was being forced to pay a particular amount, I probably wouldn't pay more than $10.  With the amount left open to me, I donated $25.  I get a "warm glow" (seriously a real economics term) from making a larger donation, whereas I just get a "financial ack" from paying a larger amount of money.

You get 10 for your $10 donation, and at any time you can choose to put a star next to your comment; you can even put more than one if you'd like. Stars don't do anything to your post except exist, but add "starred" as a "sorted by" option, putting the comments with the most stars at the top. The default would, of course, still be "best" --- unless you want to put starred comments on top, they appear where they normally would by default.		The benefit of this is literally just that you can let people know that you were willing to pay to let them know that; the most common use I can foresee is if you feel you have an important contribution to a thread with a large number of comments. For instance, someone posts a cool picture and you realize 10 hours later that it's most definitely shopped, or you realize that a popular IAMA is fake, or for whatever reason you have an important comment but you doubt it will get noticed.

But if I get something physical I CAN hold in my hand or look at on my wall as well as a subscription I really think it would be a deal breaker, I really do think you'd get a greater take up doing that.

I'm slightly worried that this will lead down a slippery slope to generate more revenue at the expense of Reddit's subscribers.

I believe information should be free to the masses.		On the other hand, I understand that money is needed to keep the lights on and would gladly support this site. Reddit has become my go to site for current events and new discoveries. It's convenient, easy to use, simple, and almost always has intriguing information regarding topics that interest me. Additionally, most comments are informative, perceptive, or, at least, funny and enjoyable to read. It's a true rarity to find such a one-stop shop anywhere.

So rather than a giant subscription sign-up-fest, I'd suggest that Reddit allow a certain number of subscriptions per year. Say, 2% of their active user base. You'd have to be a user for at least one year; no other restrictions, karma or otherwise. (Mainly because I love Reddit, I check it for news every day, but my link karma is crap.) 		However you want to distribute them, do. Maybe a random drawing for the vast majority, with a hundred or so going up for auction, to diminish the black market. You get the chance to subscribe, your existing account goes gold. No transferring, or anything. Again, to lower the incentives for people fucking with the system. 		That way the bean counters don't get all psyched at once and expect one time revenue every year, and a Reddit subscription stays something cool. 		Most social networks fail at some point.

{"body":"Rooster Teeth charges $5 for 6 months of being a subscriber. It's extremely reasonable. There's pretty much nothing you guys can offer for something like $10 a month. Go low, take what you can get, and consider subscriptions lasting several months. $5 for 3-6 months adds up quickly, and would help immensely. Go for quantity, and hope it works out. If you find it's not bringing in enough, up the price by a dollar or two for the next billing cycle.		As far as features go, how about optional themes? The Reddit color scheme is excellent, but perhaps adding some customization wouldn't hurt. Instead of letting people alter everything, just pre-package some themes people can use and switch between. There's not much else you can do with Reddit other than more customization. Just remember to never take stuff from free users and restrict it to Reddit Gold accounts.		That's pretty much all I have to say on the subject. Perhaps offer some more ad space. I've always been a fan of the bottom of the page ads, since they're relatively unintrusive. Consider selling space along the top bar on the home page for a premium price, and try to be sure it's not all ads all the time. Just static ads. You'll need to make sure the Reddit Alien and all the buttons are capable looking fine with different backgrounds. Basically, just stick a static image in there for a high price.		Oh, and make a post explaining how to disable AdBlock for just reddit.com and hope people realize how easy it is and do so when you ask.

One thing I've noticed about gmail is that the ads you see (or not see) are really unobtrusive, and because they're so well focussed on your interests, they're not annoying.  For example, if I'm planning a holiday to Spain, then an advert for Spanish villas doesn't annoy me one bit, and might be helpful.		What I would hate is trawling through reddit reading stories that look like they've been submitted by users but are actually just shilling some company's products.

{"body":"I think this is a really interesting conundrum. With 280 million pageviews/month, there's got to be some way bring in a very decent amount of money without harming the user experience.		I used to own/run a site that got 10 million pageviews/month and faced financial issues as well. So on a smaller scale (1/28th of the size of Reddit), I've been here myself.		I think we should all be appreciative to the Reddit people for sticking to their guns on showing a minimal number of ads. I've also noticed that they show a lot of house ads in their one banner ad slot which means for unsold inventory they are choosing a better user experience over crappy ad networks which are riddled with "lose belly fat" ads, etc. This is really admirable of Reddit. (And also helps keep users loyal and invested and coming back to the site which is a great business decision.)		My suggestion would be this... Add more banner ads to the right hand side bar, make them cheap, and sell them to the readers of Reddit.		Reddit seems to show two ads per page. One sponsored link at the top and one medium rectangle sized banner ad (300px x 250px) in the right-hand side bar. I think they could easily show more medium rectangle sized banner ads in the right-hand side bar without harming the user experience.		Now, the question arises as to *what kinds* of of additional ads to show in the sidebar.		1. The Reddit people seem to be avoiding bottom-of-the-barrel ad network ads and I applaud this and I think they should continue to avoid this. I've seen these kind of ads singlehandedly ruin websites.		2. There could be sales people knocking on the doors of deep-pocketed companies (and maybe this is happening already) but I imagine those companies want more than just a banner ad these days. They probably want larger ad sizes and expandables and integrated campaigns , etc etc. Not sure if the community would react well to this or not.		3. Here's the idea I'd suggest: Add more medium rectangle sized banner ads in the side bar, make them affordable, sell them to the readers! Here's the full explanation...		Add more of those medium rectangle sized banner ads and make them self-service and relatively low-priced so that the readers of the site themselves could buy them to promote their own blogs, video games, bands, self-published books, etc. Reddit could accept or reject the ads on whatever basis they want. They could even stipulate that no ads can be animated. 300px x 250px is plenty of space to make an interesting ad that doesn't animate.		Here's some math on how this could work. Lets say Reddit showed a stack of 5 of those medium rectangle sized ads  in the side bar of every page. And let's say they charged $0.20 CPM for those ads (which is really cheap) and allowed people to spend as little as $20 at a time. That would get Reddit $1.00 CPM in total for that group of 5 ads ($0.20 CPM x 5 ads on each page). $1.00 CPM means the website gets $1.00 per 1000 impressions.		So if Reddit gets 280 million pageviews per month and can consistently make $1.00 CPM, that's $280,000 per month. (280 million / 1000 * $1.00)		And if they offered a few features in this self-service banner advertising option such as being able to choose preferred sub-reddits and maybe geo-targeting as well, this would make it really effective for the people buying the ads.		tl;dr; Add more banner ads to the right hand side bar. Make them cheap and sell them to the readers of Reddit. Make $280,000/month doing this.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"adorablogger","name":"t1_c0tzsct","parent_id":"t3_cnth8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1278848807,"created_utc":1278820007}
