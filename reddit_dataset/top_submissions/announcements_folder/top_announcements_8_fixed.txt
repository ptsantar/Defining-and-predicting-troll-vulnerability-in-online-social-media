{"body":"It's strange.  The concept of removing the 'if' sounds a little worrying - the idea that anyone can make an account, and start marking regular content as spam/vice versa just doesn't *sound* safe.  At the same time, I suppose that the sheer number of users would outweigh the number of shill accounts.		I suppose it's a question of the user:content ratio - a high figure will mean we can let multiple people see an article, and go with the majority after x amount of time.  9 out of ten people say it's not spam, it's not spam, and so on.  A low number, though, could result in one douchenozzle seeing it, voting it ok, and it being entered into the main rotation (where, of course, it'll get downvoted into oblivion anyway, in theory.)  (Also, I'm curious.  How long will 'x amount of time' be?  Too long, and it'll still be piled into the new queue, too short and it may not see a reasonable number of eyes).		Another ratio to consider, I suppose would be 'users who give a shit:users' - how many people will just ignore/troll the big pink?		Sorry, I sound like I'm knocking the idea, when I'm just letting my paranoia get the better of me.  I can't see much difference between this and the 'forced new queue' that came in a while ago, (apart from making it more obvious/easier to tell apart from a redditad) though. I certainly don't see this being detrimental, I just wonder about the implementation, and how we'll (read:you'll) prevent opportunities for abuse occurring.		(God, I sound like a dick.

{"body":"I disagree. These cases were handled by people who had no clue WHAT child molestation really was about. From the first article I referenced:		>Almost all the cases coming to light today are cases from 30 and 40 years ago. We did not know much about pedophilia and sexual abuse in general back then. In fact, the vast majority of the research on sexual abuse of minors didn't emerge until the early 1980's. So, it appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to their priestly duties.		The actions are despicable, of course. I'm not defending the priests who abused.
