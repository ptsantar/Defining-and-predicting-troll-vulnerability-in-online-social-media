{"body":"Just to piggyback on this announcement and the current discusion, I have to say so far I've been impressed with the non-annoyingness of your ads overall. Reddit is the ONLY site that I have whitelisted in Ad-Block Plus and have disabled Ghostery from blocking AdZerk on only this site. I've trusted you guys to not serve flash ads and ads with malicious content and you have yet to show anything that remotely makes me think you have any intention of ever sinking that low.		Bravo to you guys! You've proved that it's possible to have ads on a site without malicious content and once you earn peoples' trust they'll jump through hoops to allow ads to help the site out. I just hope it's helping a little bit.		That said, sorry I'm still blocking Google Analytics in Ghostery though because Google already knows way more about me than I care to admit and I'm slowly losing trust in them.		Keep up the awesome work!","depth":0,"score":452,"ups":452,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"slayerboy","name":"t1_ch56i5n","parent_id":"t3_24aevu","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1398820824,"created_utc":1398792024}

The second you take a legal obligation to share critical information about any one of these groups (and many more, sexuality is one that comes to mind), you both put yourself in a position where you can not just keep your mouth shut to keep the person's life private (you've taken the responsibility legally, already) and also you place those people in a position where they can not continue to freely express their ideas.

{"body":"You're over simplifying the problem at hand. I'm at school and have an exam in like 20 minutes, so my apologies if I am unable to write something detailed enough. 		Firstly, let's start with the idea of life and ownership. Many people have many different ideas about politics. Some people find the idea of a government necessary, some find it problematic. Some like solid, static law, some like one that adapts. Some are of the left wing, some are of the right. Some are outside the spectrum. Many of them are so different from each other that they're incompatible. However, they all have one common principle. Well, except for just a few. That principle is the ownership of self. You can be whoever you want, you can do whatever you want, you can speak whatever you want, you can believe whatever you want. However, you can not stop someone else from doing so. That is where your freedom ends and another's begins. I find reddit, in general, to be in support of this idea. Subreddits like /r/trees, /r/anarchism, /r/atheism and /r/Christianity... etc all show that people are free to do whatever they want. However, I believe the recent change has a huge potential to damage this. 		One argument against privacy when it comes to matters like drugs and suicide is that people might not be mentally stable, and thus need someone else to decide for them in specific scenarios. I understand that. Personally, I'm in conflict with this idea, however I can see its merits. Back on topic, this idea is actually used a lot in the sub /r/depression. Many people come saying they're fed up and want to die. I see a lot of commenters saying that they're actually wrong. That they don't mean it. That they could've ended their lives, but didn't. Because they don't want to. That's why they sook help. That's why they posted about it. I believe this to be true, and I believe without simple connections like this sanity wouldn't be a fact, but just an illusion. However, that is also a topic by itself, and I don't have much time left to derail. 		Another thing, which I'll talk about shortly is, a person has every right to end his life. I don't want anyone to, I'll try to make them stop with my words if I can, I'd use force if I knew the person myself. However, I can not cause problems to someone I don't even know based on a single comment on a website. Proof is necessary when matters get this serious, and the news don't care about such things. If such a thing, even mistakenly, is announced about a person, their life is pretty much destroyed. Their job, friends... Even family might think differently of them. Do you think this'll reduce or increase the chances of another attempt? 		Lastly, there are many other cases where such information can be asked. For example, I believe reddit is based in America. Therefore, they have to abide by their laws. (or even if I'm mistaken, wherever they're based has its own laws). They can choose not to record information so no one can ask for it. But if they choose to, then they'll be forced to share if they're given a legal order to. This would be detrimental because many people wouldn't be able to share their thoughts anymore. It's basically increasing the chances of taking the problems about police states in the real world and bringing them to this forum. 		Sorry, I have like 10 minutes. I have to study a bit more. Ask anything you want me to elaborate on. I'll do so later, when appropriate.","depth":8,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Orion97","name":"t1_ch5qzcp","parent_id":"t1_ch5qeyt","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1398863477,"created_utc":1398834677}

In all those words, the best you could do is accuse me of "simplifying" something.		One of the problems in explaining something simply is that the truth becomes evident, rather than obscured behind a forest of reasons and excuses.		There are, and always will be, people who are so precious about the possibility of a minor inconvenience to their privacy, they will happily put in place a set of requirements so strict that they become ridiculous in the face of a possible human catastrophe.  If given a genuine belief that a person's life is in danger, or that they are about to harm others, the privacy zealot will sit on their high throne of judgment and deny the possibility of action, because there might be the chance that the police would be called unnecessarily.  Better to avoid that and risk a preventable death, than vice-versa.		And therein lies the rub.  It's not admirable or even intelligent to insist on this rigorous enforcement of privacy.  In fact it's a failure.  We are admitting, as a social group, that we are so utterly unable to apply the human reasoning and discernment that sets us apart from earthworms, that we have to rely on totalitarian enforcement of principles.

Alternatively, to put a different perspective, if you are of sound mind and want to die, go and die.  No one need stop you, and your individuality is protected.

These lasted for 42 years, with the battles finally settled when Tiber released a powerful ancient weapon, the Numidium, crushing his foes with unparalleled might.		After his victory the underking tried to steal the powerful gem that powered he machine since it was powered by the soul of his kind, in the battle that followed the Numidium and the UnderKing were both destroyed.		He continued to reign for 39 years, before eventually dying of unknown causes. What is known however is that in his possession at the time of death were several powerful magical artifacts related to crossing planes of existence and a magical artifact derived shards from the soul gem that used to power the Numidium.		At his death it was public knowledge that he was now a god, however as time went on belief faded as people demanded to know how a mortal can become a god, with the great war of the fourth age dividing the world an agreement was reached to end the fighting, among many terms was one banning Talos worship.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"scragar","name":"t1_ch5g123","parent_id":"t1_ch5e60w","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1398839600,"created_utc":1398810800}

As pointed out above, your IP address isn't considered PII, so I'll assume any publisher can get the entire list of IP addresses you've used to access Reddit.		* How to use this:  Suppose you want to humiliate, say, some Democratic congressional staffers, because you're a Republican.  You figure, probably some of them have gone in to Wikipedia from home to fluff up their candidate's article or to make rude comments about their opponents.  On Wikipedia the IP addresses of non logged in users are listed publicly, but it is treated as "anonymous" because if they're on some residential ISP who knows who they are?  So you strike a deal with one of the many advertisers to get the list of associated IP addresses from Reddit.  _Now_ you look up all the known IP addresses of Democratic political offices (I imagine the hard-core Republicans know those pretty much by heart) and look them up in the Adzerk data that you've gotten via the publisher, and now search all the IP addresses that they _share a Reddit account with_ in the entire dataset of Wikipedia IP addresses to see which ones have edited.  You then go through these looking for anything juicy.  The result, eventually, is that you have (I think) a Reddit account name, a Wikipedia IP address's edit history, a congressional office, all linked up.  After that you can go to work with the power tools, looking up all the dox on one or a few targets that you can.

{"body":"Thanks for posting, and I've now read the updated policy.		I assume Reddit has thought about simply requiring a paid subscription to generate revenue -- something like $1 per year ala WhatsApp -- in lieu of going the traditional paid advertising model.		But, under either model, the Redditor pays. Either way with dollars, or we pay with privacy data. I see that the privacy policy indicates (at least in its current iteration) that no user-identifiable data will be sold to third-parties, though (1) some might wish to foreclose even aggregated, geo-specific data from being disclosed, and (2) the nature of the TOS is simply to change when the economic desires of the company changes. I have no doubt that, one day in the future, Reddit will sell user-identifiable data. I think that's a fair assumption unless and until Reddit includes a contractual clause in its TOS prohibiting it from doing so for as long as the company remains a going concern, and inducing all Redditors to rely upon the promise.		Which leads me to my question (and, again, I appreciate that the company is open enough to even give this question a voice): why the decision to collect data from users rather than money? Does Reddit believe that the community is unsustainable if a small amount of money was collected each year? Has a study been done? Are there plans to exclude any Redditor's IP data if that Redditor purchases gold or some other subscription-based service?		I don't purchase Gold now. I realize that my voice rings hollow on this point.

{"body":"You're right the cost/bandwidth per user is likely low - though the daily session times are probably pretty high.		Data itself isn't useful out of context. I'll see if I can explain:		The majority of websites traffic get sold into what's called an 'rtb exchange' - and advertisers can upload ads/destination url's (these typically go through tracking url's that you set up first) and you place bids for these ads based on available targets. 		Country obvious it is the most important target, If I'm promoting an ad for Kia for their US launch, ads going to users in India are basically throwing away money.	You can also target via url and/or broad demographics which is more just an educated assumption by the sites content (eg Oprah.com is going to be predominately North America female 30+ etc)	There's other targeting like session length, frequency of ad  to user , retargetting pixels etc		You can see how much traffic is available from any given site (recorded as impressions) - and you place a CPM bid in the auction to buy these impressions, these numbers only include users who successfully load a banner (so as an advertiser I never pay for an adblock user).		Raw information like analytics, isn't worth a tonne of money. It is for someone like google as it's a 'search engine' it can extrapolate intentions and trends in real time.		With reddit, aside from what everyone can see being upvoted on the front page, they don't have a whole lot more to offer as far as user analytics. Nothing that an advertiser is going to shell out millions of dollars for at least.		You're right that Initial user bases help with SEO rankings and users bring other users, but reddit has been large enough for quite some time that it no longer needs to worry keeping/getting un-monetizable users.		You just can't pretend someone who uses adblock and doesn't buy anything is an 'asset'.		The best you can say is that they're likely not much of a liability.		Also as of late last year Reddit was in the red, they 'hoped' to break even by 2014, this years financials haven't been outted, but they have to do something more to keep this site going and people like you telling everyone who's contributing less than nothing that they're *actually helping in anyway* isn't going to do reddit any favours.		http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-ceo-admits-were-still-in-the-red-2013-7		http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/19/reddit_in_the_red_why_the_internet_s_front_page_is_still_losing_money.html","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"damendred","name":"t1_ch5pzlc","parent_id":"t1_ch5o2yb","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1398860783,"created_utc":1398831983}
