{"body":"Well here we are again. We knew it was coming but most of did not suspect it would come so soon. It hasn't even been five months since the worldwide PIPA & SOPA protests and Congress is back to playing its standard game of slashing and burning what we hold most important for the sake of their personal agendas. The bills of PIPA & SOPA are effectively dead, but their text is being broken up into pieces and has been put into other bills and what they represent lives on. I do not want to alarm you, the person reading thing, but you should starring long and hard at what is going on right now. We are on the precipice of something horrible happening and if we do not fight again, we will lose horribly and our personal freedoms will be maimed and impacted far beyond what we can see as the initial impact:		As of today this is where we stand:		1. SOPA (The Stop Online Piracy Act) is effectively dead		2. PIPA (The PROTECT IP Act) is effectively dead		3. [CISPA (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act)](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3523:) has passed the House of Representatives with [248 yes, 168 no, and 15 abstained votes.](http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-national-security/house-representatives-passes-privacy-busting-cispa) 		4.

[PRECISE Act](http://homeland.house.gov/bill/hr-3674-promoting-and-enhancing-cybersecurity-and-information-sharing-effectiveness-act-2011)		Currently there are four bills in Congress that stand to wipe away the privacy, the anonymity, and the freedom we take advantage of every day. If any one of these bills makes it through Congress the internet as we know it is effectively over. This is a zero sum situation and we have to act again. 		**Let us begin with CISPA:**		- [Accusations & source information against CISPA.

While many of the answers to those questions can be found in the links posted above the biggest reason as to why major companies like Google, Facebook, and even reddit have not spoken out vehemently against these bills is simple. They actually stand to benefit from them in some ways. CISPA was crafted from the ground up, with the help of some of these very major tech companies and the NSA, so the debacle of SOPA & PIPA wouldn't happen again. Instead of having to fight against companies and their users they now just have to worry about your average joe getting upset. Doing this paints a much smaller target on the bill and makes it that much more challenging for us to prevent the abuses that are poised to come from CISPA and the additional 'cybersecurity' bills. 		Many are calling for blackouts again but unfortunately Congress is trying a new and incredibly effective strategy this time. They are dividing us from the companies that assisted us last time. In the language of CISPA it has been found, cut and dry, that most companies will be given immunity from what goes on within their enterprises so long as they hand over your information en mass. This means that your user profile, your personal information, your comment history, the websites you link to, and even possibly what you like of Facebook and similar websites will be handed over to the government. To make matters even worse, the government will essentially bribe these companies by paying them to hand over the data. Congress did something cunningly smart, they made it so the only allies the common user has are themselves. Reddit INC as a company has no good reason to speak up loudly in support like they did with PIPA & SOPA. The reason is that they actually come to benefit from CISPA.		/r/ExplainItLikeImFive puts it nicely:		>[Basically it allows companies to provide the federal government with data concerning "cybersecurity threats" without liability. Currently most large websites have a Privacy Policy which normally states that companies will not voluntarily share your data. If they did share your data, then you could likely successfully sue them. CISPA protects companies from lawsuits if they share data concerning "cybersecurity threats" with the federal government. So companies like Facebook and Google tend to like the bill because it shields them from liability.](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sujsu/what_is_cispa/)		We must not, we cannot, allow these companies to ever believe that that selling out the user and throwing them under the bus can be part of their business model. It must be a concrete, inseparable, fact that our interests are the companies interest. You and I stood up and fought in the ways that we could to protect these companies like Google, Facebook, even Reddit INC from PIPA & SOPA. They need to do their damnedest to do the same for us. The ridiculously overused saying by pastor Martin Niemöller best fits here:		>First they came for the communists,	and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.		>Then they came for the trade unionists,	and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.		>Then they came for the Jews,	and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.		>Then they came for me	and there was no one left to speak out for me.

{"body":"Part 2:		*Some of you will consider this next paragraph a bit harsh. Keep in mind that these companies aren't too interested in seriously speaking up because they actually stand to benefit from these bills. The companies listed had no problem aligning themselves and speaking out with us when it was explicitly for their own benefit but when it has come time to protect our interests they are essentially nowhere to be found. They don't consider our situation to be 'their fight' even when it really should be. They figure that we're their users regardless and don't care. If there is consequence for them then they will be more inclined to say something.*		Facebook, reddit, Google, you need to get back in the ring. We stood with you and I don't mean to sound pushy but its your moral obligation to stand with us. If you are not willing to fight on our behalf then we will be left with only two options. We can either sit here and let you sell us out because its convenient or we can demonize you for the actions you choose to support and revile you until we are capable of creating something that will leave you obsolete. You may believe that you are too big and too influential for some random person talking on the internet to do much harm to your enterprises, but make no mistake that if you do not make it your imperative to fight for us in the open and behind the scenes then we will be left with the only option of creating, through necessity, something that takes you out of the equation. 		Out of all of these bills I have yet to see the focus of attention be on the biggest problems we face. Those problems boil down to government employees, contractors, and users with access to sensitive networks misbehaving and not doing what they should. No government employee should be downloading torrents, watching porn, blogging, or any of the sort on government computers. This leaves them vulnerable. Outdated software, and insecure networks, when coupled with connecting infected cell phones or USB sticks to these systems compromises them to such a level that nearly every company or aspect of government has been compromised on some level. Here are just few articles out of hundreds that highlight the plague of incompetence that could so easily be stopped by proper training and setting essential standards within government agencies, private contractors, and the US military. Almost all of these things do not require new laws but instead require internal changes that effect management and policy within these entities.  		- [Zero Day exploits](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/zero-day-exploit-sales-should-be-key-point-cybersecurity-debate)		- [Forever Day vulnerabilities](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/rise-of-ics-forever-day-vulnerabiliities-threaten-critical-infrastructure.ars)		- [General incompetence levels in government contractors.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124027491029837401.html) 		- [DoD Networks Completely Compromised, Experts Say .

While a vast majority of problems could be prevented by reasonable, common sense, approaches and policies within agencies, it still stands that the current law is lacking in certain regards. However, the blanket approaches that are used in all of these bills and that are all too common cannot be used as they are so far reaching and apply to nearly every aspect of the internet. SOPA & PIPA drew so much ire due to the easily broad interpretations that could be made under their legislation. Similarly, CISPA and the additional bills, follow this line of thinking. Rather than just throwing everything under the sun under a single umbrella Congress needs to be much more choosy about where they allow for broad interpretations within their legislation. Loopholes and blanket approaches cannot stand and we need to make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. Using "protecting children" as part of the actual language of the bill to include topics covered by CISPA is outrageous. 			**I hope many of you are asking how you can help:**		 If you want spend a few minutes you can retweet, discuss and link to articles on facebook, talk to your friends and family, upvote these kinds of topics on reddit. Subscribe to /r/evolutionreddit, /r/fia, or any of the various subreddits that these subreddits link to. If you want to be informed, then doing the little things will make all the difference. The little things add up and your effort could be the piece of straw that breaks the camel's back.		If you are a doodler you can create a work that symbolizes what is wrong with these bills and please release it under one of the appropriate licenses. If you are a video editor, or even have a webcam, you can make a work and upload it to youtube or any of the various other video websites so others can watch and become better informed. If you you are a writer or a journalist, and it doesn't matter what your level of expertise is, you can help explain to others why these bills are to atrocious. If you are on a school paper you can write an article and bring the fight to your campus. 		If you have an email, if you have a phone, if you have five minutes to kill, you can call or write someone and give them a piece of your mind. 		All that matters is that you try to do your part. Give up an afternoon and print out fliers to pass out around town, to stick under windshields, to staple to a local bulletin board. If we do not advocate for ourselves them nobody else will. 			**Contact your representatives in Congress directly.

{"body":"Dear ------:	 	Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity.  I appreciate hearing from you.	 	We must be vigilant in protecting the privacy rights of Americans.  As a United States Senator, my primary responsibilities are to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people.  	 	At the present time, we know our public and private networks are alarmingly vulnerable to intrusion.  This is undermining both our national security and our economic competiveness.  We need to do more to secure out networks, and there isn’t any reason this should be a partisan or ideological issue.  	 	We should work together to pass cybersecurity legislation that safeguards our critical infrastructure, permits more timely sharing of information with stakeholders, and recruits the next generation of talented cyber personnel.  Any approach on cybersecurity must also include meaningful provisions that prevent the sharing of sensitive personal information with other government agencies or private sector entities.  The end goal of cybersecurity should be to make the personal data of online users more secure.	 	As you may know, there are a number of different legislative proposals on cybersecurity currently before Congress.  I am evaluating all of the different bills, and I will keep your thoughts in mind as opportunities to address cybersecurity come before the full Senate.	 	I value the input of fellow Coloradans in considering the wide variety of important issues and legislative initiatives that come before the Senate.  I hope you will continue to inform me of your thoughts and concerns.	 	For more information about my priorities as a U.S. Senator, I invite you to visit my website at http://bennet.senate.gov/.

{"body":""Thou" is nominative, and "than" takes the nominative case. "Holier than thou" is not just an idiom. It is grammatically correct. If you say, "I can do better than thee," you are saying that you can do better people than doing that person. Because "thee" is the object. "Better than x" is a modifier, not a verb phrase. The distinction is blurred in modern English, but German retains this distinction even in casual speech. "Ich kann besser als du" vs. "Ich kann besser als dich." Not sure if that translates idiomatically, but it gets the point across. In fact, "du" is a cognate of "thou," and thee=dich, literally. They are only a few sound changes apart.

Everyone with a pair of braincells who hasn't gulped from his Jesus-juice Understands it. He's using both parties to get what he wants: to just be called president and continue the same cycle the Bush family began. RP isn't dumb, and he's got a great marketing campaign going for him. He just requires the stupid and the stoned. By joining the republicans, he got the stupid. By avoiding to take a position on weed, he got the stoners vote. 		American politics are (and for Most of the last 20 years, have been) a huge joke. There is a joke from a comedian that is often quoted. I'll paraphrase badly: "I like the puppet on the left, but the puppet on the right aligns with my views. Oh wait, they are both controlled by the same guy!"		Ron Paul is connected to the third arm of that same guy. You're a fool to believe otherwise. :)","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"stlnstln","name":"t1_c4hvgh8","parent_id":"t1_c4hum62","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1335705775,"created_utc":1335676975}

You're semi-right, but you can also say Obama hides behind anti-science ideas too. The drug war is scientifically sound?  	And you really don't believe the president has any power to do anything without congress? We both know that's silly. Hell, Obama just fought a war with Libya without congressional support. Again, how about that drug war? And government spying? I could go on and on. The presidentpower ear unlimited power in certain areas. 	Now you do have a valid point that Paul can't return us to the Gold Standard, destroy the FED or other wackiness without congressional approval - and thank goodness. I think most of us, however, would love to see Obama and Paul in a debate just to demonstrate how far right Obama has moved since we voted him into office.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LongStories_net","name":"t1_c4hyq10","parent_id":"t1_c4hvgh8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1335740810,"created_utc":1335712010}
{"body":"1. I still say it is too convenient that RP wasn't able to make it when his own party decided to streamline things. I highly doubt he was unaware of what was going on at the time. Unless his wife was dying in hospital, it just seems too coincidental to me.		2. Absolutely not. The drug war is archaic and counter-productive. But the drug war preceded Obama and it will outlast him. Entire agencies exist to fight the war on drugs. It's definitely not something Obama can actually remove without congressional support. But I also don't think that Obama would end the war on drugs even if he DID have congressional support.		Well doing something such as making a short incursion into Libya without ground troops (I believe that was the idea) was something that Obama technically wasn't allowed to do. Same thing with nabbing Osama from Pakistan.		Government spying again, precedes him and will outlast him. America is built upon a huge spy network (embassies, CIA, NSA, etc). Those agencies simply will not go away. And I hope they don't, personally, as long as they are still pointed externally. But maybe I read too many old Tom Clancy novels. 		I believe the president has power to make small decisions that normally take a very long time to be debated and approved/denied in congress. For example Libya and Pakistan. How many weeks would it have taken for congress to approve picking up Osama? What would have been the odds for him to have remained there? 		The president, outside of snap decisions, is basically our last chance for a veto vote against the incredibly stupid amount of bills attempting to be passed.		The problem is that Ron Paul knows that. His campaign is based on things that are slow decisions and require long term implementation (such as destroying the fed, gold standard, and every other idea he has). We simply don't know how he will act when it comes to the quick decisions that actually make a president.		Lastly, I still think Obama the most left of any presidential candidate, currently. He implemented medicare.....no other president in the history of America has done this. And he did it in a recession. With a republican dominated congress. If I could vote, I'd give him another term.

{"body":"Here goes:		The community as a whole is framing this argument wrong. CISPA is simultaneously undermining your right to control information about yourself while increasing corporations and governments ability to control information about their operations.		The concepts of intellectual property and privacy are entangled and by being re-active instead of pro-active, we're sacrificing liberty so that corporations thrive.		The primary purpose behind the design and implementation of the internet was to increase the efficiency of scientific research and development. It is built around the value of collaboration; allowing individuals access to facts and theories so that they can advance the rate of human creativity.		We should be writing legislation demanding more transparency of the corporations who are utilizing a government project to increase their profits instead of focusing on hitting back when they try to undermine our liberties.		Human beings have a right to privacy. Corporations have no such right. Intellectual property rights choke off creativity and productivity for the sake of constricting the number of people who profit from an idea. Yes, creators deserve to be rewarded fro the production of "content"... but hiding the scientific principles surrounding a new technology or burying studies that call into question the value of a product are both slowing the rate of human advancement.		I'm not saying to stop defending the right to control your personal information, but we need to create a threat to the power-base of the people attacking us, or its just going to keep happening over and over.		Intellectual property protection that extends beyond the lifetime the inventor is insane.

First of all, if you are giving information you wish to protect to a company  you don't trust, "you're gonna have a bad time." Who on earth would give sensitive data to Facebook? The only thing this bill changes is that they can now share it, under certain prescribed circumstances, to certain prescribed entities to be used for cyber-security purposes. You *really* thought your data was private before? At least now you know otherwise.		If you have something worth actually protecting, you should have it encrypted, with a key only you have. Anything less is illusory security, which is worth nothing at all.		Are there real issues with CISPA? Yes, of course. 		Does anyone on Reddit actually understand these issues? It doesn't seem likely.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ordinia","name":"t1_c4hvm4h","parent_id":"t1_c4hs0e7","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1335706825,"created_utc":1335678025}

{"body":"As a non American my first reaction is: "Why should I care". Then I remembered an argument made by a fellow countrymen regarding e-tolling in my province*. If it works there (the USA) it will start to appear closer to home, wherever you live. Bad ideas should be stopped before they are spread by bad people.		*In South Africa's most economic active province, Gauteng, the government decided to upgrade the intercity, and urban highways (the province is about 100km x 100km in size) This is a good thing, but later on with terrible communication to the public they decided to errect drive through toll gantries. To the public the documents and information were either censored or jumbled. But the information it did give was that the average worker will pay a lot more to get to work. The cost of of living would also increase significantly, harming the poor. The tolling system would be extremely innefecient, at about 50% admin cost, but it also came to light that a lot of backers and investors in the system will coin it big time. So a cheaper alternitive to cover the cost of infrastructure upgrade would be to increase the fuel levy. People in other provinces and cities said this is unfair since they would have to pay. The argument against this was two-fold. First if the system is succesfull it would start popping up in other urban centres within a couple of years. And second, the Gautng province only keeps 40% of the money it generates in the province. The rest is used to fund other provinces, either by taxes, or by profits from external companies, or by workers sending money to their outer province families. So the argument is weak.

Whether they listen to us is another thing, but what they need to realize is that we aren't going to give up on this. Free, open communication and the use of this powerful tool is much more than a room full of out of touch, wealthy people that were elected to listen to our requests to make a better society and ultimately, a better world.		Our next step, and this is where I may lose some of you is electoral reform. This cannot continue, and if you wish to improve this joke of a political system that was once so great, you must get involved. The internet, reddit particularly is famous for activism that takes a couple clicks. You want change? Fight for it. I'm not talking about violence, it should never come to that.  Work to change your political system, get involved on a local level with the candidates running for Senate positions. I've informed one of my Senators (McCain, R-AZ) that due to his work on the NDAA, I will no longer to continue to support him, and I will spread the word. Most people don't even know that NDAA passed, let alone the verbage of this constitutionally-raping, bill of rights-shitting on piece of garbage.		That brings us to Mr. Puppet himself.  The presidential elections.  The third phase must bring back the vote to the majority, not the minorty.  The USA's electoral college is a sham, and a travesty to something that most people would jump, run, swim, sign, sell their souls to be a part of: Democracy and the Freedom that goes along with it.  Immigrants (both legal and illegal) come to our country, to experience the freedoms America has to offer, and yet we can't control our own political system. It's not that this is something new, it's been happening for a long time, we just know more about it thanks to....wait for it...you guessed it, the **INTERNET**.		All of this is rooted in fear. Fear of power of information. Fear of a bunch of people banding together to fight back (as is welcomed and understood in the American Constitution written by our forefathers). This fear is visible by those who are elected by their constitutency.  They receive handouts from lobbyists, and can reword a need to tighten watch over piracy in the name of 'job loss'. I know this is from SOPA, but it's still true with CISPA.		Look at the Occupy Movement. In it's infancy, the movement was hard to track, plans were hard to follow if you weren't in the know. This was because TPTB couldn't figure out how information was being passed. Much like the tactics of the Arab Spring, the people could stand and pass information, looking as innocent as checking a sports score or reading the news. Then...they caught on.  As they started to crack down on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, getting sites to censor, pull down, or delete material completely they've begun to learn. Clever girl.  They realize that the delay comes from them, and have learned our weakness....CSPAN. Not many of us watch it, and I'd be curious to find out how many American redditors understand the actual passing of a bill into law in the USA. Immigrants who pass our citizenship test know more about our processes than we do.  We have been lulled into a sense of security by products and our lazy way of life.  We cannot allow generation after generation to slip into ignorance of this.

SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, and now CISPA are all bills well worthy of rallying against. However there are so many things passed over the past year that should've been aggressively opposed, as much so as these "cyber security" bills, and probably more so. 		My issue why is that sites like Reddit and Google will chomp at the bit to trash these kind of bills that could affect our freedom on the internet but I never see them rally support against things like NDAA and NDRP? The internet is certainly a worthy cause, but the assault on our liberty and freedom is coming from all angles now. We should be taking a stand against these things as well. 		We have proven how powerful the internet really is, so why don't we use it to protect freedoms outside the internet and fight government on betrayal of ALL of our liberties and rights, not just the internet? 		Or could it be that even those that we feel are fighting along side us have no interest unless directly threatens their livelihood and revenue? I strongly feel this is the case. Our power is in numbers, and we access the greatest numbers via the internet. NDAA and NDRP were pretty much in a spotlight on Reddit, but no action was taken.

{"body":"The corporations buy off the government. The government then does their bidding, which generally has negative impacts on both the people and the planet (not just the American people, mind you). The government uses the police and the armed forces to enforce the rules they put in place at the demand of the corporations. And the bulk of the money used to pay for the whole show comes from taxes. 		Taxes are paid by the public, to the government, who spend that money to bully the public into submission. 		Privatised prisons, corrupt police departments, illegal wars, forcing religion into schools, allowing companies to go unpunished for environmental destruction and endangering the world's food supplies... the list goes on. 		Spying on the public is just another step towards controlling the population they feed off.		Unfortunately, there is no quick and simple answer to this problem. There is no overnight fix. But President Obama is the closest thing you have to a leader you can trust. Show him that you respect him for the things he has done, are disappointed and feeling let-down for the things he has done wrong (in your opinion), and that you still have hope for the future. 		I think the best way to do this is through an online guide or similar that outlines all the bills and policies in a TLDR format, with the reasons and repercussions for each. 		Market the hell out of it not just in social media on the web, but in a leaflet drop where everyone able to prints out a dozen fliers a day, begging people to go and get a rough idea of what parties or candidates they can trust, and which ones are shady as fuck, (or outright crooks).		Then give them a poll to vote on how they feel about each party or candidate. Don't tell them the poll results until the end, so they can see (based on their choices) which party or candidates left them feeling the most confident and which ones feel like slimy crooks. 		It has to be fair. You can't just say "Reddit feels this way so this is the right way"- it has to be the voice of the people. ALL the people, or as many as you can reach. 		On the same site, you could list the candidates for each position with a snopes style (crossed with wikipedia style) breakdown of the broken promises, lies told by or about each one, colour coded, with a graph or pie chart showing each group or party's history in regards to racking up debt, starting wars, telling lies to the public, breaking laws, corruption, etc etc etc... 		Make it simple enough that a casual browser can skim it and get a rough idea of which member or party is the most dirty, the best for the economy, the most reliable, the most war-hungry, has the most ties to corporations, and uses the most underhanded tactics.

{"body":"I have a suggestion to the folks who own and run Reddit:  lead by example.  The reason why the SOPA protest was so successful was because, beyond the users of social media, the owners of social media sites got directly involved.		In the case of CISPA, the major social sites (Facebook, Google, etc) ALREADY collect the data that is asked for in CISPA and ALREADY share, sell and store that data.  Social media sites make the bulk of their money selling user data to anyone who is willing to pay for it.  If these companies were to come out against CISPA, their very business model could asked to be aired in public, and that is the last thing they want.  Did anyone see the expose about the data Facebook is willing to handover on the flimsiest of contexts?  It's chilling to say the least.		Remember, these are companies that hold not only your name, but address, emails, credit card information, buying patterns, what websites you visit, what you read, what you click and countless other data points.  This is information that even those sites who gather it will not share with you, but will release to advertisers.  The giant revenue of companies such as Facebook and Google is based on trading and selling your personal information.		Now, ask yourself, do you think these companies would block a law which makes the sharing of this information easier?		As for Reddit, SOPA threatened their very existence.  Reddit is a site a where people could share pics and info from other sites, therefore could have fallen afoul of the restrictions in SOPA, and could have possibly forced Reddit to shutdown.  But now, with CISPA, which doesn't target companies and websites, but individuals, Reddit has no stake to lose.  That is why there is no big announcement that Reddits execs will go on the warpath.  CISPA does not affect their business plan like SOPA did, so why risk there necks by making themselves a target?		What it comes down to is that web "giants" will fight anything that directly affects their business model, revenue stream and very existence tooth and nail.  But when it comes to something that would solely affect their users, they could care less as long as they can exploit it to make some more money.  Take a look at the penalties or fines that major tech companies have paid for privacy transgessions and compare that to the profits they made.  Do you really think that these companies will fight to protect the very same people that they are exploiting as long as it doesn't affect their bottom line?		That's why the powers be at Reddit have been so quiet.  They have nothing to gain and nothing to lose vis a vis CISPA.  So why should they put their corporate neck on the line for something which does not affect their bottom line and something that will not harm their business model should the act pass?  Because it does not affect them, therefore they don't care.  No business will pick a fight if they are not threatened, and Reddit is no different.		Which is a shame.  If Reddit lead as zealously in this fight as they did against SOPA, it could make a difference.  Instead they opted for a tepid statement and a half hearted call to action.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tillicum","name":"t1_c4hulzd","parent_id":"t3_sxdxv","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1335700366,"created_utc":1335671566}

In the future, should we go ahead and let all bills that attack our freedom pass based on the idea that they may *really* try to screw us one day?		>We have to show a willingness to give a little.		When you can show me real, hard numbers that the US legislative system removes 10 times as many laws that erode our freedoms as Americans than it adds, instead of the other way around, I might be inclined to take you more seriously. Until then, I'm going to go ahead and operate as if once a law is passed it becomes even more monumental to revoke it.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ghostrider176","name":"t1_c4hsezf","parent_id":"t1_c4hrw2p","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1335687051,"created_utc":1335658251}

However, we should not pretend that the reddit admins stepped in just because the users wanted them to -- they stepped in because the issue threatened the very existence of the site itself.  See, for example, the removal of subs like jailbait.		With CISPA, reddit the company has not become a major player in the opposition because it no longer has an equal interest in the outcome.  I am actually fine with that; reddit is a huge website run by a small number of people, and it takes a lot of effort to engineer something like the last blackout.  Moreover, the number of people who actively contribute to reddit is much smaller than the number who come here simply to consume its content, and not all users are affected by American political developments.  I do not expect the role of the admins to include using the site as a soapbox for popular opinion of the users, even if the issue is something quite righteous and worth fighting for.  The users themselves do that, through the submission and discussion of content.  If the admins choose to take up an issue and run with it, then good for them -- but I do not expect them to do so unless it affects the existence of the site, even if it's an issue that many redditors feel strongly about.		**TLDR:**  It is reasonable to expect reddit to expend resources fighting for something that affects its existence.

Having realized we (the internets), were obviously being spied on, with the cooperation of our ISPs. So a plan was devised whereupon a poster would make a post as usual, BUT at the end of each post, the poster would include a list of specific words that were sure to attract the attention of the keyword bot, and cause the same to retain and forward the post to a "human" reader for assessment. Now given the number of posts containing these words, and the manpower needed to sift through each and every flagged post, you can imagine the headaches it caused. Complaints were made, and it appeared some ISPs were embroiled in the whole mess of providing incredible amounts of detailed information to authorities. One can imagine the toil and trouble this caused those ISPs in particular. So I'm left wondering if this might work again? Instead of trying to beat the system, maybe we should be forcing the system to work at peak capacity, and overtime, all the time.

They blame the website for not stepping in and saving the day, because they have developed this feeling that this one website with its billions of views can do anything.

We try to bring the rest of the world into our comfort zone..."Get X to do an AMA!" Then if they fuck up or don't know our "rules" then we go ape shit at them.

If you truly want to "beat" bills and legislation like this you need to take yourself to where the actual conversation is taking place. Then find the person you need to talk to and figure out how to talk directly to them.

They simply talk to different people who try and persuade them to vote for certain issues. Some do this with votes and others do it with campaign contributions.

{"body":"From, "101 Things to do Until the Revolution", by Claire Wolfe		**1. Don't write to your congresscritter**		Put down that pen! Close that word processing program!	Forget all that happy crap you learned in civics class about	sharing your views with your "representative." You don't	have a representative any more. You merely have someone	who thinks he or she is your "leader," unfettered by either	your opinions or the Constitution.	Your congresscritter assumes the role of the overseer in the	field. You are merely the "n-word" toiling under super-vision.	The benevolent massa wants sincerely to "help" you, as long	as you toil and obey.	Marx was wrong: religion isn't the opiate of the masses; in	modern America, the drug that keeps us numb, dumb and	well-behaved is a belief that we can still make a difference by	politely voicing our views to our would-be rulers and owners.	The fact is, every minute you spend writing to your congressperson	is a minute you don't spend on useful freedom	activity. Every minute you spend writing to your congressperson	is a minute you fool yourself into believing you're	accomplishing something when you're not.	101 Things To Do 'Til The Revolution	2	What happens to your letter	Here's what happens when you write your congresscritter.	Your letter is carried into his or her office in a big plastic	crate along with thousands of other letters. An aide scans it to	see what it's about and sticks a form letter in the mail to you.	Then the aide enters your name in the computer, with a	notation that you wrote to say, "Vote yes on X" or "Vote no	on Y."	If you're lucky, they might actually get the topic right. If	you're really lucky, they'll record you as being on the side of	the issue you're actually on. They're just as likely to record	you as being one of your own political enemies, though.	Doesn't that make you feel special?	Even if you get what appears to be a "customized" reply, it	was written by an aide and probably signed by a machine. The	congressperson never saw either your letter or his or her own	reply.	If you send an e-mail, an automated system scans your	message and zaps back a reply, without your message having	been seen by human eyes.	The whole process is designed to say, 'There, there now,	little citizen, your congressperson cares" — when, in fact,	nobody cares.	If you're rich, famous, powerful or influential (or if they	think you're a dangerous loony, but that's not an impression	you want to make), you have a chance of being heard by	someone in Congress. Otherwise, the only time you have the	slightest chance of influencing a congressperson's views is	when your letter — or fax or phone call — is one of several	thousand expressing the same opinion. Then it's only going to	help if: 1) the congressperson is already on your side of the	issue and wants to wave a basketful of supporting letters	during a floor debate; or, 2) the congressperson's seat is	Chapter One and Only	3	insecure and he or she has to do what the people want for a	change, or else.	The only method that might do a bit of good	If you just can't live without writing to your congressperson,	keep a stack of pre-addressed postcards handy, and	when you're so roused up about something you simply have	to do it, write, "Vote no on HJ32000, the Counterterrorism	Act sponsored by Rep. Bigbro," or "Vote yes on SB504, the	Privacy Amendment sponsored by Sen. Rarebird."	Bright-colored postcards get more notice, just as shiny	objects best attract the attention of mindless rats.	Keep it that simple. Don't waste your time on reasoned	argument or constitutional issues. Use those arguments	elsewhere, with people who might actually listen.	In order to become the master, the politician poses as	the servant.	— Charles de Gaulle","depth":0,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"didyouknowthatt","name":"t1_c4hsff5","parent_id":"t3_sxdxv","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1335687124,"created_utc":1335658324}
