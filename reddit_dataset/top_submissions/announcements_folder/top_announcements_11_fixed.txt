A lot of people can feel very isolated in the real ~~weird~~ world, whether it's because of depression or social anxiety or anything along those lines.

{"body":"I couldn't agree more. I recently had to take leave from work because my depression got so severe that it was incapacitating, and I ended up finding shallow comfort in my home. What I mean by that is I didn't get better, but actually got worse because I isolated myself out of fear and anxiety. 		I had few friends to begin with, but ended up losing those too. 		One day I was so depressed I could barely move, and was putting myself down. I was cleaning up after lunch, and I found one of my grandfather's old oil markers (a pencil for graphic design). I figured "well, lets draw something. That will make me feel worse because I know how bad it will look.". Anyone with depression will recognize that negative thought pattern immediately. "I feel bad, therefore I deserve to feel worse."		Anyway, I took up the pencil, and drew a tree in my backyard. I had a coworker bring some things over a few days later, and they said "wow, that's really good. did you draw that?" 		It was enough of a push to get me to join a reddit community for art, and I ended up finding I really loved drawing. It's enough that I want to do it some day professionally.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A kettlecorn is a kettlecorn and a member of the popcorn family.

You said a kettlecorn is a popcorn, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the popcorn family popcorn, which means you'd call Doritos, Bugles, and other corn snacks popcorn, too.

Now people who *don't* interact with the admins because they don't report things to them or otherwise have reasons to talk to them, they're the ones who see **one** negative post about an admin and join the bandwagon, without any experience of what they actually do.

Reddit simply let go and left the mods to pick up the pieces.

{"body":"I'm going to take this reply in reverse.		> If that's not glorifying, I don't know what is.		That's easy: You don't know what glorifying is.		http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/glorify		Nobody who is calling this user out is glorifying the shooter. We're saying the shooter's actions are so despicable that voluntarily associating with so much as their name is a shitty thing to do. That the shooter got their start on the same ideas espoused by /r/coontown, which is modded by the user being called out, makes it especially shitty. The only person glorifying the shooter is the one who is using their name online.		> What? Where. That doesn't even make sense. You know what backpedaling means?

No it doesn't. Selective ignorance doesn't help anyone. If we labeled every person in history as just "someone" you would not be able to distinguish between them, and noting that these are all individual events by distinct actors is a worthy part of understanding them.		Even if you did actually believe that using names is glorifying, why aren't you directing your ire at the guy who's using the name and posting the same vitriol that the dude believed in? It really seems that your issue is with people who have better memories and working spines.","depth":9,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"avatar_of_internet","name":"t1_ctm0yk7","parent_id":"t1_ctm0foo","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438319900,"created_utc":1438291100}
{"body":"I hear about shooting in the US all the time, and I see the news, but I don't care much for them, and I don't remember them.  	  	So, yeah, I see news all the time, know there are people shooting each other in the US, but I don't care about it that much (it just shows on front pages of news site, amongst the news I want to see) and don't remember the specific name.  	  	There's no contradiction about remembering having seen an even, and not remembering the details of the events.  	But, again, thanks for bringing back that story to the forefront, and making sure everyone know that those ideologies exist and are alive in the US. I'm sure making sure everyone knows that someone did this, and was thinking like this isn't going to help someone else justify that they aren't alone thinking that racism is a good thing.  	  	As I said, if I would have noticed the name, and nobody would have mentioned anything, I would have thought that it referred to an RPG character before I would have remembered the event, because I, compared to you, don't try to remember the name of people like this, because I don't think they are important.  	  	Compared to you, which seem to remember the name, because it's important to you.  	Sure, keep spreading his message, and saying I'm wrong to not remember racist people, that makes lots of sense.
