But creating a recipe is super easy once you open a free account at ifttt.com. You can grab your personalized RSS feeds here:		https://www.reddit.com/prefs/feeds/		At ifttt, 		- Step 1:  	  	select 'My recipes' > 'Create a Recipe'.		You'll see a page that says:  		"ifthisthenthat" in big bold letters, with the "this" part a clickable link.  Click "this" and your available channels will be displayed.  Select the RSS icon that says "feed".		- Step 2: Choose a Trigger  	  	Select 'New feed item'.		- Step 3: Complete Trigger Fields 		Enter the URL of the RSS feed.		- Step 4: "that" 		Choose an action channel, which in my case was Gmail.  I activated the gmail channel on ifttt for other reasons, but I don't think it needs to be activated merely to send an email to your address.		- Step 5: Choose an action		Simple because there is only one, 'Send an email'.		- Step 6: Complete Action Fields		Basically just enter the email address where you want the RSS item to be sent.  The other fields can be left with the defaults. Then click the 'Create Action' button.		- Step 7		Review your recipe and click the "Create Trigger" button if satisfied. You're done!		Recipes run every 15 minutes.

As an example, most subs I moderate have AM set to automatically remove anything posted by any account with -10 comment karma or less, since generally only disruptive users have negative karma. We've also set AM to alert us to a number of keywords that are commonly used by disruptive users, and to remove anything posted by users with some racial slurs and similar in their username.		AM can also be extremely useful for enforcing some submission rules. Are memes banned? Set automoderator to automatically remove anything from quickmeme and similar. Not all rules are suited to automatic moderation, but some can definitely be detected with a low false positive rate, improving response times.		AM can also often detect doxxing, racism, bigotry, general assholishness, and so on by looking for various keywords. AM can also alert the moderators to /u/totes_meta_bot commenting so that they know that their sub might be brigaded.		Essentially, AM makes any rule that can be enforced by looking for keywords much easier, and can also do quite a bit more thanks to the sheer number of conditions one can code AM rules based on.","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Meneth","name":"t1_covs8re","parent_id":"t1_covrigd","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1424832011,"created_utc":1424803211}

The interview, as the previous commenter has pointed out, was in response to this [Andreson Cooper expose on the jailbail subreddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuMdQRRLoYg). Alexis in the interview claimed there were no mechanisms in place to address the issue. That Anderson and his guests attacked the platform of reddit for being a platform of free speech. He wasn't criticizing reddit at it's best, he was specifically attacking reddit for allowing jailbait. You should have just said Alexis did change his mind when the policy changed back then, this is strengthening it more. It's true and sounds better. There are mechanisms and tools to police it, you showed this when you changed your policy to get rid of jailbait. With the social media privacy you missed out on last year and the jailbait stuff reddit made a mistake, they admitted to it and we can move on. Alexis was a little younger and naive then, you can't fault someone for growing as long as they take responsibility for their mistakes. There is no misrepresentation in that. The only thing you can say is we hope we will act sooner than later on the next moral or ethical issue, at least it shows you're trying.		I would have touched on other initiatives reddit announced recently and a desire to increase safety from stalkers and general abuse this year, like /u/5days. You don't have to commit on anything, but it shows good corporate governance that you're changing and moving in a positive direction. I look forward to this change, because as a user of reddit in the jailbait days I didn't have much respect for the company on their position then. 		Advice to give teenagers regarding being safe out there is a passion of mine, and [I've communicated to representatives of reddit about it for years](http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2sk8i9/were_updating_the_reddit_privacy_policy_and_user/cnr18el?context=3	). I'm all for preventative education, and I hope Alexis, Ellen, and reddit as a company will get behind it too in the future. Below is what reddit can do to give advice to teenagers regarding being safe in the digital age. There are mechanisms to address this, and reddit has the power to be vocal about these mechanisms and create awareness so they're not just the powerless link aggregator but a digital company who holds ethics, privacy, and freedom of speech to their highest regards. 		This is what I wrote to a lawyer representing reddit two years ago on what advice you could offer to teens to be safe, and rewritten to 5days this year. There are valuable tools that reddit can promote, that would improve your public image and might actually help someone with relatively little work on your part. While I may have not been a fan of reddits previous policy on these matters, I am optimistic for the future of the site by the shift in dialogue coming from the company. 		---		As an older person who is concerned with young people and not being fully educated on the darker sides of reddit, I was wondering if you could convince the company to add a few lines either to this privacy policy and/or to some help area.		While companies aren't expected to legally, I do believe they have an ethical obligation to ensure people are fully educated on obviously the positive aspects, but the negative aspects as well. There is nothing within reddits help system to address how abusive the community can be, and how any little bit of personal information could lead to having it plastered elsewhere and some real life harassment coming at you from people on this website. 		I do believe that companies who have a mixture of gratuitous NSFW images and porn boards, mixed in with young teenagers, and the ability for a small minority to make their lives hell, have an obligation to have material prepared so that young teens can educate themselves on the dangers of this website, and the internet in general, and also have information for their parents as to the dark sides of this website. Below are some resources I have amassed for a donation project on /r/creepyPMs, where sometimes teenagers under the age of 18 are sent sexually charged messages, harassed, or subject to offensive messages, sometimes from this very site. 				Cyber Angels partnered with Time Warner to write a comprehensive Cyber Safety guide that is pretty good. You may or may not be able to use it, but I'm sure it wouldn't be much to throw together a 3 or 4 page document about some of the dangers of having too much private information, or linking to other sites that contain it like facebook, tumblr, twitter, etc. 		www.cyberangels.org/docs/cybersafetyguide.pdf			Maybe in this same section, or a updated help section for parents and teens, they could include the numbers of kids helplines around the world. You can't police the entire internet, or this website apparently, but you can offer solutions that while they may seem like a small addition, can make the world in a kids life.		Here are a few that could be listed:		Kids Helplines		Australia		www.kidshelpline.com.au		UK		www.childline.org.uk			Canada		www.kidshelpphone.ca		USA		www.childhelp.org		and the one below has some extra similar resources		www.teencentral.net/Help/other.php		The most important one is the federal and worldwide agencies minors can contact if they are victims of being forced to view pornography or are being solicited for sexual images that can be found in /r/creepyPMs/wiki/childabuse		Lastly, having an easy to read privacy policy is great, but there really isn't enough done for education. Many times I've seen on this website teenagers have to delete their account because some online sleuths found their facebook, school name, and twitter account (while the people who do this do get banned from the website, this still can be addressed with education). Educate them on the fact that people will use sites like www.tineye.com and google image search to find where your pictures may be located on other sites to find your information. It's good that the company ensures our privacy on their side, but there could be a lot more done on educating young people on how to ensure their own privacy with minimal effort that could make a big difference. 		It's far too easy to see inappropriate material for young people on this website. I'm not sure if you're a parent or have any young nieces or nephews, but I wouldn't feel comfortable allowing a teenager under the age of 15 on this website. After 15 they should still be encouraged, by the site itself, to talk about their use with their parents. While my response may seem too strong and I understand that it will never happen, I hope for the day that websites out there address their ethical obligations to their users, mainly the underage ones, to educate them on the dangers that exist here. 		Thank you for your time and consideration, and I do hope that your experience, education, and passion may be able to influence something like this in the future.","depth":4,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NoseFetish","name":"t1_cowjcrj","parent_id":"t1_cow5vfy","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1424883833,"created_utc":1424855033}

{"body":"Exactly, which is very lame.		People often get their [UNDERWEAR OF CHOICE] in a twist when it comes to the intersection of nude imagery and censorship, usually because the former can be (very tragically) associated with the exploitation or harassment of others.		But that's not always the case: as society progresses and everyone has a camera, the obvious case is that consenting adults are going to capture record sexual imagery and are comfortable uploading that content to the Internet. 		This presents a number of very difficult questions about how to differentiate between behavior that society/company/free Internet wants to promote and that which is subject to regulation. Of course, once regulation of content is involved, then, simply by definition, censorship is inherent to the discussion, and the consequences of that must be weighed. None of this is controversial; in fact, we already have a scheme that deals with these questions every day, the modern Copyright system.		A true "leader among peers" would weigh these questions heavily and cast the appropriate balance: making sure to value the importance of community input, *workable* policies, and (because it's a web property) software tools to make sure things go smoothly.		Reddit has barely done any of these things. Unlike Google or other major sites that deal with user content, there's no database where we can view takedown notices that reddit receives. It's unclear whether or not Reddit will ever seek OP or subreddit mod input in an attempt to determine whether or not there is a valid claim over the supposedly prohibited work. Reddit has released a transparency report, so kudos to them for that I guess, but it really only undercuts the complete house of cards that this "rah-rah we're protecting your privacy" policy really is.		We're supposed to believe that nudity/sexual content is some huge problem when there were only 218 content take down requests last year? And we're supposed to believe that people making claims under this vague/no questions asked new policy will always be legitimate when 62% of those 218 were completely bogus? And we're supposed to believe the admins will be perfect arbiters of this black box censorship when reddit has barely been a follower in the mandated-by-law statutory scheme we already have?

{"body":"Reddit isn't really a source of demand though. Demand for pornographic material is there regardless of reddit. You could argue it's a supplier... but it doesn't really produce the content, it doesn't even host it, just acts as a distributor. To reduce demand you'd have to raise the cost of viewing said porn. There are too many alternative hosting and sharing sites for this to have any real impact. Especially considering this isn't a blanket ban of porn, it's just a formalization of the removal process for affected parties. It'd be pretty costly for individuals to constantly browse reddit and fill out the proper forms to have their content removed given how simple it would be to re-host it. I doubt it'll significantly impact the amount of porn submitted to reddit, unless like I said before you're a celebrity that can hire a legal firm to constantly monitor the site. The effect on demand would be so negligible it's not really even worth counting. Even if reddit banned all porn without an actual country or statewide law you'd just end up incentivizing other sites to pop up and distribute it.		I think you're kind of wrong on the CP thing too. Making it illegal does decrease demand somewhat as it ups the cost, but they mostly target suppliers. The scarcity and cost of CP actually makes it far more lucrative and increases incentives to supply it, since if you can get away with it you can make a much larger profit. Same with drugs and other black markets. I think I remember reading CP demand isn't very elastic either, similar to drugs, because pedos are basically all mentally ill.

{"body":"The policy isn't about legal or illegal. Users on reddit are violating the DMCA/copyright law thousands of times a day. The process of suing each reddit user individually is basically impossible so it never happens. Very little of the posts on reddit would fall under fair use. That said, plenty of case law makes reddit as an organization fairly immune to this type of suit.		However, doesn't mean that there aren't serious violations on reddit, and every other website on the internet, but again the difference is liability of a user vs. the corporation. 		The problem is the lawsuits hung over reddit's head over the fappening, which is a totally different animal. Unlike an easy copyright suit that can be whisked away, these are much more serious to make go away, and could even lead to criminal jail time (however unlikely). It is very apparent that the reddit owners had a freakout over their liability and are trying hard to make themselves lawsuit proof at the expense of (some) reddit user freedoms. 		This is the rule so when the lawsuit comes, Reddit can be like "look judge, we took all these steps because we really care about not harming person X or Y, so we didn't intend for any of this to happen." It gives them a shield in the courtroom. This happens all the time with companies. It's smart to be proactive. 		The proof of all of this would be the restriction to sexual images only. If reddit actually cared about privacy they would have banned all posts on the website that made specific allegations about people without their consent. I fail to see the difference in violation between saying "Person X at this address is X or Y and did thing Z" without the consent of Person X, and posting a picture of someone without their consent. Except legally the laws for posting sexual images is more severe. 		It's another big step in Reddit's decision to move towards the "mainstream" and away from the dark cracks in the Internet from whence it came. A large part of that will be cracking down on a part of its traditional user base which is weird people on the Internet doing devious things. I will bet most weird/sexual explicit subreddits will continue to slowly be removed over time. I'm not sure if it's good or bad, it just is.

{"body":"I think the part that disturbs me is where the line gets drawn here. TMZ was a big part of those leaks, and whether or not you like them and the quality of their journalism, they do indeed do reporting and break news, including leaks. Same with, say, leaks of bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan, which I believe would fall under your "We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified." If a soldiers family requests video get taken down from /r/combatfootage, this policy allows you to do so the way that it is written. The Jordanian hostage video from ISIS, I can easily see videos like that being taken down by family members under this policy. I can go on and on, there are far too many cases where this vaguely written policy can be used to stifle internet freedom that has made Reddit a very special place, if not controversial.		I want to go back to the TMZ fappening photos. Paparazzi have reported leaked images and information about celebrities for a long time now. Are leaked videos of Ray Rice punching his wife not allowed on /r/nfl anymore, if say, Ray Rice's manager wanted it removed? It is private, it is violent, and it is leaked. **Private info, pictures, video, is released about celebrities all the time that makes its way into the news. This lets them cover up when the news is not so flattering to them. This is Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice's dream policy.**  I also think that it screams hypocrisy when Reddit focuses on the privacy of leaked nude pictures whenever it features subs that center around other illegal activity such as piracy, drug usage, sexual assault, etc.		It sounds to me like Reddit is just bowing to political pressure, and I disagreed with the removing of the fappening pictures (whenever they were released and distributed under actual media sources). It was unfortunate that the event happened, but Reddit was just linking to pictures that were being leaked by various agencies. Direct leaks to Reddit, of course, I can support them being banned, but whenever they are appearing elsewhere on the internet, Reddit (like google) should be a safe place to talk about them.

No one really cares about a "positive brigade" when something a community views as awesome happens and other similar communities link to it and flood it with support in the form of up votes and positive comments.		The actual problem is when "negative brigades" happen.  And a community is over run by ideologically opposed people who down vote everything and leave snarky negative comments (often nothing more than calling people retards and other disruptive trash).		This is why people look at SRS and affiliates (SRD) so often.  These communities that are narrowly focused on "things they don't like" become reddit bully brigades, it doesn't have to be all of them doing the brigading.  If 10% of them actively troll a targeted community's new queue then it causes disproportionate damage to the organic sorting of submissions.  I've seen posts that basically say "conspiracy theorists are retarded pedos" get voted up to the front page of /conspiracy while posts that the community traditionally are interested in are all sadly sitting at ZERO in the new queue.		There shouldn't be anything wrong with linking to another subreddit on reddit, the only reason it has become associated with something "bad" is because these bully brigade "we don't like you" subs are allowed to exist.		I can't imagine why reddit would, on one hand, ask all these strangers on the internet to come here and build up your community, while on the other hand they are allowing destructive groups of bullies to actively break a community because they don't like it.			http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2x82hh/jihadists_destroy_historic_statues_in_nineveh/		Its just like this video here /u/kn0thing,  it takes a masterful intelligent mind to create something after a lifetime of patient focus as discipline.

{"body":"It is my opinion that more often than not it feels like the general purpose of a "moderator" is to react to trouble reports and otherwise assist in enforcing the rules. But the way reddit has things set up, it makes the moderators seem like community leaders when in fact, enforcing the rules could be all that they are doing. As an example, /r/TheForest has 5 moderators (not counting automoderator), 4 are actively using reddit but "inactive" to the subreddit they moderate in regards to that they haven't posted anything to the subreddit in more than half a year, two of which are very active DayZ players. They could be moderating through the mod panel, but regular people can't see this or other forms of moderating activity except through posting patterns. In short it appears that 4 out of 5 moderators aren't participating in the growth of the subreddit, just moderating it.		Another issue that I see is that some redditors are moderating in excess of 50+ subreddits. It makes it seems like some people collect moderatorship and are proud of it, although I am aware of the fact that some people were named moderator without their approval (/u/Jeresig in /r/JavaScript as a likely example, I don't really know) before that policy changed.		I think defining community leaders / contributors as people that both actively participate and moderate in a subreddit would be a better indicator and contributor towards the health and growth of a subreddit.		**tl;dr**: Moderators aren't necessarily growers of communities. Redditors that actively participate in subreddits (moderators or not) should be noted.

{"body":"Yes. The way comments for a link are stored ("comment tree") is pretty inefficient. Basically any time you want to see a link, the apps have to grab a list of all of the comments for said link. Then they look through the list and throw out the vast majority of them and display only the top comments (according to the sort that you're looking at). This is mostly ok for small to medium comment trees. This really breaks down when it comes to comment trees for big popular threads.		The [4th quarter super bowl thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ugyjr/game_thread_new_england_patriots_124_at_seattle/) has 14985 comments and had something between [20,000 and 52,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditTraffic/comments/2uhrjq/20150201_traffic_on_rnfl_for_super_bowl_xlix/) active viewers on it. On top of that, every time someone commented on the thread, there is a process which would recompute all the sorts and overwrite the list of comments for everyone.		Basically what this does is slow down requests for any comment pages on the site (because they are the same groups of app servers) and also causes additional load on our databases (because it's stored in a not-great way) which ends up slowing down all requests on the site. More servers can actually make the problem worse by tying up our backend databases more which further slows everything down.		In the end, the way to fix this is to change how we store comment trees.

{"body":"EL5: 	The "NFL threads problem" is due to how reddit stores comment threads. When a thread becomes massive >30k comments and is being read extremely frequently our servers become a little busy and odd things start to happen across the environment. For instance, our app servers will go to memcache and say, "Hey, give me every comment ID for thread x", the memcache servers ship back an object that includes the ID of every comment ID for that thread.. Now the app server iterates through all the ids and goes to memcache again to fetch the actual comment. 		So imagine this happening extremely frequently, hundreds of times a second. This process is extremely fast and is fairly efficient, however there's a few drawbacks. A memcache server will max out the cache's network interface, somewhere typically at 2.5gb/s. When that link becomes saturated due to the number of apps (a lot) asking for something, the memcache servers will begin to slow down, a high number of TCP retransmits will occur, or requests will flat out fail. Sucks.		When the apps start slowing down and having to wait on memcache, database, or cassandra it'll hit a time threshold and the load balancer will send the dreaded cat picture to the client.		By splitting these super huge threads into smaller chunks it spreads the load across multiple systems which can deliver a better experience for you and also for reddit.

Again I am sure this has already been thought of and dismissed and I have no knowledge of how y'alls code is set up and what other technical difficulties you will run into. 				another quick and stupid question/idea.... when a thread is large how about you start off with all the comments minimized and then users expand a comment tree one at a time and you load when they hit the expand button? i am sure this would upset some users but it would be better to be serving some content in a slightly annoying way rather than not loading anything at all (which i would view as a greater annoyance)?","depth":5,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"templar_da_freemason","name":"t1_cow2od6","parent_id":"t1_covw38d","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1424847946,"created_utc":1424819146}

Definitely true.

{"body":"Wow, I'm terribly late to this so I won't be surprised if this gets ignored.		Don't you think you need to address the fact that old content is incredibly difficult to access on reddit? Now, I get that improving search is a difficult task and most advanced users use google site search anyway, but I'm astounded by how difficult it is to access my own old comments. Any user who's made more than a couple of thousand comments is going to face the same problem.		Your privacy policy states that my comments will not be deleted if I delete my account, just unlinked from my username. This means, to completely erase my comments (or check if I accidentally exposed personal information in the past), I have to find each of them individually. Even that would've been okay had it not been for the fact that you make it impossible to do so. My account only lists the last 1000 comments when sorted by date and that number will maybe rise to 2000 or 3000 with top, hot and controversial (there will be overlap). If I have more comments than that, I'll have to use google which completely ignores some of the smaller threads.		Any method other than that, such as a timestamp search or a sitedump, is way beyond the feasibility of a regular user.		And that means, if you're an old, heavy user, there will be comments on reddit that you will never be able to erase. Furthermore, those comments are essentially public and possibly accessible by 3rd party bots and scrapers as well as the reddit admins.		Say what you want, that sounds worse than Facebook or Twitter.		Both of those 'Machiavellian' services allow you to access an archive of your data to determine if there is content you'd like to remove. People flame those services on reddit every day despite the fact that reddit's own privacy philosophy seems to be shakier when it comes to giving users control over their own content.		I firmly believe you have to do something about this before you try to be 'a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy'. Please don't stand behind the cliched reply of database and framework constraints. And if you do, please don't brag about your privacy policy.","depth":0,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"furiousBobcat","name":"t1_coweqgm","parent_id":"t3_2x0g9v","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1424869440,"created_utc":1424840640}

There was a time when everyone (i.e. early adopters) had their own unique webpage, with their details, stories, photos, accomplishments, etc. Now those have been homogenised into Facebook profiles -- you don't really need your own personal dot com any more.		Similarly, I can see all the specialist forums, BBS, and alt.* usenet groups (and their modern equivalents) gradually being replaced by subreddits.

A moderator with some judgement would have understood that the lede was not editorialising, and left the article in place.		When it was taken down, I said "You all know who the moderators are and what you can do about this." I got a lot of "Uh, no, we don't".		Here's the thing: There are two things that can be done about moderators whose judgement in running their subreddits you disagree with.		You can petition them to change their moderation policies,		or you can form a new community with better moderation policies.		reddit is helping on both of those with the moderation tutorials — so that existing moderators can learn how better to lead (not boss) their communities — and so that redditors can, fluidly and with relative ease, organise and form new communities, if the moderation teams of particular communities have difficulty meeting the expectations of the crowd in their executive capacities.		There is no way to wrest a subreddit namespace away from a given owner. reddit shouldn't change their stance on that, IMO — that way lies madness.		There is absolutely nothing, save for the technical limits of the architecture that reddit and the Internet runs on, stopping people from walking away from communities that no longer serve their interests, and forming their own.

What good is "moderation policy" when every action moderators take is hidden from the public? Content is never marked as having been removed and it's up to the courtesy of the moderator to tell someone about the removal. Bad mods aren't at all forced to do that so they won't. There is no public ledger of moderation on a per-sub basis, and for that reason, there's no way to actually know what "moderation policy" is. When moderators are held are no longer able to hide from the public what they do with their powers, bad moderation will naturally be avoided.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LetItSnowden","name":"t1_cow3q3k","parent_id":"t1_covsn31","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1424849751,"created_utc":1424820951}

{"body":"Frankly, I don't think this problem requires heavy admin intervention. The way I see it, the admins are meant to focus on the underlying systemic functionality of reddit, keeping the gears turning and pipes clean.				"Subreddit politics" is more a community issue, **though** there are some things the admins could do to better empower us as communities to organize ourselves (see below). 			For instance, there is one key, systemic, underlying flaw that (I feel) lies at the root of this problem, one thing that (though it is too firmly entrenched in how reddit works for changes to be made to it easily) _has_ to be tweaked to get people to start doing what they should have been doing; namely, picking their subscribed subreddits more critically. And that thing is this:				**Subreddit names should not be the main descriptor of what a subreddit does**.			"But," you argue, "the names aren't the only descriptor. There is the sidebar description, the subreddit caption, and the like for users to look at."			The problem is that users don't look at those things as much as they simply gravitate towards "big names". This creates a disproportionate acceptance of certain subreddits as "main" ones or "hubs," simply because of the name - thus, whoever snaps up the name first gets "power" irrespective of whether they are the best fit for the job.				A lot of longtime users now know certain truths about reddit. _"Unsubscribe from the defaults. [These] are better instead. Smaller subs generally have better communities."_ Unfortunately, these aren't things that someone just joining the system isn't going to intuitively induce - all they're going to know how to do is find subreddits by just typing in a name and seeing if it exists, or using search, or sidebar links.			So the system should be tweaked such that that user has an easier time of finding subreddits relating to a specific topic. In other words, weakening the "subreddit name" as the most-well-seen indicator of what a subreddit is/does.			[I have a project on the backburner](http://imgur.com/GcvNBx4) that I think would help me visualize reddit better, and deassociate the names from topics. Though at the end of the day, even if people like me create extensions/userscripts/websites to try and address this issue, it won't do much because it'll just be another thing a new user _wouldn't know to look for_ - which is why I hold out hope that the admins implement systemic changes such as this or others (I've heard a couple of ideas for handling the "default subreddit" problem, though I can't remember any I liked; have a whole rant on that too in a textfile somewhere) that would help the community as a whole start seeing subreddits as non-unique despite the unique-naming and catalyze changes in how reddit's community addresses these 'issues.'

{"body":"If you want to encourage people to create more communities (subreddits) you need to make non-default sub-reddits more relevant, and decrease the overall power that the mods of default subs have.		One way of doing this is by turning the default subs into multireddits that get their content from more specific subs.  For example, there's no reason for there to be an actual community around "/r/funny" or "/r/pics"  These should just be aggregators of whatever rises to the top in more specific subreddits.		Doing it this way would reduce needless crossposting, and it would draw more people into the more specific subreddits, where they would have to post if they want to see their posts graduate to the front page.  These days, people who are out for karma just post to a default sub and don't even consider posting to a more specific sub that might appreciate their content.		For instance, someone with a funny cat pic would be encouraged to post to /r/funnycatpics (no idea if that actually exists) and then the funnier pics there would get picked up by /r/pics .		Even better would be for the defaults to feed on a tree of subreddits, where posts get picked up by more and more generic subreddits, but you could always drill back down to find where the post originated.		This would improve the variety of content on the front page, and probably reduce the amount of reposts, because it would be a lot harder to get a repost promoted through multiple levels than it is to just post in one of the default subs, where so many people see it immediately.		For example, with news, you'd get someone posting to a local subreddit, which would get picked up by their country's subreddit, after which the World News subreddit would pick it up (if the news is "big" enough.)  Seems like that's how it should work.		I've posted this suggestion many times in the past.  I usually get a respectable ratio of upvotes vs downvotes, and a healthy amount of encouraging comments.  I know this is not a perfect solution, and I know there will still be ways of exploiting it, but every way I look at it, it's at least an improvement over the current situation.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"shutz2","name":"t1_cowavx8","parent_id":"t3_2x0g9v","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1424862325,"created_utc":1424833525}

Most people tend to become miserable and depressed when they're subjected to that. Depression is known to drain a person's motivation, and that makes it incredibly difficult to improve your living conditions. It takes motivation to make major lifestyle changes. By contrast, when people treat you like a person who still has value, then you tend to be happier, and you just might be able to get up the motivation to live a healthier life for your own reasons.		People like you often talk about how they hate fat people for being irresponsible and for living an unhealthy lifestyle that they ostensibly have the power to change. You say that it's their fault alone for being fat. You ignore that many of them were raised with bad eating habits that are difficult to change, and you ignore that your attitudes are (by virtue of being so widespread and vicious) a major obstacle to many fat people who otherwise could build up the motivation to change their lifestyles.

You don't have to be a "fan club president", you just have to find mods willing to do the jobs you won't do while you're busy getting into stupid arguments elsewhere on reddit. You don't even have to give away the subreddit to do that. The creator of a community can bring in new mods and set permissions for what they're allowed to do. You could have 50 people as mods just for spam and stickying posts. You could have mods just for policing spoilers. You wouldn't have to do anything. 		But you're so stuck on mod power giving you the validation you're clearly not receiving out in your regular life, you don't care that the subreddit's a mess, just as long as you don't have to do any actual work or share mod power. 		It's embarrassing. And since your account is *eight years old* I can also assume you're over the age of 15.

I offered to help you privately in modmail, because clearly the subreddit needs a spoiler/spam manager as well as someone to run regular discussions like every other normal tv subreddit does. I offered again in [the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/2u47dx/meta_in_case_anyone_was_curious_about_the_mod/) that finally ended any hope you would let someone/anyone who actually cares about the subreddit take care of it. 		We just reacted to your statements on the matter. This was no "stealing your garbage" type of action lol. For years the subreddit has needed more effective moderation and for years you have refused to do anything for it. You made it perfectly clear that even asking you to fix the mod issues on the subreddit would be a bannable offense. What choice did we have? You told us if we didn't like the way you ran things to go somewhere else. So after exhausting all other options we did just that. 		You have the right to squat on the subreddit and do nothing. It's clearly spelled out in Reddit's rules that you can do that. But is that really all that fun for you at this point? /r/SupernaturalTV is trying to pick up the slack and we can keep doing that, but the people who are mostly being impacted by this are the /r/Supernatural  subscribers who are not getting the kind of subreddit that one would expect for a TV sub on reddit. 		I said at the time, you don't have to accept my help but at least let someone run the sub who actually wants to do it. Just saying that the subreddit needs someone to run it is not a directed personal insult towards you. It's just the facts. 40k subscribers should have at least a mod team of 5 people, a couple CSS mods and a few community mods to handle the daily stuff.

I'm not a shipper or a big fan of fan fictions etc, in fact I'm pretty well known for not liking them. That is not what this is about.
