{"body":"On the topic of PM harassment, how would you feel about a button that either party could press to allow a PM to be read by Reddit admins? It would open just that PM thread, and only to admins, along with a note about why it was forwarded. Sorry if something like that is already available. I just figure it's better than taking images that can be altered and it allows admins to follow along if the harassment continues from one user.","depth":0,"score":3747,"ups":3747,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Aaron215","name":"t1_ctk96h7","parent_id":"t3_3f10up","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438207792,"created_utc":1438178992}

But it also seems like it might start creating headaches for mods and admins when someone who doesn't know they've been zapped can't understand what's happening in conversations and reports it as a mystery. If they just don't get any bites on their attacks on the other hand, because the person can't see the attacks, that doesn't lead to confusion or support scenarios.

To use it to squelch and control actual user's political speech is, in my eyes, a detestable practice though. This happens all the time here on reddit. That is admin territory though. Much more common are subreddit banns.		See, it use to be the admins tried to put up a front of professional aloofness, just letting their pet powermods do the dirty work (as they still do). Lately even that curtain has dropped, and the admins are doing the shit work themselves, in plain view. Straight up banning select subs while letting others go on, even though they are guilty of exactly the same. /r/ShitRedditSays is one major hub of superMods that control dosens, if not hundereds of other subs, many of them defaults. The admins are completely ignoring, even condoning the cancerous behavior of this minorty of super powerful mods, and the blatant censorship of reddit for their own political and monetary gain.		Look up any of the "undelete" type subreddits. There are examples galore of the monitization and blatant censorship that really goes on here. It has been heading in this direction for years, and lately is really picking up speed.		Oh, I fully agree with you. We desperately need full transparency for sub banns. Legitimate anti-spam shadow banning needs to be secret, or it defeats the purpose, but it needs to be bedrock solid policy to NEVER use that for political or profit purposes against common users, simply because of a difference of opinion.	The same should go for mods banning people because of thier own petty beliefs. Freedom of speach is what this forum was designed on, and to try to control the "direction" of that is not only deserving of ridicule, but it is insanely misguided.

{"body":"Cute.  While yes, shadowbans require an admin to carry them out, when admins just rubber stamp every request, that is no different than the mods having the power directly.		So there are two scenarios.  An admin gets the requests and just shadowbans any account without investigating at all(this means the mod can lie to get the ban approved), or they have a bot that just implements any shadowban request by a mod to a certain mailbox without any human intervention at all.		Take your pick. Both result in mods having the direct ability to shadowban for any reason.		I got shadowbanned by a mod because I told him to stop censoring my posts.  He told me he never censored any post.  I gave him proof by logging out and taking a screen.  Not 5 minutes later, I was shadowbanned from all of reddit.  Which was crazy, it wasn't even a subreddit ban.  He purposely wanted it to seem like I could still post in the subreddit and an admin apparently approved it.		How the hell does that happen if admins aren't just approving every request blindly?  If an admin read the conversation, it was clear the mod lied about ghosting the comments.		The mod could have simply said, "Yes I hid the comments and I will hide any comments I don't like, I am the mod you are not."  Instead he said, "I did not censor any of your comments and all of them are still visible."		Due tell, how does a mod not have the power to shadowban if he can get someone who simply proved he lied shadowbanned in under 5 minutes?  That isn't even a rule violation in the subreddit or sitewide.

In my office, our CS team has a concept of Public and Private comments on issues. All comments on all issues are considered private and not exposed to the clients. 		When a comment is deemed of value (or, at least, far enough along that it's not something we're afraid of showing), the comment is marked Public.

If I had my druthers, I would love to be able to just sift through your JIRA to see what's actively being worked on, what issues have come up... what the devs actually think about any given issue. 		I recognize that this is not good business. If you show people how the sausage is made, it opens you up to a whole assortment of disasters. 		However, if you could come up with a system wherein certain comments are marked as interesting and valuable, and then have an automated process for posting these to a dedicated sub, you could demonstrate to the userbase the stuff you're working on without having to create a post and then stick around to answer comments (lest you are accused of hit-and-run). 		Granted, this would require some trust on your part. No amount of 'safe harbor' statements will prevent some people from holding you to the letter of a statement. 		And you really couldn't remove posts from this system without suffering accusations of trying to hide things. 		You'd also have to train the devs and cms to correctly identify comments worth sharing. The comments would have to exist a-contextually (since we don't have access to your issue tracking system), and would have to be careful not to reveal privileged information. 		If the system required a vetting process that was too complex or time consuming, then that is all you would do and it wouldn't be worth it. It has to be almost totally automated. 		If you could resolve these complications, I think it would be a great way to share with the community. It could even serve as a crowd sourcing platform for trying to come up with ideas to solve specific complications. 		It might be more work than it's worth. I'll just say as a user and a professional dev, I prefer too much communication to too little.","depth":2,"score":70,"ups":70,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"antiproton","name":"t1_ctkb3qe","parent_id":"t1_ctk9k2w","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438210741,"created_utc":1438181941}

{"body":"I'm a developer, and I love it when I get “User Stories”. So, I'm going to assume everyone is like me and give you a User Story:		---		George is a young professional and enjoys redditting during breaks (or at least, that's what he'll admit to the boss). He has a dozen or so subreddits that he follows, including /r/bestof, /r/ShitRedditSays , and /r/TumblrInAction.		One morning, a cross-reddit link is posted in the latter forum lampooning some exceptionally naïve SJWing elsewhere on reddit. (Sure, the link probably violates TIAs rules, but it was early and the mods weren't fully caffinated yet and missed it.) George laughs at the obvious troll and reflexively downvotes. He then heads to /r/bestof to see what's new there.		About an hour later (maybe less), George gets a PM. “Odd,” George thinks, “I don't usually get PMs.” He opens it to read this:		> George, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/TumblrInAction on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. This is your first warning, which will expire after a month of good behaviour.		“Oh, dear,” George thinks, “I didn't realize that was brigading. I'll make sure not to vote like that in the future.”		Three weeks later, George upvotes a thread linked from /r/bestof. It was early and, this time, it was he that hadn't had his coffee. He gets another message:		> George, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/bestof on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. This is your second warning, which will expire after a month of good behaviour. Unfortunately, because of your repeated brigading, you may no longer vote on content until you have fewer than two warnings active. Please read our <link>Reddit Warnings FAQ</link>.		George is normally a level-headed guy, but this time, he loses his cool. He creates a new account and heads over to that same link and downvotes it another time, just for good measure. He then receives the following PM:		> GeorgeAlt, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/bestof on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. Records show that you are an alternate account of George, which means you share the two warnings you already have. Both GeorgeAlt and George are now banned from reddit for the next month, at which time, both accounts will drop back to two warnings. Please be aware that creating additional accounts to circumvent this ban will result in permanent bans as well as possibly other administrative action. <more links to rules and faqs>		---		The key takeaway here is that George's punishments were proportional to his crimes, and, at first, aimed at educating him in correct behaviour. Also, his minor errors expire fairly quickly, but continued errors over time will build up. And the system automatically prevented him from getting himself in extra trouble without his working around it. (You can't brigade if you can't vote. Also note: if you can't vote, you are at an automatic disadvantage commenting, since your comment starts at 0 instead of 1.) Critically, all this happened without mod or admin intervention, which is the only way it can possibly work.

Key length is decided on how fast it can be factored, not how fast it takes from a user's standpoint.		>is unbreakble by other methods other than factoring		Not true. A group of researchers have broken it by using microphones to listen to a CPU while it created the key, I think that was a ~~1024~~ 4096 bit key.		Additionally, you can break RSA in any number of ways, it just so happens that factoring N is way easier.		>the point of RSA is that it is a "one-way" function at it's core		This kinda stuff bugs me, when people do that "lemme tell you what I know about RSA". Believe me, I'm well versed in RSA, I've had courses based upon the theory.		My point still stands that RSA is and will never be 100% secure, and that nobody is yelling "WE NEED A 100% RSA".

Now, the issue is indeed, that we use RSA keys again and again, instead, in my opinion at least, keys and certificates should indeed start to have short expiry dates...

Similar user names, create the account from the IP of the blocked account, create the account with the same user agent (browser name, version, etc) as the user last used, similar trend in posting patterns after the account is created, etc.		Note:  I don't work for reddit so this is only speculation on my part.","depth":13,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"casualblair","name":"t1_ctklpl7","parent_id":"t1_ctklgcm","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438225130,"created_utc":1438196330}

{"body":">I clearly specified legal speech. You're outright lying here.		What legal speech is banned on reddit? I'm not sure what you're getting at. The only things subreddits have been banned for recently are harassment and ban evasion, to my knowledge. 		>Prove it.		I don't have to? Ask the admins to do that or something. Their stated reasons for banning the subreddit was harassment, so they presumably have evidence. They could be lying, sure, but if they were why would they not use the same lies to ban more heinous subreddits like /r/coontown?		Besides that, there are posts floating around that offer some (incomplete) evidence for harassment, [such as this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39c0n3/cmv_reddit_was_wrong_to_ban_rfatpeoplehate_but/cs27yt4?context=3). I imagine the admins have much more conclusive evidence, since they stated as much, and that mods weren't taking action to prevent it (or were encouraging it).		>They did it for years, and continue to. I get death threats from them regularly.		Oh, will that constitutes evidence then, better lock them up now.		Seriously, if you have evidence of that subreddit harassing you and threatening to kill you, and that moderators are aware and doing nothing about it, why don't you post it somewhere and show the admins?		>reddit admins are aiding and abetting a militant, dangerous, very real hate group, and so are you.		How did I aid or abet them in any way? What? I've never posted there at any point. Is calling them an overblown boogeyman "aiding and abetting" now? You've also never told me how they're dangerous at any point, this is bizarre. 		Also, I seem to recall a ton of GamerGate's favorite targets getting death threats too, like Sarkeesian or whatever her name is. Even if you believe that some people faked some death threats, which AFAIK is the common claim, surely you believe that at least *some* of threats were real, given the rather extreme vitriol surrounding some of GamerGate's favorite people. Does that make GamerGate a "militant, dangerous, very real hate group"? Are the admins aiding and abetting them? Are you?		I'm sure you disagree that it is, so why make SRS into the same boogeyman.		>How is demanding ethics, free speech, accountability, and non-entryism in any way hateful?		Pretending that a large portion of GamerGate serves as a "lets hate on 'SJWs' platform is just silly. Everyone knows they do it. By your criteria for a hate group from your last comment, hating SJWs makes GamerGate and subs like KiA "hate groups". There are also plenty of arguments to be made that those subs have a strong negative bias towards women, transgendered individuals, and other minorities. Clearly those aren't the primary focus, but you can find examples in relative abundance.		>How is demanding ethics, free speech, accountability, and non-entryism in any way hateful?		Just because those are the stated goals doesn't mean it's all they do. By that logic, the stated goals of SRS are just to point out shitty comments made on reddit, so how is that in any way hateful? Clearly it's about the actual content posted by users. Just as you think SRS is hateful (in addition to pointing out shitty comments), others would claim that KiA is hateful (in addition to discussing gaming journalism and whatnot).		>You are a fucking liar.

{"body":"Sure, shadowbanning is how Reddit deals with those who break their site rules. These are mostly spammers, but also those who engage in vote manipulation, or vote in subreddits after being redirected there from somewhere else. This is done to ensure that "smaller" communities have their own place to discuss the things they like, without being bothered by other groups.		Meaning that MyLittlePony fans shouldn't be made fun of or downvoted in their own subreddit by those who end up there because a news site or a different subreddit links to a post in /r/mylittlepony. 		This doesn't just apply to /r/mylittlepony, but also /r/blackladies, /r/timberframe and /r/afrobeat and more controversially but just as important, the racist as fuck, /r/CoonTown. Now I don't necessarily believe hate speech needs to be harbored by Reddit. But they do need to enforce their site rules in **all** their subreddits.		If you spam, or do what I described above, or try and bypass subreddit bans by using alternate accounts, you'll get shadowbanned. At first glance, nothing really seems to be different to you, you can still post comments, and upvote/downvote submissions and comments, but people stop replying to your comments.		They're not replying to your comments because they can not see them. While everything still looks fine on your end, nobody can see your comments. Your votes don't do anything. Reddit tricked you. They want you to think you can still Reddit normally, because as long as you don't know your spam messages/votes aren't coming through, you won't make another account or look for a solution to that problem.		[Take a look at this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/cjam1dc), this is a pretty famous shadowban case. Unidan was banned for vote manipulation, using 5 puppet accounts to upvote his own posts, and downvote those who he thought were teaching incorrect facts, so he had more visibility among them. /u/Unidan is his userpage, as you can see, his userpage does not exist. If Unidan were to log into Reddit and visits his userpage, it still exists for him, meaning that he sees all his old comments.		So all you need to do to see if you're shadowbanned, is visit your own userpage while not logged in. A quick way to do this in Chrome, is to right-click your own username and open the link in an incognito window.		**tl;dr**, shadowbanning is Reddit's way of segregating you from the rest of the people on the site without you knowing it, by breaking Reddit Site rules, you can visit your own userpage while not being logged into Reddit to check whether you're shadowbanned or not.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Xaguta","name":"t1_ctkdjs7","parent_id":"t1_ctkbtdx","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438214198,"created_utc":1438185398}

Shadowbanning wasn't ever meant to be used on USERS.  It was only ever originally intended to be used against BOTS.  Spam bots, to be specific.  And now they (the bots), like most any half-way savey user, can easily tell if they're shadowbanned or not (log out, go to your userpage... can you see  it?  No? Then you're shadowbanned) 		And so now:  shadowbans are mostly used against regular users, which was never the intention, and is incredibly cruel to those who aren't savvy enough to tell that they have been shadowbanned (even though its trivially easy) since they could potentially go on wastring their time using their account, not knowing that nobody can see what they're doing.   Thats fine if you're a bot, cruel if you're a human.   They are obsolete for so many reasons, and are just plain cruel to users who may or may not have done something that bad.		I had my account shaddowbanned once, because another account from the same IP (My girlfriend) upvoted a lot of my comments once...  Because she was supporting me in an argumet..  The system thought I was "vote manipulating" and shadowbanned me... I had no idea for days, wasted tons of time figuring out what was going on, and eventually had an Admin un-shadowban me and tell me "yea sorry.. this actually happens a lot with people who live together, and do things together on reddit, you didn't actually break any rules, it was just an unfortunate accident".  HAPPENS, ALL, THE TIME... its bullshit, and unless you know enough to check whether or not you are shadowbanned like me, you might just be fucked... because you'd never know you were banned, for all the wrong reasons too. 		TL;DR: Shadowbans are only fucking over inocent people, who were likely banned for bullshit reasons, who dont know any better.   Any real troll or bot knows how to get around them, and they do nothing.","depth":5,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Orbitrix","name":"t1_ctkacmv","parent_id":"t1_ctk9jxi","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438209620,"created_utc":1438180820}

They don't want you making new accounts.		>Most shadowbans aren't a "never use the site again" sort of thing. It's just banning a single account, and if you don't run afoul of the rules you can keep going on your new account.		You are ignoring what a shadowban is.  You get shadown banned when they set your account in the system as a spam account.  A shadowban is an anti-spam tool.  It was never meant for banning accounts based on opinions.		What else comes with a shadownban?  Because your account is flagged as a spam account, it actually will shadownban any new account created on the same IP address also used by the shadownbanned account.  This is how it currently works.  Now it does seem to have some protections against larger shared IPs.  Such as if you are in a classroom at school and 30 other people are logged in, it won't shadownban people sharing that IP with the shadowbanned account.  But your home IP is burned. Because it has so few accounts using that IP, it is blacklisted by the spam filter.  So any new accounts or existing accounts using your home IP are automatically shadowbanned.  This means roommates, spouses, children, etc.  A friend from out of town visits and uses your connection, he is shadowbanned.		Now if you have an ISP that lets you reset the IP by resetting the modem, you can do that and the next customer that gets the IP will get their accounts shadowbanned if they use reddit because now they have the flagged IP.		tl;dr  	A shadowban only happens when they set your account as a SPAM account in their anti-spam system.  It means your IP address is also flagged and any accounts sharing your IP will also be shadowbanned.  New and existing accounts.  If you have been shadowbanned, that means they want you banned from reddit forever.

{"body":""See an asshole in the morning, you've seen an asshole. See assholes all day, you're the asshole."		That's the usual quoted context of the idea I was referring to, which is neither disclaiming responsibility, nor is it an immature idea. Quite the opposite, really. It suggests that each of us look not only at others behavior, but also at our own perception of those behaviors. If you're constantly seeing other people as having a problem, perhaps it's your perception that is the problem. He/She has "**never** observed one who had emotionally matured past the age of 3" (emphasis added). Should we draw the conclusion that **nobody** has matured past the age of 3? No, that's obviously not true. Apparently, there is some context, most likely a biased one, that has shaped their perception to draw an inaccurate conclusion on this point. Confirmation bias, which we are all subject to, will reaffirm this position in their mind, and they will continue to perceive immaturity even where it doesn't actually exist.		I intentionally didn't disagree with the rest of their sentiment, because there will certainly be people who opt-in and then complain about the content that they agreed to see.

You start to feel like what you're working on really matters, is important, and anyone who doesn't join up the cause is wasting their time being indecisive because you *know* in your heart that this issue matters and you are on the correct side of it.  Take this and apply it to multiple issues across a broader ideology, and you form large teams of opposing ideologies.   Then the perception develops that anyone outside of this "team" class (no matter which side of the issue) are not passionate or are indecisive and a waste of space.		I understand that you personally don't agree with that premise, but that's where yours and my opinions on the matter diverge and thus why I thought we'd probably not be able to land on a decent conversation.

{"body":"I agree 100%, but I guess I'd just add to the example that within that group of humans who are of a like mind, exists a nuance to each of their ideologies.  They agree *mostly* on *most* things, but there is wiggle room from person to person.  On a smaller scale, this works fine as things can be discussed and hashed out to reach a moderate version of the story between the ideological leaning group's more progressive and more conservative approaches.		The tendency for vastly large groups to form, and then for the loudest, most impassioned and extreme voices of that group to Shepard the flock and drive the group ideology in one direction or another, is my primary hang up in joining a team and shouting down the other team.  If there's no room for nuance within the goals of my own team because of the scale of the thing, then there's certainly going to be no room for nuance when trying to debate and compromise with the other ideology's team.  Then it becomes a race to the most extreme versions of each ideology in order to clearly separate the "right" group from the "wrong" group and in the end.. you have a very polarizing paradigm and everyone who is not comfortable with hardlining either ideology is somewhere in the middle, left to be perceived as indecisive and for lack of a better term, chickenshit on the important issues of our time.		I do take your point though and don't in any way decry you for having your positions on things set and taking up the cause.  I just don't think that those who have not yet gone all in on an ideology, or maybe never will, are to be criticized for doing so.  Not every human mind is geared towards these issues, and not every human mind should form an opinion on certain issues as well.  Everyone comes from a different background, and some people shouldn't really even be forming an opinion on certain issues.. and yet in today's world it seems you need to have an opinion on everything to be considered politically conscious.

They're still reddit users and reddit itself is under no obligation to start branding people based on the content they view. Should they tag you with a "SJW" label? I'm sure you don't view that term favorably either (and before you say anything, I'm not arguing the merits of it, just trying to make a point). There's a reason these things aren't done.

Also, I'd like to point out that the original question above was about whether or not opting in to SEE the content would tag you.

I commented on that screenshot, "I swear these people interact on the level of children." Nothing racist or sexist or homophobic or even rude, I simply criticized the mods of /r/me_irl for doing the internet equivalent of plugging their ears and screaming. All of this took place outside their subreddit, mind you, and I still got banned for the stated reason that they don't want *trolls* like me "coming into their house and shitting on their floor" (because anyone who publicly calls you out on your shit is obviously just waiting to spam hateful remarks in the modmail and comments and deserves a preemptive ban).

{"body":"So it's a shadowban.		Edit:  so this is clearly an unpopular thought. I've distilled it into a single sentence that includes  very divisive word.  I standby what I've said, so I feel like I had better flesh out my idea for clarity.		Shadowbans exist for the sole purpose of quietly separating a nuisance from the rest of community.  Not to enforce Reddit's rules.  The community agrees when they use the site that the rules ought to be enforced, users are banned when they break site rules.  Shadowbanning is unnecessary when a banning is administered because site rules have been broken.  		 Shadowbans are convenient for admin because they allow them to enforce unwritten rules.  When a user is acting within the posted site rules, but breaking unwritten rules they are quietly quarantined to a site experience of conversing with only themselves.  Nobody hears their voice, yet they are made to feel as though they still have one. 		 /u/spez has clearly stated the new quarantine option is for subreddits that are not breaking site rules.   		Users interact in subreddits, if subreddits interact anywhere on reddit, it is on /r/all, where posts and subreddits gain attention from the general user base.  If you remove a subreddit from /r/all you effectively remove its voice from being heard from the rest of reddit.

SRS should have been banned a long time ago. My point is in respect to the original comment. FPH was in violation of rules that were bannable offenses and would still be bannable offenses after the ability to hide offensive subs is introduced. The fact that they made a nuisance of themselves leading up to it and aren't in agreement with the Reddit hive mind is obviously why they garnered the attention for the ban, but it doesn't change the fact that they still committed bannable offenses, besides general in-sub harassment and being distasteful.		Honestly, though, if you want to make a case about banning SRS and can get them for a recent violation that their mods supported, I'm right behind you and will be in the comments there saying that the ban is legit.

No. Because this is not necessarily a bad thing, we need not argue against it. This mechanism is what allows us to judge things on a case by case basis, since the point of policy is to protect the integrity of the community, not adhere to the rules for the sake of the rules.

{"body":"A bunch of people have already responded with regards to the humanity of black people not being an "argument" to "win."  But here's another consideration.		Let's pretend there was an "argument," and your intention was to foster this argument with the good intentions of potentially converting virulent racists to not be racist anymore.		Where is this argument taking place?  Not on coontown, that's for sure.  A sub entirely dedicated to posting about how awful black people are is the lions den for any brave souls wishing to spread a bit of truth around.  Plus, it's privately maintained; they can "silence opposition" themselves.		Where it will take place is the rest of reddit, with comments calling black people theives when there is a picture of something that is black, or endless "dindu nuffin" quotes on endless posts about somebody black doing anything.  Hosting a subreddit for racism means *racists will create accounts*, and creating an account makes it more likely for someone to comment on the rest of Reddit.		So basically, if you're true intention is to host a debate about racism, you are then putting a burden on every single subreddit not specifically dedicated to that cause to still have to participate.  Cat pics, sports teams, video game communities; every single one will also have to be about racism.  Even if that participation is banning a bunch of users who may not have even bothered to come to Reddit had they not had a racism hub to join.		"You can't win an argument by silencing the opposition" only applies when there is an actual argument going on.

{"body":"> your intention was to foster this argument with the good intentions of potentially converting virulent racists to not be racist anymore.		That's not how that works.  For the most part, the virulent racists are too far gone, they're lost.  We can't get them back.  The problem is, when you drive their message underground, where nobody can address it and where they cut out any dissent, the non-virulent racists and even the undecided just get a reinforcement of shit piled on shit.  It's the reason why you can still go to small racially homogeneous towns in this country and find racism (not always, by any means).  Sure, we're driving it underground, but as we've seen with so many things (religion, drug use, crime, etc.) driving something underground doesn't stop it, and can even aid it.		> Hosting a subreddit for racism means racists will create accounts		Hosting a popular public forum means that racists will create accounts, and any other non-negligible group of people.  		> It does not apply to Reddit as a whole, unless you want to force Reddit as a whole to host the "debate" on racism.		It seems he specifically doesn't want Reddit *as a whole* to host this debate.  If he starts censoring he specifically includes Reddit as a whole in the debate, but if he leaves it alone, and lets those subs do their thing in the corner, it doesn't include all of Reddit, but just those parts.

{"body":"> If this site TRULY wants to advocate free speech		And this is exactly my point: I don't think they should, at least not to this degree. Free speech is a great thing to a point, but some of it is harmful. Even the first amendment, which is one of the strongest guarantees of free speech in the world, has exceptions. Governments and other monopolies like, say, the root DNS, should be held to the highest standard of free speech possible, because anything they do censor can have a powerful chilling effect, unfairly destroying entire areas of discourse. They need to tread very carefully when considering the lines between free speech, harassment, threats, hate speech, etc. because the damage that can be done is so great. 		Reddit is trying to meet that standard too, but they don't have to. It's a private website providing free discussion forums to anyone who wants to form a community, but it's just one site on the entire web. The code is even open source, so it's not even the only place where you can have a reddit-style community. The threat posed by tyrannical admins is minimal at best. Worst case scenario, everyone goes to voat or back to Digg or whatever. 		Of course, they can choose to hold themselves to a high standard anyway, for idealistic reasons, but I don't think that it's working out well for anyone. In some cases, there's interesting and good debate happening about controversial things. Social justice has been a big deal here in recent years, and I've learned a lot and expanded my mind as a result. There's perennial topics like abortion and circumcision and men's rights and feminism and affirmative action where passions run high but people are still capable of having a discussion about it, and even changing their minds once in a while. That stuff is all great, and I'm all in favor of keeping it around even if one side is offensive to the other side. Then there's things like coontown, or pics of dead kids, or raping women, or fat people hate, and many variations on those. These places aren't enabling a rational discourse. No one is experiencing new and interesting ideas as a result of these places. They're just gross and harmful. As evidenced by the fact that even reddit, with its singleminded pursuit of free speech above all else, is hiding these terrible places behind a wall so that people don't see them. If there's such a concern about giving them a space too, why hide it from everyone else? Why create second-class citizens? It solves nothing, because they lose their free speech cred but they also don't fix any of the criticism they're getting!		And giving these communities a free home online doesn't just have minimal benefit, it's also got serious drawbacks. These groups get a huge platform to spread their hatred, they get talked about because of all the controversy, and they drag down the reputation of the site as a whole. Stormfront has been around for ages, and they're just as terrible as coontown, so what's the difference? The difference is no one gives a shit about Stormfront because they're doing their own thing on their own site. The coontown people are doing it here, and people talk about them because it's scandalous to have such virulent racism on one of the top sites. They all already have accounts here. When they're looking at their shit, it's right there intermixed with mainstream content. They get to feel normal, because hey, they're just using reddit like anyone else, and they're seeing all the same stuff. It's so easy for them to feel comfortable writing racist shit whenever a black person is in a video because reddit lets them create a world that is more racist than the world actually is. And those comments spread and draw more racist comments in mainstream subreddits. Or someone debates them and mentions their posting history, and all the other racists or even just misguided people get links to where they can find more racism. And again, it's all on reddit, a mainstream site, so it's getting a boost of legitimacy. This is a choice that reddit makes, to enable the spread of racism, and it's fair to criticize them for it. 		That's all fine for reddit if that's the kind of site they want to run. You can choose to have a free site where anything goes, or you can have a site where people feel comfortable just mentioning that they're black or a woman. But you can't have both. Censorship will drive the people you're censoring away, but in this case, with those people left unchecked they have created a site with a reputation for shitty stuff, which also keeps people away. You can't satisfy everyone, so who should reddit satisfy? Personally, I pick the non-racists every time. We aren't giving them the Internet death penalty here, we're just making them live somewhere else. The ones we drive away will be replaced by much better and more interesting people with different viewpoints than the typical nerdy white males of reddit. That's a much better catalyst for free speech than the "opportunity" to hear the same racist garbage over and over. 		All the concerns at this point are hypothetical, and the benefits of banning them are real. Reddit as a site will not suffer if the racist networks alone get shut down. They are doing zero good and plenty of harm. It *might* suffer if they start shutting down other stuff, but they don't seem likely to go too far, if anything they won't go far enough, and when they do really make a mistake they'll hear plenty of backlash for it and be able to undo it.","depth":8,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaos750","name":"t1_ctlnlaa","parent_id":"t1_ctldc0l","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438301182,"created_utc":1438272382}

But they still have the right to speak their minds. 		Do we have to listen to them? No we dont. Can we give them hell for their opinions? All day, every day.

Buckley is there to convince the room of his opinions, particularly that segregation was a good thing, or at least, a necessary evil. While Baldwin, one of the foremost authors of his generation, soundly trounces him, I want you to consider: For a minority, they're James Baldwin at Cambridge college several times in their lives.

There are some exceptions, most of them jokes, and I'm not sure what the right answer is there.

There's a difference between jokes about race and being racist. It's not even a very subtle one. Jokes about race are jokes in which race is an element. Being racist is when your joke is clearly attacking a group of people for being the group of people they are.

[Even SPLC](http://www.splcenter.org/Black-Hole), a well known civil rights organization, has said it on record that, "The most violently racist internet content isn't found on sites like Stormfront and VNN any more." Thats right. Reddit racists are more brazen than the good ol' stormfront which mostly functions as a buzzword for racism now a days.","depth":10,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"teapot112","name":"t1_ctl68ja","parent_id":"t1_ctl38yy","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438257424,"created_utc":1438228624}
{"body":"I imagine quite a few stormfront users have permanently migrated to reddit in the last few years; that would certainly fit with their "discourse poisoning" strategy. I'd be interested to hear your argument as to why either one is particularly threatening, or to what- I certainly didn't think that of stormfront's earlier efforts, and like I said I've seen less outright racism lately than when I first joined.		I read the article earlier so I had heard the sentiment; it doesn't actually qualify or quantify the author's opinion very much though- are they saying the content itself is more violent? The subs more popular? I'm not really familiar enough with stormfront or the chimpire to say, and the article doesn't give a comparison.","depth":11,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"selectrix","name":"t1_ctl6ux1","parent_id":"t1_ctl68ja","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438258704,"created_utc":1438229904}

{"body":"Worry about the slippery slope if the site actually starts sliding. This isn't a "first they came for the..." situation, no one is being sent to a concentration camp. We're talking about banning people from a free website, and in the worst case scenario where the slope really is too slippery everyone just goes somewhere better and life continues on. 		That seems pretty unlikely, though, considering how hard they're clinging to their free speech ideals even in the face of so much evidence that it's a bad idea. If anything, they could stand to move a few feet down that slippery slope. It's become clear that reddit as a whole is being way too permissive. They've created a site where toxic communities can thrive and sometimes actually hurt and abuse people, all for $0. (And for the worst stuff, it's even ad-free!) And that's now the reputation they have, too. I feel very apprehensive admitting that I'm a reddit user, and if I do mention it I feel like I need to distance myself from all the gross stuff. If the admins don't want to support terrible communities, and they want to keep the vast majority of people from feeling icky about using their site, they can and should feel free to remove the toxic stuff. Not every site has to be 4chan. 		Redditors seem to take the whole "front page of the internet" thing way too seriously. If reddit bans a community, they aren't going to infect the rest of the site because they have nowhere else to go, they'll just go to another site or shut up (after the initial tantrum, of course.) Where's all the "fat people hate" now that that sub is banned? Is it permeating the site? No, it's gone to voat or /pol/ or whatever. The few people still popping up get banned, and rightfully so. The same will happen to the racists, and the people harassing women for daring to speak their minds, and so on. And even after that happens, free speech will live on, but hate doesn't have to be given a home here.","depth":6,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaos750","name":"t1_ctkjv8x","parent_id":"t1_ctkedih","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438222678,"created_utc":1438193878}

{"body":"Black crime rates are higher because the black poverty rate is higher. Look at crime rates for whites in poverty. Higher than whites above the poverty line. Crime rates for blacks in poverty versus blacks not in poverty, same thing.		So why are they in poverty? Look at history and current events. No Child Left Behind defunded schools that didn't score high enough on standardized tests. Which schools were those? Mostly inner city, mostly black schools. Why? Because their district was already short on budget and couldn't afford to hire proper teachers or fund decent after school or other programs to keep kids in school and off the streets.		So you have an education disparity here. If you have a poor education, you're less likely to be motivated to continue said education, less like *to be able* to continue said education, less likely to land even basic, minimum wage jobs, etc. Not to mention the stereotyping and assumptions that go on during the hiring process, especially if you've never been taught how to conduct yourself at a job interview.		And that's just one example since the 2000s. People like to claim we've come so far since the 50s and 60s and that racism doesn't exist any more. It's just straight up not true.		That's just a tidbit of what you learn in a sociology class.","depth":16,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ih8Hondas","name":"t1_ctkw1ka","parent_id":"t1_ctkvdok","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438239997,"created_utc":1438211197}

{"body":"I typically try not to read TOO much into things, but I begin to wonder if there are some seriously fat people working for Reddit that prefer to kill discussion on their problems instead of, you know, *confronting them* and losing weight. Or ignoring FPH and related subs and keep eating yourself to death, it's a free country. You get to be fat, everyone else gets to dislike you  for it.		I take the sometimes unpopular stance that *shame is not always a bad thing*. 		Yeah, FPH was often just plain mean, but killing that sub seems to have set a dangerous precedent for Reddit. Don't like what people say? That's fine. But - particularly on the internet - trying to silence discussion is essentially taking a baseball bat to a gigantic beehive and angering ALL the bees because a few of them got annoying. 		As someone surrounded by paranoid conservatives, nothing - and I mean *nothing* will reinforce their delusional conspiracy theories in their heads than trying to shut them up. 		Let 'em talk. That's right, Obama's a fascist space alien from the planet Jihad. Yup, Ted Nugent is a genius. Fluoride is a mind control agent. Sure!  Keep it coming! Let 'em rant. And then point, laugh, and shame them. It pisses them off, but after a while, no one takes them seriously because *their own words* become shrill and hilarious. Their message got out. Their message was dumb, and often easily shredded to bits by a little research and verifiable *facts*. (God, they hate facts). Now the only people nodding along are the dittoheads. 		But if you were to somehow shut down /r/conservative - or wonder of wonders - take Fox "News" off the air - you've just made the problem FAR worse. Now they feel totally justified, they feel they're right, and everyone really *was* out to get them, and their message *must* be the truth because they're being silenced. 		And honestly, the Onion's job is hard enough. Don't starve them of material.		Put another way: I saw a video here of a Klan rally recently. The Klan was allowed to walk around with their stupid rebel flags and their goofy sheets and generally be rednecks. No one stopped their little parade, and no one should even try. ...Instead, a gentleman with a tuba stood just outside the parade and quietly played goofy, cartoony 'wump, dump, wumm wammp' sound effects, lending the entire proceeding a comic vibe and pointing out the absurdity of it all without trying to stop the Klan from marching or screaming louder than they were or escalating tensions. 		*It was brilliant*. We need that Tuba Guy mentality on Reddit. Make fun of the mean people when they get too stupid, ignore them unless they get violent or break too many rules. Or just hold up a mirror and let them feel uncomfortable seeing their own words repeated to them from outside the echo chamber.		Again - shame can be constructive.","depth":6,"score":65,"ups":65,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Tin_Whiskers","name":"t1_ctkczz9","parent_id":"t1_ctkae1k","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438213442,"created_utc":1438184642}

{"body":"I don't know if I'd say evil is 'necessary', so much as I take the view that it's an inevitable part of the human condition. It's part of us as human beings. It can be managed, but attempting to suppress it or deny it outlets tends to backfire. 		Besides, allowing people to speak their minds - no matter how abhorrent their speech can sometimes be - lets you know where people stand. In my neck of the woods, the whole Confederate flag thing is a *big* subject. I personally have long identified it as an emblem of a certain mindset, as a badge racists and hateful people tend to rally behind.		And now that it's come to the fore in our national conversation, some people are realizing it's long past time for that flag to go. They're looking into their hearts and changing. And others... have slathered their cars with rebel flag bumper stickers, stuck large flagpoles into their trucks for display, and taken to wearing shirts and hats with the flag on it. It's meant to be provocative, to anger others and simultaneously make the flag's defenders feel empowered as the world moves away from them. 		And that's good. It's showing everyone who the bigots and apologists are in their community. And it's letting those same people vent, after which we can slowly move on. If we were to ban the flag outright, and/or ban their outlets of expression (like subreddits here) it would just move those people underground, give them more of a sense of grievance and community, hide them from public view, and potentially turn them into a festering menace. 		Better to let them stomp around and be petulant, where everyone can watch them and they can feel better about themselves. Better to let them be mean and possibly hurt our feelings, and thereby allow us all to grow and be open about those emotions. 		We can take the horrors out of reddit, sure. We can ban FPH, we can delete garbage like "Coontown". And they'll pop up somewhere else, whack-a-mole style. And those people will get angrier and potentially more radicalized with each blow. 		I argue its better to just have our feelings hurt by mean people than to wonder what they're up to, and give ourselves a false sense of security and unity by futile attempts at making distasteful speech invisible.

And that's too bad, but thems the breaks.		Okay, away from the fat people wanting to pretend they're healthy. 		Politics. Everybody has an opinion. Including myself. I'm (for the most part) a fairly liberal guy. I have a *massive* chip on my shoulder regarding MBAs and conservative businessmen. My take is they're very often evil people, serving themselves at the direct expense of everyone else. They're *bad people*, and personally, I would love to see these tax-dodging thieves bought low and made to answer to the poor and working people they've gleefully kicked around and called 'takers'.		Some people think I'm an idiot. I've been called out here and elsewhere. I've been called rude names and a few times I've had my parentage called into question.		There have been a few times people have just gotten MEAN, because they think I'm wrong, they think I 'want something for nothing' or I'm lazy and hate rich people purely out of jealousy. I got called names. I've been dismissed. 		Because I expressed my opinion. And sometimes I'm not nice about it. Sometimes, I have it coming. 		Maybe my feelings got a little hurt if I thought I'd made a good point! But I stood up in a public forum and I let 'er rip. Somewhere, maybe there's a nice person who worked their ass off and got an MBA and saw my post and thought *"Screw you, I worked hard and I'm not a horrible person, you're making assumptions!"*. Maybe they replied, and called me out. Maybe *their* feelings got hurt.		The point is, that's life. That's free speech. Sometimes people get mean, sometimes it gets personal, *particularly* when everyone's behind their keyboards.		The problem is when one side decides their feelings - their egos - are more precious that others and that those things are worth more than speech and tries to silence everyone save for the people who agree with them. The idea seems to be 'people will get along better if we moderate speech and not let people say things like "conservatives/liberals are idiots (or using names like 'libtard'" or "no, jackwagon, you need to stop eating coke and McDonalds and loose weight, stop claiming you're somehow a victim when you can't fit in an airliner chair'".		Free speech can be hurtful. Shocker! Censoring all but the most egregious examples, though, won't make the world a better place.		Free speech is just that. The free exchange of ideas and feelings. Sometimes it's constructive. Sometimes it's just highly evolved monkeys throwing digital feces at one another behind a mask of anonymity. 		Look at Tumblr. *Jesus, look at it*. Morbidly obese people calling themselves 'athletes' with straight faces, telling themselves they're *healthy at any size*, while that's VERY obviously NOT the case. 		People coming up with 'head mates' and pretending they're 'dragons' and have 'astral wings'. All in a mostly sealed bubble of honestly screwed up people just like them, or at least others playing along.		Does Tumblr look happy? *Hell* no, they're angry and often shocked and offended when they step outside that bubble and find most people see fat people as gross or lazy, or laugh at / back slowly away from someone when they start talking about how they're *really* a flying cat-dragon-thing with their own sexuality and gender pronouns. 		Welcome to the real world! It can be rough, but that's not always a bad thing.		Look. I know bullying can be a shitty, shitty, shitshow. I was bullied in school because I was the awkward quiet kid that sucked at interacting with people. I got my feelings hurt, got called names. I got my ass tossed around a few times and I didn't deserve it.		I had to buck up a bit. Some of the bullying just hurt, others made me look at myself and make adjustments. This is how society works. Protecting people from contrary or potentially hurtful speech or concepts *they personally find distasteful* in the long run only serves to insulate people who might need a sometimes rude wake up call to the real world outside their bubble. 		For the *really* mean people - the trolls - it only makes them worse. Like putting a lid on a boiling pot; you've stopped the steam for the moment but when it breaks loose it's going to be bad. *And it will escape*.		"Calling the free speech argument" can be a concession. The thing is - if 'your best argument for your opinion is that it's not really illegal', people will see that, and sometimes slowly - sometimes quickly - it'll be called out. Might start a debate. Might just get you banned or have your feelings hurt.		The alternative is censoring everything so *no one* gets their fee fees hurt. And that's not, honestly, a world anyone - even the SJWs, though they might not believe it - wants to live in.","depth":10,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tin_Whiskers","name":"t1_ctkox1u","parent_id":"t1_ctkhbn7","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438229406,"created_utc":1438200606}

It totally does.  People act like reddit is a government building and that your constitutional rights have any bearing here.  They don't.  It's a private website, on private servers.  They can host or ban any content they want with impunity.  They can ban you right now for no reason and there's nothing you can do about it.  That's fact.  They are not withheld to any rules except the ones they make themselves.  As long as they aren't committing crimes they can do what they want.

Coontown has thousands of subscribers.  They are each other's audience.  You are not entitled to a convenient platform, even if its an echo chamber.

You can't take the same idea applied to a government and apply it to private businesses.  That's the antithesis of capitalism.  There's a reason the idea **only** applies to the government.  You can't force a private business to do that.  The whole notion of capitalism is that the government take as much of a hands off approach to private entities as possible.

Example: for the longest time segregation was legal because of this very concept; that the government can't tell a private business who they can and cannot cater to, or what they must or must not allow.  And if you go back and read the supreme court cases that made segregation illegal, while the intent was good, the reasoning was constitutionally dubious as fuck and any lawyer will tell you that.  		>You're saying that the existence of a subreddit automatically grants an audience.

Nope, not at all, but there's nothing wrong with voluntary communism and we even have some of it in this country.

Of course not. But hosting a racist discussion still isn't illegal.

I can think of a couple potential benefits, actually:		* It provides a nice, centralized location for folks to keep track of what those people are up to, which can be handy for dealing with any illegal activity that does spawn from it. Consider how much more difficult that would be if those discussions were being held in a private, invite-only forum.		* Likewise, it provides a nice example we can hold up of what *not* to do - "These ideas are racist and bad. If you find yourself saying things that are also being said here, you may want to re-examine your ideas." It helps us form counter-arguments to refute the points they make. It lets us learn from the mistakes of others, whether or not they recognize those mistakes themselves.		* It gives the opportunity for these folks to better themselves together, without losing their community, if they so choose. Not especially likely, but possible.		But the single biggest benefit is that it upholds the societal value of free speech (which is what resulted in the enshrining of the legal protection of free speech in the Constitution). The general idea is that what the majority thinks is right and wrong is not always spot-on, so we should allow minority opinions to be expressed even if almost everyone disagrees with them.		Imagine if we were having this conversation fifty years ago, and the sub in question wasn't Coontown but instead /r/ainbow. Overwhelming majority would likely say that sort of thing was incredibly immoral and shouldn't be tolerated - but now society has changed its views and recognized that being LGBTQ isn't a deadly sin. (I could see something loosely similar happening with pedophilia in the next few decades - recognizing that the desires themselves maybe can't be fully suppressed, but they can be managed and minimized, and that some things which are currently banned may have a use in that. **Pure speculation; not saying I support pedophilia.**)		Sometimes the majority isn't right, and we need to allow for that, by not outright banning the expressing of certain views. This lets us be exposed to ideas we disagree with, which is all-around a very good thing (this is a cornerstone of a good college education, btw); it makes us rethink about *why* we believe what we do, reinforcing the beliefs we find to still be valid and changing the views that we don't find to be valid.		Then comes the argument about whether or not that should be happening *here*, on reddit. To me, that's something for the folks who run reddit - the admins - to decide.

I'm just saying that was also a reason for them taking it down, that PR wasn't the sole possible reason.		>Do you really think people are going to openly discuss illegal activity on coontown where they know they're being watched? No. they'll just take it to those private spaces.		I'm sure it still *helps* having the discussions which then lead to the illegal stuff in an open place. I also vaguely remember stories of a Brazilian drug cartel conducting operations on a small sub, and reddit left it open so the FBI could track it more easily - I could be confused on that, though; it's a vague memory. You *might* be overestimating some folks' intelligence.		>It's not like we don't have enough examples of racism already. There are reams and reams of shitty racist opinions that have been spewed. If you want, archive all of coontown's contents as some kind of library of shit. Nothing of value is being added by allowing them to continue.		I'm certain that, even among such backwards ideas and communities, new ideas come up now and again. No group is *completely* stagnant.		>You think people's opinions are more likely to change in a racist echo chamber than outside of it? This makes literally 0 sense. The only community they have is being a bunch of racist assholes, which is not one worth having.		It's *possible*, but yeah, it's definitely a longshot. I think it'd be more likely that a few folks might be convinced by people coming in from elsewhere on reddit. We're not as echo-chamber-y since subs are part of a larger site. (the "quarantine" idea would exacerbate that, though I still think it's a great idea)		>People still have the freedom to run their own shitty racist websites and have their shitty racist clubs and be racist in their own homes.		Absolutely.		>What you're essentially saying is that nobody should ever be prevented from venting whatever opinions they have in whatever context.		Absolutely not. You're taking my views on reddit in particular and generalizing them to every context ever, and that's not accurate. reddit, specifically, was founded as a place where the idea of free speech would be a high priority, and I'm glad that the admins are finding ways to still uphold that while also making good business decisions. I absolutely wouldn't expect other organizations to take the same actions if they didn't have the same founding principles. Heck, I wasn't sure reddit would keep to those founding principles, and I wouldn't blame them if they 180'd on it; I'd be disappointed, but I wouldn't be *angry*, as long as they were fairly honest about it.		>This is not one of those times. The views of /r/coontown subscribers are definitely wrong.		I agree with you, but I disagree that it means they shouldn't be able to talk about it anyway or that no good can come of them doing so, and I disagree with the idea that this site should be anything other than what the folks running it want it to be, and if they want to provide a space for those folks to talk about those things, I won't yell at them for doing so.		>Should all biologists be forced to read the opinions of young-earth creationists and anti-evolutionists? Should doctors be made to learn about crystal healing and homeopathy because "hey man, it's good to be exposed to ideas you disagree with!"? 		Never said anyone should be forced to it - I'm saying folks should have the opportunity if they want it. There was a time when prevailing medical opinion was that acupuncture and chiropractic ^(why is it "chiropractic" and not "chiropracty"? ugh) were complete bunk, but that's changed, specifically because some folks who were interested sought out those they thought held invalid views and engaged them and found that there was some validity to those views after all. 		>No. Those arguments are over and to continue them only gives credence to disproven and outmoded ideas. 		I don't see how letting someone continue saying nonsense somehow gives that nonsense meaning.		>Most of society has moved on from the ideas expressed by /r/coontown[2] too. There is no longer anything to be gained from their discussion. 		I don't think what gets discussed in /r/coontown will lead to anything especially productive, but I'm willing to leave the door open for it to happen in spite of my low expectations. Especially since they *will* have those discussions elsewhere if they don't have them on reddit, so not allowing them to have them here doesn't really accomplish anything. I don't see much downside (again, assuming the quarantine idea goes through), and while there is *little* potential for upside, there *is* potential. No reason to throw that away.

Also, is it okay to simply say such things to people *without* mentioning any particular group to which they belong? Does that somehow make that speech become acceptable, for legal purposes?

You do your best to make it fair and just and you adjust it as necessary to maintain that ideal. 		Yes and no; you do have to weigh whether it may do more harm than good (and whenever someone's talking about making new exceptions to protected speech, that's pretty much the first thing I worry about), and flaws in the system absolutely should be taken into account when deciding that. Hell, that's why we have a bill of rights in the first place - because the system is flawed, and the folks setting things up realized we needed some fail-safes to prevent from doing more harm than good.		So while you're right that it's entirely possible to do good despite flaws in the system, I don't think you can just dismiss them out of hand. You have to take reasonable steps to try and minimize the problems that will arise because of the new laws; doing otherwise is horrendously irresponsible.		>It isn't about being over sensitive it is about minority groups literally being assaulted and murdered for being members of minority groups because somebody bought into bigoted rhetoric.

{"body":"It's only hate speech if it is inherently prejudicial against whatever minority group it's targeted at. It's not hate speech to say a black person is an idiot, it is to say black people are inherently stupid or to say they're a stupid n***er. And even that's more likely to just get you clocked on the spot rather than prosecuted. Hate speech laws generally are used mostly for large scale public speech like writing a book about how gays are degenerate animals or a website devoted to defaming black people rather than interactions between individuals because as you yourself said on an individual basis a lot of the time the target just does not give a fuck. It's more about stopping hate groups from being formed because that's where the real danger is. 		Which brings me to your next point. No, those crimes are not hate speech themselves but they don't occur in a vacuum.

{"body":"Thanks for the clarification! Also HOLY THIS TURNED INTO AN ESSAY. TURN BACK NOW.		Okay, so are we specifically outlawing mass publications (including on the web), or are we outlawing all such speech and relying on prosecutors to only enforce it against mass publications? I'd be far more comfortable with the former than the latter; too many examples of well-intended laws being taken to ridiculous and harmful extremes because of prosecutors not being quite so discretionary.		Either way (only mass pubs, or only enforcing on mass pubs), that does change things a decent bit. So again, thanks for clarifying.		I would *love* stats on what impact such laws have on reducing the amount of hate crime. I suspect it's very little, but I may well be wrong on that. As such, the rest of what I'm going to say is drawing on my personal experiences in life and what I've seen/read/heard in the media, which will obviously be biased, but it's all I've got. (Not up for intensive research today, heh.)		I think there are a couple loose categories we can place those who carry out the crimes you described into.		First are the folks who wind up going on a killing spree, typically resulting in their own death. These folks may well cite a manifesto of some kind as the basis for their actions, but they're usually suffering from underlying mental disorders which are the true source of their actions, and the exact thing they focus in on and obsess over isn't nearly as important as the disorder that's making them obsess over something to the point they're willing to seriously harm others for it. Even if you took away all hate speech, they'd find *something* to set them off, because it's the mental disorder that is the root cause, not the hate speech. I think anti-hate speech laws wouldn't have much, if any, impact on this group. (Improving our mental health industry, on the other hand, would work *wonders*, as would improving our societal understanding and approach to mental health disorders. But that's a whole other rant.)		Then you have your stereotypical gay bashings and the like. Group/minority membership absolutely plays a role in these, but there's still more to it than that. These are often crimes of opportunity - sometimes as simple as seeing someone acting gay, or a black guy on the wrong side of town, and jumping him immediately. Minority membership is certainly one of the primary factors here, though I'd also argue that any person/group willing to bash someone's head in for being gay has other problems that also need addressing beyond just their view of gay folks. I think most of this behavior is taught/learned in *person*, not by mass publications - the folks who hated me for being gay in the South (or would have if they'd known) generally didn't care what the Bible said; they just cared that I was different in a way they didn't understand and were taught to hate. Banning such publications might remove some of the justification, but not that much - we tend to be scared of what we don't know/understand, and it's easy for that fear to turn into anger, even if you don't belong to a religion/spend time on a website that encourages it.		Other times (still on gay bashings & such) it's primarily personal, and the minority membership just adds to it: "That stupid fag insulted me and embarrassed me in front of my friends, and I'm gonna teach him a lesson." You could replace "stupid fag" with "that guy" and it wouldn't be functionally different - the minority membership is just a mask for what's actually personal aggression. Banning publications will have next to nil effect here, since it's mostly personal anyway. I think this category can also include folks who adopt kids from overseas to keep as slaves (though banning publications *may* help keep people from knowing what to do and say to be successful at it - no "train your housepet in 30 days" manuals - there's still plenty of documentation on adoption and such for someone to piece it together, and I don't think lack of a centralized resource would actually stop anyone who wants to do this in the first place), because I don't think they really care about justifying their actions so much as they want free labor. Same goes for abusing and raping women of a certain group - often they just realize (consciously or not) that it's easier to get away with it if they target marginalized groups, and removing the minority membership from the equation doesn't solve the problem.		I *think* that pretty well covers what you were describing? By all means let me know.		So, in summary, I don't think the sort of laws you're suggesting would have a great impact on the crimes you're wanting to discourage - it may have some, but I don't think it'll be that much. So some positive benefit, but not a lot. (We can agree to disagree here if need be; after writing more below, I honestly don't think it'd matter much if it *were* a big benefit. I think we *can* agree that it wouldn't *completely* solve the problem, at least.)		Now let's look at the cons.		First one is obviously going to be religious texts (hinted at it earlier) - the three main monotheistic religions are by far the majority religions in the US, and all three of them have holy texts which contain blatant hate speech against homosexuals *and* those who don't follow that religion (death for the former, death/enslavement/enforced conversion for the latter). They also arguably have such material concerning women, trans-oriented folks, people of other races/cultures/geographical origins, and more. I don't know how you could possibly draft legislation that outlaws the publication of hate speech without outlawing the Bible & Koran, not to mention the statements of faith that the various Christian denominations use to distinguish themselves from one another, or the various publications discussing those beliefs that circulate. You could try and *only* ban the hate speech parts of these publications, but people are gonna get awfully mad about chopping parts out of their Bibles, and there's gonna be some awfully borderline parts. Some major denominations refuse to have women in any leadership position - does that qualify as hate speech? If so, you're taking away a significant aspect of many folks' belief system (no joke, I've seen churches split over whether or not my mom was allowed to be treasurer, or allowed to cast a vote on the board when acting as treasurer. It was idiotic, but I don't think it should be *illegal*.) Does it only count as hate speech if they explicitly say *why* they don't think women make capable leaders? 		Depending how strictly you define hate speech (and I'll admit I'm stretching here, but mostly because I *know* other would try and make this a legitimate point and that scares me), scientific research describing the average male's strength vs the average female's strength could likewise be construed as hate speech ("They're saying women are inferior to men!"). Same goes for risks for different illnesses and conditions (gays and blacks have massively higher risk of HIV; men have lower life expectancy than women; blacks have increased risk of heart disease; etc.). Your gender and your race are considered significant risk factors for **all sorts** of things. And we already have some folks claiming this is discrimination - we gays have been loudly protesting the restrictions on our blood donation for *ages*, even though statistically we *are* at a massively higher risk of HIV, and no one has the *right* to donate blood (which is why legal challenges to it haven't gotten anywhere, afaik).		Then there is the aspect of learning from past mistakes - how exactly can someone obtaining a racial justice degree or gender studies degree be expected to sufficiently learn their field of study if the most potent books and writings of their greatest enemies are banned? Sure, they could read a summary of Mein Kampf, but that's not going to have the same effect as reading the actual thing. Encountering opposing views is sometimes the best way to understand why you are opposed to those views. That's a pretty big component of a college education, actually; especially true for the humanities. (You could try and work in an education exemption here, but what about folks who want to study it on their own and not in a formal environment? How do you preserve the benefit of having them available without completely negating the benefit of *not* having them available? They're directly opposed.)		So you see, it's not just an arbitrary sanctity of free speech (though I can see why it may sound that way when I wasn't working with a better understanding of what you were supporting) - it's the very real consequences that restricting free speech can have, often in completely unintended and massively harmful directions. These are just three pretty significant problems (or two, if you discount the middle one, but I wouldn't) that I've come up with in... twenty minutes of typing a wall of text? And there's definitely going to be more than just that.		Perhaps that explains why I'm so adamantly opposed to a broad new restriction on free speech? I'm not going to pretend it's always the right choice for every country/culture (I hate when people do that with democracy; holds true for this as well), but I am going to state very firmly that it's the right thing for *this* country and culture, and staunchly oppose any attempts to broadly change that without a *very* thorough examination of the potential impact, for good and for bad. And I trust the body of law that has been established for centuries over here that such broad changes are almost universally not worth the cost, in addition to my own thoughts on how things could go.		^(if you made it this far have a cookie and go rest your eyes)","depth":15,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sorator","name":"t1_ctkza3v","parent_id":"t1_ctkwsno","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438245431,"created_utc":1438216631}

I don't agree that providing a space for people to talk about something necessarily encourages the spread of those ideas or endorses or supports it.

I disagree that reddit permitting them to be here is somehow endorsing them.		>Encouraging the spread of hate by giving these people a place to congregate on a site that claims to be the "front page of the internet" is silencing and oppressing minorities because you are validating the opinions of bigots and sociopaths.		**Allowing someone else to talk does not in any way prevent anyone else from also talking.** I hate that idea. The proper response to speech you disagree with is *more speech* - you can talk louder than them; you can engage with them to try and show them how they're wrong and you're right; you can make an example of them and show *others* how they're wrong and you're right; etc. Silencing their speech is the wrong approach.		Someone talking about how they hate gays does not in any way prevent someone else talking about how they love gays or how they are gay. Just think of the logistics - think of literal speech. You talking doesn't prevent me from also talking at the same time. (Doing so means we probably won't be *listening* to each other, but the idea is a right to *speak* not a right to be *heard*.) And allowing someone to say something does not in any way validate or endorse or approve of what they say - this is, for example, why politicians are supposed to explicitly endorse the messages they put out while campaigning, because simply allowing it to happen is not the same as endorsing it. (Whether or not they actually do that as they should is a whole other issue.)		Would you rather they congregate in a true echo-chamber, a closed forum where no one is allowed to speak except to agree with what they say? Wouldn't that be *more* validating than having the occasional open discussion where people call them out for being bigoted sociopaths and expressing why, exactly, that is a bad thing?		The proper solution here is *more* speech, not less. And while that speech doesn't *have* to happen on reddit, I'm absolutely not going to be upset if it does - this is the front page of the internet, and there's all sorts of crazy and demented shit on the internet.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sorator","name":"t1_ctkr5q5","parent_id":"t1_ctkprm7","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438232488,"created_utc":1438203688}

You jump from, in your own words, "subs that's easy to determine" to subs that aren't (or in some cases, made up to be). In a sense, it's comparing the maliciousness of Fat People Hate, borderline paedophilia of Jailbait and ardent hate speech of CT with the passive aggressive angst of /r/Atheism. Or, moreso, suggest that Christians would just want /r/Atheism banned simply for being atheist - not for being hate-filled, or harassing Reddit users outside their subs. *That is a slippery slope,* because none of these cases are even remotely comparable (or slightly realistic and reasonable.)		> I could see the pro-christians pushing to ban anything atheistic		You can? Is there an actual large voice on reddit that's looking to ban r/Atheism and just *waiting* on the opportunity on the basis that they're Christian? I mean, there are people who want r/Atheism gone because it's seen as whiny, but that's a different conversation.		> SRS wanting to ban who knows what.		I'm going to guess they'd like CT banned for the same reasons other people pointed out in this thread: Reddit seems hypocritical at this point. That's all it comes down to.		The line is clear. It's been drawn in the sand in the past, and their past actions have made it abundantly clear of what Reddit *says* it doesn't tolerate. But it was merely bullshit. The argument isn't whether or not there's a "slippery slope," because banning hate subs like FPH aren't going to lead to bans of subs *that aren't hateful* like /r/Atheism. Or even pointless subs like RedPill and KotakuInAction. The argument is whether or not Reddit intends on sticking to its own word or if it's deciding to be hypocritical.

These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.		TEXAS:		>Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?		SOUTH CAROLINA:		>The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.		GEORGIA:		>The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.		1st Vice-President of the CSA:		>The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution — African slavery as it exists amongst us — the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization" and further that "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea ["equality of the races"]; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition.

To quote Allan Nevins, a historian who wrote the most extensive and detailed narrative of the Civil War era in history:		>The South, as a whole, in 1846-1861 was not moving towards emancipation but away from it.

Yes, there's a hypothetical slippery slope. I don't think that banning Coontown and friends means that the site is slipping down it though.

Those distasteful corners of the website are a litmus test for the freedom of Reddit's users.

{"body":"> By the time you start talking about which things to censor you've already lost what makes reddit great.		Well, then the battle is already lost because reddit has always censored tons of stuff. Things like doxxing, which aren't technically illegal unless they're harassment, are forbidden site-wide and have been for as long as I can remember. Jailbait is another example. That one, they censored due to bad media coverage basically. You're not even allowed to post links to other parts of reddit and say "Hey, everyone down vote this!" or anything like that. There's no law against brigading, that's entirely reddit's decision. 		>There are lots of distasteful things to be found on reddit and lots of wonderful things too. That's because right now reddit is a mirror that reflects humanity. The good and the bad. 		And that's a lovely idea, but I think there are two problems with that. One, most people don't come to the reddit "mirror" looking to see the worst that humanity has to offer. So gradually, the only people coming to reddit are those who either can tolerate the gross stuff, or those who are rolling around in it. Two, it helps to not just reflect, but *amplify* the worst in humanity by giving them a great place to congregate and organize. That's fine if reddit want to do that, it's their site, but I don't think it's a good idea. Plus, if you're looking for a mirror, the internet as a whole is a much better, fairer, more accurate mirror than reddit alone could ever be. 		>If people have a problem with something someone says on Reddit they are misguided if they try to blame Reddit for that person's opinions, and they are fooling themselves if they think that removing those ideas from reddit will make them go away.		I don't disagree. Censorship alone isn't going to get rid of ideas. They have a point, though: Reddit is voluntarily hosting this terrible stuff, and they don't have to. Is that making Reddit better? Is it making the internet better? Is it making the world better? I think it's fair to criticize them for their choice, because it is a choice, and I don't think "free speech" alone justifies it. 		>You are supporting the idea that people should be able to come together and discuss whatever they want freely.		They should be able to come together and discuss freely... but that doesn't mean that reddit has to give them free, prime real estate to do it. 		>Reddit has still managed to keep working toward the ideal that people should be able to talk about whatever they want.		That's a good ideal, and I agree with it, but it isn't reddit's responsibility to make that happen on their own. Every website censors content to some degree, reddit is no different. Is it really so bad if the racists have to start their own forum? Frankly, I think it's a win-win. The racists no longer have to fear a ban by the admins, because they are the admins, and the rest of us can choose whether or not we want to support their efforts, see their posts, etc. Free speech lives on stronger than ever, and if you look at both the new racist site and reddit.com, *more* ideas are being expressed, not less.		>"The worst of the worst" according to what? "Borderline cases" according to what? The "free exchange of ideas" limited to a subset of approved ideas is*n't* a free exchange of ideas at all.		Yeah, it isn't. I don't care if reddit, or any other site, restricts the speech they allow. Especially when the topics being banned are so reprehensible. As long as everyone is equally free to create their own site discussing whatever they want however they want, the free exchange of ideas is there, and my desire for freedom of speech is satisfied.","depth":7,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaos750","name":"t1_ctktvur","parent_id":"t1_ctkrd1i","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438236535,"created_utc":1438207735}

Things like doxxing, which aren't technically illegal unless they're harassment, are forbidden site-wide and have been for as long as I can remember. Jailbait is another example. 		Doxxing isn't illegal but it is a legal minefield and opens reddit to all kinds of liability. I understand why they take the stand they do against it. It's to protect them and their users. It also helps protect the free exchange of ideas because I can post openly without worrying as much that I'm going to tracked down and attacked in the real world for my statements here. A compromise certainly, but a reasonable one. 		Jailbait wasn't taken down because the idea behind it was declared unacceptable. It was taken down because it became a liability after it was found that people were using it to request illegal material (for the record, the illegal stuff was only sent over PM, nothing illegal was posted to the subreddit directly). The negative media attention was certainly a motivation as well and in that aspect reddit failed to live up to its ideals, but it has allowed the idea behind that subreddit to continue in its replacement which thrives to this day. Reddit isn't perfect, but it tries and as long it keeps trying I'll support it.  		Brigading is a complex subject currently under a lot of debate. Part of the reasoning behind the anti-brigading rule is that it hurts the free exchange of ideas especially for minority opinions when large groups of people can coordinate to bury what it doesn't agree with and "punish" users who dare to even discuss those things. Personally I hope that Reddit ultimately decides to go after those kinds of coordinated attacks while leaving subreddits that serve to direct people to cool or interesting posts and subreddits out of it. I have a "spreading ideas is good, attacking ideas is bad" sort of view on Brigading. We've yet to see what the rules end up like. 		> most people don't come to the reddit "mirror" looking to see the worst that humanity has to offer.		Most people will never see the worst either, not unless they actively look for it. No one is forcing new users into coontown to talk about things they don't want to. People *should* expect to be exposed to unpleasant things on the internet, just like in the real world. Reddit already gives people the ability to filter out the things they don't want to see and create their own experience. They are going a step farther and putting the more unpopular stuff behind another wall (opt in). This isn't really a problem. 		>  it helps to not just reflect, but amplify the worst in humanity by giving them a great place to congregate and organize.		Same with the good. It's not really an issue with reddit, it happens everywhere like-minded people gather. Providing a place for people to get together, organize and discuss things is a good thing. What results from that is up to the people involved. I don't think the internet makes a better mirror than reddit, because reddit *is* a part of the internet. Reddit is the internet mirror focused on a wide area. What you see is people doing people stuff.		> Reddit is voluntarily hosting this terrible stuff, and they don't have to. Is that making Reddit better? Is it making the internet better? Is it making the world better? 		I think it does. I really do. Reddit doesn't have to be a platform for the open exchange of ideas and the building of communities. It could be lots of other things. A curated list of approved topics, or a cat photo repository for example, but the internet is a better when it has a well maintained site for free discussion where ideas are shared and challenged. There are few places like that, fewer popular ones and even fewer that are run as well. reddit fills a gap very well. It's why we are all here. 		> They should be able to come together and discuss freely... but that doesn't mean that reddit has to give them free, prime real estate to do it....  it isn't reddit's responsibility to make that happen on their own. Every website censors content to some degree, reddit is no different. Is it really so bad if the racists have to start their own forum? ...  As long as everyone is equally free to create their own site discussing whatever they want however they want, the free exchange of ideas is there		So this is the "They can have freedom too, just not here" argument. It's not compelling. There are a lot of good reasons why Reddit should stay available to everyone. By not censoring ideas here they avoid having to even start down the path of what do we keep and what do we censor. It absolves them of all responsibility for the content on this site. Once they officially endorse certain ideas and ban others everything they allow on the site is a reflection on them personally, right now they are just providing the space and users are responsible for what they do with it.  		It also makes them popular. Everyone is here discussing what matters to them no matter what it is. They could be fragmented into a million forums all over the internet, but by having everything in one place Reddit gains a ton of users each with unique contributions to make. Perhaps some of them have some misguided views on certain subjects but are respected experts in other areas. By having them here they can share with the rest of us, and we can expose them to different views as well.  		We'll take racists as an easy example. A bunch of racists on their own forum are completely insular but as a part of reddit they can be exposed to very different opinions and views from all over the world. It may not sway many of them, but it very well might help some of them. It also allows those of us who aren't part of those groups to explore them, to try to understand them and how they work if we're interested. It's easier to observe those types of things here than to try to track down and join closed tight-knit groups scattered all over the web.","depth":8,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kensin","name":"t1_ctkvzok","parent_id":"t1_ctktvur","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438239910,"created_utc":1438211110}

{"body":"doctor steve, not to be rude (i guess it's really 'to be a little bit rude') but your job sounds like it sucks.  And you sound like you have very little idea how most jobs function, to be honest.  		>Raising morale is a myth. Workers are not going to be happy working.		This is hilarious and horrible and untrue.  Raising morale can be incredibly important.  And no, you don't do it by "cleaning up a park".  You do it by improving communication, honesty, trust, transparency, etc. This is usually easier if you have an in-person relationship.		And believe it or not, some people actually like their jobs.  Shocking, I know.  		>What does Reddit need to discuss with people for? There's plenty of ideas on the site. You can just say "What's an idea you'd like to see" on a modpost and see what the top comments are. If they have work that needs to get done, being in an office together is not going to get that work done.		This is how I know you have some narrowly tailored job with no experience in anything else.  What could two programmers need to sit next to one another for?  Just write the program, gosh.  Yeah...  that's not how it works with complex projects.  Some as simple as pulling data from a data feed can turn extremely complex, and face-to-face conversations are the best way to resolve the complex technical problems.  A 3 minute in-person conversation can clear up something that might take hours of back and forth email.  And since you're there you see everything that programming friend does and it gives you an idea how you can copy his methods on your own unrelated goals.  Etc.  There's so many ways this is valuable, and that example was literally just pulling data from some data source.  If you're trying to build something really complex, it can be even more vital to have face time.		"Plenty of ideas on the site", jesus h. christ man.  Sure.  Who's going to choose which ones get made?  Which ones are even feasible?  Which ones align with the 'right now' and then the 'next six months' and then the 'future goals'?  Who's going to study the impact on the users?  Decide which ideas align with the ideals and the future direction of the site?  The CEO by himself?  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.		But I guess Dr Steve said they can just read some comments, sort by top and tell some programmer to go make it.  That's so hilariously ignorant...  Sorry to be so blunt, but it is.  Sure if you're doing medical transcript data entry shit, no need to talk.  If you're doing actual creative work, it's very valuable.","depth":7,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MrDannyOcean","name":"t1_ctkabwf","parent_id":"t1_ctk9wss","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438209590,"created_utc":1438180790}

I've been working remotely for a long time now and I wholeheartedly agree that you can get a lot more work done if there are no distractions (and making sure there are no distractions is a skill a remote worker needs to absolutely master).		What I also noticed is that it requires certain skills across office and remote workers alike, most important of which are communication skills. People need to report what they are working on, what progress is being made and what they need from others. And others need to take note and do the same, whether they are in the office or not. The problems I faced were mainly in that area. If people start going their own merry way because they don't care or don't know what others are doing, it all falls apart. And that's a shame because as you said, if you force them to be in the office all at the same time, production goes down compared to what you could do with a well behaved remote workforce.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zenhamster","name":"t1_ctkaglm","parent_id":"t1_ctk9ega","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438209788,"created_utc":1438180988}

And they cause problems not just in the office but also when others are working outside that same office and depend on their output.		Now, usually I'm in a position where I can fire those people or reassign them but in this particular case I wasn't. And then there's also the problems associated with simply firing those people. In this particular case this was a software engineer but for any position that comes with specific knowledge, firing someone is not always in your best interest because replacing them is hard and making sure none of their knowledge gets lost when you do is even harder.		I'm in the preparation stage of starting a new business and I want people to work remotely at least half of the time if not more. The only way I've come up with to avoid the common problems associated with that is screening new employees on their aptitude for working remotely. But if you have an existing company with people already working in it, that's not nearly as easy. I think a business needs to be designed from the ground up for remote work, converting an existing business to a more remote way of working is ridden with pitfalls, some of which may be too expensive to easily work around.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zenhamster","name":"t1_ctkcxbf","parent_id":"t1_ctkau5n","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438213337,"created_utc":1438184537}

You make one comment and everyone tries to lump you into a group and ascribe others beliefs and actions to your own. 		To me it seems, the longer these 'wars' go on, the more extremes they attract and the more rational people they chase away from their group, until you have two extreme groups that no longer represent the original ideas. 		It's like Mothers Against Drunk Driving founder being driven away from her own org once she felt they they had accomplished their original mission, but it wasn't enough for the extremists that had been rallied to the cause so it continues without her trying to return us to prohibition bit by bit.		This can happen to MRAs, SJWS, people who want to preserve their cultural heritage, GGers, redpillers. The moderate voices of reason that recognize the legitimate issues brought up get drowned out once the hateful masses start jumping onto the bandwagon to join the war. Additionally they become afraid to be associated with the very groups fighting for the things they believe in.		It makes me sad that we have made so much progress in womans rights for example, yet I've known people to tell me. I'm for female rights but I'm not a *feminist.* It's very sad that a female, for female rights, would ever use the term feminist derogatorily or try to distance themselves from a group trying to 'fight for their cause'		Could you even imagine life a few years back, and having someone be like, 'yeah I'm for equal rights for all skin colors, but man that MLK guy, I don't believe in any of his stuff! hes going to make things worse for us'		Humans love to categories things, and lump them into convenient one-word boxes, but that behavior is not good and causes us vs them / hate mentality.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zenerbufen","name":"t1_ctl6g8d","parent_id":"t1_ctl3ldo","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438257860,"created_utc":1438229060}

So like, figure it out. You do some racist shit. People call you out on it. You can either not give a fuck, or you can actually consider why that might be a problem, and understand that nobody's perfect and maybe you have some personal work to do on your behaviors. But that doesn't make you, as a person, some kind of irredeemable villain.

This whole paragraph is idiotic.  Of course there are "bad guys".  There are bad people all over the place.  Plenty of racists are bad people.  Plenty of racists are just ignorant but good people.  That doesn't matter anyway, because telling a racist joke does not make that person a racist.  		Being a racist means that you have and show the belief that one race is inferior to another.  Personally, I absolutely think that people are inferior to other people, but there is not a single solitary thought in my head that someone's skin color has anything to do with that.  I'm going to guess that you don't think that whites are superior to blacks either.  If you don't think that one race is superior to another then you aren't a racist.  		Using racial stereotypes for humor's sake is not in and of itself racist.  You're racist if you believe that the Irish are inferior to other races solely because they are Irish.  There is a stereotype that Irish are drunks.  If you tell a joke about a drunk Irishman, then that doesn't make you a racist anymore than quoting the Bible makes you a Christian.  		There is a huge difference between /r/coontown (which I actually did finally look at) and /r/imgoingtohellforthis.  The former is filled with people who honestly seem to hate black people.

All completely true. 		>Why are admins blindly approving shadowban requests from moderators without validating a rule was even broken? 		They aren't. 		>Are moderators lying and claiming accounts are SPAM accounts when they are not?		No. The issue I think you may be having difficulty with here is the purpose of a shadowban. From my reading of your comments (and correct me if I'm wrong), you're thinking shadowbans are for spammers. Yes, that is their original purpose and their stated purpose, but that is naive. They are used for all bans handed out by the admins. Why is that you ask? Because that's the only one they have. It is the only type of site-wide ban built into the system because until relatively recently (before the massive increase in the population of this website and the trolls and hate it brought with it) spam was one of the only community issues that required admin intervention. There has been no reason to create a public hardban because no one has cared until recently. Now that there is such an uproar, there is supposedly one being developed. Yay. The big spooky shadowbans are going away, everyone can rest easy and enjoy a hard ban to the same effect. 		No one is deceiving the admins and tricking them into thinking regular users are spammers. The admins aren't rubber stamping bans. They have tools above and beyond the moderators, they see a lot more. They can see what links an account has visited, where it has voted, where it came from, where it went next, the IP, browser session information, a lot of stuff. People are not getting banned for nothing, they are getting banned for breaking the rules. Don't be misled by the people you see saying "I did nothing wrong and the admins are ignoring me!" Four years here and I've never met someone who said that and was telling the truth (as evidenced by yesterday's post in /r/videos).		>On top of that, ghosting individual comments is a tool provided to mods by admins. Mods can't ghost comments if admins don't let them.		True as well. This is an Automoderator function, which started out as a user created bot that was not associated with the admins in any way. It was only later after its creator was hired by reddit inc that it became integrated into the site. 		> I would argue that admins should not be giving tools to mods that allow them to hide individual comments at will in a way users will most likely never detect.		The answer for this is simple. This is a result of mods using anti-spam features to pseudo ban a user. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop mods from doing this without taking those anti-spam capabilities away entirely, which would be a colossally stupid thing to do. The two abilities are one in the same, completely tied together. There is no way to remove one without removing the other. 		>Technically mods using them to hide opinions is an abuse of those tools. Why are admins not banning mods who do that?		This goes back to my other point. Because the mods' word is law in their subreddit if they chose to make it so. That is the official sitewide policy.

My point is, what this tool just shows that some users  (including mods) see themselves forced to use it, because other users decide to be assholes. And no, they aren't "just stating their opinion". No they aren't "just saying things I don't like". They are being straight up assholes. If you imply someone should get raped or someone should die because of some kind of physical difference between you and them, you are an asshole. Not only some (not all) users of those subs do such things, they are relentless, they are motivated by something, and I'd really like to find out what it is. And whenever other users try to protect themselves from them, whenever mods formulate rules and make bots to get rid of them, they scream censorship and Hitler and what have you.

See for many the admins don't do enough. They will occasionally react to such a request, they don't do it in 100% of the cases. And it's not entirely their fault, they don't have the right tools and sometimes they simply have to deal with more important matter. And as far as I can see, the tagging tool is not a mass ban tool. The only thing I've seen is mods stating that it's one of many things that helps them decide whether somebody should get banned to keep their subreddit peaceful or not. Is it a perfect tool? Certainly not. But it's kind of a desperate measure to the problems that arise with having such a huge accumulation of people and the fact that some people decide to use the platform to make others feel bad. 		The alternative isn't doing nothing, but keeping an eye out for such people when you're a mod is certainly tiresome and can lead to being burned out.

{"body":"If someone is harassing you, the admins generally do take care of it. What they haven't done is they haven't banned entire subs for the actions of a few dicksnots. Sometimes, though, harassment isn't as clear cut and sometimes people take things as harassment that to others are not. That's part of the problem too. That's why Reddit needs a clear policy on harassment. 		As to whether or not the tool is a mass ban item - it can be used to build one. It could be used to plug in all of those names into automod and use automod's subreddit specific shadowban function (not a real shadowban, but automod has a feature that bans that person silently from that sub/removes their posts/does not allow them to post or whatnot). Which is exactly why I'm saying that it is a bad idea. It is a group of usernames that can very, very easily be taken and used for purposes that are shitty. 		Grouping people up in the way that they have is also very disingenuous. It groups KiA and MensRights with Coontown when they are NOTHING alike. It throws in commenters and submitters even if they've submitted AGAINST the POV of the sub. It also seems to randomly link to a submitted comment or post, even if there are previous ones, or ones after that. It takes one small sample and paints a broad picture that is inherently flawed.		If this tool was made by CoonTown against users of BlackLadies, would you feel the same? Would you feel the same if the tool was made by TheRedPill against women's subreddits, or against SRS? If you wouldn't that should tell you right there that there is some bias. If it is just a tool, it should be cool for any group to make a list of another group and to pass it around to users for them to install and then use - because what's the harm?

{"body":"> If this tool was made by CoonTown against users of BlackLadies, would you feel the same? Would you feel the same if the tool was made by TheRedPill against women's subreddits, or against SRS? 		I believe SRSsucks has such a tool, [here it is](https://www.triggerwarning.tk.gridhosted.co.uk/) (found on their sidebar). *And I'm not saying KiA, SRSsucks, coontown, etc. are the same exact people.* (Although there are some cross sections.)  But yeah, it already happened. I feel pretty much the same about both tools, they're both very flawed and if you complain about them you're making a bigger thing out them than they are. I will admit though, I am biased when it comes to certain subreddits and some of their more extreme users. And whether the situation is that you have a bunch of trolls (because a lot of them must be trolls, I can't imagine anybody saying some of the things they say and being serious about them) telling women to get raped or mods who take it too far and just put anybody commenting in those subs in the same category and ban them, the people who decide to be assholes have won, the trolls have won. We discuss to death what to do with them, we get annoyed, we get angry, some people are scared. If mods go too far protecting their subs they get screamed at by other users, sometimes with very good reason. These are very deep issues on reddit and on the internet in general and really what we all should do in most cases is ignoring the trolls. That's the only thing that has worked ever. However look at me, I'm writing paragraphs about the pro and cons of providing tools against them.		> As to whether or not the tool is a mass ban item - it can be used to build one.		I can't say that it isn't *technically* possible. But what you said is already happening in a much more efficient way. I know of one sub that will ban anybody who has commented in certain subreddits automatically. Even though they say that you can appeal, your chances are very slim unless you stop participating in those subreddits. **But** from conversations I had with other mods many of them (including me) don't support that way of handling things *at all*, so I wouldn't say that list might be turned into a AutoMod shadowban master list. I know it's very common to mistrust moderators, but most of them really are just normal users in other subreddits they hang out in and I don't think they want to be treated that way in those subreddits either. And more importantly most of them are decent people who don't want to abuse their power. I don't think this gets said enough.		> If the issue is admins not doing what you need, contact them. 		Not sure if you're talking in general or about me specifically. But as I already said, I don't hold it against the admins, i.e. the community managers that some reports go un-adressed. I know they have a lot on their plate an they don't have the best tools to handle things. I also get a response when reporting stuff to them most of the time. There are no complaints from my side, but I can sympathize with some people who've showed me the kind of messages they get, and what I've seen admins say about it (I don't remember exactly what the context was, but basically somebody complained about harassment to an admin and they said it wasn't really harassment. That was before the new harassment policy though and of course there is a difference between somebody saying "I hope you get raped" and "I know you live in xx, and I'll come there and rape and murder you".

They were gathering to discuss what can be done to lower the higher rate of suicide among young adult males.		The result was a group of feminists stormed the area with megaphones shouting "we don't care what you have to say" until the conference was disbanded, and nothing was accomplished or discussed. This group of feminists was painted as "the good guys" for fighting misogyny by the media. 		This is the kind of shit the men's right movement deals with, so it makes sense that they can get bitter sometimes.		Edit: Also, when they show up elsewhere with this attitude, it's usually to refute false facts being presented as part of feminist arguments (which are typically being used to attempt to marginalize/demonize men). This gets called misogyny, of course.

On the other hand, tweets promoting an AMA are mmk, because bringing users to a thing in which they are asked to participate is cool.

So for example, onsite brigading by subs that promote certain views, whether they be a link posted into SRS or KiA where users are invited to express there opinions is a problem, but bestof as a subreddit isn't, because while is shines a light on a posts or set of posts, its not actively encouraging users to cause trouble, and SRD is even less of an issue because they actively ban pissers.		So were I spez, I'd be much more worried about offsite and opinionated brigades as opposed to meta-subs that either don't hold an opinion, and/or actively ban people who get involved.

For the /r/bestof users, I would deal with it by preventing people from voting on things in subreddits they are not currently subscribed to and that problem is immediately solved.  The SRS style that is usually provided as an example of brigading is malicious and intentional, so that requires something more complicated because it's likely that people would subscribe to subreddits that have opinions they oppose just to get around the first measure.  I don't think there's a single measure of what should be done, but another potential option in addition to the ones being worked on could be a quota system where either you only get a certain number of downvotes to use in a day, or a ratio quota where you have to have let's say >=70% upvotes and <30% downvotes per day.

I guess the real question is about intent. Are the "brigaders" downvoting maliciously purely because they hate the content of the sub? Or are they downvoting because they disagree?		But the problem there is what's the difference between maliciously hating an opinion and disagreeing with it? I'll give you a hint, in terms of upvotes/downvotes there isn't one.		50 people from /r/xboxisawesome downvote a comment in /r/apple.

{"body":"Are you seriously conflating being transgender with pedophilia		Being "born that way" is *not* valid reason to defend pedophilia when their urge is literally to rape children. You're basically repeating decades old reactionary talking points - "if we let gays marry, they'll start raping kids". Someone can be gay or transgender and have a healthy relationship with a consenting adult. Pedophiles can *only* rape , or witness rape to satisfy themselves. It doesn't really matter if both are *born that way* if one is *actively harmful*.		Yeah, srs prime will literally ban you for breaking the circlejerk, which means that there's no room for reasoned discussion and they'll take things out of context. But if you want to criticize the way they do things, you can do so without using the conservative reactionary scare tactic of equating queerness with pedophilia.		And as for me, I think pedophiles need mental help that the American healthcare system doesn't provide. But reddit often takes it too far and normalizes instead of condemning it.

Congrats, you read the comments and summarized them in an editorialized fashion.

OP said they were brigading because that's what they were actually doing. I don't understand why this is so difficult for you to understand.		If SRS ever linked to KiA, and then a few users came and started "complaining" about something someone there said, the entire sub would explode in anger! But if KiA does the exact same thing it's just the fault of the OP of the brigaded post obviously. Listne to yourself.

{"body":"Thank you! :D		In this case, though—are the racists Luke Skywalker or the Death Star? It looks like they're the rebel alliance here, which is kinda weird. But if so, certainly the "racist alliance" would need to amass as much power as Luke Skywalker and friends, and be able to infiltrate the Galactic Empire's central headquarters. Reddit doesn't really have a central headquarters, unless you're talking about the admin team, which doesn't look like it'll be overrun with racists anytime soon.

Reddit's been a perfectly happy and comfortable place for me and thousands of other users, who manage to go about our lives without getting harassed by bigots.

I don't support deleting dissenting opinion, no matter how bad, because you're embarrassed about it. And if you're deleting it to protect me—I don't want to be protected!		I think that's a really good way to frame the issue actually. It's honestly way more offensive to me that people would delete content based on what they think I won't like. It's patronizing as fuck.

I think this is one of those rare moments where a racial issues pops up and I'm discussing it with someone who has legitimate critical thinking skills.		Subsequently, I don't think I can change your view. Usually it's because someone is hard headed, but in this case it's because you've come to your own conclusions by thinking it through. There is certainly merit to the idea of such 'protection' being patronizing, and that is something in the back of my mind that goes on.		But protection is a large factor. White people who gather together to celebrate the deaths of black people and their own perceived superiority never ends well. They've destroyed cities here in America, and nations overseas over less. You're right that a few stray folks with extreme racist opinions won't destroy reddit. But that's not what we're dealing with.		A lot of kids in coontown are just that, kids. Left alone among a sea of far more rational minds, whatever anger and confusion they have over racial issues would be tempered and cooled by reality and interaction with diverse people. Kept in their bubble, organized with others, as a whole become a force to be reckoned. But worse, is when that kid grows up to be a cop, a mayor, a senator. (Now, if you're thinking I'm being a grandiose worry wart, I just might be. I have a tendency to speculate. But it's not an impossibility.)		In the end, I feel the removal of such communities should be an implicit notion. As /u/spez says, such communities remain because it's still in debate whether or not black people are human. It worries me. I can certainly take care of myself, but I also worry the constant harassment from coontown against my brothers and sisters might just be too much. It just wears and tears slowly. Sometimes people think that for a force to mean something, it has to be of a powerful stream like water from a fire hose. Those people underestimate that even a tiny spring can carve a mountain in half over time.		It's like they're the crick, and we're without a paddle. But the almighty admin gods could do something about it, but ol' spez has done nothing but advocate white supremacy. And what troubles me the most is how *inconsequential* this seems to people. To me it's not, but as I said I have a tendency to speculate. I worry a hundred years from now what's happening here is going to be written in history books. Especially given that in all of recorded history, we are in fact the most recorded of history. Ink and parchment is fine, but this is real digitally rendered set in silicone stone the beginning of humanity.		And we're walking into these history books to tell our great grandchildren that we're just fine and dandy with some of the most ugliest ideology since inbreeding. And that here and now, those in power of reddit have essentially began to fund a terrorist organization.		But I digress. You feel the way you do because you've thought it through yourself, and I respect that. My thoughts are different, I reach different conclusions. And I apologize for any of your time I've wasted. But typing also helps me think things through, and I can post this for posterity and future reference. (If nothing else, I can apply some of these paragraphs to a future sci-fi short story.)","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AliceHouse","name":"t1_ctmxivu","parent_id":"t1_ctmvybq","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438388643,"created_utc":1438359843}
{"body":"> If nothing else, I can apply some of these paragraphs to a future sci-fi short story.		Heh, good luck. I am a big fan of using real life to inspire science fiction.		I appreciate you having such a well-thought-out conversation with me! It's clear that there are a lot of complex subtleties to this debate. People on either side tend to think that their opinion on the matter is the obvious conclusion, but still have a very hard time convincing each other of that. We probably aren't gonna convince each other to complete agreement, but at least we understand each other a bit better.		> Left alone among a sea of far more rational minds, whatever anger and confusion they have over racial issues would be tempered and cooled by reality and interaction with diverse people. Kept in their bubble, organized with others, as a whole become a force to be reckoned.		I think this is actually one of my arguments *for* not censoring them. Telling coontown users to go find somewhere else to gather is essentially forcing them into a bubble. Reddit is far less of a bubble, given how easy it is to go from one subreddit to another, and how many diverse communities there are on this site. A racist on coontown is far more likely to encounter non-racist arguments elsewhere on this site than someone on a separate forum created for the purpose of consolidating racist thought.		And while it's certainly possible that allowing racists (or sexists or other folks) to gather on reddit and speak their minds will lead to them going and doing harm somewhere, I think unless it's proven that coontown users are actually acting on their distasteful opinions in real life, lynching folks or similar, reddit doesn't have any concrete justification for shutting them down. Innocent until proven guilty, you know? Otherwise this is like pre-emptive censorship. There's already been so much debate about the idea of punishing people *before* they commit crimes, and the general consensus has been we can't allow that in a fair judicial system, as nice as it sounds.		But I acknowledge that these are serious issues that probably can't be solved in a single reddit conversation! Everyone has the right to reach their own conclusions. Hell, that's my ideal anyway—everyone should be allowed to reach their own conclusions, without being restricted by others.","depth":14,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"novaskyd","name":"t1_ctmybh2","parent_id":"t1_ctmxivu","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438389773,"created_utc":1438360973}

In addition, just because you don't find "value in the conversation" doesn't mean nobody does. You can't define value for the whole world. Reddit is not a platform only for people with a single political or social worldview. Conversations are not only "valuable" if they conform to, or lead to, a single political or social worldview. Discussions of these issues are not only valuable if they always lead to everybody agreeing that feminism is good, black people need to start an anticolonialist revolution, and Islam isn't ruining the world. It's rather patronizing to say that differing viewpoints are only valuable if they all end up agreeing with you in the end.		And even if you *do* want all conversation to lead to "progress" as defined by you, "progress" is not easily definable or identifiable, and while it may not look like it to you, hearts and minds are being changed every day.

I have absolutely no objection to people being exposed to new ideas! The thing is, though, that **all these conversations** have been had **hundreds of times already.** We're not *advancing* the debate, we're *duplicating* the debate by starting off at the first floor every single time.		This is known as "derailing" and it happens all. the. fucking. time on this site. Just look at any post (or subreddit) which even *hints* at supporting feminism.		If people were **actually interested** in having an honest intellectual discussion, debate, or argument, you would think they would expose themselves to the available material on the subject, including literally thousands of previous "debates" on the subject, before opening their mouths and adding their uninformed takes. 		This doesn't happen, obviously, which tells me something about how concerned people are about "learning about issues."		But really, most of my point here is that I don't think tolerating "hate" subreddits has a thin sliver of anything to do with "advancing the conversation." I think that's a bullshit reason, and it doesn't justify keeping them around. Keep them around if you want, or justify it some other way, but "Coontown needs to be here because we as a society need to have a conversation" doesn't hold any water either.

This is my entire point, actually, and I'm glad you put it like this. My experience is that on this site, it is very difficult to have *precisely* this kind of nuanced conversation if you're starting from ground zero every time. 		Because when you're having these interesting conversations about where lines are, or gray areas, and things like that, and people derail those conversations with *fundamental* questions that have been answered dozens of times and from which the discussions in question have evolved... you lose something. It isn't productive.		I'm going to put it in the lens of feminism again, because that's where a lot of my experience on this site comes from. When you're having a discussion with people which rests upon, for example, the supposition that the patriarchy is a thing that exists, it's very hard to have that kind of conversation when people who are inexperienced and vocal about their ignorance come in with things like "THE PATRIARCHY ISN'T REAL AND FEMINISTS HATE MEN" It's like yeah, that conversation has been had over and over again, and you should go have it somewhere else if you want to fight about it. Educate yourself or take it elsewhere.		Blow that up to the macro scale of Reddit and that's what I'm talking about when I say that "not all conversation is valuable."		What I'm saying is that I think it's absolutely fine, and would in fact be helpful, to say that a certain baseline level of "discussion" needs to happen elsewhere, that Reddit is not interested in facilitating or perpetuating.		I'm not saying "ban everything", I'm saying that the lines of what Reddit does and does not tolerate can be shifted a little bit at this point, and Reddit would be better off for it.

Legality is an easy, clear-cut way to draw the line.

Similar with revenge porn.		Beyond that it's much harder to define what shouldn't be allowed. The problem is, how do you define something as a valid political view vs. "invalid"? Obviously the racists don't think their views are invalid. So on some level that's just defined by what you agree with. Say for example immigration debates.

Maybe employment is hard to come by in their country. Maybe their family lives over here and deporting them will split up parents and children.

I'd argue not. (Apologies for the US-centric metaphor, but given the US majority userbase here I think it speaks well.)		Reddit has to acknowledge that it is a large, popular site.

We saw this when a lot of people started talking about "reddit alternatives"—they tried finding a new door. It hasn't really worked. Nothing has matched reddit. Because the diversity of this website is what makes these conversations valuable.

I firmly believe that a hive mind somewhere else is less harmful than one here. We're talking about places like coontown, there's nothing being refined there. This isn't a debate about the nature of race in society, it's a debate about whether black people are humans or animals. No one is going to change their minds. It's not a debate worth having. It's not like there are interesting new points to be made. But, by giving them a platform on reddit instead of an obscure racist forum somewhere else, they gain legitimacy. They gain the ability to curate a front page for themselves that makes racism look normal. They get to see some racism, and then immediately jump to a video of a black person in one of the default subs where they can take a steaming pile of shit in the comments. And if it's not overt enough, it'll be upvoted by fellow racists, or people who don't hear the dog whistle or think it's funny. The ensuing debate will mention a racist sub and give it some nice free advertising. Checking out another subreddit is lower friction that another site entirely. The controversy over such horrible racism on such a popular site gives them advertising too. None of this stuff happens with sites like Stormfront, at least not nearly to this degree, it's unique to the way reddit works. 		And now we're at the point where reddit has a reputation for this stuff, which keeps people with other viewpoints away. We can have a site where black people and women feel comfortable, or we can have one where racists and sexists do. We can't have both. There isn't enough isolation between communities to do that, even with the new quarantining. By banning the worst racist subs, we lose racists but gain the people those racists were keeping away. That's going to result in better discussion, the exact opposite of a chilling effect, because the discussion the racists want to have has been done many times before. There are new, modern, more relevant discussions to be had, and if the price to pay is that racists have to find a new place to complain, I say bring it on.

In fact, I feel more comfortable on reddit than I have on pretty much any other social media site. I feel comfortable *because* I can have conversations like this one, where we can discuss complicated issues in totally civil tones and come to more nuanced conclusions as a result. I have not seen that on any other site, tbh.		I used to spend time on tumblr, but the identity politics so popular there became incredibly stifling, uncomfortable, and legitimately dangerous in some cases, to the point where I couldn't log on without holding my breath and crossing my fingers there was no hate or abuse on my dashboard: hate and abuse predicated on the assumption that the people being abused *deserved* it, because they were somehow racist or sexist, based purely on the definitions of the abusers. I saw people pressured to separate themselves from their families, harass their own friends, and repudiate their own gender identities because these things were inherently "oppressive."		I left and came here. It's been a breath of fresh air. Despite being a woman of color, nobody has sent me any harassing messages. In fact, I haven't even read any tirades about how women and people of color are ruining America. Not even on the default subs.		I'm sure those things exist, but *I don't seek them out.* And just as those things may exist, there are plenty of discussions of how to stop institutionalized racism in America. There are discussions of how to reconcile the bloody history that founded our country with the diversity it now holds. There are discussions of transgender visibility. There are posts celebrating record-breaking female athletes. *All* of these things exist on reddit, and I can read what I want, and participate where I want.		That's amazing, to me. That's glorious and that's exactly the kind of community I want to foster. I do not actually want a community where only the topics curated by admins and determined to be *palatable* to a wide audience can exist. I want a community where *everything* can exist, and I can decide what I find palatable. I don't want anybody else deciding that for me.		edit to add:		> Checking out another subreddit is lower friction that another site entirely.		I think this works both ways. Just as going *to* coontown is easier than going to a separate, racist site, people *on* coontown can more easily be linked somewhere else on reddit, where an active debate is happening about what constitutes racism and how it hurts people. Minds can be changed both ways. And that's fine with me. That is a true marketplace of ideas, and I am confident that given the *chance* to compete, non-racists will win.

{"body":"> stifling hate speech		You're jumping the gun here a bit. The discussion at large about hate speech revolves to some extent around what exactly should be defined *as* hate speech.		I don't think that saying "I don't like gay people" is hate speech. It's not nice, and it's not a preference I respect, but it's not hateful, and it doesn't encourage or incite violence or discrimination. I can say "I don't like jocks" without subtly implying that I want them all extirpated, and the same applies even if I'm expressing a racist or sexist or anti-gay view.		> It's also in no way a loss to society for it to be stifled		That particular speech? Perhaps not, but we're not talking about that *particular* speech. We're talking about how a system should be constructed. In practice, hate speech laws do often end up being used to stifle speech that is very firmly in a grey area (which, coincidentally, is why the provision I mentioned was struck down). Laws like this are difficult to take back once they've been put into place, and the more abusive they are the greater the chilling effect on anyone who would complain about them.		I'm also uncomfortable with the way you gloss over the disproportionate nature of the punishment. Going to jail is a very serious penalty: In Canada, having a criminal record makes getting a job extremely difficult. Weigh that against the harm done by a comment like that (virtually none), and factor in the likelihood that someone could hold that opinion without being dangerous or hateful (again, dislike is not hate).		Does a person deserve to have their life ruined for that? Is it worth it to society, so that no protected minority should ever have to be faced with non-violent bigotry?

I know I've personally been accused of making racist comments on this site against a minority group to which I belong (hard to tell, our user names are all blue), and the particular comment I'm thinking of was not hateful, nor could it have even been perceived as hateful when taken in the context of the entire post.

All it takes is for one person to read it the wrong way (or pick a few words out of the center of a sentence) and I lose an years old account if you let that policy go through.  If Bill the Admin arrives at his hate speech moderation queue in a sour mood and reads the few words in the middle of a sentence that when isolated from the words before or after make a terrible sentence, boom, ban.		Or in another hypothetical case, let's say a level headed person who was raised in a small southern US town has always just accepted some racist idea as a matter of fact.  He arrives in a subreddit where somebody is refuting that idea, and he makes a comment consisting of what he believes to be innocuous fact, but others construe it as hate speech.  In one universe, he engages in the conversation where by the end he realizes his assessment of the facts were wrong and his mind is opened however more slightly (this really does happen sometimes, I promise).  In another universe, his first comment is reported and deleted and he's banned, never having reached the conclusion that his assessment of the fact was wrong.  He goes about his daily life with 60+ year old ideas about differences between races. 		I think leaving the comments stand requires the belief that the overwhelming majority of community members have a good sense of morality as well as a trust that the downvote system will punish/hide the contributions from those who don't.

I think it is far less likely that somebody who sits on the fence with borderline racist thoughts will actively seek out somebody in private if they don't find an already established public community.		You're also assuming that for every one "fence sitter" you can dissuade from their racist views, another will become full on racist.  I think the people organizing there are not "beginning to think racist thoughts."  They're already there, and all the way.  You're not going to "fact and logic" them into submission.  Ever try to beat a dumbass by using logic?  They always walk away thinking they won.  If you don't allow them that public forum, you largely isolate them from each other and take away a lot of the ability they have to recruit and further radicalize less extreme thinkers.  Their comments in isolation within a regular sub will get absolutely demolished, and, if nothing else, can be used as a head on a pike.  They won't have the sense of security that comes with knowing they're surrounded by a community of like minds and will feel less bold about broadcasting their shitty views.		I'm all for allowing racist or otherwise hateful comments to be left up to the discretion of the subreddit they were made in.

However that isn't to say that reddit is not, nor should not be, a forum of both global as well as niche subs that may only want input from established community members.		The only "anti-brigading" measures I believe should be implemented are tools that only permit subscribers actions once they have met certain requirements. For instance you could allow mods to stipulate that people can only vote on items in their sub after their comments have received a specified amount of karma.		There are many, many ways this could be broken down and many subs may want different ways to limit participation. For instance one sub may want to prevent users from submitting links until they've acquired a specified amount of comment karma on that sub. Other subs may want to restrict users from commenting unless they've already submitted a successful link.

{"body":"At what point was the paid iPad app ever declared as being ad-free? IIRC the paid version of that app was the original developer version that wasn't officially affiliated with reddit. You were paying for an app and supporting an independent developer.  The official Alien Blue app for iPad that was later released was fee and made no promises about ads either. 		Now on the iPhone version if you get the Pro upgrade you should not be getting ads. At least I've never seen them. However there is confusion because people bought the upgrade on the original version (the unofficial version made by /u/jase) and for some reason didn't get the free upgrade when it was released for a week around the time of the launch of the new, official app. Pro upgrades aren't carried over from app to app because a) the apps are owned in the App Store world by different developers and b) Apple IDs aren't shared or available to developers so there is no way to tell if someone bought the Pro upgrade on the original version so it can automatically be credited to the new version.

{"body":"Saying that someone did something doesn't make it a fact.		There's no particular reason to attribute that action to any SJW on reddit. It could have been the guy's ex wife trying to fuck with him and used that as a potential route to do so. There is zero evidence that it is a morally opposed internet stranger.		What reddit will be responsible for is pernicious and trackable offenses that are committed via reddit.		If any single opinion that you have is controversial enough that you think it could legitimately get you fired, then I would urge you to rethink your stance. 		Personally I find any similarities that people draw between something like CoonTown and something like KiA to be laughable, disingenuous and overtly misinformed. The fact that you're on a list with them is a tad ridiculous, and I'm probably on the list too, since I've made (dissenting) comments in KiA. And that's one of the key differences, in my eyes; you can go to KiA and partake in the conversation as someone who disagrees with them, but you can't go to CoonTown for any reason.		Anyways, that got ranty. As far as anyone knows, KiA isn't even on reddit's radar as something to watch.

Pretty speech needs no one to defend it. Everyone likes it already. It's the ugly speech, the one that makes me people like me and you feel disgusted, the one that needs defense, and without that defense, any community -such reddit- becomes vulnerable to groupthink and cultural stagnation.		So yes, I do feel that being put in a list simply for posting in a controversial subreddit makes me, or any 'reasonable person', to paraphrase Ellen Pao, 'conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express my ideas or participate in the conversation', and given the harassment many gamergate supporters have been through, to also 'fear for my safety and those around me'.

{"body":"Oh, hey, it's 2015 and you guys are waking up and thinking, "Oh, hey, it's 2015, this smartphone fad really isn't going away... hey guys, let's make an app for the smartphone users, because not everyone wants to ride the Cupertino bus to perpetual 2007." Yeah, great idea. Here's a better one. Leave the API open, or what have you, IANAP, but we have like 5 or 6 Reddit apps that work great. Everyone has a favorite and there is no clear best. I prrefer Sync and BaconReader. Have both installed, each serves a purpose (Sync has a nicer interface, BaconReader has the best comment browsing of any of them, it's the only one that can collapse all). With Apple, one size fits all. And that may have worked in the last decade, but for those of us living in the future, with bona fide personal computers in our pockets, we need choices. One size does not fit all with us. I have an HTC One M8 because I love the speakers and I don't need a fancy camera. Some other guy chose the Galaxy S6 because he needs a fingerprint reader and a better camera than I do. And that lady over there has a Motorola, and can just tap the edge of her phone to see the time and date, and can open the camera with a flick of her wrist. We're not going anywhere, and we're certainly not riding the Cupertino train to 2007.		I think it's safe to say none of us want you to make a new app for us. What would really be cool, and could be the same thing you want, is if you hired one of the leading developers or teams. OneLouder, who makes BaconReader, also have Twitter and Facebook apps, a great weather app, and more. They might be a bit too big, but you can't fault their ambition. I think for official status, Reddit is Fun's developer might be the best choice. I think you'll find that TalkLittle's design is faithful to Reddit's own design. It's a good app, but I don't use it for that reason. Looks too native. I like different. But I don't fault the RiF fans.		Setting smartphones aside, let me tell you the big problem I have with the way some subreddits (ironically, /r/Android is one) are run. You got some mods, who see a post that has an opportunity for karma, so they'll delete the post, and then they'll repost it themselves. You guys have said that Reddit is a place where people can come together and have good conversations. Yet ranking is based on karma, and if you have people making great posts, yet moderators are cannibalizing these posts for themselves, you're disenfranchising users. What I propose is not simple and might not make sense on the server end, but I'm gonna say it anyway. If someone posts a link, they "own" it, for karma purposes. If anyone reposts it, all karma flows to the original submitter, even if the sub bans them. Then you won't have sketchy mods and admins cannibalizing posts.		Ban evasion won't work. We live in a world with dynamic IPs and VPNs. You want to do what you want to do? Stop looking at IPs and start looking into heuristic message scanning. We're creatures of habit, there is software that can search for patterns. But that's not accurate enough. You want to ban me, for instance? You scan my post history and search for me amongst your other members, I bet you get more false positives than you want. I really think a shadowban commune (where being shadowbanned means only other shadowbanned users can see your posts). That way, the "nobody is reacting to my posts, I must be shadowbanned" trigger doesn't happen.		STFU about brigading as long as SRS and others are open. Nobody gives a shit. If the original and most prolific offenders are allowed to operate, nobody cares what you want to do about the less prolific ones. I mean, seriously. Either it's allowed or it isn't. Get off the fence. You can't move forward on the fence. Get off the fence, on one side or another, then put one foot in front of the other, and keep moving forward. You're going to piss a lot of people off, but don't be afraid to say, "This is OUR site and this is how we're running it."		On the tech side, I really don't think you can stop brigading with code. As long as you have two users who can access the sub doing the brigading and the sub to be brigaded, one user will probably always be able to tell the other user about the other sub and the other user will be able to get to the other sub and do what they're going to do. You have to do it with policy. Put your foot down, show an example, spell out exactly what it is (some are unclear), and say, "This shit will get you banned. Please, try it and be an example to all the other little fuckwads who want to do it." Then ban a bunch of them at once, and dare others to do it. Bring some people in and swing the ban hammers. Happy to help if you need it.		Source(s): Ran a forum for a couple years, albeit 10 years ago. Always been interested in the sociology of online communities, well, since about 2000 or so.

{"body":"The important and controlling question is: how does reddit *know* that someone's copyright in media being linked to is being violated? The answer is that it requires proof originating from a legal process: either a court decision for that particular media, or law enforcement representing to reddit that criminal copyright violation is occurring, or a DMCA takedown process (which largely does not apply to reddit, as they largely do not host most content that might be DMCAd (unless it's text, or is a graphic element served as part of CSS)).		Further, in this age of *licenses*, it's possible that whoever is posting links to outside-hosted material has been granted a license allowing them to host that material and link to it — and that license may be granted explicitly through license language, unwittingly through license language, or implicitly through case law and legislation of the applicable jurisdictions from where it was distributed and where it is hosted. Those are all legal technicalities which reddit doesn't control, and which reddit is unqualified to interpret or enforce — that would be a court's job, and reddit is technically an "*uninterested third party*".		Without the legal process, anyone could "claim" they had copyright interest in something and use that to censor discussion and chill public participation. For reddit, or any forum host, to *reasonably know* that the copyright is actually being violated, they need the legal process followed.		When reddit *has* been informed that a community existed solely for the purpose of criminal copyright infringement, they shut the community and its offshoots down — the visble example being /r/thefappening, which was shut down once reddit administration was approached by law enforcement investigating the theft of the pictures.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bardfinn","name":"t1_ctkj46u","parent_id":"t1_ctkgt2m","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438221675,"created_utc":1438192875}

And shadowbanning isn't just 'sneaky' it's fucking draconian.

{"body":"Sounds like a lot more crap telling people, "No, you can't do that," instead of actual cool new features.		List of features that would be better than all the censorship crap:		* Show up votes / down votes.  Why was this taken away?  Seems like just a way to manipulate ranks behind the scenes.		* Have a Markdown option for writing posts instead of Reddit for people who don't want to to use Reddit formatting.  They're already so close...		* Have a tile view like Shiny Reddit has.	** Shiny Reddit Pro - Chrome Web Store || https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shiny-reddit-pro/nihdcibdbpkakpaolelklbgckofeaofp?hl=en		* Automatically post all the times a link or photo was shared across all subreddits.  And links to those same posts / links with dates when they were originally posted.  The bots that do that are so kind.		* Create a way to Publish bad PMs to a Wall of Shame.  Recipient gets too many dick picks, boom they have a way to share it with the Reddit for creepy PMs.  And if you're worried about new accounts... just set it so you have to wait a day before you can PM anyone... OR... set it so users can block PMs form people who have accounts under X days old.  That way if I want creepy dick picks, and I'm a girl, I can turn off that block... but if not, easy out.  And if someone from an established account wants to send me a creepy message, I can still share it to the world and shame that fucker.  Or set it so you can make your account only able to receive PMs if you initiate them with that person.  Boom... we never have people getting messages they don't want ever again, and if they do we can all have a good laugh at the perv's expense.  "It's so tiny!  He he."		* Bring back FatPeopleHate.  We're doing it for their own good.  Really and truly.  Have you ever had to fly next to a fattie?  It sucks.  The fat fucks... nobody wants them around.  They made horrible life choices and we are calling them out on it.  It's lime smoking or doing meth.  They made the choice not to put the fork down.  They are a huge reason health care costs are on the rise, they're literally stealing from us to support their shitty fucking horrible decisions.  Just don't eat at McDonalds every meal.  Just walk your ass around the block.  Fucking fat people did it to themselves.  No different than if someone was a skinhead with a Swastika tattoo.  They made the choice to do that, and we should be free to call them out on it.		* Have an annual election day for moderators.  Because... fuck the mods.  They aren't good people, 99% of the time they're just cunts on power trips.  Seriously.  Fuck.  The.  Mods.  At least if we had elected mods we'd know we were living with our own shitty choices.

I don't mean to be mean, but it's kinda jarring when you place it with the other suggestions (some of which are feasible).		There are still fat shaming subreddits, I assume. If you're really into that, join one of them. I sincerely hope you don't, but I doubt I'd change your mind without a very long, detailed conversation.		The reason FatPeopleHate was banned wasn't because of it's message, but how it harassed others, and made it easy for others to do the same. It's like the cake makers in Oregon that refused service to the gay couple. They got sued, but not for their refusal. They got sued for sharing the couple's personal information with everyone, who then harassed the gay couple for months afterwards with death threats and the like.		If they were to lift the ban on FatPeopleHate, it basically vindicates their style of brigading and harassment, and they would continue to do so. And I don't think that's something you want either.

{"body":"Hey /u/spez!		In one of your answers of your recent AMA you said that monetization wasn't a short term concern but you are looking at creative efforts to experiment. Is there any room in the budget for a professional Redditor? Allow to me to travel around around the world doing awesome things sponsored by anyone who is willing to fund the adventure and brand deal. If a studio has a movie premier coming up, they could fly me out and let me interview everyone. If a brand has a new coffee coming out that they want Reddit to know about, they can show where the beans are harvested and who roasts them. If someone has a new low cost razor in Germany, I'll tour the factory and organize a Reddit meetup in Germany! I will post all my travels and adventures making myself available to questions and suggestions. My dream job would be a professional Redditor, I just didn't see it listed in the job postings.","depth":0,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"challenge4","name":"t1_ctk8pmz","parent_id":"t3_3f10up","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438207000,"created_utc":1438178200}
