While it is true that the French did not offer a full alliance until after the Battle of Saratoga, they had been supply the colonies for long before that. Also, you could hardly say that the colonies were on their way to victory at this point, they had just won their first major battle is all. France simply wanted to ensure that before they publicly threw their hat in with the underdog, there was a chance for victory. Also, while other countries may have helped, they helped to a much smaller degree than the French. I do not really see your point about them getting something out of it, of course they would have wanted to get something out of it, another ally against Britain and an economic ally. Having an economic ally with access to so many raw materials was incredibly important as that is how Britain even became the economic and naval powerhouse of Europe in that time. Downplaying the effects of French involvement is silly, they were crucial. Also, you have no definitive proof that any other nation would have helped as much as France.

{"body":"The allies would've definitely won, I don't know if there's any way to argue it. The germans even conducted [an offensive specifically because the americans were coming] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Offensive), but they failed to get France to surrender. 		>After a few days, the German advance began to falter, as the infantry became exhausted and it became increasingly difficult to move artillery and supplies forward to support them. Fresh British and Australian units were moved to the vital rail centre of Amiens and the defence began to stiffen. After fruitless attempts to capture Amiens, Ludendorff called off Operation Michael on 5 April. By the standards of the time, there had been a substantial advance. It was, however, of little value; a Pyrrhic victory in terms of the casualties suffered by the crack troops, as the vital positions of Amiens and Arras remained in Allied hands. The newly-won territory was difficult to traverse, as much of it consisted of the shell-torn wilderness left by the 1916 Battle of the Somme, and would later be difficult to defend against Allied counterattacks.		>The Allies lost nearly 255,000 men (British, British Empire and French). They also lost 1,300 artillery pieces and 200 tanks.[20] All of this could be replaced, either from French and British factories or from American manpower. German troop losses were 239,000 men, many of them specialist shocktroops (Stoßtruppen) who were irreplaceable.[20] In terms of morale, the initial German jubilation at the successful opening of the offensive soon turned to disappointment as it became clear that the attack had not achieved decisive results.		 Also Americans under Wilson were more lenient on the Germans in peace negotiations than the French or British, so if anything they might've prevented a dragged out conflict, which would've ended in German defeat anyway, but under worst terms.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"InZaintJohn","name":"t1_cwzwftr","parent_id":"t1_cwzvnyl","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447537078,"created_utc":1447508278}

Nontheless these kinds of acts piss me of more than it would the majority of people, because meanwhile it is an attack on innocent lifes to which following the Islamic law killing one innocent life is as if one killed the enitre humanity and saving one innocent life is as if one has saved the entire human race, and to have to go through these kinds of accusations every time someone I don't know or have any affiliation with decides this is what they want the image of Islam to be is tiring, very tiring, it quickly starts to change the way I even precieve myself, anyway the answer is by no means war, all it will achieve is more destruction and there will be far more people who are innocent that will die than those who are truly responsible, just looking back at the Iraq war, it is estimated that tony blair is responsible for the death of almost 1 million civilian iraqi lifes - this is what war does, it allows those in power to capitalize of the pain of others in times like these to benefit themselves, to go in under the guise of one goal with an entirley different goal in mind, now I think this is an issue that goes deeper beyond uneducated people growing in conditions where they are not open to knowledge - said terrorists are recruiting kids (12+ - 20year olds) because it is easier to brain wash them, and this is in and of itself is a real issue in the Muslim world, an issue of which the governments are attempting to combact through adverts and movements against extremism, warning both parents to look out for their children and children to look out for these sorts of people and I think perhaps this is where we need to start, we need to start by educating people, that is the only way to truly achieve anything long term - meanwhile it may seem the way to go right to now to just walk in and kill a bunch of innocents it is clear that is not going to fix anything as we've seen from the afghan war and the iraqi war, another group will simply rise in it's place like an infection and as such it must be combacted with a different type of weaponary, weaponary being education, for knowledge is more powerful than any bullet or bomb.","depth":8,"score":106,"ups":106,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"PrinceAbdie","name":"t1_cwzu5tc","parent_id":"t1_cwzp7g5","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447527261,"created_utc":1447498461}

{"body":"You aren't seriously attempting to justify keeping Muslims out, essentially barring a 1/6th of the world, you also realize that Islam is a religon and not a state, country or nationality meaning you'd also have to kick out anyone who is Muslim regardless of how long their line of origin is whether it be 300 years or 30 years, if you want to know the difference then perhaps you should begin by reading the book (The quran) in an unbiased way, and ask about that which you may not understand, for it is not an easy book to read (you can't essentially read it like you would a story book or a magazine or newspaper, you have to really understand - to understand why something was said the way it was or why something wasn't said deliberatley and meanwhile at times it is obvious it is also sometimes not so obvious, the context can have many conotations, meanings or references as you would expect if this really was the word of God but whether you agree it is the word of God or not is in some ways irrelevant and besides the point). Fine for the sake of argument lets assume you kick out every Muslim in every European country including America, the loss will be greater than anything you would hope to gain, for there are innocent and good Muslims living in these countries, contributing towards a larger good like the rest of you/us, not to mention how you will harm people who aren't muslims either, think about muslim employers, where will their employees go? Who will pay for their survival? The government or essentially the tax payer? It is not as if  governments already have enough issues on their hands, whole livleyhoods will be reduced to nothing, some may even commit suicide depending on their circumstance, it is not unlikley that a 50 year old man working his whole life to ensure the wellbeing of his kids will commit suicide under the right circumstance after loosing his job, you've already lost more lives through suicide than through terroist acts, this is besides the toll that the emigration of this many people would have on the economy as a whole for more than obvious reasons. Also another point to keep in mind terrorism is not a Islamic issue, atleast not in the way that you may precieve, yes it is an issue, but it is by far not the biggest source of terrorism, infact in comparison to other forms of terrorism it contributes less than 10% - it simply gets more attention when it happens because the person doing the terrorism was a Muslim, the same thing would apply if a woman was raped, it would never be heard of on such a scale if a woman was raped by any white male or non Muslim, but since it was a Muslim who did it the whole world needs to know, it as if every Muslim is suppose to be held to one standard and since one Muslim acts this way all Muslims must agree. You can't solve it by simply kicking or barring Muslims, and assuming you did it will create more issues in the long run for kids will grow up thinking that Islam is an evil religon hence why Muslims aren't allowed in the country, those said kids will one day grow up to the leaders or inheritors of this world, with this sort of idea deeply rooted in the brain from childhood even if not activley, it is still subconsciously present further increasing any hate towards muslims as a whole and perhaps causing tragedies in said western nations on a larger and more organized scale because it will no longer be some extremist minorities killing innocents it will be whole states attacking a whole religon leading to what could possibly full blown warfare. From simply an issue that can be treated through education to an issue that will claim far more lives than would have otherwise occured and just looking at how many lives were claimed in one war against one country imagine how many lives will be claimed if you happen to wage war against a whole religon, look at how many nations will be involved, therein lies your answer as to why this is not the greatest of ideas, perhaps some of these conclusions seem farfetched, but we've seen enough "farfetched" occurances as to know these things are not as farfetched as they may seem. Also I'd like to point you to this Ted Talk, perhaps she can shed some light on matters I may have not addressed.

Also yes it is my religon and it is a problem we need to solve but at the same time if you're going to argue that since it's the Muslims problem we should just stay out of it and let them deal with it, then perhaps you could also argue as to why America and Britain decided it was a good Idea to invade Iraq or why it seems like a western country, mostly the US is always trying to gain access to a "Muslim" country under the guise of going in for help when any person with half a brain cell is aware the US doesn't do anything that isn't in its best interest, which is fine, but lets not pretend they did it for any other motive than self interest, anything good that comes out of it is nothing more than a by product, perhaps if the west didn't meddle so much in the issues of said muslims then maybe you wouldn't even have some of these groups you're trying to say is our problem and that we should fix, take ISIS for example or even Hamas, it is a manifsation of some direct actions of western leaders; but ISIS only became a full blown media thing after a western person was killed, but yet it got no news time when it was only killing innocent muslims, right because a muslim life =/= an american life; you can't simply argue that you want nothing to do with it after having had everything to do with it, also it may just work for you if the whole world was simply split into two sections, the idea you want to see come through requires there be what is a berlin wall on a much larger scale, and not just physically, but economically too which will have large implications, again it seems you are going to extremes to solve an issue which is not as big - relativley that is, perhaps if we all got together and sat down (as nations) and got to the root of the problem and for once used our brain rather than flopping around our dicks to see who has the biggest weapon or who can do the most damage we could come to a  conclusion that will end all of this which as far as I'm aware is in everyone's best interest. That or you can just leave "us" to deal with it as you said and it will more than likley end up a far bigger issue than what currently is, and it is not because we as a people are incapable of dealing with it but rather because mostly every "Muslim" leader is pretty much there because the US wants him there, and as such they're all corrupt, how do you expect us to deal with corrupt leaders which your governments put in place in the first place, did you not see what happens when a revolution is to break out, these leaders simply bomb their own people as in the case of Egypt, Lybia and Syria - quite literally killing their own country men and in some ways some of these "western" leaders are directly responsible - far more people have died in just one of these revolutions than have since the idea of terrorism and Islam being linked was even a thing and non of these people were remotley responsible for what these inhumane bastards decided to do to their own countrymen; yet you ask why should I deal with it, it's not my problem - I'd just like to end with this is exactly the kind of attitude that started this whole mess from beginning to end and what further perpetuates every day.","depth":12,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PrinceAbdie","name":"t1_cwzz4d4","parent_id":"t1_cwzyh9d","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447544574,"created_utc":1447515774}

{"body":"So in your post I see no explicit condemnation of what was done, and the things you say that come close to that begin *within* the Islamic apologetics that begin after the second comma of the first sentence.		This is very very common in discourse such as this, and I think it should be questioned and repudiated where necessary.		For the record, you condemn the acts? You think they were utterly wrong? You think the men in special hats claiming divine knowledge that brainwash the young and impressionable are utterly wrong, mendacious, sinister despots? I ask because I see what I often see: the ostensibly rational, calming hand in a claim of moderation that lacks the conviction to call the bad aspects of their religion/culture bad.		I am glad we agree that education is the core solution. This of course leads to secularism over time, which is the *real* solution when it comes to management of mass human delusion, and things like murdering people for cartoons, child mutilation, forcing/brainwashing women such that they live in bags and are denied education and social choice. Etc.		We also agree that large scale war will probably cause more suffering than 'taking the hits' during a longer, educational/secular/grass roots approach. The problem is that both sides know who will win 'the war' with the latter approach - the secularists, the rationalists - so real warfare is tragically inevitable.		I think the realisation of that strategic fact says far more about the true nature of Islam than anything any sincere or disingenuous Muslim can say. It is an ugly artifact of pre-Enlightenment civilisation, wielded as a tool - often a weapon - by those in power - invariably theocrats - in 3rd/2nd world countries. If they lose that tool, they lose their power.		Its a sad truth that the *entire thing* is such a naked, halfwitted - yet so lethal -  exercise in irrational conservatism, either for an individual who doesn't want his 'deeply held lifelong beliefs' undermined (the first mistake being to have held "beliefs" at all) or for the powerful to maintain power.		And while I'm deeply critical of any religious angle to this, there is of course the gamesmanship by the states. To a non-zero degree, the events will be used to achieve certain things. To a non-zero degree things will have been prepared for an event like this, enabled by the outcome, *capitalisation* of it planned because of its inevitablity. To an non-zero degree opportunities for powermongering will present themselves. I am just as critical of this callous behavior - though some it no doubt is fully pragamatic and genuine, even if misplaced to whatever degree - as the religious failure that represents the main component of the event. However, how the fuck does one even begin to gather the unadulterated evidence involved before sitting down to consider it? The only thing I trust less than the governments and their backers (or rather, the sociopaths who are attracted to such circles of power) are the clergy, but the margin is thin, and it is essentially the same type of person involved whereever one has cause to worry.		The difference between the two for me is: religion has no basis in truth, no moral mandate, and limited, decreasing social mandate, and no way to hide what it wants. You can literally buy the book! It's easy to evaluate and reject. The machinations of the states, much harder: smoke and mirrors; truth and lies; with very little vulnerability to any inquirer who typically has no power to even collect meaningful evidence for consideration.		Yes events like these are the product of both stupidities, but i see no way that Islamic apologetics can be held in anything other than the same contempt as that which we should have for the recent events. Irrationality is an abject blight upon human thought and action. Theism is where human irrationality is ultilised, weilded and weaponised by the powerful. This is known. This has been shown. The powermongers of Islam do not want to give up their power and they correctly equate secularism with erosion of their belief system. Thus, *we are going to see some shit.*		However, no matter who is in power, or who is under threat, I cannot abide being told egregious falsehoods - however veiled - that Islam is wholesome or good. This is disgusting untruth, and it will be repudiated.","depth":9,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"undefeatedantitheist","name":"t1_cwzyzyl","parent_id":"t1_cwzu5tc","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447544280,"created_utc":1447515480}

In regard to the "men in special hats", yes I think their ideas are evil, perhaps they are aware that what they think Islam is not true and they are simply using it to fuel a different agenda or goal, hiding behind religon as people tend to often do - I mean for goodness sake even George W. Bush claimed god told him to go to war in Iraq as the Iraq war begun and the masses being idiots gulped it up like a kitten to a bowl of milk, which is again why education of every aspect of thing that plagues our society is important - people should be given the opportunity to conclude to their own set of beliefs or lack thereof individually un-aided by any group or agenda. Also I don't think my religon in and of itself is bad, I think the people that decide this is the way they want to practice the religon are bad, and I can provide evidence directly from the Quran as to why these "terroist" acts as we recognize them today are not allowed, you may argue so can they, they quote parts,  yet but the difference is I take into account everything, they simply quote things out of context kind of how I referred to Germany and churchil in the post you're replying to which is why I say education is important, and when I say education I don't just mean education in the way we know it in secular states, meanwhile I agree the sciences are extremly important, the understanding of the relgion you're growing up to practice is also important - rather the understanding of most popular ideologies are important period (for obvious reasons). So when I say education it encompasses education in the broadest of senses from history to physics to religon, and as such if I thought my relgion was bad I would not believe in the religon, yes I can fully agree that the culture or cultures cultivated in some Muslim worlds are dispicable, wrong and disguisting, I have witnessed these first hand where people randomly decide that a person is evil simply because they herd a rumor about them when that's all it ever is - a rumor and even if it where true it does not give anyone to act the way they do; for any form of prosecution is to be handled by the state and not the people themselves, this would be anarchy in it's most definite of senses. People in some of these cultures often use words which can sometimes have opposite and cotradictory meanings interchangably like synonyms - the words I refer to are "Aib" and "Haram", Aib meanig socially unacceptable and Haram meaning religously unacceptable, for example you may see it as socially unacceptable to say blow your nose into a tissue in public, but you can just then say it's religously unacceptable, it's almost laughable to say so, and so when these words are used to interchangeably as often as they are and over time, it begins to slowly change the understanding of kids growing up over time as to what is right and wrong, socially and religously causing huge mix ups - this combined with the lack of proper understanding creates a dangerous mix, in some cases forming what we today view as extremists, now like I alread mention said extremists may geneuinley think they're in the right or maybe they're using religon to further an agenda nontheless it is easy for them to lure kids in and brainwash them when there is no strong base or support for the kids as to what religon really is when growing up. 		In regards to what education could lead to over time then perhaps I disagree with you in that it will lead to secularism, but nontheless I can agree that killing for cartoons which in and of itself is wrong (to activley seek out something so central to someone's life - religon and make fun of it) but nontheless it does not justify killing, this is how most people/Muslims feel, I'm not the exception; infact I'm not the exception in most ideas I've expressed, but rather I'm the majority, it's equally as unacceptable to not allow women to an equal education to that of men, needless to say child mutilation is also unacceptable and most of these things I say are unacceptably are also Haram - religously unacceptable; essentially you'd be held responsible by God to a degree equivalent to that of killing an innocent life; yet sadly some of these things are Aib - socially acceptable and perhaps now you may begin to see what I mean by there is a cross over in the use of Haram and Aib and how it can have it's own set of repercussions.		I do think that warfare may be possibly or even a necessary, but I don't think we should discuss warfare untill all other diplomatic means have been exhausted, war is not an end all, it is a final means, a necessary one and meanwhile it may just be easier to declare war, we as a population of humans and as a society have to not accept it, for when war begins it is usually a bunch of powerful men who don't have to actually suffer the pains or bloodshed of war personally who just like to wave their dicks around a table boasting about who has the bigger dick - essentially going to war is being reduced to a pissing contest, and meanwhile there maybe a clear winner in a war between Muslims and the rest of the world you forget that there are 1.7+ billion Muslims in the world - the majority of which are very passionate about their religon, so essentially you would have to wipe out that many people because I don't imagine you expect the majority of them to ever stand down on the basis of forseeing a loss, if anything quite the opposite, in the end the casualties to both sides will be traumatic and meanwhile you may have killed more Muslims, does that really make you feel any better, I mean you still lost lives which weren't necessary to loose. Also I don't see solving the issue of terroism as an issue of Muslims vs the world, but rather Everyone vs extremism. 		In regards to leaders using religon, more specifically Islam as a tool to achieve their goals; this is an ugly thing yes, and even more so because most of them aren't really Muslims nor do they really believe in Islam, for them it's just another thing they can use to justify actions once used in a certain way and again this boils down to education - they would not get away with these actions if the people they're talking to were educated about the religon and in general; the tool they use is not Islam, the tool is lack of education, by knowing more you can control the world or rather by stopping others from learning what you know. This is not something just used in 2nd/3rd world countries, like I said earlier even George Bush attempted to justify entering Iraq by actually saying because God told him so - I mean I've seen some BS but come on really how stupid must he have thought people to be to actually say something like this, like really he must have been laughing on the inside as he said that. 		Essentially I think we agree in the fact that the power circles attract simply the power hungr and those who quite literally want to personally own the world, I mean just take a second to look back at the presidents who have been ruling for the past 50 or so years, I think you may start to see a pattern of certain families being in power popping up time and time again, it is quite fascinating really that we as a western society condemn some 3rd world countries or laugh at them at how their rulers are inherited, yet it is happening in our own back yard under are very noses just under a different scent; I think it is important we start to address these issues within ourselves, and to enable society and most importantly the youth as a whole world wide to think; to truly and critically think, to educate, to teach, to breed the need to understand rather than the need to simply wear $500 shoes or listen to the latest mind numbing rap/hiphop/pop or whatever else mindless shit the majority of kids my age listen to. You've presented a fair argument in it's own right and perhaps caused me to consider things I had not yet considered,  I do however hope I've addressed your concerns to an acceptable degree at the very least and I apolgize if I haven't it is either because I simply do not have the time or because I do not have the religous knowledge to discuss the topic in detail or perhaps a combination of both and as such I would hate to pass on inaccurate information - which is something I very much despise.		On an unreleated note, it is refreshing to discover that not all niches of the internet have been taken over by the mindless zombies which haunt our society. I'm a fairly new reddit user and I thought I would have to deal with the same ignorant assholes who usually like to swear at me without actually providing a logical or valid argument; I'm happy to say so far I'm glad to be mistaken.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PrinceAbdie","name":"t1_cx00hg2","parent_id":"t1_cwzyzyl","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447547637,"created_utc":1447518837}

{"body":"Please quote them and/or refer me to said video or article? I'm asking geniunley because I'm not familiar with some of them, but nontheless you will find people who disagree with each other anywhere and everywhere, but I can't imagine they would ever get behind the idea of bombing innocent people who don't even have a weapon in hand, the idea in Islam is you are not even allowed destroy a plant if you're fighting in a war, in addition to only killing those who are activley fighting you and so if you see a man simply stood there minding his own business not dueling a weapon then you have no authority or any ground to harm him, ofcourse you're not to harm kids, women or the elderly either also since I already begun in mentioning the rules of war you're not allowed to take anyone as a prisoner unless you can feed them from the same food you eat and are able to generally look after them which isn't to say you can kill them, you're not allowed to kill if someone puts down their weapon and gives in. So with these rules in mind I really can't imagine a true Muslim scholar who follows in the teachings of the Quran and the prophet Muhammad pbuh would ever agree with the killing of innocents who have not harmed anyone. Also you maybe right that collectivley the knowledge of one of them may outweigh mine but perhaps my knowledge is not just knowledge, for knowledge without actually applying is simply data and data is useless without context, so even though I'm just some 18 year old kid and they're scholars that may have possibly been studying Islam for double my life time perhaps I'm better in the eyes of the creator for my intentions are pure and the knowledge of which I do know is more usefull to me than anything any of them have ever learned, and this is just a hypothetical I'm not saying my knowledge outweighs theres in any way shape or form, which reminds me of a story in the Quran really of a group of kids who had to leave their village or town simply because they believed in God and everyone else in the city didn't and were being hunted by an unjust ruler, but yet they were all youth who were probably more or less my age or maybe even younger they didn't have any access to the information you or I do, they simply were believers in the oneness of a God or a creator/architect and yet 1400 years later said scholars are learning lessons from them which is to say that experience isn't everything, p.s the story takes place before the coming of prophet Muhammad, several hundreds years earlier - possibly thousands. Also I would never deny their scholarship, if anything I may deny some of their ideas and not out of the ability of I can do whatever I want or think however I want but I would point to specific referrences in the Quran as to why I can't accept this idea for it is not a matter of what best suits me or what I prefer or what is easier to believe or do. Anyway I seem to have somewhat diverged, could you please point me towards what it is that some of them may have said and the source please?

You can be poor, abused, starved, harassed, bullied, abandoned, marginalized, dehumanized, and otherwise mistreated and still value humanity and life to the point where you combat these things verbally or by selecting military targets.		Islamic terrorists openly state their values. Their values are not secret, and are very different from western values.		To reduce them to "Oh it's cause they are poor and mistreated" is arguably more dehumanizing than calling them evil monstrous bastards. One completely ignores their moral values, the other just says their values are wrong.	Saying that their priorities are only different because they're poor and mistreated is dehumanizing, disrespectful, and dismissive of non-western ideas and values. 		I'm not arguing for or against any particular course of action, social, economical, or military. I don't have any answers.

I have a growing suspicion that terrorism will be eradicated only when the vast majority humans world wide and all cultures value life enough that even if they are driven to kill for their cause, it would be in self defense, or against a military/government target, not mass killings.

{"body":"Unfortunately time and education won't prevent more tragic events in the short term.  You're absolutely correct that these are the only two meaningful tools in the long term but humans are so quick to anger and so eager to raise their fists.  A conflict of ideology has no simple solution.		I am of the opinion that the conflict needs to be slowed.  People are killed so very easily.  And every time blood is shed someone grieves.  And so hatred grows, like wildfire.  And yet despite this, we cannot abandon our arms.  The USA probably has more bullets than it does people to shoot and yet there's no hope of us laying down those weapons.  And I think the truth here is that guns and all weapons serve only to accelerate the conflict.  Of course it's the people holding those weapons who create the conflict but the fact that our loved ones can be so quickly eliminated can only drive us into a corner rapidly.		More to the point, slowing the conflict gives time and education a better chance at success.  Maybe people can't find mutual understanding but that doesn't mean it has to end in bloodshed.  Once you kill someone they're gone forever, and so the killing shouldn't happen in the blink of an eye.

{"body":"I tell my friends and comment on social media. But that's all I've done. I'm not a part of any group. 		After 9/11 happened, a group of Muslims (about 10 or so)  from Pakistan went on a peace march from Ground Zero site to another state (till Boston city, I think). I heard this from a friend who'd met one of these peace marchers.  And there was no news coverage of it, from what I heard. They were stopped by cops a few times since they were walking on the freeway as a group, but even that stopped as the police informed their counterparts ahead. I think some local news channel may have covered it but that was all I think			After 9/11, hundreds of Muslim scholars from across the world signed a declaration that spilling the blood of innocent people is against the teachings of Islam but I doubt you've heard of it. There are educational seminars being carried out across cities - my friend is the President of one such effort - where they teach Muslim youth, who are at risk of radicalization, what Islam really is and how to live in peace with others, but even *I* hadn't heard about it until he told me, so I doubt the world knows. 		And finally, bear with me a little here, *why* should I do something beyond telling my friends and acquaintances and writing on social media? Being a Muslim does not mean I'm plugged into a hive-mind and am a single social organism with other Muslims. I don't know those people; I've never met them or even heard them. I've never even seen any of their videos that appear on reddit because, as a Muslim, I'm scared of associating with them even at that level. 		I don't expect all Christians and Catholics to apologize or protest when the Westboro Baptist Church pickets outside a dead soldier's home because I know they aren't a single family or a single group or a single country. There are 72 sects in Muslims, each sect being further divided into extremists, conservatives, liberals and moderns. There's a whole different class of us who don't *want* to identify as a sect and are stuck without a community as such - the only other community we have looks at us for something more than our verbal condemnation, every time one of those extremist bastards does something. 		Why should *I* have to do anything more than express sorrow and criticize the attack, on social media, when everyone else does the same and is considered a part of the good guys for doing just that? The perpetrators are not my family, or friends, or acquaintances, or even people who have the same mindset as me. Those same bastards would much rather shoot me for being "astray" than hear my msg, as they have been doing in Muslim countries with any Muslims who don't agree with them. **I wonder if it registers in people's minds that ISIS has killed more liberal Muslims than it has killed non-Muslims.**		**TL;DR: I'm not connected to the perpetrators of these attacks. They'd shoot me if they knew my beliefs, as they have been doing to other Muslims. The world needs to think about it a bit and realize that.**		**Edit**: I've calmed down a bit and realize that yours is a good idea. Maybe I'll team up with some people I know and see if we can do something more to bring to light all the protests that Muslims have made against extremists. Maybe that'll help - having people know that the other 99% of 1.6 Billion Muslims are not violent extremists.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bvonl","name":"t1_cx0qrm0","parent_id":"t1_cwzwo5o","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447600178,"created_utc":1447571378}

This is true neither in the middle east nor in France. ISIS are religious extremists, motivated by a holy book that preaches jihad. That is part of their identity. Remove the religious element, and they cannot be understood.		However, you are correct in saying that they are motivated by multiple other factors - including power, greed, US imperialism in the ME, the pleasure of being "action heroes" and later "martyrs" (instead of "losers" and "victims"). In France, social exclusion and injustice also plays a large role. In the middle east, local geopolitics (read, Saudi Arabia) are also essential. All of this goes *in addition* to the religious aspect, rather than in its place. It is the convergence of all these factors that makes ISIS such a successful criminal group, despite its sheer stupidity and malice.		Simplifying ISIS as either "religious extremists" or "power/money-hungry" is equally naive and dangerous. We need to look at them for what they are, with eyes unclouded by hate or ideology.

{"body":"My husband and I started dating in July 2011.  In January 2012, his grandfather, a Frenchman, passed away from cancer.  We smuggled his ashes into France (illegal, I know) and scattered them in his hometown, Douai.  We then went back to Paris, which his grandfather adored, and had your standard brilliant time.		When my husband asked me to marry him that October, I asked him shortly after when he knew he wanted to marry me.  He told me it was when we were in Paris, after we came back from Douai, and that he thought of the 72 years his grandparents had spent together, and that he knew, standing on the top of the Eiffel Tower, that he never wanted to be apart from me.  My answer to the same question was nearly identical.		Paris has that way about it.  It makes you fall in love, whether it's with the city itself, its art, its history, its architecture, its poetry...the list goes on.  There's no mystery that this city has been beloved by artists, writers, and poets the world over.  My husband and I were no different.  And tonight, seeing pictures of bodies and watching videos of firefights and military marching through the streets, I thought of my husbands grandfather, who had watched Paris fall to the Germans, and how heartbroken and angry he would be if he were here to see it.		We love you, France. My grandfather loved you and taught me your language.  Paris was the defining moment in the most wonderful relationship I've ever known in my life.

I spent a lot of time on the atheist side of the fence and I get why people think that way. And I pray constantly that they'll eventually come around. 			Anyway. If anyone does see this, I'll give a quick rundown of what I'm actually talking about. 		Modern day extremist Islam is essentially Satanic worship. Go on Wikipedia, read the tenets of Sharia Law. That's what these people are enforcing, one of the reasons they think they're justified. 		Satan's goal is to usurp God's Kingdom and "free" us from Him. He does this a number of ways, primarily sowing discord and deception among His people. Convincing us that evil things are okay. That God doesn't love us, and just wants to control us. Stuff like that has eaten away at human society to the point that the common picture of God is twisted so far away from the truth it's maddening. But people won't even give Him a chance anymore. 		Westboro Baptist? Work of Satan. The "sin and go to hell" mindset that drives so many people away? Satan. The idea that God doesn't want us to be happy, to have what's best for us, or the He's even somehow evil? That's the work of Satan. 		If people choose to ignore this and blame a handful of crazies, fine. But this 'war' has been going on a lot longer than the last two decades. There's more to it than human politics and everyone will eventually have to pick a side. 		As far as God Himself... He just wants what's best for us. But we get caught up in ourselves and what we want and ultimately end up screwing ourselves in the process. Real Christianity shows up in people who love one another despite their flaws and mistakes. They show kindness to those who rebuke them, and they do not seek revenge. We live to make other people's lives better, and display the love that God shows us on a daily basis. Anyone who does otherwise has been mislead at best and is causing harm at worst.","depth":8,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tqwen","name":"t1_cwzq0if","parent_id":"t1_cwzpirr","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447510492,"created_utc":1447481692}

{"body":"My excuse for what? Above all else I want people to see that God is there and he loves us. It's not about power, it's not about politics. 		As far as the fallacy goes... 'No true Christian would xyz" isn't quite what I'm saying here. I know that people who identify themselves as religious do terrible things. They fly the flag, but they're not truly representing what Christ is about. There's a subtle but highly important distinction to be made there. I won't deny this: a lot of "Christians" do an awful job of living by the example that Christ set for us. But by doing that, they're inherently not representing the Christian lifestyle. Sadly, those are the ones that go most noticed since they draw more attention. People who live by the example do small things, small acts of love and kindness here and there throughout the day to make people happy, and if asked they tell them they did it because Jesus gave his life for us to have eternal life in the Kingdom. 	Every once in a while we get the chance to do something big, and when we do, we glorify Him and not ourselves. 		What I'm curious about is why the topic of God brings up so much hostility. I get that other people may have been awful to you about it, and if that's the case, I'm truly sorry. I had the same experience growing up in Catholic schools. That's why I spent so much time trying to disassociate myself from God because I decided I'd be fine without Him. He showed me exactly what happens when we live our lives that way and I decided to go back. 		My excuse, then, I guess, is that God brought me out of a life of misery and quite literally transported me to a completely new life, giving me an opportunity to completely reinvent myself. I live my new life in the holiest manner I can, showing brotherly love and affection to all who cross my path. I don't do it because I'm scared of God, of what I'll get if I don't do everything exactly perfectly. I do it because He did more for me than I could ever do for Him, and he continues to bless me and love me despite my failures and flaws. I want to pay that kindness forward, and share it with those around me. If they choose to deny it, that's their choice and I will never force my views on them.

There's a strange double standard at play these days: atheistic philosophy is trumpeted and heralded as a great point of view and anyone may freely share it in just about any populated area (fundamentalist stereotypical South-esqe social groups notwithstanding) and people will cheer. 		But I come along, and suggest that maybe He is there. Maybe He wants to bless you and bring you life away from the evil that rules this planet. And somehow I get the hate.

They ate from the forbidden tree (Knowledge of Good and Evil) and became aware of a way other than God's. From that point on, we have had to decide how to live our lives on our own.

Last night, i felt sick watching things unfold before my eyes but i honestly were not surprised. Well actually i am, i am surprised that the death count is that low. Eight basterds, with heavy weapons and explosives.... A stadium filled with people, a concert hall packed with 1500 people..		This demonstrates how fuckin stupid those guy are. They re that brain damaged that even with the means of killing thousands of people they managed to fortunately fuck it up. 3 dudes blow themselves nearby the stadium and killed 4 ppl..... Including them. I cant imagine how terrible things would have been if those cunts had waited for people to come out after the game.		Anyway. At some point there needs to be a real military intervention against daesh. This situation is not an al quaida situation. We re here dealing with a real physical entity. One that has borders, politics. These people need to be crushed, now. I ll even go further. Great nations need to stop being hypocritical. Since ww2 and the end of colonization, conquest war are considered over. But they re really not. They just happend differently, through huge companies that trust resources and exploit local people. To an end, this is way worse that our good old conquest wars. At least those had the positive impact that by anexing land, there was an actual improvement over time of the local s way of life, infrastructures etc.. Those were actually including conquered people in a new demographic. Instead, we harvest, create poverty and accept that small group of motherfucker terrorize local population.		This, all this. All pas terror events. Is nothing but the repercutions of shy, hypocritical, cold war like, world politics of the western world. Leaders thought that they could keep on claiming the world witjout actually fightin for it. Amazing they didnt see that the fight would end up on their doorstep. This has to change now. Only naive people can believe that war is avoidable at all level. It s time to conquer or be killed. And saudi arabia should be on the top list.		Just to be clear. I feel for all humans. I dont hate anyone but those who hate. I understand peacefull people who thinks that conquest is just as bad and that decolonization was needed despite the fact that i disagree. Thing is, i dont believe wars will ever disappear. So might as well include those who lose their country and embrace them as part of us instead of just eaving them with a broken land. After all, france, usa, germany, etc. Those physical entities are nothing more but the result of wars and conquest. At all point in their history, people were stripped from a part of their culture and identity. But luckily, only to grow bigger more complexed ones. So why would our time be any different.

{"body":"This is probably too late to be seen by many but after reading all of the different Paris threads and reflecting on the situation, I'd like to express my thoughts on the situation.		The goal of terrorism is just as its name implies - to terrorize human beings. Terrorism makes us feel unsafe in our own cities and homes, it makes us fear an "other" and it attempts to marginalize, alienate and destroy the security of a society. It seeks to instill doubt, dread and suspicion in the very familiarity of our everyday lives. Because of this, many average citizens like you and me view terrorism as a greater force not to be reckoned with by the common individual. Many people believe that the only way to eradicate terrorism is through political, militaristic or governmental efforts. People believe that their role is limited to being angry or upset about the situation, and sending grievances and thoughts those deceased and their family members.		This is not true. You can *do* something.Terrorism needs to be combated with unity and empowerment. The innocent do not have to be just victims. True unity is not just creating solidarity with your friends and neighbors. True unity is reaching out to those on the edges of society, those marginalized and isolated. Your small bubble of a community is not the only one who feels the effects of terrorism and it will take the solidarity of the globe to solve the problem. We must stand with France, but not only the European French. We must stand with the Muslim French, African French, the French who might not even feel French because of their place in society.		Below is a list of organizations that work against terrorism and towards peace and understanding. Although terrorism is senseless and I do not support or condone the acts or the groups behind them in any way, there is a deeply rooted social construction, agenda and psychology behind it that is not just a bunch of people who want to kill others because they are bored. As a common citizen, you can lend the time you spent watching the news or posting to Facebook and volunteer to create a new sense of familiarity between peoples or even just read deeper into the vast research and knowledge provided by these organizations. The first step towards understanding and accepting other races, cultures and religions is to become familiar with them. See the humanity behind the ideas, and bring people together under the light. 		**Learn from:** 		* National Consortium on the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (led by the University of Maryland): http://www.start.umd.edu/		* International Institute for Counterterrorism: http://www.ict.org.il/		* The Handa Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence (led by the University of St. Andrews in Scotland): http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~cstpv/		* International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (led by King's College, London): http://icsr.info/		* The Arab-American Institute: http://www.aaiusa.org/		* Salam Institute for Peace and Justice: http://salaminstitute.org/new/		**Volunteer with:**		* Council on American-Islamic Relations (several locations throughout the U.S.): http://www.cair.com/		* Islamic Society of North America: http://www.isna.net/		* Muslim Council of Britain: http://www.mcb.org.uk/		* Counterterrorism Education Learning Lab: http://www.thecell.org/		* National Council on Canada-Arab Relations: http://nccar.ca/		* The Council for Arab-British Understanding: http://www.caabu.org/		(I'm not French nor do I speak French very well so bear with me and add suggestions if you like)		* SOS Racisme: http://sos-racisme.org/		* Un Coeur por la Paix: http://www.uncoeurpourlapaix.org/		* Croix Rouge (French Red Cross): http://www.croix-rouge.fr/		ALSO: Contact your local refugee resettlement office or immigration center.

If this is happening in the middle of France it can happen in California, it can happen in Madrid, it happened in London and New York. 		I live in Israel and it happens here almost every day lately. 		Great countries are falling apart like syria, Egypt and even Lebanon lately. 		All because of one major threat: extreme Islam. 		I must tell you, Islam is a great religion. People say it here all the time - it encourages love, compassion and acceptence but we all live in a world where terror organizations are coming from the Islam and counties are FALLING because of it. 		Writing this is hard for me because we didn't see confirmation that ISIS was behind this and also because it affected me personally... I love EODM and I saw them live in Belgium six months ago... I was completely shocked and I even cried a bit. It's also hard because as soon as people read Israel they will move on. 		But this is not enough. Sending thoughts and prayers is important but something must be done. I don't know if someone reads this far but this is my main point: 		The majority of Islam is sane... Just like every other majority out there I know it. Here in Israel we have extremists as well but most of us want peace, want to live our lives peacefully... But right now extremists are fighting extremists and we need to be the stronger voice. 		Sane people can't be silent... The threat is too real. We need to discourage this thing and do our best to wake up to a world where we can feel safe to walk the streets... To see rock concerts without dying. 		WE NEED TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THEY CANNOT DO THIS TO US AND BE WINNERS. 		I'll finish with a last thought: When an armed shooter or stabber is walking into a place people already know how to handle it... They jump on him and try to eliminate the threat.		This is fucked up. We are so used to it in the past couple of months people 	wait for it.. They look over their shoulders on the train and in restaurants and in malls. Something needs to be done.

{"body":"Forget my username, it was about breakfast food and I hope it doesn't detract from my comment. 	I know this will be buried but I wanted to put my personal perspective on this. 	France has been very forward with its acceptance of refugees, as has much of Europe. I just got back to the states from traveling from eastern to western Europe for the course of a month. Given the state of the European voters and the general move for acceptance for those displaced by war in Syria, it seems these attacks were put in play to undermine the structure that the folks leaving their homes were looking for. 	It is a terror attack, it is meant to be divisive, it is meant to push our xenophobia to its extremes. There is a minority that would love to see the EU tear itself apart trying to find the 'dangerous' refugees, and from the only profile that fits (muslim by way of syria) will make it hard to take in any of these folks. If there is a response to lesser the plight of the refugee than these attacks worked. 	It's a real shame because most of the hassle, heartbreak, molestation, and lack of viable options will fall on those simply trying to emmigrate from a war zone and find a safe haven in a place they dont know and dont quite understand. 	My thoughts go out to those affected tonight and those who will feel the completely intended actions of a few individuals who could not stop to posses a single feeling for the acutual betterment of humanity. 		P.S. seeing the social media outreach of so many trying to help those stranded and locked in the chaos, you are really shining a light on the best parts of humanity, if I ever have the chance to buy you a beer or a bouquet of flowers it would be my goddamn honor.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FranchToasted","name":"t1_cwztw26","parent_id":"t3_3sqxbb","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447525898,"created_utc":1447497098}

{"body":""So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. " - Franklin D. Roosevelt		I would like to remind everyone what probably one of our greatest leaders once said, it might have been aimed at another topic but it is something we should keep in mind in our current struggles and especially in light of diversity and hard ship. While it easy to turn and point fingers and start to hate a group of people because of what bad and corrupt individuals who happen to have something in common with them - heritage, religion, color of their skin, ideals, etc. We must take the higher road and remember that none of that is what made the bad person do that bad thing and that EVERY human is capable of being downright nasty and evil.		In the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt	"I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impel. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days."	http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5057/		We have been held hostage in almost continuous fear since 9/11/2001, We have tried throwing the same stigma and hate at everyone of the area and we only succeeded in making things worse and giving the leaders of these scared and ignorant people fuel for the flames they were fanning to recruit more people to commit more deeds to generate more hate and drive more people into their waiting arms. Do not let fear rule you or us, Let us advance from this letting the innocent people who are plagued by these evil men know that we wont let others color our judgement of them.		‪#‎paris‬","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"silentshadow1991","name":"t1_cwzuxpl","parent_id":"t3_3sqxbb","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447531079,"created_utc":1447502279}
{"body":"How We Should React		For the record I am an american and have not been directly affected by the attacks. 		I would like to start out by offering my condolences to the families of all the people needlessly murdered in Paris. Scrolling through reddit today, I came across the news that Paris had been attacked by gunman and bombs. My initial shock was quickly replaced with admiration for the french people who quickly responded with help for the injured and homes for the displaced. Many on social media were in outcry because of the horrible acts and those who perpetrated them,but I think we should place the emphasis on the heroics of the french people. They are helping each other simply because they are of the same kind, humanity. 		Many will become enraged in the chaos and confusion of these attacks but I hope that we can use them as a reminder of our common humanity. People will lose sight of this out of anger, but I ask that you do not. If we let our anger overcome us, if we lose sight of ourselves as a people, then we have let the terrorists win. The way we truly defeat them is by not acknowledging them at all. While we will forever remember these tragic events we should do our best to forget those who perpetrated it. If we focus too much on the terrorists then we are doing exactly what they want. 		Lastly, we should use this event to take a stand as a people , a world in unity. A stand against the chaos that those 8 gunmen tried to create.

{"body":"Sure dude. Just to preface. I don't have a degree in Islamic studies or any thing like that. I'm just a normal every day practicing Muslim (So I'm not going to have specific proofs and excerpts, but I'd happy to try to provide it), trying to shed some light. Islam makes up nearly 1/4 of the worlds population. If you think Muslims are only interested in killing "infidels" thats a lot of bloodshed.		Infidel in a Islamic context refers to non-Muslims. There are three different interactions you can have with "Infidels", all of these are outlined in the Quran. Since you are probably only interested in the most controversial one, I'll try to address it. Our holy text has many verses on killing infidels. However, regardless of wherever it says "kill the infidels etc...", It will still always have to be within the guidelines of war. It is not allowed for anyone to harm anyone else without reason outside of war (barring self defense etc...) It has never been allowed anywhere in our religion, to fight civilians, regardless of whether they are infidels or not.		If you are not convinced think about it from our shoes, hopefully it will make more sense. One of the biggest goals of Islam is to spread the religion (hence, historically there have been wars and conquest). How can you spread a religion, if you are planning to kill everyone who is not in your religion (aka kill all infidels). A religion CANNOT spread this way. So whats the alternative, Can we force our religion on to someone?		Yes, it is acceptable in my religion to spread your influence by war. Historically, one of the most efficient ways to spread a religion is by conquest. Otherwise it is not possible for a religion spread past a border of a nation. When they used to conquer other countries it was a effort to spread Islam, but here is the catch. When they conquer a country they cannot force Islam on its people, the conquest is an attempt to open the conquered nation to Islam. WHY is this? 		The religion of Islam cannot be spread without individual consent, It is not possible to force someone to become a Muslim (because its an individuals agreement with their Creator). PLUS to add to that, In the Quran it is noted many times that Islamic faith/ Shahada can only come to someone from Allah [God] (As in God's decree). Why is this important? It is pretty much saying no matter how much effort you put into someone, there is no guarantee they will convert to Islam, because part of that decision making comes from upstairs. This means that the only thing we can do is inform someone about our religion, and hope Allah does the rest. Does this mean we tell someone about Islam, if they don't accept it that we can kill them? 		Again we can't do this, because Shahadah comes from upstairs that means it can come at anytime, it is not in our control. If we kill a infidel, what if they turn out to be a Muslim in the future when the Shahadah does come, that is counter productive to the spread of Islam and our belief. So Muslims job in waging war is simply to get the message of Islam across. I will also say that these people during this time of war etc... just to make better incentives would heavily tax non-Muslims, which I don't think was correct. 		Historically Islam has been one of the fastest growing religions (even to this date). Do you think Islam is interested in spreading? (I think it is, from a theological and a historical perspective. It has been very successful in spreading historically. Why is this?). 		What these terrorists are calling Jihad is a different topic. To make it short, it is still illegal to do Jihad against civilians (pretty much illegal period). It is LAWFUL for them to wage war if they feel like their right to religion is infringed, or their land is invaded. Which is what they started with, but when they realized they were losing they decided its okay to cheat a little bit to see if they can win that way. Again philosophically incorrect. In our religion, God does not care whether you succeed in an action or not, he only cares that it is the correct action and you gave it your best shot. It is not do whatever you can to succeed/win, its do what your supposed to, and He will decide if you succeed or not. (again ties to the same concept mentioned earlier in Shahadah, It is He who gives success (like shahadah), we are not in control of it. He can chose to give or not give, just make sure you do your part). That being said it is harder to put this in practice than in theory. You start fighting you realize you are losing, you can either surrender or you keep fighting till your dead. THATS IT. There is no option C, lets plan a terrorist attack on civilians or option D, use illegal battle tactics like suicide bombings. This comes from realizing our God does not need us to win, he never promised us victory, he just needs us to do the right thing. Islam be like here is your test (this world) please answer all questions to the best of your ability, these people realize they have a hard problem and decide to cheat to get the correct answer, the grader (God) never asked us for the right answer or looking for the smartest person, just wants us to answer to the best of our ability based on hints he has given us. Wow this is a horrible example, but yea. oh well. 		Man It is so weird that people have the impression of Islam to be very barbaric, but as a practicing Muslim its actually quite the opposite. There are like rules after rules about anything and everything. Unless I'm mistaken barbarians are not interested in submitting themselves to prayer 5 times a day (one of them super early in the morning, so can't sleep in), can't eat pork/bacon/any animal not cut in the name of God, can't take interest, fasting a whole month from dawn to day break (What for you ask? Just cuz God said so), and commanded to give certain portion of your wealth to charity every year. (Barbaric sounds like you would be violent and have a lot of freedoms/no rules). Islam is mostly distancing your self from wealth and pleasures of this world, and instead trying to gain favors with God (aka. Allah), because this world is one big test to see if you do the right thing. These terrorist dudes got a hard question and are piss failing, and along the way making it harder for everyone else taking the test as well. SIGH. 		Sorry this is so long. I just needed to unload somewhere about this for a long time. Hope you found it useful, All Muslims are not terrible people, most of them are God fearing, humble, and friendly people (all those characteristics are more like requirements) it is also helpful to understand there is a reason that all these terrorist come from the same region (Hint: Oil, political power struggles[believe it or not Western powers were a key catalyst in what used to be relatively a very peaceful region] ), while some of the most populous Muslim countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Turkey have all been pretty much under the radar for a long time.

Are you of the belief that that Redditors from Beirut are not present on this website? That ISIS attacks against Lebanese people are less newsworthy? 		What exactly is going on here? I use Reddit primarily for news aggregation. It is one thing if the userbase just feels that terrorist attacks in France or Israel or America are more relevant. But I expect better from the management. The front page has something like 7 Paris-related topics on it, from cancellations by the Foo Fighters to TIL's about Hitler's invasion of Paris, to pretty pictures of flags. As a result, I was not aware of the attack in Beirut until 48 hours after it had taken place; there isn't a single word about the ISIS terrorist attack in Beirut that took at least 43 lives. 		True, maybe it's my fault; if I had dug through r/worldnews, I would have found a topic hidden in there. It might have also been mentioned in in r/lebanon. But what's YOUR excuse? Where is your sympathy for other terror victims? 		If you can't tell I'm partially speaking about this because I've had a rough day reading through the news -- everywhere, in Paris, Beirut, Baghdad, and so on. But I'd like an answer, even if it's a "We don't know". 		**EDIT: Partial retraction. The top story right now is about a hero in Beirut who tackled one of the IS bombers.

{"body":"I'll admit it's been quite awhile since I’ve stumbled upon a large post just filled with logical fallacies and even outright disinformation like this.		>You really need to stop living in your protective little bubble.		You really don't have to project like that. There's a difference between a valid critique and cherry picking the worst from a religion and using it as a representative for it in it's entirety. It's no different than characterizing Christians because of the positions advocated by evangelical U.S. Republicans and a few very vocal pastors.		A valid critique of Islam for example, would be how fundamentally following Islam would result in an outcome that isn't exactly favorable to homosexuals. Which is a trait that's fairly common in religions unfortunately.		>That was a talk, by a group of 9 prominent figured in Islam held in Norway in 2013, to prove that Islam was not an extreme religion. There are 4,000 in that audience, in which all but a very small number agreed that people should be stoned to death, beheaded and slaughtered by the commands on the Qur'an.		I'm still pretty appalled someone who claims that I'm living a bubble apparently drew their conclusions about an entire religion from the most meager of sources. You've seriously allowed a 6:30 Youtube clip convince you that moderate Muslims all secretly want their worst views enforced on non-practitioners? Or is it that you're so overly eager to have your worldview confirmed that all critical faculties go flying out the window when anything shows up to do exactly that?		Your description of the video was really just a copy and paste of the description given in the YouTube link which in itself depicts the speech as more important than it really is. You claim it's a talk by 9 "prominent figures" who are all very conveniently all unnamed when it's reality only a single guy who is arguing that normal Muslims agree that stoning is an appropriate punishment that should be enforced for homosexuality. Obviously, an extremist isn't going to identify himself as an extremist and the stances of the other visible figures are never given.		And second, the quote that the audience agreed with was, "How many of you agree that the punishments described in the Koran and the Sunna – whether it is death, whether it is stoning for adultery, whatever it is... If it is from Allah and His Messenger, that is the best punishment ever possible for humankind, and that is what we should apply in the world. Who agrees with that?" Yes, as the greatest form of punishment. That in itself, isn't THAT awful.		>These were people from a large group of different mosques, all conglomerating in one area, in argument against the media, against papers such as Charlie Hebdo (need I remind you?)		So you're projecting the views of the speaker onto his audience?		>You are blinded and ignorant, because you're being suckered in by all this political correctness that everybody is throwing about. 		Actually, it's just me not selective with my criticisms and not actively go out of my way to characterize entire religions because of the actions from terrorist organizations or figureheads. Because I realize that's nothing more than a dishonest generalization. If anyone is blind here, then you it's being blinded by hatred that prevents you from being objective on religions.		>So much, in fact, I assure you right now you believe me to be a racist islamophobe.		I believe part of the definition of racism is to take the actions or statements of a few and force them over an entire ethnic group. You fit that part splendidly.		>Despite all the charity events I attend for human rights, and the amount of effort I put in to provide aid to those who need it. Even offering to house Syrians should it be necessary. 		Your point is? This has literally nothing to do with your warped statements. Ironic how you belittle moderates for not taking serious substantial action against fundamentals but you attending charitable events and donating to those in need apparently, which is in part with Islamic tradition funnily enough, makes you completely immune to criticism of being a bigot.		>Even offering to house Syrians should it be necessary. 		I'd be interested in your conditions for "necessary". Might be even be necessary soon given how refugee camps are being burned down in response to the Paris attacks. Am I going to see a defiant condemnation from you on the refugee attacks and demand the same condemnation from Christians as well? I'm doubtful, but you would if you weren't operating on cheap double standards.		>Islam is a cancer. You speak of insane statements made by Hindi, Jewish and Christian men and women. You are correct, but they are not the target here. 		The issue is that you’re essentially giving other fundamental religious figures a free pass while depicting fringe fundamental Islamic figures as a complete representatives of the religion.		>Religion is a cancer, and I believe they are all disgusting tools to manipulate men to do sick shit, the difference is, when is the last time you saw a major attack on a western city by a Hindi, a Jew? Christians it's a given, but the last major attack was either Timothy McVeigh, or Anders Behring Breivik. Yet those are the only two notable events I can think of off the top of my head in the span of 20+ years.		The only thing that isn't misleading here is that religion is frequently used to manipulate and mislead others. 	As for attacks on western cities by other groups, I can't think of any in recent history because a Hindu or Jewish extremist has should have little to no motivation to drawing negative attention towards their cause by attacking a western city. It's not because their faith is intrinsically more friendly, but rather because it wouldn't be politically beneficial to orchestrate attacks on the west. It's why Jewish terrorism is usually in the form of violence from settlers against Palestinians and Hindu terrorism is against fellow Hindus. It's more directly relevant to their cause to go after those respective groups.		>Daily... Literally fucking daily, there are "radical" muslims in the middle east, hunting down and slaughtering each other, drowning each other and filming it, beheading others and filming it, all in the name of their religion. 		So now we're conflating militant groups operating in regions of political turmoil with typical followers of Islam, the typical followers that are currently fleeing because of said atrocities? That's just terrific. If it's just their faith, and their faith alone that compels them to commit these acts, then why is it that everyday Muslims in westernized countries are generally no different than their neighbors? If it's only their faith as you so adequately put it, then there's shouldn't be any difference in their behavior.		>You then have once every couple of years now, them spill over to commit acts of mass murder on western nations... and you are here to tell me that Islam is not an issue? 	It's more like political factions that are hostile to the West are using religion to manipulate their followers into infiltrating and attacking the West rather than Islam itself being an enemy to the West.		>It is, and the biggest issue here, is the inaction by the "moderate" muslims who just sit down and watch it happen without a word of opposition.

{"body":"Air campaigns alone won't protect women and children and honorable men from the evil of Isis, nor will anything but persistence and courage. I think we learned this specifically several days ago when innocent lives of sisters, brothers, wives, and fathers were taken in the violent shootings in the heart of the beautiful city of Paris. Now grief stricken and mourning over the deaths of over 123 citizens, the President of France has declared their act an act of war. I know this and my husband knows this, I refuse to have my children grow up in a world where men cower behind bombs and kill innocent people for a false god. This is why a little over a year ago my husband and several of his life long friends put their lives and families on hold to leave to Syria/Iraq, to put pressure on Isis and protect their country. Through using similar guerilla tactics as Isis fighters themselves, my husband and his friends have been weakening Isis by bombing weapon caches, attacking oil pipelines, water and food supplies, rescuing hostages and assassinating high-valued, dangerous Isil leaders. Our crusades however are not cheap and neither is the equipment used to support my friends and family overseas. Me and my husband's gross income is probably only about 35,000 a year, and the price and amount of equipment used to barely meet the basic requirements costs over 50,000 per person. It took some cutting corners and scrounging but eventually we were able to put away enough money to support the project. The problem is the price of upkeep is more than what my	husband and his men receive, roughly 75,000 every 6 months to provide ammunition, replacement parts to broken equipment, food, body armor and the multitude of humanitarian aid projects. Normally the funds are procured by hijacking oil tankers, and intercepting funds intended for Isis. However increased amounts of security and decreased amounts of overall traffic ( thanks to us, people don't want to buy oil from Isis anymore because they know we're just gonna show up and take the money and oil) procuring the necessary funds to support our team had become somewhat of a challenge. Normally ( or planned protocol ) in the event of a lack of funds standard protocol is to use our “home” fund which was about 60,000 dollars that would be used for nothing but last minute equipment expenses and the long transit home. My stubborn husband however chose to liquidate the fund to further support their combat. Please don't be confused. Your donations will not be used to help bring them home but only to further their attacks on Isis, please support by donating, or at the very least share","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Endradicalislam","name":"t1_cx1sj4s","parent_id":"t3_3sqxbb","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447680206,"created_utc":1447651406}

The one thing I have never understood is that most evil dictatorships and regimes over the millenia have had a clear end game and motive to their despicable acts, but what do the extremists actually want?		Do they want the whole world to think and act as they do?		Do they want to rid the world of everyone and anyone who doesn't feel the same as they do?		Do they want the western world to have no involvement at all in the middle east even down to tourism while at the same time allow middle eastern people to travel and live freely across the world? (please understand I'm not saying middle eastern people should not be allowed to live freely wherever they please because of course they can, I'm just highlighting the hypocrisy in that hypothetical situation, I felt the need to explain it because it's easy to misread things on the internet)		Do they want a full scale atomic war? seems the most logical but really? I don't see what they would gain from that other than the desire to literally wipe humanity of the earth while making everyone of them a *martyr*			Because they seem like the only things I could think they possibly want but all scenarios are absolutely illogical and have no chance in happening (apart from the scary last one)			I just can't begin to understand how they actually think and feel, I mean the nazi's had some of the most deluded evil ideas for their end game but they had the means to do it, as I see it the extremists could never recruit enough people and perform enough cowardly atrocities to take over the world, it's just a pointless war of attrition that will only hurt and destroy the lives and freedoms of all humanity.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jah_92_rastafari","name":"t1_cwzqmi4","parent_id":"t3_3sqxbb","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447512359,"created_utc":1447483559}

Look at palestine, they are going through x10 the shit France is "going through". Look at Lebanon, just 2 days ago, 43 INNOCENT people were killed and another 200 wounded. Why isn't that on the news??? I'll tell u why, because Western "news" is bullshit. They rather report on Caitlin Jenner being "brave" then fucking children washing up on the shore, or the Kardashians then children starving to death in Palestine. And hey I don't blame them, because that doesn't sell, people want to have "happy stories".		Every year we " mourn" and "remember" those who died on 9/11 beacaue they died innocently, but at the same time within the time period between 9/11 and 2011, 500,000+ INNOCENT iraqi's were killed.

{"body":"Hollande knew it was coming. When for example Germany attacked Belgia in WW1 they made defensive precautions because they knew they were going to be attacked back. EVERYONE knew Isis would do this, nobody is surprised. What IS surprising is that France did not make any preventive measures when they KNEW isis said they would attack back if anyone attacked them. Isis said that LONG before France started bombing them, he KNEW what would happen. Just like how the police have certain rules on how they should react if for example someone kills a policeman, manybe someone disagrees with what the police stands for and kill one, should they be surprised when the police try to arrest him? No, he should expect that. And if he wants to avoid it he needs to make preventive measures. 		You don't seem to know how the world works. If you start bombing people everywhere and not expecting retaliation then you are stupid. At least when isis SAY they are going to do it. I guess maybe most groups won't react if you start murdering them (at least that is what you seem to think), but Isis explicitly said they would and they have always kept their promises of revenge previously. Why on earth did Hollande behave like they did not mean it this time? He could have prevented it by either letting someone else bomb isis and expose themselves to terror or shut down the country, make total surveilance of the people and random searches while they bomb isis.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kaizervonmaanen","name":"t1_cwzwetc","parent_id":"t1_cwzueo1","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447536987,"created_utc":1447508187}

{"body":"> Why would France like any other country not help bombing ISIS.		Someone else will do it. So it is much cheaper to stay away and no risk for revenge attacks by Isis. Let Russians and Americans be blown to bits for this, they always love a excuse for war. And terror attacks is better controlled in America due to the massive state surveillance apparatus, France also have that but not so extensive. America also have a "kill list" where they can assasinate anyone they want even if they never broke a law if they are considered a "danger to national security" which can be anything at all. America can just set up camps and execute everyone they think looks scary. It is perfectly legal. France can not do that under current laws.		> Do you know what they do.

They are not. They can mouth the words if it gets them more gibs, or gets them lenience with a judge, or allows them to invade and despoil a white country (after they have already destroyed their own, of course). But they are not like us. They are simply animals in human form, and no amount of gibs or tolerance will ever change them.		Europe and America are literally tolerating themselves to death.		This message will probably be taken down and this account banned. I expect no less from the cowards, pathological tolerators, and nigger-lovers of Reddit. But it will be seen by a few people, and they can spread the word.		The time is coming. There will be no vote, no semblance of "fairness" or "inclusion in the decision-making process", and very little in the way of warning. The politicians who have already betrayed us and the special interest groups who are egging the invaders on will not be consulted.

{"body":"This is something I wrote about the events.		On Friday the 13th of November 2015 several locations in Paris were attacked and over 100 people were killed. This caused devastation amongst many. Family’s broken, loved ones lost. Far too many people had lost their lives. 	Many people are calling this a terrorist attack. I refuse to label it that way. In my opinion on that day, one human killed another. One, HUMAN, killed another. And I know that is wasn’t just one human and it wasn’t just one death. But still one human, killed another. The same species went out of its way to end the life of its own kin. It doesn’t end there. Now people are thinking, well how do we counter act that? I’ll tell you what most suggest we do. Let’s kill more humans. Let’s divide even more. Let’s cause more suffering, more devastation. Why don’t we just end all off humanity on this planet…? But aren’t we better than that? 	A group of humans pick on kid. Another human their age. Taunting them, hurting them, stealing possessions, embarrassing them, isolating them. This kid then decides to threat back. Stating that they won’t stand for this. The bullies laugh and hurt them once more. The kid pulls out a knife. The bullies laugh and hurt the kid more. The kid loses all hope, and ends their own life. Now the bullies are affected, hurt damaged, mentally, emotionally, however you feel they would be. They then start getting bullied by everyone else, the cycle doesn’t stop…	We hurt these people, we steal their land, attack their individuality and isolate them. THIS IS THE ENEMY. Are they really, what nice thing have you done. You abuse someone because they aren’t different when really you’re hurting someone who is exactly the same. We are all part of this same planet. The same core. We are society and we are humanity. Yet you care if your eyeliner is on fleek. We need to figure out where our priorities lay. 	Hug someone, buy someone a gift, ask how their day was. At least smile at them. You never know how much that can help someone. You underestimate how much one human can do for another. So let’s stop killing, stop fighting, stop hurting, stop blaming others, stop dividing and unite. Spread love, positivity and be happy that you all exist. Respect what others believe, respect what others think. Respect yourself. You can do so much more than you think. 	I beg you. For the love of all humanity. Stop dividing. We are all the same yet we are all so different. Look inwards and ask yourself who you are. Once you can answer that ask someone else who they are. Once they can answer that they will ask someone else. Sit down and think what are you doing and what can you do? We are all human. Now start acting that way. I love you all and wish you the best in life.
