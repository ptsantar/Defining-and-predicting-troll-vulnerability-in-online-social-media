{"body":"This is the problem with the numbers-based thinking of old school marketers. A 17 year old black kid and a 40 year old white woman can both hold the same purchasing potential for whatever your product is. Demographics-based marketing is based on vague generalizations. Why do that when you can hit your target market with  much more accuracy by looking at their interests and behaviors?		Reddit has the potential to offer this goldmine of information based on what users post, comment, and upvote/downvote. I don't know if the Reddit staff actually has the models to do this, but they are missing out if they don't.		Take for example an outdoor company like REI. They can try to target 18-30 males making $40k+ a year, but they are likely going to be serving ads to a large proportion of people who have no interest. Wasted money. Now take the same company, and have them target users who frequently upvote/comment on stories regarding outdoor activities and display other behaviors that are highly correlated with the outdoors type of person (which can found through some research). Tapping into that community and speaking to them directly (make them feel as if REI is really participating with Reddit) would offer a much higher return on investment.		Smart models are still being developed (you see them with Amazon and Netflix recommendation engine or Pandora's music genome project), but I think there is huge potential in the future and Reddit could be the testing grounds of a model that can be implemented across all community-based sites.","depth":2,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hivoltage815","name":"t1_c0y790v","parent_id":"t1_c0y76n8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1283315178,"created_utc":1283286378}

{"body":"> For example, trying to figure out the wants of the subscribers to r/technology is a tough one.		Good point, but that's tackling the issue upside-down. Figuring out the wants of your target market is the job of product managers.		For example, the PMs may come to a conclusion that a large segment of gadget enthusiasts have an unfulfilled desire for USB coffee warmers. The product is defined, and the target market is established. What the advertiser does then is figure out if gadget enthusiasts tend to visit /r/technology or if they all huddle in /r/gadgets. This can be done by a cursory review of topics in both subreddits.		The advertiser adds the weights of subscribers to the subreddits and the contents. To illustrate in arbitrary numbers, /r/gadgets may have a 90% targetting relevance but 2.000 subscribers. /r/technology may have an estimated 20% relevance, but 15.000 subscribers.		That means that posting an ad in the technology subreddit gets you slightly higher exposure of the people who may be interested in your product, and it offers a secondary exposure of the 80% population who's vaguely interested.		TLDR; figuring out the wants of the /r/technology subscribers is a very difficult process which may yield no valuable information.
