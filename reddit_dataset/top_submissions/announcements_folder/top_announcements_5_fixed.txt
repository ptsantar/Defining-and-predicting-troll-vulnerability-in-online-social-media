(Both comments bolded for emphasis, I'll come back to that in a couple of paragraphs...)		As if it refuted his point about complete wipage of a comment from servers by bringing terminology into it when the terminology is actually near irrelevant to the actual point.

{"body":"IP addresses are just that: addresses.		Think about how mail (regular physical mail) gets routed - you need a destination address, and the postal system needs to know how to route from your address to that address.		It's the same with computers. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is just a destination on a network, and just like the postal system you need one on both ends.		Now, in the real world, addresses follow a pretty loose format and almost never change because they represent a physical location entity.		With the internet though, that's not the case. Each device needs an IP to communicate, and devices don't necessarily stay in one place. Plus there's the problem of there only being 4-billion possible IP values under IPv4, of which we've already run out. And of course your ISP can only assign you an IP they control - much like how you can't give your house an address belonging to a completely different state and city.		All that really matters is that the IP doesn't change out from under active connections (or at least, doesn't change from the point of view of the two machines talking to each other).		So if you A) know the IP of the system and B) also know what *time* that IP was used, it could be enough to identify a specific machine, even if something else ends up with that IP later. It's more complicated than that of course, especially with NAT becoming more and more common to conserve IPv4 addresses, but that's the simple version.

One weakness of hashes is that, if there's only a few values anyone would try to hash, you can just try all of them until something works.  To help with this, there are special hashing functions (cryptographic hashes) designed to take a lot of computing work, so brute forcing like that is harder.

It sounds like they are mainly storing IPs to fight spam. 		If that's the case and if they can manage it, they could structure it so that IP checks are near last in line. They can check a ton of other stuff first, and if enough of them flag that it *might* be a spammer, then they check against the IP hashes. (after all, if it's *probably* a spammer an extra few ms or even tens of ms of time on the request isn't going to hurt all that much for such a small and somewhat shady subset of users)		And by using an scrypt style hash and targeting 5ms (which is doable if they weed out the vast majority of requests that they are pretty damn sure aren't spam) they could then verify if a user's IP is on the spam list as a last resort.		At that point it would take commodity hardware about 250 days to generate a full rainbow table (assuming your earlier calc of 50 days / ms is correct). They can then rotate the salts every 100 days and get the same level of spam-fighting they do now but with the added benefit of not storing any IP addresses (and the added downside of more CPU usage).		And if they have a few **really** bad spammers (say like 1% of IPs cause like 80% of the spam), then they could do something cute like store a blacklist of un-hashed IP addresses and add IP addresses to it only when they hit a trigger of something like x thousand spam requests per the last 100 days.

{"body":"The answer is effectively 1000, but it's not really quite that simple.

The older items still *exist*, but they're basically inaccessible since the listing will never get there.		You can see this lots of other places. For example if you go to a user's profile page that has thousands of comments, you'll only be able to see the newest 1000 by going back through the pages. Similarly, if you went back through the /new page of any subreddit, you'll run out of posts after seeing 1000, and so on.		That's kind of why gold users can effectively save more than 1000 items - they have options that let them filter the saved items by subreddit or category, and *each* of those individual filtered listings can go up to 1000.

{"body":"The internet would die and those corporations would implode. They couldn't hope to force that. Instead, they'll just have to be content with what we give them. Have you noticed that only a few cities, and only for a few blocks in those cities, is there an anything goes policy with ads? Sure, Times Square is a quilt of billboards but generally, in most home towns, you get space set aside for your ads and that's that. Rent those billboards, but you won't be erecting 20 in front of your competitor's stores. Sure, they'd make WAY more money if we let them do whatever the fuck they want but then, you and I never get to do just whatever we want, eh? They're not, you know the word, *entitled* to it all...		I know it makes money to track our every click but it also makes money to sell cars -I don't expect you'd let me take yours even though it'd make me a wad of cash! Companies made plenty of money before the internet with advertising. I'd be willing to go out on a limb and say the majority of people ignore asnd abhor targeted ads anyway. I won't click on any. And anytime Amazon tells me on a website ad what's left in my shopping cart I feel invaded and remove the item, never buying it. That's my business, not yours. What if it was a gift for my wife and she saw it on a news site in an ad? What if it was a sex toy and her mother saw it on a recipe site. Get out of my computer, get out of my browsing history, get out of my head. If a guy in a suit walked into your house, would you just invite him to search your browser history? It's actually no different at all except this time you don't even get to see his face. 		They can put up ads and we can go browse what we want. Internet shopping is booming and we go seek out what we want plenty enough already. I know a fuckton of money is never good enough for the constantly-starving corporate world but then we don't pander to anyone else's desperate desires. They can make the already crazy money they have been making since long before the net and it's just too bad if they need to do some actual work if they want to make more, instead of stealing all my private info and becoming fucking *billionaires* overnight while we get shit all of that back. I get to use a site for free. Cool. It as free before they stuck their fingers into your computer, they just sold ad space. And if that's not good enough, too bad. I'm not apologetic, some of us just do not think it's ok and will never think it's ok.

{"body":"This is more an architectural decision than a limitation. Yes, they could have the same button do two things. Delete within a few minutes deletes it immediately. Delete after a few minutes marks it as an empty string or null. 		However, this has several things going on behind the scenes for something the scale of reddit. First, sharing the logic for when something is hard delete vs soft delete means your system has to record when the user clicked the button. The delete command may not be immediate. What if your servers are lagging and one recieved a hard delete and the other, by the time it is ready, recieved it as a soft delete? Timing issues happen when you have time based events and these are the bugs that give most programmers nightmares. 		Second, indexing and materialized views are constructed on the fly for optimization. Think of this like a cache or the impulse buy section of a store - everything is there nice and easy for you to see and access. Updating this isn't a good idea. Instead, you update the source and rebuild these indexes and views on a timer, or after a certain number of events. This means our edit function is already good enough to do what we want it to. 		Lastly, what are you trying to accomplish by deleting your comment? I would assume you don't want anyone to read it any more. Well, the absolute fastest way for this to happen in this system is to delete the text and not the comment. Once this has occurred you can then ask for a deletion which will queue up a soft delete once everything in the back end is ready to do so. Deletions are expensive (performance wise) to indexes and you should really only do them all at once at reddit scale right before you rebuild indexes.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"casualblair","name":"t1_cx7rus3","parent_id":"t1_cx7mmb1","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1448116953,"created_utc":1448088153}

But it does aggregate that data and feed that back to its networks, via cookies/localstorage and tracking using anonymized IDs. For example - I can't say "I'd like to target people who have visited Best Buy's site in the last 30 days" but I can say "I'd like to target people who have demonstrated an interest in purchasing electronics in the last 30 days," which will then use metrics data (and search, and ad views) from whomever else uses GA and sells electronics.

{"body":"The other data that your browser sends could be linked with an individual for sure, but it's not very likely or very easy at all (without an IP, the only way to associate a person with browser information is a timing analysis based off of your OTHER history, which if the person spying already has that, you're basically screwed anyway). It's especially difficult if you type in "reddit.com" manually or disable sending HTTP referrers. With how huge reddit is, you're certainly among thousands or tens of thousands of users with the exact same browser info at any given moment.		This information is used for analytics and error reporting. Reddit, among every other website on the planet, likes to see page views, device statistics, user interactions, etc, to aggregate into reports over time. For example, how much time and resources reddit spends building their mobile site is almost certainly directly correlated to device statistics that show the trend (over time) of people using reddit on mobile devices more. Operating systems, browsers (useragents), screen size, etc, are also used for improving the site. As far as tracking user interactions, perhaps they also have a report that can show how likely or often people using specific devices interact with the site vs just lurking. Perhaps they also like to see the time of day and rough geographical location in which reddit is used more in order to optimize certain localization aspects. This is all common practice in the industry.		It's also vital for error reporting. Seeing what kind of device or configuration a user has when an error gets logged is very important for tracking down the cause. Without this information, they're lost as they can't do a proper reproduction.		tldr; browser information is not personal information, is useful, and directly impacts the quality of the website. Any site that uses Google Analyitcs or any other analyitcs package already collects this information (however, GA does NOT show IP addresses).

{"body":"Yes and no.		First, for the no: here's some of the JavaScript related to tracking (I'm sure there's more, but for interactions, not page views) that is included on every page of reddit (it spans three <script> tags at the top of the site): https://gist.github.com/nelsonlaquet/ef960d838a9dd11759e8 (gotta love that beautifully awkward type coercion on line 3) 		The relevant bit is here:	>      _gaq.push(	>       ['_require', 'inpage_linkid', '//www.google-analytics.com/plugins/ga/inpage_linkid.js'], 	>       ['_setAccount', 'UA-12131688-1'], 	>       ['_setDomainName', 'reddit.com'], 	>       ['_setCustomVar', 1, 'site', 'announcements', 3], 	>       ['_setCustomVar', 2, 'srpath', 'announcements-GET_comments', 3],	>       ['_setCustomVar', 3, 'usertype', user_type, 2], 	>       ['_setCustomVar', 4, 'uitype', 'web', 3], 	>       ['_setCustomVar', 5, 'style_override', '', 2],	>       ['_setSampleRate', '50'], 	>       ['_trackPageview']);		Basically, for every page-view that Google Analytics tracks, it'll track the subreddit, the path, if you're logged in or not (user_type), what interface you're using, and if you're using custom styles. This *should* be the only place where custom variables are set, so your username is never sent to analytics.		Now, for the yes: of course your username is tracked *on reddit's servers themselves* for every interaction. How would it know if you've already voted on something, or who made what comment? Your username leaves a trail of interaction all across their database for everything you do; even viewing pages (how else would the "X new comments" feature work?).		Though the question I'm assuming you're asking is if your browser info is tied to your user account on reddit's servers. I have no clue. Reddit may or may not track browser data beyond google analyitcs. It's harmless either way, however. If they don't, then the answer to your question is no. If they do, then refer to my comment above.		For IPs, it's common practice to track what IP a user registered with, or last visited with. That kind of data is outside the access logs themselves. So you may want to ask the reddit admins if they do track that info, and if they do, do they purge it in addition to the access logs themselves. Because that is a way in which a reddit account can be tied to an IP.		At the end of the day though: what is it exactly that you're concerned about? I don't mean staying anonymous, I mean what specifically do you see this information being used for that could compromise your security?		EDIT: they do at the very least track registration IP addresses. I'm not sure if they're ever purged, but they are there. People often forget that reddit is open source and anyone can look to see what they do and don't track.

A woman arranges a playdate for her kids while Hubby's at work, she plugs in a Black and Decker back massager and winks at the camera. Couple is touching each other all seductively while browsing for S&M retreats and talking about a luxury vacation - commercial ends with the husband getting spanked for booking luxury travel at affordable prices on travelocity.com.  		Just spit balling here. These all would need workshopped, but how fun would that be?  		You know what, I'm starting 8 Accounts Studio. We're specialists in non-standard advertising. I've been sitting on a concept for a few months now for the billboard's more sophisticated alter-ego, the Williamboard.   		We've got this.

I'm a cord-cutter, and I am quite wary of excessive and obsessive advertisement through any form of media. It would be great to have some semblance of control over what I see and how often I see it, without needing to be cautious about the context of my comments. It's a big part of what drives me away from websites, or tv stations, or radio; not having some degree of control and being force-fed information that I really do not care to experience.		Additionally, how will this play out for mobile users, or any user who has an Internet Service Provider that imposes a data cap? Will the ads be primarily text based, image links, videos, some combination of all? If ads are to be served up, is there some consideration for the data usage, perhaps a maximum allowable file size based on what medium the advertisement is being served through?

No, it's not. 		There are probably many thousands of private messages sent via Reddit every day. The admins would not read *all* of them! In fact, they probably wouldn't read *any* of them in the normal course of events. Why would they? That's a lot of reading time, and they've got better things to do than read your messages.		But, if you clicked on a "send to admins" button, that would inform the admins that you *want* them to read a particular message - because, otherwise, they would ignore it just like the thousands and thousands of other messages they ignore all the time.

{"body":"If you want a like button go use facebook. I don't know if you used Digg but removing the bury button was what triggered the mass exodus of that site, and most of them came here. People felt like they didn't have a voice and in a monochromatic world of only good, things lose meaning. Good will forever be tied to the duality of good and bad, you literally can't have one without the other. You want to remove the downvote button? Well we might as well remove the upvote button while we're at it and replace it with a fucking hit counter because that is basically what you are suggesting.		Upvotes and downvotes are like a thermometer for the community, and there will always be meaning in that. Reddit removed the ability to see votes (+/-) on comments in the name of not appearing overly negative. The day they removed that ability was truly sad because it destroyed an entire spectrum of opinion. Before you could have a comment that was close to 1 upvote but had hundreds of upvotes and downvotes because it was highly controversial, or in other words interesting. Now that is dead and all the conversations that could have been sparked by such controversy is gone and furthermore the most controversial comments are swept under the rug despite being highly polarized. It's a damn shame because that's where people really define their opinions.		The lifeblood of this site is its community and the crucible of argument is where we define who we are and what we believe. People being able to say they disagree is equally important to being able to say they agree. They are both equally capable of being abused. Removing the ability to use one only clouds the perception of the other. Saying that you don't like the downvote button is akin to saying you don't like voting. If you are only interested in a person's opinion when it is conditioned then you aren't really interested in their opinion. If your only goal here is to get people to stop expressing dissenting opinions, then you must be new to the internet. 		Any way you want to slice it, an aggregator type site like Reddit stands on the ability of it's users to say that *this* is good and *that* is crap. Removing the ability to say that something is crap leaves us with a frontpage full of potential bullshit and no community recourse to deter the presence of substandard material. In other words, the community wont be able to remove some click bait nonsense that got upvoted by bots straight to the front page. The only way to fix such a problem would be to have admins remove it. At that point we no longer have an aggregator guided by the community, we have the admins deciding what we should and shouldn't see, why bother being here.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Senious","name":"t1_cxbsbq6","parent_id":"t1_cxbchui","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1448425804,"created_utc":1448397004}

I was suggesting a binary choice. Approve the post or don't. Don't silence it.		The front page will continue to rotate and people will get their say without being down voted into oblivion for a "fascist", "that's just wrong" or "eww! gross!" opinion or expression. Getting rid of the DV button will strip brigaders of a weapon they have had for far too long. I would go the extra mile and say peoples comment history shouldn't be accessed by anyone but the user themselves. The DV button swamps the bad as well as the good and if you do care for opinion (as you say you do) and expression you wouldn't want it to be swamped by easily nerve stricken people where their emotion comes before any reasonable discussion. Comment history also gives brigaders ammo to pointlessly attack without engaging in proper debate or without being part of a healthy community of their own. Instead we have syndicates of political nerve bags destroying other communities and individuals because feelings. What kind of philosophy is that?		People should have a right to be offended, be an arsehole or anything else while also being able to express themselves. Any mechanism that enables the swamping of anyone, without a mode of control, is akin to a bunch of protesters screaming a person down for his political belief. The most extreme of people can look like wankers to most, though they have a right to be a wanker as much as the offended have a right to be offended.		I'm pointing out mechanisms that are flawed to the point of being, not just pointless, but also damaging. These mechanisms don't uphold debate or expression, but stamp it out. These are mechanisms that come with loose rules that can't even be enforced (aka "Reddiquette" - Don't write rules that can't be enforced, Enforce the rules that are written).

User based moderation has its problems but I trust the committee more than I trust the activist, you know? No amount of positive votes is going to make an unpopular comment popular. People who think that way can't be reached with any form of persuasion so the monkey may as well get his banana. Life's too short to fight all battles and I'm not fond of swimming upstream. 		I mean I think we have to acknowledge from the ground level that we invited EVERYONE to the conversation. You can't do that if you want to maintain a standard. The Bay Area of San Fransisco found that out in 69. The punk music scene found that out in the 90s. StumbleUpon! found that out the moment it opened its doors to IE users. Karma is an opinion poll, despite its original intentions and operating under any other assumption is to turn a blind eye to stark reality. 		But I do agree management of this site has empowered poor behavior at the expense of valuable dissenting view points. And I also agree that it's particularly unforgivable in the default subreddits where the need for open discourse is at its most essential. It is the elephant in the room that increasingly is being ignored only by management. Moderators should not be deputized lone wolf authorities on a web site that prides itself over its own discourse. 		I would also add that I don't think your echo chamber problem is going to be addressed. I'm in advertising, and I can tell you the single most effective tool to sell a product is to congratulate the customer. Reddit is taking the facebook approach: Isolate the user from dissenting view points to better identify markets for targeted advertising, and to keep their egos ramped up with self-congratulatory horse excrement so they're in a purchasing mood.

But I don't shit where I sleep. I behave myself like a human being on the subreddits I wish to remain on. And THOSE are the ones I've been banned for "shitposting" in. It's nuts. If you run afoul of a moderator's opinion on this site you're just plain done. I fully agree; this variety of ambiguity is unacceptable. Allowing mods the privilege to act however they wish on some half baked legalist interpretation of internal rules is dishonest at its absolute best.		My experiences with these activist mods parallels yours directly. No matter how civil or calm you are with them, their universal response to any appeal for the allowance of a dissenting view point is to ban and then silence. They kick you until you bite, and then put the dog down for biting. It's a trap set for the purposes of profit and reddit's users need to get VERY vocal about it. 		Today it's controversial view points that get you blacklisted. Tomorrow it's common place ideas that don't gel with the corporate ethos. I may not be a particularly sympathetic voice, that's my fault and I rightly deserve the hardship that causes. But this isn't about me. It's about reddit as a whole.

This strikes me as a move to a FB-like feed inventory model that can dramatically increase the number of potential impressions.  The removal of comments from the AlienBlue ads seems like a direct attempt at stifling the inevitable negative comments, and the fact that vote counts are hidden solidifies that.		I realize this comes across as somewhat of an attack, but we've discussed various ad-tech-related matters before and I know you know your shit.  Would really like a straight business answer on these decisions as they are pretty blatant to anyone who pays attention.

{"body":"Sure. 		Commenting: We have always had the ability for advertisers to turn off comments  on ads. Previously on reddit.com and now in the apps. This is nothing new. The comments on mobile do tend to trend more negatively and less about the content of the ad and a general distaste for mobile ads. So advertisers tend to turn comments off on mobile ads because of this.		Feed vs fixed to the top: On reddit.com there is potential for 3 ads on any given page load (the Sponsored Headline, 300x250, and the 300x100). So the total number of ads per session can be quite high. But, on mobile there's not really a concept of "pages", it's more of a never ending stream of content. If we just had one ad at the top of our mobile feed, it would be extremely hard to make enough revenue to justify the cost of running Alien Blue. We need to be able to put more than one ad, especially since mobile users scroll _a lot_ more than desktop users. One ad at the top would never be seen. Even with 3 ads per stream load, we still won't be getting the same number of ad impressions that we would get from the same user on desktop. Mobile monetization is hard. With more and more internet traffic going towards mobile, it's important that we figure out a business strategy that respects user experience & privacy, but also makes enough revenue to keep Reddit healthy and thriving.		Hope this helps shine light into our decision.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ryanmerket","name":"t1_cx7rnoe","parent_id":"t1_cx7ofaj","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1448116336,"created_utc":1448087536}
{"body":"Really appreciate the logical, no BS answer.  That says a lot and I wish that were more prominent in initial company communications.		Have you guys considered testing additional business models for mobile? My fear is that as the requirement to generate more and more mobile revenue creeps up, the walls over what Reddit is ok with and what it is not will topple and we'll likely be seeing high RPM auto-play video ads every 4-6 items ala FB.		In this case, the interests of the publisher seem somewhat misaligned with the interest of the user, but it might be the only viable model, so the lesser of all evils.		It's like, from a business and ad industry side, I totally get it.  As an incredibly loyal user of Reddit for almost a decade however, I can't help but loathe it.  Part of that is because I love Reddit due to its lack of ads.		Would you say there is a clear threshold for what is considered too high of a mobile feed frequency?		Also, is your stance on retargeting still that it is verboten? The comments higher up talk about the steps Reddit takes to limit tracking, but then goes on to say Reddit uses GA. Google does leverage data gained from its GA coverage to inform targeting, and they can match many people down to the name/phone number/address level.  That worries me quite a bit more than Reddit having the data TBH.		That leads to the question of what the official stance is on the privacy implications for users of Google having that data?  Obviously many folks like me run NoScript or other blockers, but that is conveniently impossible in apps these days, and I am left wondering what Reddit feels its duty is to its users, and how far that extends to the third parties it exposes them to.

Retargeting provides much higher revenues, but we just haven't had a chance to even discuss it. The ads team has been heads-down working on releasing an auction model type of ads platform since Steve re-joined. Also, you can't actually use GA targeting for ads. Google doesn't allow publishers to access the data in that way. You can only use GA data for analytics. The only data we use for targeting ads today is the current subreddit, the IP (for approximate geo location), and the device (laptop vs mobile phone), and if logged-in the user's subscribed subreddits (only if they're on the frontpage).		>> Would you say there is a clear threshold for what is considered too high of a mobile feed frequency?

{"body":"> *They never play devils advocate, for example.*		There's a component of that in what I'm doing here, but at the same time I can't escape the seriousness of my statements, I am not playing a bullshitter's devil's advocate.  I think this is a serious discussion where all valid arguments need to be recognized, not ignored, whether they are arguments against our chosen position or not, and I promise I'm trying to do that with respect :)		You ask:		> *What are the benefits, exactly?*		I say:		>> *and people have a chance to see where you stand*		> ***Wow, creepy.***		Just the other day, I responded at some length to a person who turned out to be a habitual troll.  This was pointed out kindly by someone else, and the troll responded by asking me if I was going to believe a day old account.  So I went and looked.  The brand new account had several long and very obviously sincere posts on other subs, serious topics.  The troll was a long time user that posted almost nothing but one line, ambiguous and mildly inflammatory and/or confusing statements; a shit stirrer, and maybe not so bright.		So I ask you, was it creepy that I took my only available means to try to figure out where these two posters were coming from, so I could figure out who I might best trust, and how not to be tricked?  I don't think that was creepy, I think it was just the right amount of accountability.  I got to see what other people let me see (they could use separate accounts but they didn't), and what I saw said something very useful about where they were coming from.  I also got the impression that the day-old poster was not new to reddit, knew exactly what they were doing, and was making use of the free availability of having multiple accounts.		Allowing posting history to be public allows others the right to form their own opinions, and sometimes that is invaluable, especially in a community where trolls, pranksters, abusers and assholes could easily abuse the privacy as badly as they can abuse the ability to look at other's history.  If you say something to me, I can look at your history, or lack of history, and make up my own mind how much I'm willing to trust you.  Without this, there would be no way to see how much shit someone was hiding.		> *People can never change their minds, never have a change of heart, never reconsider their positions. They should be tarnished, branded for life. Also, what they post gives clear intention, death of the author and all that. They never play devils advocate, for example. They never explore a topic before deciding it isn't for them.*		You raise extremely valid points there.  OTOH, I've changed my mind many times, been wrong, embarrassed myself for sure, lost arguments, been an asshole and a troll and a contrarian... I've done it all, and I've admitted as much publicly.  If you had several days, you could read my posting history and see it all in full gory glory.  If some asshole decides to do that, and wants to hold me accountable for something, and I disagree, then I'll think they are an asshole, and maybe I'll just have to ignore them and the shit they want to say about me.  Or make another account and start fresh and anonymous again.  I can live with my own behavior, or walk away from it.  And in extreme cases, I can even go and delete any past posts that I'm really afraid of (I've never done that).		> *Why not put down your full name and postal address? Or is that too much neck?*		Yes, that would be too much neck.  Even after five years of posting history, you would have an extremely hard time figuring out who I am, because I chose to be anonymous, and that is one of the extremely powerful aspects of Reddit, a crucial part of the freedom it gives us, that enables all the personal experimentation you so rightly mention and cherish.  I very fully agree, we need the ability to speak and discuss things without being exposed.  But it's a practical balance, and Reddit strikes that balance simply: you can have multiple user names freely and with no expectation of identifying yourself for real, and you can delete your posts if you want them gone.  For all we know, Obama and Putin are having fantastic discussions over in r/politics, and nobody but them will ever know, including each other.		But I recognize there is tension here, because ***in practice*** you end up with a single main user account, and you want to stick with it for various reasons.  It becomes inconvenient to switch users a lot, and you miss features if you are gilded on a main account but not a secondary account.  It would have been nice to be able to have a single master account, with multiple user names (personas) that would not be inter-visible except to the master account.  I think Reddit probably wasn't thinking that far ahead back when it was created, and it would be a radical restructuring of the system to change its core user account mechanisms now.  I expect we'll be stuck with the present choice, which is to make separate accounts and live with it.		> *I don't suppose you have any relatives, that every time you go home for Christmas, have to endlessly drag some stupid shit you did once in the past to introduce to the next person who dares to join your "family".*		Oh god I hope you're not talking from experience, and my heart sincerely goes out to you if you are.  I do not have that problem, or anything like it.  Right now, your only options are to make separate accounts, or delete your old posts.  They are not the best possible tools, but they work.  Honestly, that is shitty behavior to do that to other people, very unkind.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"exploderator","name":"t1_cxpfiup","parent_id":"t1_cxp4myn","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1449462691,"created_utc":1449433891}

The site rules state: "Do not post content that incites harm against people or groups of people"		Yet /r/European which is a subreddit created by those banned from /r/Europe and refugees from the /r/coontown banning do this regularly. In fact calls for attacks on Muslims supporting terrorist acts against non-white people have been increasing extremely fast following the Paris attacks.		The rules also say:"Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."		But when /r/europe mods stepped up to the plate to keep the Paris live thread updated for the site one has received tons of harassment, calls for him to be killed, and people posting about his Twitter trying to get harassment to happen off site. All for only posting confirmed facts about what happened during the attacks.		These are examples of just one subreddit out of many breaking site rules and not dealt with. [If you personally don't know about what that subreddit does here is a small taste.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/search?q=url%3A%2Fr%2Feuropean&restrict_sr=on)		Now we have countries in Europe like France following the attacks banning sites for terrorist threats or support of terrorists.

While it is nice that you are honoring it, I can't help but feel worried that you're trying to talk around the fact that not using (not opting-in to) do not track (since, like I said, it just makes sites aware that you are trying very hard to not have them track you, thereby defeating the point and making them try harder, if anything) actually appears to open you up to tracking.		I just hope the information you are collecting - or have reasonable control over in some form or other - is aggregated and as untraceable and non-corroborative as possible.

{"body":"Two thoughts: 		1) Sharing of information should (tend to) attract more ad revenue, which helps pay for the technical work necessary to maintain operations and scale the capabilities of the site. Even those positions that support the organization behind the site but don't actually design or code any site infrastructure, e.g. the sales team, create jobs that would otherwise not exist.		They are indirectly paid by advertisers, at least in part. If not for these advertisers paying more in return for our information, then who would pony up the cash to attract the miracle workers requested in the Reddit job postings?		(It is my personal experience that coding server-side database functionality and selling things are difficult tasks; hence, my use of the term "miracle workers.")		And just because Quora pays staff without relying on ads doesn't mean Reddit shouldn't. I've contributed sporadically to Quora but have found it to be a hive-mind of Ivy League elitists and West Coast programmers; whereas Reddit is much more diverse in terms of viewpoint.		(I'm sure the typical Quoran sees us a "bunch of Muppets," but that's why we're Redditers and not wasting our time on Quora -- for the most part, as some overlap surely exists in some sub-Reddits.)		2) If you're Hell-bent on dissuading advertisers from getting your Reddit information, then find some way to prevent Reddit from hiring a decent sales team (who would otherwise bait advertisers); analytics experts (who would otherwise show the sales execs usage and visitor metrics); and machine-learning engineers (who would otherwise help Reddit serve more scientifically targeted advertising).		On the latter note, who pays Reddit staff? Advertising revenue alone surely cannot cut it, as the dozen or so Reddit vacancies -- although without stated salaries -- likely pay between $40,000 (for an account assistant) to upwards of $80,000 (for any of the engineering roles).		Include the non-vacant jobs, and the Reddit payroll easily approaches $1 million.

Technically you could encrypt/compress this data (IP/general user data) via hashing - which obviously helps because of reduced storage space at the cost of increased clock cycles, but how does that help identify spam and abuse? 		* Secondly, who decides what is abuse and what is not. On what parameters. For example: say I have a completely different opinion about some random topic, and some OP/ some user said something that really ticks me off, and I call him/her a fucking idiot. What happens then.  How is it treated differently from some some dude/dudette hounding a person over reddit/other places.		>One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. 		Why is 100 days required? You could go with like 92 days which forms the quarter. Or add one more day to sift through said data.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_0bserver","name":"t1_cx7yk58","parent_id":"t3_3tlcil","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1448143608,"created_utc":1448114808}
