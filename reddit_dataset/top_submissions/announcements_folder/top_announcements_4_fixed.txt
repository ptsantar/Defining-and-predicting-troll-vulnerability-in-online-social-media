I started to complain about about this behavior by posting to different sub reddits I found such as r/undelete, r/redditcensorship, r/oppresion. I didn't complain to them directly at all then tonight around 7:30PM 11/13 I am banned and falsely accused of ban evasion. I let them know how pissed I am with one message to their inbox and and muted for 72 even though I am banned. This sub r/news is obviously a very corrupt sub and their mods can never be wrong.

The point is, having a temporary suspension, that gives you a giant warning, doesn't let you do anything and when you try to you get more warnings is very in your face and something you won't forget or not notice.

It's not always easy to tell if someone is really a spammer. A lot of people will make an account to post their stuff out of the goodness of their heart without realizing how allergic redditors can react to self promotion/OC (depending on who you ask).

We'll work on figuring out what the best amounts of times for different infractions are, we've set some limits internally but haven't had a chance to use this in the community yet, so they will probably have to be tweaked.		In clear cut cases, the Community Manager answering the queue will have the final say. If it's an edge case, we'll work as a team to come up with the decision.		3.)

{"body":"Oh, sorry! So a hash is a mathematical function that's applied to make a transformation. A hash could be something like "Take the email address, convert it to numeric form, add 75 to it, and store". Since computers store everything as numbers (binary, zeroes and ones, is just how you'd represent a number instead of using 10 digits), this isn't hard to do.		The goal is to store something that won't make sense when read by a thief. So if a thief read this address+75, they'd only see gobbledygook.		But you and I know that we just have to +75 to the email address, so any time we want to check if an email address is the one which we have stored, we just convert this email address into the hash and see if what we get is what we have stored.		Look up MD5, SHA1, and digital signatures to see examples of hashing in use. Practically, a hash function would be more complicated than just "take that shit and add 75", to make it less easy to break.

{"body":"This is something I have always wondered about, if you are just tracking IPs that seems reasonable to me, its the equivalent of saying "hmm these letters are coming from the same address but have totally different names attached, they are probably one person pretending to be two." Its a passive way to quickly check if two accounts are the same person for the purposes of enforcing a ban. And those IPs don't need to be indexed to browsing history.		Where I start to get worried is when companies start to use cookies to assign an identity to you even when you are browsing anonymously. For example Reddit can keep me logged in over multiple sessions If I tick off "keep me logged in", but what if I click "logout" because I want to browse reddit anonymously or in another account. Are those cookies still there in the background inactive, not keeping me logged in, but still telling you on your end "hey turkeygiant doesn't want to stay logged in right now...but this is still probably him he's just using his pornlover69 account"?","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"turkeygiant","name":"t1_cwvtqcs","parent_id":"t1_cwvt1to","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447222637,"created_utc":1447193837}

{"body":"I actually was suggesting they not use cookies as part of their process to enforce bans across multiple accounts and avoid circumvention of bans, or at least not without stipulations.		As far as I know the only ways to track down who is on the other end of an account is to either look at the IP from which activity on that account is coming from or use a cookie that will sit on a particular computer and inform them which accounts use that computer. Neither of these situations are inherently problematic, and I agree that they can both be quite easily bypassed.		The issue I was raising is whether or not these techniques will be used for more than just enforcing bans. Is there a registry somewhere that is logging and utilizing all my activity on reddit via IP and cookies, no matter what account I am on, even when I am logged out, even when I am not the the recipient of a ban?		If someone is the recipient of a ban then certainly put their IP and unique identifying cookie on a blacklist. But for the average user with multiple accounts who also aren't a problem user I am uncomfortable with the possibility of Reddit keeping a shadow profile that links multiple accounts to a individual. You could quite possibly figure out who I am from the comments I have made on this account and I don't really have a problem with that, I have willingly made comments that push this account out of anonymous territory. I might not however want another hypothetical "pornlover69" account to be attached to me in any way, and Reddit can easily accommodate that...unless they are connecting it through IP and Cookies to my everyday account. If you are dealing with a problem user I can see the need to make these connections for the duration of a ban, I don't think they should be made in any other circumstance for privacy's sake and because of the image of anonymity Reddit trades on","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"turkeygiant","name":"t1_cwvy51c","parent_id":"t1_cwvvbg6","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447229876,"created_utc":1447201076}

If the mods want to allow people who are shadowbanned to post in their subreddit that's up to them.

They also never said (as far as I'm aware) that a mod shouldn't allow a shadowbanned users post, and it's been up to the mods discretion.		As far as I know, a shadowban pretty much just treats everything a person posts like a type of spam (as it was made to deal with spammers, particularly bots), if a mod wants to allow "spam" in their sub, I guess that's up to them.

{"body":"> Haha, I like you. I'm an English as a third language kinda guy and I feel super insulted by everything you just wrote.		I've been in a perpetual state of feeling insulted since I first read your first comment. It's what keeps me going. 		The /r/ELI5 thing is... I don't know... worse somehow... though still mind-boggling dumb... because in this case I wasn't dealing with a user. I was dealing with the moderators of the sub. There was never another user involved. And the crippled mental capacity of the breakfast burrito's they call mods over at /r/ELI5 are so, shockingly dumb (for a sub that's all about exploring the world in search of answers... I'm... I'm speechless) that things went from dumb to breathtakingly idiotic in less than three comments. 		So this was the question:		>ELI5: Why doesn't our Moon have any name while Moons of other planets are named ?		and I replied:		>Luna.		Because OP assumed that our moon has no name. But it does. Luna. You can also call it "Moon" in any other language but English since obviously Moon in English is Moon but Luna is an acknowledged name of our moon. 		Day is saved, Op is educated, life goes on right? Nope. 		Their bot deletes my post. So I message the mods asking for my post to be reinstated:		>OP asked why the moon didn't have a name. I responded with the actual name of the moon. Luna. Shitty bots are shitty.		The first mod replies:		>Luna what?		I'm already feeling twitchy from the whole /r/writing thing so I try to have some fun with it. I reply back:		>Luna Luna Fofoona, Bananafana momoona, me, my, mo, moona. Luna. You know... the name of the Earth's moon? Is this thing on? Can you understand the words I'm typing on this keyboard? 		Which is way too much for them to handle. Mod #1, crippled into submission tags in his equally stupid partner. He replies:		>Luna isn't the name of the Moon though. It's just a name for it. The official name for the Moon as per the IAU is whatever it's called in the language you happen to be using.		Now I'm pissed. And harkening back to my assertion that smart people looking to help the criminally stupid deserve a mulligan when the interaction goes full retard I will confess I allowed my displeasure to seep into my reply. Though I would like to remind anyone who reads this that I was trying to answer OP's question. That I had an provably correct answer. And the moderators of the subreddit were first too stupid to understand what was happening to the glowing picture box on their desk and then wanted to argue that while Luna was indeed a name for the moon it was not "the" name for the moon. So while I got rude at this point I really feel like I deserve some sort of recognition for not having my head simply roll off my shoulders onto the floor and then popping like a balloon full of rancid Hamburger Helper. My reply:		>Holy shit dude. Just... You have BLOWN my mind with how completely off the rails you are. You really don't get it do you? My words are just whipping through your mind and producing nothing but dead cells and righteous indignation. I'll admit it. I'm at a loss. Humans who claim to speak English fluently no longer speak the same language as I do.		>Frankly I hope Rosetta Stone comes out with language lessons at some point so that I and the many others like you on the internet can communicate at some point.		>It seems so simple. The OP asks why the Earth's moon has no name. And I reply with one of the acknowledged names of Earth's moon. Your bot deletes the post. And then when I protest this the language barrier rears its ugly head once again and your interpretation of my words confuses and angers you.		>I bet this is why my post was flagged by your shitty bot. You have it set to you what you believe to be "English" and I'm speaking... well I guess they'll have to come up with some other name for whatever the fuck I'm doing here. And that makes me realize that you probably won't understand any of this either. Perhaps you'll take it as a nice recipe for fruit salad or something. Until we meet again noble savage. I will study your language and make further attempts to communicate once I believe there is a chance for meaningful discourse.		The mute message came quickly. And when I posted the interaction in an exasperated attempt to summon the empathy of my fellow user I was immediately banned. 		Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I can't wait for my 72 Hour waiting period to be over so I can further confuse the slow witted meerkats running /r/ELI5 by thanking them for saving me... from them. 		**EDIT** Oh! I completely forgot. The mod who banned me from /r/ELI5 is named /u/doc_daneeka and after he banned me I was checking out his post history because cotton stuffed muppets who somehow become moderators of huge subreddits are my "Gorilla's In The Mist" and so I was curious to see him in his natural habitat when I came across the absolute crown, fucking, jewel of irony. 		A mere 48 hours before (probably) being struck by a meteor and left with the faculties of a small bowl of pudding /u/doc_daneeka found himself in an argument with a user he was unable to get through to and in his frustration he said:		>I'm not comparing them, as you'd realise if you reread what I've been saying this entire time. You're completely and utterly missing my point to such an extent that I'm wondering whether you're just being deliberately obtuse.		Now I'm not going to say that God *made* me reply to that comment. But I do believe that my reply was at the very least a divine moral imperative. My reply:		>*I'm not comparing them, as you'd realise if you reread what I've been saying this entire time. You're completely and utterly missing my point to such an extent that I'm wondering whether you're just being deliberately obtuse.*		>Wow. I wonder what that feels like?

I'm probably the only disabled combat veteran banned from /r/military...		Maybe not... I know a lot of cranky vets. But the story of how I got banned from that sub isn't as interesting but does measure on the same "stupid" scale. The moderator was tired of reminding everyone that "political" posts were not allowed on /r/military and explaining to him that excising politics from the military was akin to trying to get red colored paint by removing the blue paint from green paint was getting nowhere, so he made a huge (and we're talking like a quarter of the above the fold web page here) red banner with big yellow text reminding everyone of the "no politics" rule on the subreddit.		And it was annoying the fuck out of everyone. It constantly caught the eye and you had to scroll down to see the top few posts on the sub. I want to say it was this mental giant:		/u/JTACery		But I think he changed his name or there was another JTAC guy because this one's only been a redditor for three months which is a pretty short time to become mod of a sub with 75k readers. [And an ever shorter time to completely lose your sense of humor about everything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/3s15np/heartbreaking_heres_what_a_us_soldier_said_when/) I don't even know what he's replying to since he obviously blocked the post after his comment but you can feel the lack of a sense of humor the same way you would feel the absence of your cat's bones if a soft bag of meat-filled fur hopped onto your lap and started purring loudly. 		Anyway pretty much everyone hated the banner and people repeatedly asked him to remove it. After he and I got into it and he banned me he made it green and then as you can see now it's gone completely. 		Which leaves me with the moral of the story which is I was right all along that the banner should have never been there. Which also means that trying to separate politics from the military is also a goal akin to removing the letter "m" from words. Because reasons. 		You can in fact do it.

{"body":"> I'm sorry that your recent subreddit bans apparently bother you so much that you feel the need to talk about them all over reddit, but that's really your problem and not mine. 		I don't consider it a problem. The stories don't bother me I find them entertaining/hilarious and so I share them. They do seem to bother you though since you've made such a huge deal about getting the piddling details correct. Does it really matter if it was you or one of you team members that muted and then banned me? It amounts to the same result. 		>You're the one who felt obliged to start following me around.		As the last team member who spoke to me/I replied to before the administrative action I was interested in who you are. I took a quick look at your account page and found that one response you made funny/ironic in light of what just happened to me (and honestly man... can you really look at what you wrote to me, and what you wrote there and not see the irony?) so I replied to it. One reply. If you want to call that "following you around" that's your prerogative I guess. 		>We don't allow single word answers.		Wow. A subreddit called "Explain Like I'm a Five Year Old" forbids simplistic answers. No single word or even single sentence replies to the Original Poster. To be honest it never even occurred to me that you would have a rule so in opposition to your mandate. It's like having a subreddit devoted to "short recipes you can cook in under an hour" and then banning any recipes that have fewer than three ingredients and take less than fifteen minutes to prepare. 		But yeah... that insane, stupid rule is definitely there. Wouldn't it have been awesome if it had taken less than five interactions with your mod team to learn that? I feel like it would have been awesome. 		Or maybe since my one word answer did indeed negate the point of OP's post it would have been your responsibility to then investigate whether the post was necessary. Or were you unable to "muster" enough brain power to figure that out?		>If the question can be explained fully in a single word or sentence, maybe it was not a complex concept needing a simplified explanation from ELI5. In that case please report it or send the moderators a link to the thread in question so they can take care of it.		Hmmm?		>The expanded answer you gave in modmail was incorrect, so I pointed that out (you stated that it was the name, which is a very common misconception, and I noted that it is merely a name).		All of this... entirely irrelevant. OP's assertion was that the moon has no name. The very fact that you acknowledge that "Luna" is "a" name for the Moon means that the response to the OP was correcting of his assertion. An assertion I repeatedly pointed out to you mental giants. That you wanted to argue, and continue to want to argue a completely irrelevant point is just further evidence of the flawed thinking of the mod in the wild. 		>Again, I'm sorry that this bothers you so much.		It bothered and bothers me because it is really, objectively, provably, a correct response to the OP's post. Yet you can't seem to deal with the fine point that OP did not ask for the "Official" name of the fucking moon as you keep pointing out but wanted to know why it had **"NO"** fucking name other than moon. Seriously... is this really so hard for you to grasp? I would add that your stupid answer... that the moons name is whatever "moon" means in whatever language you speak is a very, objectively, provably, wrong answer to OP's question and does not in fact help in "Explaining" the answer to his post in any way. It is the literal equivalent of OP asking "Why doesn't our Moon have any name while Moons of other planets are named ?" and you replying "The official name for the Moon as per the IAU is whatever it's called in the language you happen to be using." 		If you can't see how that just absolutely contributes nothing to the post... well I absolutely think you won't because you're in full on confirmation bias syndrome at this point. So let's take a different route. 		Had you been an even marginally proficient moderator you would have seen my original modmail message on the subject of your bot deleting my one word reply (that totally answers OP's question) and would have either deleted OP's post outright for the flawed premise and simplistic one word answer (that again... totally answers OP's question) or you would have taken on the herculean task of entering the word "moon" into your subreddit's search bar and found:		[Not one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2a846b/eli5_why_doesnt_our_moon_have_an_actual_name/)		[But two.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/37egg9/eli5_how_come_we_call_our_moon_the_moon_but_we/)		More completely valid reasons to delete OP's post. You know... in light of this:		>Search before submitting with keywords from your topic. The search box is in the upper right corner of the subreddit. 		Being part of your sidebar. 		Any one of your team members including you, actually doing a moderators job and telling me "hey we don't allow one word top-level replies but since your one word reply actually does answer the question and we don't allow questions that simple I'm going to delete the post anyway." or "Hey we don't allow one word top-level replies but in this case OP is asking a question that has been asked a number of times and since OP didn't check the search first I'm just going to delete the post and send OP a link to the last time the question was asked anyway." and so many digital characters could have been saved. Instead, you want to argue the finer points of who actually banned me or whether or not Luna is "the" name of Earth's moon or just "a" name for Earth's moon regardless of the fact that your point is irrelevant to the post in question. 		Which makes you just... awesome. 		>You're the one who decided to be a dick about it		And it doesn't surprise me in the least that you can't see why I was a dick about it. 		>And then you ended up banned, and not by me.		Again... who cares? If you think separating yourself from the decisions of the mod team you are part of without explicitly saying "I don't know why you were muted/banned but I didn't do it and wouldn't have done it" means anything you are mistaken. You're like Hillary Clinton referring to her time as Secretary of State and saying "I didn't order all those drone strikes." and not adding "and I wouldn't have ordered them had I been in charge." It makes no difference if you or someone else dropped the bombs. If you're part of the team and don't publicly disagree with the decision you keep your share of the responsibility.		 >Having given me no reason whatever to feel badly for you though, I don't much care whether or not you're banned in this sub or that one.		Finally something we can agree on. I could not care less that I was banned from your shitty sub. I'm awesome. Your sub doesn't deserve me. You and your fellow mod team members did me a favor. Thanks. I'm glad I didn't have to wait the full 72 hours to say that. Please pass my gratitude on to the others in your meerkat warren. 		I just enjoy the story. Tales of batshit crazy mods on reddit is one of the great cultural heritage works of our time. Made all the more important and entertaining by moderators unable to see how crazy they are. So I thank you for that as well. It was already a great story. *This* has made it immeasurably better. 		>Anyway, my only point in coming here was to state that you're a liar and an asshole, and to ask you to stop making comments just to get my attention.		Ok. Well done. Consider me "put in my place." However... I feel like this is an opportunity that I can't really walk away from. So let me make a proposal to you. How about I add the characters /u/doc_daneeka to everything I post from now on... regardless of the fact that I will probably never actually refer to you (unless I get to tell this UH-mazing story again) in a relevant way again so that you, in turn can complain that I'm harassing you OR... and I'm only floating this as a suggestion, you could just ignore my mention of you (as you could in this instance) and go on with your life? Suggestions? Comments?		>I absolutely did not ban you, mute you, or anything of the sort.		Yep. I get it. Your team did. Which you are part of. So.... yeah. But not you though. I totally get that. 		>And now I'd like to go back to ignoring you, if you don't mind. So again, do fuck off. Thanks, and have a nice day.		Absolutely. I promise that if you can stop replying to me with so much great material you will never hear from me again... you know... assuming that whole "post /u/doc_daneeka in everything I write on reddit" thing doesn't take off. I can assure you that I have no desire to talk to someone I consider so intellectually deficient. But when you add so much flavor to the story I can hardly ignore it now can I?		And I will have a nice day. It's looking to be cool and sunny and I'm already considering a nap in the yard. My cat likes to sleep on my chest when I do that and I find the whole experience particularly enjoyable. Add in that I just bought some new books for my e-reader and today is shaping up to be a very nice day. Thank you for getting me ruminating on that. It's given me a sense of joyful anticipation. 		So if I may I'll offer you your own words in return. "Fuck off." Because if you don't start none.

{"body":"Any spammer worth their salt is going to be able to find out whether or not they were shadowbanned pretty quickly. The shadowban itself is not that effective. However, I'm certain that they have other tools in place that are much harsher (i.e. IP bans and the like) when they find they're just recreating accounts. I'm not contending that they're letting spammers keep spamming, as the shadowban is just the tip of the iceberg. I am contending that the shadowban itself is not that effective. Anyone with a brain or any decently created script can easily find out if they're shadowbanned and recreate an account. But, that should set off alarm bells for other disciplinary action which can be much more effective.		The suspension system allows people caught in it to correct their action or appeal. The shadowban system doesn't. If the account doesn't improve their behavior, more serious measures can be taken to ensure that they don't bother Reddit again as I'm sure is already happening.		Edit: Basically I'm saying that this system is essentially the same as what's happening already, but is more user friendly. They're changing the initial contact to something more reasonable to users. That isn't to say that this, or shadowbanning, was the only tool they use to deal with spammers.

{"body":"It doesn't really add complexity, though, is what I'm saying. Add a line to the script to launch another browser, navigate to user page, if error, then alert. Or just run the program that's available from the link above (they offer a css/js file to run it locally). In addition, if it's a bot, they're still going to have to run checks for a suspension, which are going to be a little more difficult to do as you're not going to be able to rely on external tools as easily or http error codes. Plus, launching a website and checking for errors is childsplay as far as batch goes. It isn't really "complexity." To put it into perspective, you're proposing moving the entrance to a McDonalds 1 foot further away so people have to take 1 more step to get in to dissuade people from going there.		tl;dr - it doesn't add a pertinent amount of complexity to bots, and it certainly doesn't add *any* complexity compared to the suspension system...		As for IP bans, they can be problematic for larger websites as they *can* take out other users as most people have dynamic IP addresses. That said, there is a limited pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to you. Statistically, though, it's unlikely that the handful of people in your address block are using the same sites as you. Basically, "do your neighbors use Reddit too?" For most people, the answer is going to be no. I'd also like to point out that I'm not stating that Reddit should start using IP bans, rather that I'm fairly confident that they already are using them.		Basically, I'm stating that Reddit has an escalation of force. Right now it's:  	Shadowban -> some undisclosed things that Reddit won't say but likely includes things like IP banning.		The shadowban *should not* be the initial contact. Users, such as myself, get caught up in it and have no notice of action being taken. The suspension system offers a much more interactive system.		Think of it this way, if you get caught speeding, should your first interaction be a revoked license and jail time, or should it be the warning/ticket? Right now, Reddit is going immediately to throwing you in jail, and they're moving towards giving you that warning/ticket.		tl;dr2 - shadowbanning hurts legitimate users more than it hurts spammers.

This may also be the case in the new policy, but I don't think this announcement makes it clear.		Secondly, I would propose some form of "notification" system for suspensions. For example, moderators who've suddenly lost one of their team may need to be on hand more regularly to cope with the work load. They can only ensure that this happens if they're notified of the suspension. I think a suitable way to deal with this would be to allow the user to send a form-message (i.e. the suspended user does not get to change it) to small number of other reddit users with details of the suspension. Details could include the length of the suspension, but probably not the details of why that user was suspended. This may extend to placing the suspension notice on the user's page, however, this would be at the user's request. The notice could also detail the length of the suspension, but not the reason.		However, I think that these suggestions are minor, and the policy change looks like it'll provide significant benefits to reddit overall.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tinned_Tuna","name":"t1_cwwmzos","parent_id":"t3_3sbrro","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1447288713,"created_utc":1447259913}

I dunno, like the fucking dark net or something.		It's their company. They own it, they work there, they will get arrested if anyone fucks up too badly on their servers. It's THEIRS. That is why subs get banned when they get media attention, they don't want to have to explain to cops that "Well yes, the guys on /r/jailbait were trading cp... But only through PMs?

Whatever the reason is, there's no getting around that shadowbanning happened wrongfully far more often than it should have. 		Although I think letting the user know *why* they were suspended is a great step, and will help regulate suspensions compared to shadowbans, I think this is still missing the big picture of transparency and the issue people had with shadowbans. That is, nobody knew, and still doesn't know, the full details of how shadowbanning occurred and how so many wrongful shadowbans happened. That still doesn't look like it's being addressed here, either. This explains what suspensions are, but doesn't explain how they happen.		Although I still have reservations, some I haven't mentioned, I believe this is still a better system than shadowbanning.

{"body":"for the love of god, when is reddit going to start policing the mods who ban people from default subs without as much as even a warning simply because they made a comment the mod didn't like or agree with.  		many of theses recluse shut in's who volunteer get a sudden case of the big head as soon as they are granted authority, and they abuse that authority daily with ZERO oversight, many times when you ask "why was I banned" you get no response or laughed at. and this will have a profound effect on reddits growth as well as credibility.		Take /r/politics for example, thats a high profile subject that should be open to debate on a site like reddit, but sadly it has been hijacked by one opinion and one voice, and if you express an opinion that differs from the mods, you will be banned with zero warning, which should not happen on a default sub with a large interest like politics.		I could care less about special interest none default subs like model air planes, or vintage boats, but front page high profile default subs should be monitored for bias by mods, and there should be an appeal process to contest an unfair, unjust permanent banning with zero explanation.		Many people work hard hard at building a decent reddit reputation and karma, so it's complete bullshit that some mod can ban somebody for no good reason then just laugh about it with zero accountability, and at the end of the day reddit as a whole is the one who is hurt by it, for each person banned, that is one less person contributing to the site.

{"body":"The childhood tradition of a bedtime story is in serious peril, as experts warn that parents are not making the time to read to their children at the end of the working day and stop reading to them at too young an age.		“Parents lead very, very busy lives,” said Diana Gerald, chief executive of the Book Trust, which encourages children and families to enjoy books and develop their reading skills. “We live in a world where parents are juggling work and home life. Lots of parents are working shifts and there’s a lot of pressure on families. People are increasing their hours.”		A recent survey, by YouGov for the children’s publisher Scholastic, revealed last week that many parents stop reading to their children when they become independent readers, even if the child isn’t ready to lose their bedtime story. The study found that 83% of children enjoyed being read aloud to, with 68% describing it as a special time with their parents. (“It felt so warm, so spirit-rising,” as one 11-year-old boy put it.)		One in five of the parents surveyed stopped reading aloud to their children before the age of nine, and almost a third of children aged six to 11 whose parents had stopped reading aloud to them wanted them to carry on.		Frank Cottrell Boyce, who won the 2004 Carnegie medal for his first children’s book, Millions, was dismayed by the findings. “The joy of a bedtime story is the key to developing a love of reading in children”, he said – more so than literacy classes in school, which can be “a very negative experience”, for the many children he meets during visits to schools, whose first experience of books is in the classroom.		“They’re being taught to read before anyone has shared with them the pleasure of reading – so what motivation have they got to learn?” said Cottrell Boyce. “Even the ones that attain high levels of ‘literacy’ (whatever that is) are in danger of achieving that without ever experiencing the point of reading.”		 Frank Cottrell Boyce	 Frank Cottrell Boyce: ‘This is something people have done since the days of sitting around campfires napping flints. To stop doing now is to break the great chain of our being.’ Photograph: Alamy	A survey by Settle Stories, an arts and heritage charity, of more than 2,000 parents with children aged four to 10 claimed that only 4% read a bedtime story to their child every night, with 69% saying they did not have the time. In February a study by TomTom of 1,000 parents of children aged one to 10 found that 34% never read a bedtime story to their children, with 29% blaming late working and 26% the daily commute.		“Parents have definitely got the message they need to read to their children up to the age of five or six,” said Catherine Bell, managing director of Scholastic. “What’s really interesting [is that] as children acquire the skills to read themselves, parents back off. It comes across really clearly: when parents stopped, the children wanted them to continue. They thought it was a really special time with their parents and they felt really positive about it.”		On Thursday the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, and the children’s author and comedian David Walliams launched the next stage of a joint literacy drive, announcing a target to make English pupils the most literate in Europe within five years. Currently, nine- and 10-year-olds in England are ranked sixth in Europe.		The government acknowledges that the role of parents is critical and has created new activities and resources to help get more children reading before they start school. “Few things can compete with the joy of getting stuck into a good book, and I believe that is something no child should miss out on,” said Walliams.		 Michael Rosen: ‘When I was in my forties, [my father] was still reading to me.’	 Michael Rosen: ‘When I was in my forties, [my father] was still reading to me.’ Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian	The children’s author Michael Rosen enjoyed being read to by his parents for decades. “My mum read to me from as early as I can remember. I have many of the books she read to me and I would plead with her to read some of them over and over again.”		Then it was his father’s turn. “When I was about 12, our father decided that he would read to us on our camping holidays and over several of these holidays he read the whole of Great Expectations, Little Dorrit and a Walter Scott novel, Guy Mannering.”		It didn’t end there. “Because he was in the US army, he was very good at American accents and he read us Catcher in the Rye and Catch-22 when I was in my teens. Then when I was in my 40s, he was still reading to me, but this time it was his own memoir, Are You Still Circumcised?”		Rosen believes the TV in the bedroom is the killer of bedtime stories. “I sometimes ask audiences of children, ‘How many of you watch TV till you go to sleep?’ and it’s well over 50% in most cases.”		 A child reading CS Lewis’s Prince Caspian. The writer John Boyne says: ‘I’ve grown less concerned with  how young people read and more fanatical about just getting them to read at all.’ Facebook Twitter Pinterest	 A child reading CS Lewis’s Prince Caspian. The writer John Boyne says: ‘I’ve grown less concerned with how young people read and more fanatical about just getting them to read at all.’ Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA	John Boyne, author of the bestseller The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and his new novel The Boy at the Top of the Mountain, said: “I’ve grown less concerned with how young people read and more fanatical about just getting them to read at all. Whether they read with their parents or away from them, on electronic screens or on paper, seems unimportant now.”		Cottrell Boyce, however, is passionate about preserving the bedtime story. “Great ideas come from people who are able to bring their whole selves – emotional as well as rational, memory as well as logic – to bear on problems. Bedtime stories give reading an emotional depth. Why would you ever stop? This is something people have done since the days of sitting around campfires napping flints.

{"body":"Yeah, there's a lot of confusion in terminology, and that in turn causes confusion over what people can do.		Moderators can ban a user from their subreddit. This ban can be either temporary or permanent. If the user has participated in the subreddit, they are notified (this is to prevent advertising your subreddit by banning random people, which was previously a problem). In addition to notifying the user via pm, a subreddit ban removes the reply button and comment box.		Admins have had access to the "shadowban". This makes a user's posts appear to them to work, but they are invisible to others. The posts are put into the spam queue, so moderators can see them and optionally approve them.		Moderators can remove comments and posts from their subreddits. Some mod teams have scripted this so as to emulate the shadowban, but it is really just (on a technical level) the same as them manually removing all of a person's posts. There is no visible indicator of this, and can never really be.		This post is about announcing suspensions, which in many ways act like a subreddit ban, but site-wide (and available to admins).
