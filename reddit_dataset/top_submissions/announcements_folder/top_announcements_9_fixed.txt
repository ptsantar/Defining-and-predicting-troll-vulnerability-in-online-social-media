{"body":"Few things that occur to me:		* Quality comments, brought to you by the Hivemind Sorting Algorithm: 		Reddit is exceptionally good and using its community to sort and filter content. Most sites, like Digg, sort comment threads based on date. Reddit, on the other hand, by default will sort comments based on number of upvotes and ratio of upvotes to downvotes (using an algorithm principally developed by none other than Randall from xkcd).  This means that the stuff that people like gets put up top while the crap gets buried. 		In general you'll find that reddit admins put **alot** of effort into getting that maximum use out of the distributed intelligence of its users as well as setting things up so that small number of highly determined users cannot easily game the system. 			* Isolation of subreddits:		Reddit is a purposefully splintered community. If you submit the same story to two different subreddits, it'll create two different pages with separate comment threads rather than two links to the same set of comments. This allows for the creation of hyper-specialized communities and makes reddit resistant to being dumbed down because of increased popularity.

[Click here for my full formatting guide](/cw70q)		Also:    	[Large collection of unicode faces](/9z73e), such as ಠ_ಠ    	["Collection of Awesomeness" by DarkSideofOz](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/87gf7/notice_how_theyre_starting_to_crack_down_on_the/c08h5lu)		***		###Comment Sorting		[Everyone can now sort their comments by default!](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/08/new-features-to-start-your-week.html)   		However there was also [this tool](http://d0c.org/reddit.php) which will find your top 5, bottom 5 and median comments.		***		###Default subreddits	[Pics](/r/pics) | [Funny](/r/funny) | [Reddit.com](/r/reddit.com) | [WTF](/r/wtf) | [Science](/r/science) | [Politics](/r/politics) | [World News](/r/worldnews) | [AskReddit](/r/askreddit) | [Gaming](/r/gaming) | [Programming](/r/programming)		If you complain about too much noise and not enough content, try unsubscribing from these. 		###How to find new subreddits		* [metareddit.com](http://metareddit.com)	* [subredditfinder.com](http://subredditfinder.com)	* [subreddits.org](http://subreddits.org)	* [New Reddits](/r/newreddits)	* [Karmanaut's subreddit map](http://s272568090.onlinehome.us/reddit/karmanaut-redditmap.html)	* [Ultimate subreddit map](http://hdevalence.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/routput2.gif)	* [searchreddit.com](http://subredditfinder.com)		#"*I don't know how to subscribe/unsubscribe!*"		It's easy! Click on the [`+frontpage`] button! ([View example](http://imgur.com/EMMuU.png))		***		###Makes Friends!		If you find a redditor who submits links / writes comments that you enjoy, you can befriend them by clicking the [`+mates`] button on their profile. ([View example](http://imgur.com/kl1So.png))		Once befriended their name will gain an "[F]" tag, and will glow an exciting scarlet color! 		[You can view their submissions by visiting this link.](/r/friends)		The person you befriend will not know that you have done this, and they will not see *you* in scarlet. I guess this feature would be more appropriately named "Stalk".		***		###"What does that do?"		I'm am surprised to find out that some redditors are yet to discover some basic features. 		#[Expand inline text from `SELF` posts](http://imgur.com/HN96U.png)		#[Expand inline media](http://imgur.com/jJk2X.png)		#[Expand and collapse comments](http://imgur.com/6Wxqo.png)		***		###Bookmarklets		[Bookmarklets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklets#Bookmarklets) are snippets of javascript you bookmark in your browser,  they can do all sorts of cool stuff.		* [Official reddit bookmarklets](/bookmarklets)	* [redditor-created bookmarklets](/bnc1z)		***		###Shorten Subreddit URLs	http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth    	*can become*    	http://raerth.reddit.com		***		###Shorten links to a submission	http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cix4g/how_to_reddit/    	*can be written:*    	http://reddit.com/cix4g    		*(the 5 digit code is located in the original URL)*		***		###Shorten URLs even further!	Reddit markdown supports relative links. This means when creating a link on a reddit webpage you can ignore "`http://reddit.com`".		Examples:		* [/r/music](/r/music)    	* [/user/raerth](/user/raerth)    	* [/help/reddiquette](/help/reddiquette)    	* Linking to 'self' posts shows the full page. eg: [/cix4g](/cix4g)    	* Linking to a submitted link will bring up the toolbar page. eg: [/9btvn](/9btvn)		***		###Combine Subreddits		Want to view *only* /r/videos, /r/books & /r/music?    		* http://videos+music+books.reddit.com    	* http://reddit.com/r/videos+books+music    	* [/r/videos+books+music](/r/videos+books+music) (within reddit only)    		Want to view a combined *New* tab for the three?    		* http://videos+books+music.reddit.com/new    	* http://reddit.com/r/videos+books+music/new    	* [/r/videos+books+music/new](/r/videos+books+music/new) (within reddit only)    	(Also works for `/top` and `/controversial`)		N.B. There is a character limit for subdomains, 6 or less subreddits should be fine.		***		###Get an [RSS feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of almost any page	Simply add **.rss** to the url		Examples:		* Subscribe to new comments in this thread: http://reddit.com/cix4g.rss	* Subscribe to new submissions in this subreddit: http://raerth.reddit.com/new.rss	* Subscribe to comments made by Raerth: http://reddit.com/user/raerth/comments.rss	* Subscribe to submissions by Raerth: http://reddit.com/user/raerth/submitted.rss	* Subscribe to submissions from the domain `TED.com`: http://reddit.com/domain/ted.com.rss		Bonus Tip: Use [twitterfeed](http://twitterfeed.com) to add any of these to a twitter account! ([I do](http://twitter.com/raerth))		***		###Chat to other redditors on [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC)		Many subreddits have their own chatroom. Most on the Freenode network with webchat.		Examples:		* Main reddit chat at [#reddit](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit)	* /r/AskReddit at [#askreddit](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=askreddit)	* /r/Programming at [#proggit](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=proggit)	* /r/Marijuana at [#weedit](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=weedit)		[Click here for a full list](/cmcws)		***		###Reddit Enhancement Suite		Redditor [honestbleeps](/user/honestbleeps) has created [this awesome enhancement suite](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com/).		**Features:**		* Create tags for users & subreddits	* Reveal images in comment threads	* Show Up and Downvotes	* Keyboard Navigation	* & more		Works with Firefox (with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748)), Chrome and Opera.		***		###Change reddit's appearance		Stylish is a browser add-on which allows you to add custom css to any page		* [Stylish for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/)	* [Stylish for Chome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)	* [premade reddit userstyles](http://userstyles.org/styles/browse/all/reddit)		***		###RedditAddict		[RedditAddict](/redditaddict) is a reddit-approved desktop app to track your karma and alerts you to replies/messages.		***		###Socialite		[Socialite](/socialite) is a reddit-approved toolbar-style Firefox add-on		***		###Smartphone apps		* [iReddit](http://itunes.apple.com/app/ireddit/id302732279) *iPhone*	* [iReddit Free](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ireddit-free/id321405188) *iPhone*	* [Alien Blue](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alien-blue-reddit-client-unofficial/id370144106) *iPhone*	* [Reddit is Fun](http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-andrewshu-android-reddit-qjEw.aspx) *Android*		***		Subreddits I like: 		#Meta	* [Best Of](/r/bestof)	* [Too Long; Didn't Read](/r/tldr)	* [Reddit Stories](/r/redditstories)	* [*All of the Above*](/r/bestof+tldr+redditstories)		#Interesting	* [Wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)	* [Tip of my Tongue](/r/tipofmytongue)	* [DepthHub](/r/depthhub)	* [In-Depth Stories](/r/indepthstories)	* [Food For Thought](/r/foodforthought)	* [TED](/r/ted)	* [I Am A](/r/iama)	* [Documentaries](/r/documentaries)	* [*All of the Above*](/r/wikipedia+tipofmytongue+depthhub+indepthstories+foodforthought+ted+iama+documentaries)		#Entertainment	* [Videos](/r/videos)	* [Books](/r/books)	* [Music](/r/music)	* [Movies](/r/movies)	* [Sci-Fi](/r/scifi)	* [SF Stories](/r/sfstories)	* [Listen To This](/r/listentothis)	* [Web Games](/r/webgames)	* [*All of the Above*](/r/videos+books+music+movies+scifi+listentothis+webgames+sfstories)	* [llimllib's list of musical subreddits](/r/Music/comments/b36g9/dear_music_reddit_what_other_music_subreddits_are/c0laq17)		#Fun	* [Trees](/r/trees)	* [Woah Dude](/r/woahdude)	* [Shitty Advice](/r/shittyadvice)	* [Humor](/r/humor)	* [*All of the Above*](/r/trees+woahdude+shittyadvice+humor)		#Random	* [Zombies](/r/zombies)	* [Space](/r/space)	* [Frugal](/r/frugal)	* [Geek](/r/geek)	* [Shreddit](/r/metal)	* [Favors](/r/favors)	* [Soccer](/r/soccer)	* [London](/r/london)	* [UK](/r/unitedkingdom)	* [UK Politics](/r/ukpolitics)		***		###Mod Resources	* [Mod News](/r/modnews)	* [Mod Help](/r/modhelp)	* [Reddithax](/r/reddithax)	* [Reddit Logos](/r/redditlogos)	* [Mod Queue](/r/mod/about/modqueue) (combined Spam + Reports for all your moderated subreddits)	* [New submissions in subreddits you moderate](/r/mod/new)		***		###FAQs, Help and Reddiquette		All these are listed at the bottom of every page, included here for completeness.		* [**Reddiquette**](/help/reddiquette)	* [Reddit's Help wiki](/help/)	* [Reddit's FAQ](/help/faq)	* [List of subreddit FAQs](/help/faqs)","depth":0,"score":418,"ups":418,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Raerth","name":"t1_c0y27fa","parent_id":"t3_d73ow","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1283194808,"created_utc":1283166008}

Hopefully some others find it helpful, too.		Actually, a lot of us redditors were originally diggers.  I started checking reddit in addition to digg maybe 2 and a half years back, and eventually just stopped going to digg.  It's not that I suddenly decided one group of people were substantially dumber, but rather that the potential for learning existed more here at reddit.		It wasn't all ice cream and posies either, though.  After lurking for a while, I registered an account so I could leave a poorly executed ad hominem comment.  I got downmodded to oblivion, and I took it personally; it hurt —  "Why don't these guys want to hear what I have to say?"  I deleted the comment, and continued to think about it.		I didn't actually have anything to add to the conversation.  As such, the rest of the redditors were filtering out useless posts using their individual moderation powers, as is encouraged by [the reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette).		**Other things I've learned here**:  		- Correct usage of grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. serves the primary purpose of avoiding invalidation of your message due to others perceiving you as being dumb.  Yes, the function of written language is to get a message across, and it can still get across if you spell things incorrectly or your sentences are phrased strangely, but there are always corollary messages conveyed simultaneously.  An example would be the mistakes' connotation, "i rite liek a idiot so take wut i say wit a grain of salt."  		- Don't plagiarize.  If you appreciate something, chances are others will, too.  Honor it by crediting the source, and it may even pay off by means of residual effects — increased traffic to a site, thereby increasing ad impressions and revenue, for example.  Also, people here are from all backgrounds and many, many levels of knowledge of many, many subjects.  There's also a good chance someone else will have seen whatever you're passing off as your own, and they will call you out on it.  		- In general, just care.  Think before you write or post something.  This site and community are only as good as you make it.  That also being said, make sure you adjust your [subreddit subscriptions](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/) to accommodate your personal interests.  A few highly recommended subreddits to get the most out the site are [True reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit), [tl;dr](http://www.reddit.com/r/tldr), and [best of](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof).  		- Also, be open-minded.  Don't discount any particular political stances simply because of which side endorses them; judge what you see and hear for what they are, and if it is ludicrous, blast it to hell, but only do so after understanding it (or trying to hardest to do so).  		- Karma is worthless.  Don't worry about it.  Really.  It's not actually a measurement of your e-penis, or how much people like you and what you have to say, etc..  Speak your mind if you have something pertinent to say, or if want to show the rest of us something, do it however best facilitates doing so.  For example, don't post an image of text if the text is readily available.  It [probably] takes longer to load, the image could be in a lossy format and be of an unreadable quality, etc.  This is called karma-whoring; it is looked upon with disapproval.  The Karma system is inherently plagued by certain circumstances, like that those comments which have existed longer will generally be upvoted more, and that a hivemind develops based on similar opinions, so people will occasionally circle jerk by simply feeding this hivemind.  An example here would be hating on Nickelback — I don't think their particular music is any worse than a lot of the other stuff out there; [I wouldn't not watch porn because there was a track by them in the background](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/d6yjl/oo_nsfw/c0y0wft?context=1), but the hivemind will do what it does.  		- If you do want to accumulate more karma for whatever reason, browse posts sorted by what's [new](http://www.reddit.com/new/) and/or see what is being posted outside your subreddit subscriptions by viewing [all posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/all).  Help the community by downvoting (and if you really want, [reporting](http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers)) the spammers, upvote the decent material or that you think should gain more exposure, and comment early on threads that have the potential to be popular.  To get the most out of everything you see here, though, don't forget to change how comments are sorted - by best, new, top, etc. to vary what's within reasonable scrolling distance.  		One last thing, here's another useful link - [markdown guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ewgt/reddit_markdown_primer_or_how_do_you_do_all_that/).  If you have any other questions, just ask; somebody will probably be willing to help you out.

You should be able to see it on this comment. An edit without the star is sometimes called a Ninja Edit.	* If you see a post and there's a number between two square brackets, such as [6], this is how high/stoned the Redditor is at the current moment (on a scale of 1 to 10). This comes from our friends in [/r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees).	* How do I make the look of disapproval or any of the other many combinations?

{"body":"Here at reddit, we like to complain. We complain about republicans, we complain about democrats, we complain about how useless and pathetic we are as individuals, we complain about all the people complaining all the time, and we most certainly complain about /r/circlejerk.		We like to fantasize, and we like to tell each other how cool and funny we are. And to be honest, as long as we think we are cool and funny, who's to say we aren't?		But reddit can be serious. Reddit is full of people who would quickly and happily extend a helping hand. You have a question? /r/askreddit will do their best to come up with an answer. You need advice? Steer clear of /r/shittyadvice. Or, go there. Your call. Reddit is full of people with feelings, a sense of humor, desires, pride...		We have helped people with their small businesses, we have helped people find solutions to homelessness. I have seen more comments about people spraying their keyboards with coffee than any other single type of comment. Reddit has moods, reddit can be happy, reddit can be sad.		Remember, reddit is a bunch of individuals. In a site like this, the loudest minority is often the most heard, until the masses get fed up with a particular type of annoyance, and rear their mighty self-post self-righteousness.		Ultimately, there are no absolutes here. We try our best to be respectful and considerate, but we are only human, and we sometimes fail. This is a friendly place, though. This is a community, and we all try to contribute, not to exploit. We like each-other, we're friends. Not good enough friends that we add everyone to our friends tab, but buddies... or something like that.		So... have a good time. Don't be afraid to post, comment, submit. So the hivemind doesn't like your news article? So what? Move on. So some eloquent speaker disagrees with your opinion? Thank him/her for sharing his/hers, and move on. We make a big deal about Karma, no-one actually cares. Granted, there is a time and a place for every topic of conversation, but it's not hard to find that place (and the time is early morning, central time).

{"body":"Here are my tips:		I find that, instead of ignoring sections of the community by selectively subscribing to things, I choose to view discussions and links from all subreddits. I do this with the following two links:		* http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top?t=day - I visit this several times a day. I really have a feel for this site by reading the daily happenings/trends. I find that the best comment threads to read and comment in are 2 to 10 hours old; I find that is my hotspot for 1. having enough discussions to read to be satisfied, and 2. have a thread young enough that if I make a reply I am pretty sure people will see it and maybe even interact with it		* http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top?t=hour - I look at this several times a day, too. Often just when I am bored with everything on the prior page I linked to. It's usually only the top 1 to 5 links on this page that I'm actually interested in.		(I subscribe to reddits solely for supporting their growth and traffic).		I tend to switch reading sections of reddit using the URL bar in my browser. I might want to go straight to the best IAmA posts of the week, so i'll just type in http`://www.reddit.com/r/iama/top?t=week`. Why? Well, there's a lot of subreddits out there, and different ways to sort each, and I also tend to browse reddit on a variety of different devices, so I can't count on things like bookmarks all the time.		Here are two handy javascript snippets that you might find handy some day, and you should bookmark them. You use them by pasting them into your URL bar while viewing a comment page, and hitting enter. Or just by clicking the bookmark.		* Show images - `javascript:%20var%20x=%20$(".content").find("a").each(function()	var%20href=$(this).attr("href");if(href%20&&%20(href.indexOf('imgur')>=0%20||%20href.indexOf('jpeg')>=0%20||%20href.indexOf('jpg')>=0%20||%20href.indexOf('png')>=0))	var%20img%20=%20$("<img%20style='display:block'/>");img.attr("src",href);img.attr("width",%20"300");$(this).replaceWith(img);		);`		* Parent comment only - `javascript:$('div.commentarea%20>%20div.sitetable%20>%20div.thing%20>%20div.child').each(function()	var%20t=$(this);if(t.children().length%20>%200)t.prev().find('ul.buttons').append($('<li></li>').append($('<a%20href="#"><font%20color="green">toggle%20children</font></a>').click(function(e)	t.children('div').toggle();e.preventDefault();	)))	).children('div').toggle()()`		There's a lot of different things that you can do with reddit comment syntax. Either find a guide for it, or just wait and learn it as you go. It took me a long time to figure everything out. Might come in handy one day to figure out how to get the .json or .rss from any page (just add it to the end of a URL).		What else? Be courteous. Conciseness, grammar, and punctuation all stem from this. Don't be afraid to stick your neck out with your opinion, but respect everyone around you. If you think someone's a troll, just ignore them. They hate that the most :) 		Moderators are not administrators, and they can't do much in general. You should ask them if things you comment or submit don't seem to show up for other people. They can hide comments and submissions, and they can also unhide ones that have been filtered by the spam algorithm. Try to be nice when you message them :)		Read usernames. This can be important, and you may not be used to doing it. They can make comments more entertaining or insightful to read. You will also start noticing notable people. The Administrators, for instance. Or novelty accounts like Nonsensical_Analogy or Look\_of\_disapproval		As for the visual look of reddit, I made/modified a greasemonkey script that colors comments based on what score they have. It takes a bit longer to load comment pages, but if you have a good connection and you like the novelty of it, it's worth that drawback.  	You'll need the Firefox web browser, the Greasemonkey add-on, and then you can download [this script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/43882).

And this is how [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) (please read it) advises users to upvote/downvote:		- **Upvote**: "This was an interesting/informative/funny post, whether I agreed with the overall content or not. It added to the discussion."		- **Downvote**: "This post added absolutely nothing to the discussion/was spam/was racist or derogatory."		It's perfectly usual to upvote a comment even if you don't agree with any of it. Reddit should be a place of enlightened discussion rather than simply an enforcing of the hivemind opinion.

However, saying that anybody who doesn't realise what a shining example of humanity she is is a dumb ass hippie communist nigger muslim... well, that's obviously fair game.

So often, I'm totally in agreement with someone in a debate, and then they call the other person a fag. Instant downvotes. Just make your point, and leave the name-calling on the bus.  	    		*  Most people don't care about karma, but if you happen to, never criticize Jon Stewart, Yahtzee, or Rachel Maddow. No matter how valid the criticism, you will get downvoted. It doesn't matter if Yahtzee just spent 10 minutes ranting about Super Mario Bros Galaxy 2 not having a story.  Just shut up.  Those people's ardent supporters will go to your profile and downvote everything you ever said.  	    		*  Alternately, there are certain things that will always get you upvoted, no matter what. For example, saying "What Matrix sequels?" or "What Star Wars prequels?" will result in a massive influx if karma. In fact, as a good starting point, I recommend googling "atheist quotes." Then find a good one and submit the link to r/atheism. Check back later for your free 5k karma.

{"body":"True, but I feel it doesn't hurt to suggest theories.  Also, although I think the scientific method is a powerful tool to get to the truth of the universe, I think there is a flaw in the notion that a phenomena can't exist if it can't be disproved.  That seems to suggest that the only phenomena which can exist and be discussed are those that we can control.  		I'm not saying that its possible to "know" for certain that a phenomena is true if it can't be tested and possibly disproved.  But I am saying that many scientists refuse to consider many possibilities and assume many other possibilities are automatically false, simply because those possibilities can't be tested.   		The phenomena of ghosts is a good example. Since there is no way to control when and if a ghostly phenomena will appear, then the possibility that ghosts exist is scoffed at by many scientists, despite the large number of sightings.  Granted many of those sightings are probably hoaxes, but if even one is legit then there is a phenomena out there in the universe which is being ignored by many who are closing there minds because of the notion that only phenomena that can exist are those that can be disproved.   		I was a chemist for 14 years and have known many brilliant scientists who had extremely closed minds. More closed than any fundamentalist Christian.

{"body":"Ex-digg user here with a question/comment. Comment first actually: The content here is great. Everything is new and fresh and, having been terribly disappointed with every bit of news to hit the front page on digg in the last week, this is a sight for sore eyes. Question now: I am finding the comment system to be the biggest thing to attempt to get used to here and was wondering if there were any tips on the subject. I used to sort digg comment by "most dugg" and look at the top comments, expanding the thread only if it seemed like it would provoke interesting discussion. Sorting by "most dugg" would sort universally so no matter if a comment was a reply to a reply, it would get sorted to the top if it had the most votes. I could open the thread to see what spurred such a reply, if it happen to be such, or what replies it may have generated. Here, it appears that threads are maintained and replies stay nested under an original post. The ranking of the original comment is all that gets sorted. This is only frustrating because threads here seem to become very large before a new thread is started which keeps the second comment thread tucked way down below. And even if the 152905th comment within a thread has the highest votes, and correct me if I'm wrong here, it can only be found 152905 comments down under the original comment.

Those of us who have been here a while have generally made it a positive place to discover new ideas, laugh our asses off, and actually talk about subjects of substance.

{"body":"There is a mobile version of Reddit for those of you who enjoy the use of your various mobile handheld electronic technological devices.		There are two versions for use in your mobile (and also desktop, if you really want to) browser. For the older version, simply enter ".mobile" (no quotation marks) at the end of any Reddit url (I.e. homepage or a comment thread) and it will direct you to the mobile site. For the newer (and imo better) version you simply do the same process but enter ".compact" (no quotation marks) instead of ".mobile" at the end of any Reddit url (i.e. homepage or a comment thread). Either version makes it much easier to read homepage, other Reddits and comment threads (although .compact does it better, imo). For .compact, as a plus, when you click on a link it automatically has a Reddit toolbar up top to directly upvote/downvote/direct you to the comments so you may read and easily comment. Also if you want to see your profile, go to another subRedddit or search Reddit (which btw they did an awesome job with that) you can go to the top right and a menu will drop down (sometimes it works first time, sometimes it doesnt, at least for me...).		It does, however, have a couple draw backs. When you log in, go to the top menu-drop-down-thingy and press "submit" it directs you to an error message (the classic "you broke Reddit message"). Don't freak out, nothing is wrong with your mobile handheld electronic technological device, it's just an issue with the mobile site (I assume it's on their to-do list). If you really want to submit something from your mobile handheld electronic technological device, stay on the error page, go to the url and delete the ".compact" from the url, and it will send you to the regular submit page. From there I'm sure someone else here will instruct you on how to proceed.		The other issue is loading of more content. I'm not to keen on how it works, so I won't go into much detail, but if you want to load more links, you have to scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see the rotating alien, and then wait until more loads (dont quote me that, I honestly don't know how to load more, but thats my theory). If it bugs you too much, again you can go to the url and delete the ".compact" at the end and it gives you the regular site so you can click "next", or the other mobile version (instructions in second paragraph) will also have the "next" option.		All in all, its a great option for your various mobile handheld electronic technological devices. But if browsing through your browser isn't your cup of tea, there is an app for Reddit (at least for Android, I'm not sure about iPhones, but if android has one I'm sure they should have one too). Just search "reddit is fun" at your local application downloader and you should find it. I downloaded it and used it and it is a very good app, but I still use the mobile handheld electronic technological device browser version; it's up to you.		Thank you for reading and have a good day.				TL;DR, Reddit mobile.

Also, at all costs, share your opinion, even if it goes against what seems to be the norm here. If you get downvoted, don't get discouraged. Remember, karma is just a number.
