{"body":"This is where the /r/betateam folk can finally spill the beans :) Thank you guys so much for not blabbing about it before it was ready. It's made for some [odd-looking threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/crxdw/some_months_you_just_cant_seem_to_do_anything/c0uszla?context=3), though ;)		**Edit**: to those asking how the /r/betateam members were invited, there were three avenues:		1. I made a sponsored link to a [blog post](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/06/looking-for-secret-beta-strike-team.html) that I left live for about an hour, where I told people to go subscribe to it (about 300 people did)	2. Then after the first gold announcement, I offered to let gold members invite themselves (about 1,100 people did)	3. I invited anyone that PM'd me a search complaint or suggestion on how to fix search for the last few weeks (which was about 20 people)		**Edit #2**: Please stop PMing me for an invite to /r/betateam, we don't have any active betas right now, and the next one we hold will have the same opt-in model as this one","depth":0,"score":351,"ups":351,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ketralnis","name":"t1_c0uthqo","parent_id":"t3_cs4ll","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1279763389,"created_utc":1279734589}

The answer to your quiz is actually secret option (c): you're childishly overreacting to something that doesn't actually mean anything. You think it means something but no one else does. Of course, rather than consider the possibility that you may be overreacting just slightly, you'll continue to wage this pointless war. Possibly for the attention, possibly for the lulz, but possibly because you care way too much about the happenings of the website. If it's the latter, something tells me  you were heavily involved and opinionated about the whole Saydrah thing.","depth":22,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Scalawag","name":"t1_c0uv4bb","parent_id":"t1_c0uv3lt","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1279798873,"created_utc":1279770073}
