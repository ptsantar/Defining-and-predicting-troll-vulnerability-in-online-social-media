{"body":"Yes! Spoiler tags! I've been [advocating for this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/oqnxk/on_behalf_of_the_entire_book_and_tvshow_subreddit/) for a long time.		The simplest, most elegant solution would be to allow moderators to upload a thumbnail image for each linkflair.		On the frontpage, the thumbnail would be replaced with the moderator uploaded one.		So if we created a "spoiler" link flair, we could have a "spoiler" thumbnail for it that would appear for users on the frontpage.		If we have book spoilers and tv show spoilers, we can have thumbnails for those too.		All of these would also block out the picture thumbnail itself, which frequently contains spoilers.","depth":2,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RainbowCrash","name":"t1_cr1rzxx","parent_id":"t1_cr1p2z7","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431058675,"created_utc":1431029875}

We try to launch things in a way that's appropriate for the scope of the feature. So, for example, minor bug fixes or small UI improvements are either silently fixed, or mentioned in our [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/ukaeu1ik4sw5), which we try to keep up-to-date with every change. Larger changes that are user-facing get mentioned in /r/changelog - an example is [Q&A sort](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/342y8k/reddit_change_new_comment_sorting_options/), which is definitely user-facing but not likely something that every user or even most users will care about. The largest features are reserved for a blog post and /r/blog - things like the [launch of reddit live](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/07/announcing-reddit-live.html) and [embeddable comments](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/03/announcing-embeddable-comment-threads.html).		Hope that helps clarify how we do things - of course, we've grown a lot over the last year as a company, and we're continually learning, so we'll continue to experiment with the right ways to communicate changes with you all.		**tl;dr We launch things in the appropriate venue based on the size of the feature.

However, while I do hope that things turn around for you, I have zero interest in tolerating your hatred and personal attacks so please bugger off.","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hermithome","name":"t1_cr6werb","parent_id":"t1_cr6v9x8","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431487315,"created_utc":1431458515}

{"body":">Reddit sorely needs a generic catch-all subreddit so there isn't a constant battle between users wanting visibility and mods trying to keep their subreddits focussed on a specific topic or quality.	   	You sweet, sweet child.  That's exactly why they removed it in the first place.  [They wanted to take away your place to address your concerns with the website as a whole]:	         	>**UPDATE: WITHIN 30 HOURS OF MAKING THIS POST, I WAS SITE-WIDE SHADOWBANNED "ACCIDENTALLY", I AM NOW UNBANNED (See *new* point #14 for details) _________		1) **The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.** 		This took away the only tool for communicating *with* reddit *about* reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.		2) **The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**		I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious [campaign to filter him out of the election](https://archive.org/details/HowTheGovernmentAndMediaCheatedRonPaulDocumentary).		3) **Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**  		I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be "approved". Someone named [Victoria](https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=3110&amp;seid=111) is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.		There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. [Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/)		4) **The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.** 		All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. "Feel good" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions from brand new accounts that *never* posted again.		[Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city!](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html) I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! "Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are *never* to be included in our yearly stats!!!"		[Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy) **Protip:** the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.		5) **Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.** 		What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.		Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.		Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title .

{"body":"6) **Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**		We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if *anyone* agreed with you.		7) **Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random** ^‿^ 		No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.		And speaking of the female demographic and "gender discrimination" being represented, that happened around the time [this person](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ellen+pao&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) took over as CEO of reddit.		8) **You are posting too much, please wait...**		It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing "well", then you get benched.		Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment. 		A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have [shadow-banning](http://www.webanswers.com/technology-computers/internet/web-sites/shadow-banning-on-reddit-997916) on a website that claims to support free speech.		9) **[Reddit is not a meritocracy](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/).**		**tl;dr**: **Your votes do not matter.** The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a "head-start". As we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this [amazing comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6kofo) that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. [They actually gave that user the boot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/) How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!		10) **The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.**		Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. [Nope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/)		11) **[Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/304uk6/the_reddit_trend_towards_banning_people_from/)** Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the *exact* same way about complex geopolitical events.”		12) **All of the proper "checks and balances" are now in place.** 		R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the [Two-Minutes Hate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate) from George Orwell's 1984:		&gt;a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.		But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!		Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, [the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/reddit-ddos/). Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the ~~manufactured~~ consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, **without any other evidence**, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.		And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.		13) **Online guerrilla tactics.**		When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https://voat.co/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?		Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. [Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE.](https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/rupert-murdoch-and-vice,6483) And once you have the customer, [it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones](http://oursocialtimes.com/70-of-companies-say-its-cheaper-to-retain-a-customer-than-acquire-one/). So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.		14) **Shark Shank's Redemption** (title credit to: u/Iridium777)		So I made this post and it went viral on r/conspiracy reaching +3500. I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer "be found". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban. 		So I made a new account and made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30hy5r/i_wrote_how_reddit_was_destroyed_and_it_went/) about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:		&gt;It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.		I have no idea what "vote brigade" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a "vote brigade". 		Anyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of "yeah, our bad". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban "accidentally" within a day and a half of my most viral "How Reddit Was Destroyed". 	…………………………………….			It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.		Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) syndrome and this manipulation has encouraged the retard masses to become their [useful idiots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot).		**I believe this can essentially be boiled down to not just greed, but controlling and manipulating the information that the millions of people see on a daily basis. Reddit gets billions of views. [Manufactured consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) is very real and doing it through social media is the gold standard because people are hard-wired to value the opinions of their peers.**		The people who run reddit are not the "cool bloggers" they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. 		And they know it. You should too.		................		**Fun Fact**: Type this into the reddit search: How Reddit Was Destroyed.
