On the other hand, you are publically posting to a website in the first place. There is SPDY which uses SSL as well and increases performance, but that depends on the browser. Overall if you really feel you need complete privacy, you could use a proxy to browse and traffic would only be visible between the proxy server and the website.		They mention they use CDN in another post on here also, which can carry pretty high costs (one I know of is $1500 for a single CNAME for HTTPS).

Dear Reddit: If you want us to care about our account security, you should at least give us an option for SSL to begin with.

A password theft would be more dangerous, except that by default, Reddit's login/signup page is delivered over plaintext also. Even if the password is theoretically submitted over SSL, a MITM on the login form could steal passwords, even before Heartbleed.		And this can't be purely accidental. https://ssl.reddit.com/ redirects to http://www.reddit.com/ which tells me that this insecure mode is very much intended.

{"body":"What Munroe is doing is describing two 'algorithms' for creating passwords.  He does this by explaining them as a series of choices you must make to pick one password from the set of all *possible* passwords that you could make with that algorithm.  The bigger the pool of possible passwords that an algorithm can generate, the more secure those passwords are.  This is important because password cracking programs try to model these exact algorithms and iterate through that set of possible passwords.  A good algorithm will have the biggest pool possible and generate it from the most memorable choices.				The first password looks complex because it involves six choices (caps or not?  which base word?  Which substitutions to make?), but it has a problem.  Not only are the choices hard to remember, but they tend to have very few possible states.  For instance, caps-or-not can only be one of two things in your password, so your bang-for-buck ratio in terms of how large your pool grows per thing you have to remember is "double", which is not so good.  Choosing four common words, despite being fewer decisions, is picking four times from a pretty big set of possibilities.  The number of way you could do this explodes exponentially.			Incidentally, one bit is a good way to represent a choice between two things (1 or 0), and that's what Munroe does in the comic.  The total pool size comes from multiplying the all the component choice sizes together.  Incidentally, it's easy to do this in binary as well.  The possible number of outcomes between two independent binary choices is 4: [00, 01, 10, 11], which is exactly two bits.  This is the same as making one decision among four equally probable possibilities.  You can keep adding bits this way to represent picking something out of larger and larger pools, and that's how Munroe represents the total number of possible passwords: he guesses or determines the number of possibilities for each little decision you have to make, represents them in bits, then adds the number of bits together.  The total number of possible passwords is then equal to the number of unique integers you could make with that number of bits.   Every new bit doubles the pool.  "Correct Horse Battery Staple" comes from a pool of many more bits than "Tr0ub4dor&3", but is easier to remember.  				Relating how many possible passwords there could be to how many characters are in the password starts to touch on the concept of "entropy", which is a deeper pool.  Consider this: A one-character password is not strong, because it is one symbol from perhaps 255 possibilities.  However, the grid-based password system on mobile phones where you have to draw a line that connects some of the grid's dots is much stronger even though there is still only one symbol that you provide, and that's because you are picking a single thing from a much larger pool.","depth":1,"score":30,"ups":30,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eubarch","name":"t1_cgsj1uo","parent_id":"t1_cgshv5w","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397546684,"created_utc":1397517884}

{"body":"I can help with this, I actually just had to explain this to a layman yesterday.		The basic gist is that when a computer does a brute force attack, it's going through a range of digits and guessing every possible combination of characters within the set (like a-z A-Z 0-9 specials and so on) with that number of digits.  So if you have 4 digits, you're guessing every possible combination of characters within 4 digits.  You can't re-use any of that when you move up to 5 digits, so you're guessing every possible combination of those characters within 5 digits now.  This increase is exponential, so when you get up to like 16+ the number of combinations to guess gets ridiculous, even for a computer.  		The time becomes expanded greatly when the character set to guess is larger, too.  When a password is being cracked the fact that a number or special character or whatnot is there is enough to increase the complexity of a character set (how does anyone know WHICH letter of the alphabet will be capitalized?  If you don't, you have to include all of them).  This means even having *one* capital letter, *one* number, and *one* special character increases the character set by *all* of those things, which is a huge jump.  So that, combined with length, gets a really ridiculously secure password going.  Something like this would be an amazing password cryptographically:  		Ilovehavingreallysecurepasswords1!		34 characters long and forces the cracker to use upper and lower alphanumerics, all numbers, special characters, and so on.  It would require some time to crack in hundreds of years and it's absolutely brainlessly easy for a human to remember.  correcthorsebatterystaple is good for its length (which is the point he's trying to make), but you can still improve on it by enlarging the character set.		The whole gist of rainbow tables is that you're pre-generating these values and sticking them in a text file.. since generating that data is the hard part.  The actual comparison of the data is the easy/quick part.  But still.. rainbow tables that contain that large of a pre-generated character set would take an enormous amount of disk space.  I'd have to guess at least 4-8TB, I'm ballparking it though.  Tiny for a datacenter, pretty big for a power user, and definitely huge for your average user.		Don't forget the way that these cracks work is that the password is guessed (generated) and then it's hashed with whatever encryption type is being used.. then compared to the hash you already have.  		A quick example, with a certain encryption type (I'll use MD5):		**aaaaa** becomes **594f803b380a41396ed63dca39503542**		**Ilovehavingreallysecurepasswords1!** becomes **2959c171eac7cba9bfdddb1763c70a1b**		Always and forever.  So if your password is aaaaa, your hash will be that.  So when a cracker's brute force generates "aaaaa" they'll see that hash, see it matches yours, and then realize your password must be "aaaaa"  The complexity of the password doesn't actually change the complexity of the hash, as you can see -- this is done to obfuscate the password length (among other things) so people can't say "oh, the hash is X long, so I only need to bother guessing X or fewer characters."		Mostly word/letter order doesn't matter, some cracking algorithms will use plaintext wordlists and variations on it, so they may actually string together random words in order to make guesses and throw things like one number or special character at the end because crackers know full well that people like to do this.. but it's still severely offset by the fact that it's just so damn long.  Think of how many english words are in the dictionary.  Think about four *random* words.. the number of possible combinations to guess is mind-boggling and one individual computer can't really make quick work of it either.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DamienWind","name":"t1_cgsj7ah","parent_id":"t1_cgshv5w","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397547007,"created_utc":1397518207}

{"body":"Passwords are usually acquired by one of x ways:		1) Phishing attacks (you're sent an email to a fake login page that records your password)		2) Crappy sites/services getting hacked (your password is used on forumX which has security holes)		3) Spyware infection on your machine listening to what you type/send		4) Brute forcing (usually impractical, but some services can have vulnerabilities making this possible)		With 1 and 3 they'll usually have your name and password. So you're screwed.		If they manage to gain access to the user data of a site/service with #2 they'll usually have your name and copy of your password in an **encrypted** form (Unless they're complete idiots and store the passwords as normal text. Then you're screwed again.).		When you have an encrypted password, working out what the password actually is is a little tricky.		You see encryption normally only works 1 way: You encrypt *"iloveponies"* and out the other end you get *"f53388acbbf84e54bd7d105f..."*. But once you have *f53388acbbf8...* there's no way of turning it back (or there shouldn't be). So when you go to log in normally you give it your password, it gets encrypted, and if that *encrypted* version matches the encrypted version they have on record then *great*, they know you've used the same password. But the service itself doesn't actually need to know what your original password was.		So once you've pilfered an encrypted password, the usual method for working out what it came from is to encrypt every combination you can think of, until one of them matches. Computers are fast. They can do this given sufficient *time* (usually a long time).		-		So we've got a big list of 20k encrypted passwords, and we want to crack as many in as short a time as possible. Lets start with obvious guesses first..		(note that if they you got you via number 4 you'll end up here too.. since they'll need to try every combination while they're trying to brute. Although usually with much limited capabilities)		First we'll try a few hundred commonly used words/passwords. That's just a few hundred to try, that's good and fast, even for 20k passwords. 		Then we'll try each of those same words, with the numbers 0-9 on the end. There's just a few thousand combinations to try now. That's still okay.		Now we'll try again with the first letter as uppercase - a few thousand again.		...And eventually we'll end up trying every combination of upper, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. There's scadoodlezillions to try, but we'll leave it going for a while, trying the shorter passwords first, then slowly getting longer until we finally give up or decide we have enough.		So obviously to get the most passwords we want to try things that are more common. The more likely your password is to be similar to other peoples (in form and length) the more likely it is to be found out earlier. If you password really is a *random* scramble then that's good, that's possibly relatively unique in form. If it just starts with an uppercase letter, and is then mostly lowercase, with a few letters capitalised or replaced with common letter/symbol substitutes and then ends in 1 or 2 numbers/symbols (as exampled in xkcd) then no, this is more likely. Attackers are more likely to try combinations like that before they try completely *random* combinations of everything. They'll work their way out from predictable patterns, to less likely.		xkcd's example of using long memorable phrases is that		A) It is rememberable		2) It is long		Passwords aren't usually long phrases of words. So this isn't a pattern they are *likely* to try. This *likely* won't be found until they're trying every random combination last of all. And because it's very long they won't get there till the very end.		And really our hopes are all based on the fact they'll give up before they get there. Getting this far is likely to take a *very* long time, even with some real meaty computing power.		Of course if everyone starts doing it now and it becomes *common* then it's likely attackers will start trying *random list of 3-5 words with and without spaces* before the other stuff, so it will become less secure again.		There are also limits as to how many combinations you need to try. Encrypted passwords are only *so* long (depending on the scheme used). So after a while long passwords start coming out the same as shorter ones. The speed at which they can guess also depends on whether the usernames/passwords came with **salts**, and whether they all use the same salt. If they use the same salt then you can encrypt one guess password, then loop through and compare it to every encrypted one for a match. If they all use different salts then you'll have to encrypt your guess separately, with the salt, for every single one, taking much, much longer. And there are other factors based on scheme, and tricks you can use - I've skimmed over a lot and massively simplified.		But the trick is to be uncommon. Your password should be far, far from the norm - both in content, but also in the *form* it takes. 7 characters may be a little short, even if it does feature letters, numbers and special characters in a *random* form. Really though every password is insecure if the attacker already has a user/password list and enough time/machine-power behind them to crack it. Every password will eventually be found out. So make it long, uncommon, and use a different password wherever possible, so when one is found out it does not jeopardise others.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ProPuke","name":"t1_cgsm0yv","parent_id":"t1_cgshv5w","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397553024,"created_utc":1397524224}

{"body":"xkdc is right, but that has little to do with your password.		xkdc assumes that a potential attacker does not know your password, but your password scheme. In your case:		> 7 random scrambled letters (upper + lower), 2 special characters and 3 numbers		Then, the question is: how many passwords that match the scheme do exist? I have no idea why they used "bits" for that number, let's just do the calculation for "correcthorsebatterystaple", or 4 random words. They assumed that you choose the random words from a pool of 2048 common words ("11 bits", because 2 ^ 11 = 2048), so there are 2048 * 2048 * 2048 * 2048 possible passwords, or 2 ^ 44, or around 17 trillion. Meaning: an attacker has to try (max) 17 trillion passwords to get the right one.		You can calculate ***your*** password strength, too. Assuming you use the letters / chars / numers in exaclty that order:		- each random upper/lowercase letter = 52 possibilities, so 52 ^ 7 = 1 trillion combinations	- 2 special chars: there are not too many that are commonly used, so let's say 10 per char, so 10 ^ 2 = 100 combinations	- 3 numbers is easy, 10 ^ 3 = 1000 combinations		So your password scheme is really good, 10000 trillion combinations fo find your password (max).		xkdcs first password is unsafe because the basis is an "uncommon" word (one of 65000 unkommon words), and as an attacker will have a database with uncommon words the length of the word is not relevant.

It's a parody of a scene from an actual movie called [Angels With Dirty Faces (1938)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_with_Dirty_Faces).  If you watch the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nld4DcRHME0) for that movie you can see part of one particular scene which might have inspired the parody.

{"body":"I wish to register a complaint.		I went to update my password, as a result of this announcement.		When I left my (verified) email address in the password/email form, it did not update my password in your system (it said "email updated", even though I didn't update my email address) even though I filled in my old password and put my new password in both of the password/verify-password boxes.  I had to clear my email address for it to do so.  (it then said "email and password updated")		Then, when I put in my previously-verified email address, it required a new verification.  Furthermore, it didn't automatically attempt to verify the address I put in place (this may or may not be by design, but I view it as an unhealthy design).  Unlike every other web service I have used, this one also required a queue-processing time before it sent the email so that I could verify it.		I recognize that you view your service primarily as a means of wasting time, but even if you do view it such, I'd rather waste time browsing your site and not by getting anxious over administrivia (such as "making sure that my password storage and your website believe I have the same password", or "having to reverify an email address that I already verified because your password-change form doesn't act properly when the new-password/verify-password fields are filled in").		I use IBM Notes and IBM Domino, which were first released (as Lotus Notes and Lotus Notes Server) in 1989.  And even *they* have more effective and consistent password-change semantics than Reddit, which was first made available in 2006.  17 years, for a large step backwards in usability and security.		How many people have tried to change their passwords, and failed, because they have a verified email address?		Please fix this.  My account has had its password changed, because I'm anal-retentive about ensuring that my records and site records match.  I've noticed, however, that most others are not so paranoid.

{"body":"I used to work in an IT department.		When someone forgot their password, we would reset it to the word "password" and tell them to log on and use that, and then change the password to anything they wanted to after logging on.		The problem was that nobody changed their password after logging in. We had too many users that used "password" as their actual password.		Even then people complained that "password" was too hard to memorize. So we used "passme" instead, but then they still didn't change their password so we had a lot of users using "passme" as their password.		Some of the employees became trolls and tried to guess passwords to administrator accounts using "password" and "passme" and they got in and started to mess things up.		Our fearless network administrator changed settings to force a stricter password that required at least 8 characters and an upper case and symbol to qualify and made all passwords invalid so that after logging on they had to change them. People got angry, they couldn't follow the new security policy for the new password so they couldn't log in and kept calling the help desk asking for help.		Finally the security policy on passwords got changed back to normal. We tried other passwords like "late4work" and "changethis" but it only made people confused and so we went back to "passme" instead.		I think at one time we even used "passcode" and "swordfish" and other stuff. 		The average employee at that law firm I worked at, were not very smart when it came to computers and passwords.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OrionBlastar","name":"t1_cgsr6ke","parent_id":"t1_cgsh777","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397564364,"created_utc":1397535564}

{"body":"Let's say that you and a friend are passing notes in class. You want those notes to be totally private, so you and your friend come up with a secret code that only the two of you know. Every note you pass is written in code, and even if your teacher grabbed every single one of them, he wouldn't be able to figure out what they said. That's a very ELI5 version of encryption.		But now let's imagine that every time your friend opens that note in class, your teacher can see a tiny chunk of it - maybe only a few letters or numbers. And let's say that because your code is so complicated, your friend has another piece of paper on his desk (called the "key") that he can reference to actually translate from the coded note to plain text. Now, your friend is really stealthy, so he does his absolute best to hide the "key" under his desk so that nobody but him can see it.		Heartbleed is the equivalent of your teacher having super vision that allows him to see tiny bits of both the notes you pass AND the piece of paper that tells your friend how to translate the message - **even though your friend is doing his best to hide everything**. Your teacher can only catch the tiniest glimpse of those things, but after enough time, he can piece together big chunks of your notes but also (perhaps) the entire "key" that your friend uses to translate your messages. 		If your teacher writes down everything he sees - both messages and the "key" - for long enough, he can eventually crack the code and read every single note that you have ever passed to your friend using that "key". It's important to note that your teacher would REALLY have to put a lot of effort into this in the "real world" of the internet, because you and your friend would be among **billions** of pairs of kids in class passing notes. But it's still possible, because your teacher has lots of eyes.		(In this example, you are you, and your friend is your bank or something - and the note you're passing contains your Social Security number, date of birth, bank account number, and list of your fears)","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"adityapstar","name":"t1_cgsi30b","parent_id":"t1_cgshb6d","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397544595,"created_utc":1397515795}

So, the hash of reddit.com would be "1fd7de7da0fce4963f775a5fdb894db5" (that's 32 characters). Maybe you pick characters 10-17 or something, so "0fce4963". Then you decide to drop that in the middle of "SuperAwesomePasswordTwo", so it becomes "SuperAwesome0fce4963PasswordTwo". Then for youtube.com, the hash would be "14dd5266c70789bdc806364df4586335", so following the same pattern, your password would be "SuperAwesome70789bdcPasswordTwo". Another option to mix it up, instead of hashing reddit.com or youtube.com, you could hash Xreddit.comX or Xyoutube.comX or something.		Or you could use this: https://www.passwordcard.org/en","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OakTable","name":"t1_cgssrxf","parent_id":"t1_cgshy0a","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397569112,"created_utc":1397540312}

{"body":"When you encrypt something, it looks like gibberish. So for example "Hello there!" might read as "09agjq349f8yevj4328v".		If you know the encryption key, you could reverse it, so you'll know that "09agjq349f8yevj4328v" is supposed to be "Hello there!"		Encryption allows you to enter things like your credit card and address and password into websites without other people knowing what you typed. The website will have their encryption key, so they will know what was entered, but other people won't.		OpenSSL is the name of one such encryption program. It's used all over the internet on many, many websites, reddit included.		[It was recently discovered](http://heartbleed.com/) that there was a bug in OpenSSL that allowed people who are not supposed to get private data to get it. These people are referred to as hackers (or, if you want to be pedantic, crackers).		OpenSSL has been fixed. People that own websites which use the broken version of OpenSSL need to use the new, fixed version. Then they need to revoke their old encryption keys and use new ones. Using old ones would allow crackers who got encryption keys before OpenSSL was fixed to keep taking information which isn't theirs.		The reddit admins are saying that they have done both, updated OpenSSL and revoked the old certificates/encryption keys, and as such it is now advisable to change your passwords in case someone nefarious got ahold of them while OpenSSL was broken. If you do not own a website, you still need to make sure you're not using the broken version of OpenSSL, as information can be taken from you if you do. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/22h163/critical_crypto_bug_in_openssl_opens_twothirds_of/cgmzrln) explains what to do to fix the problem.

All in all, the most effective password is the 4 random words from a dictionary with an important number and punctuation. 		Ex. I like pi. 3.14159! 		Thus password is very hard to break to th the point where anybody willing to cracked it would be extremely disappointed to know all that hard work went to claiming a reddit account with 12link karma,  357 comment karma and a bunch of posts in /r/adviceanimals and /r/askreddit		Edit: words","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ROFLicious","name":"t1_cgt8bi5","parent_id":"t3_231hl7","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1397617361,"created_utc":1397588561}

People are needing to change their passwords because of this recent threat and this allows them to create new unique VERY strong passwords (as well as usernames) without needing to actually remember them.		Furthermore, if an account is hacked, it isolates the issue to just that ONE site.  Sure it won't stop the server from getting hacked in the first place, but you sure as hell don't want the rest of your accounts getting infiltrated as a result.  Since most people use the same username and password for all their accounts, it means that every account becomes vulnerable.		Also for people who do in fact create unique passwords but need to remember them, they need to rely on patterns or tricks to remember them and thus they'll often be based on words and utilize little to no other characters, thus making them easier to hack.

{"body":"Do you submit your username and password using a form on a page?  Yes.		Does Reddit use cookies to track your session and logged-in state?  Yes.		Heartbleed is an information disclosure vulnerability that gives an attacker access to the web server process' RAM, which includes temporary memory used to store submitted form data, incoming requests, and outbound responses (which include cookies).  SSL/TLS is "Transport Layer Security", not at-rest encryption, so these details are, in fact, stored in plain text at some point before being passed to/from the behind-the-scenes application server.		This is separate, but related to needing to change the certificates.  Because not only your form data gets exposed, but potentially the private key of the SSL/TLS certificate.  With that exposed, even if Heartbleed itself is patched an attacker can continue to decrypt the in-transit data at their leisure, including passwords from those logging in and subsequently issued session cookies that go back and forth with each request.
