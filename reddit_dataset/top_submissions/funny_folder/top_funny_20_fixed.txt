Indoor air fresheners (ha, 'fresheners'...they literally pollute the air) trigger asthma, migraines and cause congestion. They're very bad for pregnant women.		A 2006 study carried out by Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), a part of the National Institutes of Health found that a chemical used in air fresheners reduced lung function.		Human population studies at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), a part of the National Institutes of Health, found that exposure to a volatile organic compound (VOC), called 1,4 dichlorobenzene (1,4 DCB) may cause modest reductions in lung function. 		"Even a small reduction in lung function may indicate some harm to the lungs," said NIEHS researcher Stephanie London, M.D., lead investigator on the study. "The best way to protect yourself, especially children who may have asthma or other respiratory illnesses, is to reduce the use of products and materials that contain these compounds." 		http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-using-air-fresheners-during-pregnancy-boost-childhood-asthma-risk/								http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-using-air-fresheners-during-pregnancy-boost-childhood-asthma-risk/","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cm7h2lx","parent_id":"t1_cm7f8gd","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1416441180,"created_utc":1416441180}

Being that the Optipulus-nerve behind their eyes is relatively thin, means that it doesn't take a lot of pressure to rupture that nerve and have the eye leaving the skull. It's a sad sight everytime I have to work on one of these poor fellas but what I usually do is, I take out my scalpel and cut out their second eye so that they don't have to see themselfes being killed while I kill them.

At one point I was running around the yard when he was working on the deck and failed to notice a hole directly in front of me. It was a hole about eight feet deep with a sonnet tube in it which was going to be used to anchor one of the main supports of the deck with concrete. 		Well I ran straight into it and fell head first down the Sonnet tube with my arms trapped against my sides until my head slammed into the bottom of this eight foot whole. I don't really remember it but apparently my Dad suddenly noticed I was missing after a couple minutes and heard muffled sounds coming from the hole. When he looked into the hole he saw my legs kicking back and forth and immediately reached down and lifted me out by my ankles. I somehow wasn't hurt in any way but it momentarily freaked my Mother and Father out a little from what they told me.		Edit: It's been pointed out that the word choices of "momentarily" and "a little" probably were not the best. Knowing my Father he was probably actually scared shitless and my Mother probably threatened to kill him and one of my Uncles who I believe was there at the time helping build the deck.","depth":0,"score":28,"ups":28,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Camelizer","name":"t1_cm7dn9m","parent_id":"t3_2msrcz","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1416434720,"created_utc":1416434720}

I remember just giving a good push and going down the steps while my uncle, who would have been around 16 at the time, completely ignored me. This is the same uncle who when I was 4 invited his girlfriend over while babysitting me, and explained using her as an example, what french kissing was. Anyway, my parents said they picked me up at the bottom of the steps where I had been thrown out of my walker and watched as my eyes rolled to the back of my head. 		This was the 70's and my parents were idiots so they shook me until I woke up, and then proceeded to keep it a secret from everyone.

{"body":"There's a photo of two year old me and my one year old sister sitting in front of what looks like blurry shower curtains that use to hang in my living room. When taking it down my dad told me the back story was that we went to Niagara Falls and my dad thought it would be a good idea to have both me and my sister sit on the railing in front of the waterfall all by ourselves without anyone holding us up. He loved the photo so much that he had it blown up and hung it in our living room for years. 		Too bad he's a shitty photographer and you can't even tell where we are. Later on I found out my dad loved taking pictures of us on high railing without anyone holding us up. Most of them look the same just with different railings because all you see is us, the railing, and the sky. Only he seems to know where any of them were taken.

{"body":"My mom often takes the dog out and, when I try to drink my daily supply of milk, it walks back into the house, oftentimes through the cat-flap. This makes me highly distressed, and I often run upstairs and contemplate jumping out of my bedroom window, situated 100,000 feet above the ground, leading down onto cold, hard, frozen jell-po. I wanted to start the next sentence with "however," but some asshole told me I couldn't, so, anyone, everytime I'm about to do that, my mother comes up to me and says "David, you know what happened last time the porpoise jumped the gun?" An epiphany hits my every day at that time (23:41 P.M. EST), and I fall backwards, landing on a sharp, tractor razor, which gores my back into a mangled mess. I am then hurried to the emergency room, where doctors there, oftentimes stuffed animals, hurry around with scalpals and hard lemonade, reviving my back into a proper, knit together sack of disgusting kangaroo fur and cyclops eyebrows. With a gleeful shout, I jump down onto the floor, and proceed to cover myself in the fruit punch you always find at a 5th grade middle school dance, the sticky corn syurp attracts ants, and I lie there, slowly being devoured by fire ants imported directly from Costa Rica for this purpose, until the sun comes up, and a new day begins.
