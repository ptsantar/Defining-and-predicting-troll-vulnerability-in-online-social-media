{"body":"All you have to do is go to the emergency tent and ask for water. Often times they'll give you attitude at first so you just fire back with this:		"So what you're telling me is when I wake up on a stretcher and the EMTs ask me why I wasn't drinking water I'm going to tell them it's because the festivals drinking fountains aren't working and the emergency tent refused to give me any of their water. What's your name? I'll mention you specifically."		They'll give you water.		And before anyone informs me I'm an asshole, I know I am. I'm an asshole because nobody else knows how to be. The emergency tent is most likely set up by a 3rd party contractor. They buy their own water and that's why they don't want to share it. If enough festival patrons came up and do what I did management at the 3rd party contractor hears about it and starts telling festival management they need to adjust their contracts for future festivals. That's when changes happen. I realize the people at the tent probably have little control over this but that's true of pretty much everyone at the festival. This is very much intentional and it's done because employees rarely put pressure on their management team because they have no incentive to do so. Me being an asshole gives them the incentive to act. They start being an asshole when their manager is being stupid and putting them in uncomfortable positions of denying people water. Then that manager becomes an asshole to the festival rep for putting them in an uncomfortable position of providing water to patrons when it's legally the responsibility of the festival. The festival rep is an asshole to his boss and so on. The only way shit goes uphill is if you're an asshole and you carry it with you.		EDIT: Woo!

They buy their own water and that's why they don't want to share it.		I volunteer for St John Ambulance in the UK. I've done multiple duties, especially at music festivals or sports events (Barclays Summer Time, London Marathon, etc.).  	The water is always exclusively provided by the festival organiser, and sometimes we haven't got enough for ourselves, much less so for ourselves + our patients, so you can imagine it's difficult for us to provide water to those who just pass by and want water.		That said, at those festivals and events, water was readily available at clean taps, or sold for ??1 by all food stalls.  	In those cases, we definitely didn't feel compelled to give water bottles to those people, because they could simply walk to clean water taps or buy a bottle for cheap.		As a first aider, it is always our goal to protect and care for the public. In that sense, if clean water isn't provided, even if _we_ were the ones buying our water, we'd still provide water to the public, because it is a way to make sure the public stays safe. Not providing water when there is none easily available is, in my mind, contrary to the role of safety that the first aid provider is supposed to have.		I've also been at a smaller event where the organiser provided so little water, that I went and bought some with my own money to make sure we had enough for ourselves and the public.

I have never interacted with the British Red Cross, except for people with tin cans in the streets.

That said, I started volunteering in the North of England (not London), and to be honest I was pretty unhappy and disappointed. Volunteering in London is far better than it was there.  	This is probably due to the fact that each region is administered slightly differently. Plus the people are not the same.

{"body":"I think the simplest way to make sure everyone has food and water is not by subsidizing food or water, but by proving a basic level of income for everyone. Subsidizing these resources could cause market distortions that may have potentially disastrous unintended affects while a guaranteed basic income would ensure people weren't starving.		There will doubtlessly be a huge amount of resistance to such a program, but speaking from a purely economic point of view pure cash transfers have more benefit for the payee than simply subsidizing only food/water.		If people weren't directly paying for their water this could lead to abuse of the system and the wasting of water. For instance, Ireland has recently moved to meter and charge for what was previously an uncharged for commodity. Ireland had huge amounts of waste and inefficiency in their water systems because of this lack of transparency.		To conclude, a guaranteed basic income would be better public policy than subsidized food and water but would most likely also be more politically challenging to enact.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"matthewtheninja","name":"t1_cju8hra","parent_id":"t1_cju74di","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1408422347,"created_utc":1408418747}

I'll be honest, I don't know if the programs still exist, but ~25 years ago, you could receive certain "government provided" food.  Water came out of the tap (and is paid for by the building owner). It wasn't provided to everyone, though.  Now, we have "food stamps", or whatever they're called today, which I guess are the same thing.  Water still comes from a tap just fine. I suppose you could give everyone a brita and filter, and not replace them as often as Brita would have you do so.  But, tap water is held to a certain standard and anything else is a nicety (that I'm not convinced matters a damn.)		It kind of got away from me there, but... Government provided food was shit.

Adderall is a combination of amphetamine drugs so yes, I believe everyone can experience an effect from it. Whether it's beneficial or not is down to the individual.

{"body":"This is a myth.  		The drug that both ecstasy and molly refers to is MDMA, that is what you are supposed to be getting. It is however, in either ecstasy pill OR powder "molly" form commonly cut with other drugs. 		Methamphetamine is commonly used to cut MDMA in ecstasy pills, as are piperazines such as BZP and various synthetic stimulants such as Methylone (BK-MDMA), Mephedrone (4-MMC), or other cathinone- based stimulants which are commonly known as "bath salts".  		  Cocaine and Heroin are never really used as cuts for MDMA.  If you think about it, it makes little sense.  Both drugs have a very low oral bioavailability, which means that the dose it takes to get any effect from them is very high. 		 Since MDMA is usually taken orally it would be a total waste to put these drugs in it.  Also, cocaine is NOT a cheap drug.  A recent study on prices of drugs showed it to be the least cost effective illegal drug.  A gram might be cheap, but cocaine purity is so low nowadays that you're lucky if a third of that gram is actual cocaine. 		 Heroin also does not make sense, it's often said to be a cheap drug, because first time users can get high for a few dollars, and its much cheaper than prescription opiates, but per gram its much more profitable to sell it as heroin than as MDMA.  		Also, why would a dealer/drug chemist use these valuable drugs as cuts when cheap alternatives like meth or BZP that can be obtained for WAY cheaper are available and will give a high that is somewhat similar to MDMA (at least to an inexperienced user) when taken orally.  		As for mescaline, there is even less of a chance of that being in a pill or some molly.  It is never produced commercially anymore, since an active dose is so high.  A usual dose of mescaline is at least a third of a gram, whereas MDMA is a tenth to a fifth of a gram.  Pure MDMA is just as easy to make and is in fact cheaper to make than mescaline. 		 The only mescaline available now might be from a chemist making small batches for personal consumption with his friends, maybe distributing a little on the dark net, but commercial mescaline synthesis died in the 60s-70s.  Even back then most things sold as mescaline were actually LSD or PCP.  		All of this information is widely available on the internet with a simple google search.  I recommend bluelight.ru and erowid.org for accurate information on drugs.  		Drugs and drug culture are surrounded by myths spread via word of mouth as fact.  No matter how often your buddy gets high its never a good idea to trust the things he tells you about the often dangerous chemicals you are consuming.  ALWAYS check the facts yourself, and use reliable sources to determine the best way to keep yourself safe when using drugs.		Edit:  Just wanted to say that there are testing kits available online for as cheap as 30$ that can tell you what is in your ecstasy/molly.  They aren't 100% accurate when a substance has more than one active ingredient, lieka  pill with both MDMA and meth, but it gives you more information than you have without them.

A usual dose of molly is 150-250mg.  250mg of mescaline would be pretty low dose.  Most pills only way 300-500mg tops, and they need fillers/binders to stay together, so its not even really possible to have an active dose of mescaline in a pill.  I'm sorry if I came off as obnoxious, I have been told the whole heroin/coke based pills thing 1000 times by many people, its a very prevalent myth, but it isn't true.

None of those three were sold as MDMA.  They have NEVER been sent a sample of ecstasy or molly that contained any Mescaline.  		Edit: Also, if you are sold mescaline on the street it is much more likely to be one of the widely available mescaline analogues such as escaline, allylescaline, or even heavily cut 2C-B, than to be actual mescaline.  It's possible to get, but I personally wouldn't believe anyone telling me they had it unless I had independent confirmation from a lab.

{"body":"This shit sucks, and it's fucking serious business. Spent a month at Fort Hunter-Liggett in Califorsee some years back for some training. I'd always been good about drinking plenty of water, but Hunter-Liggett that time of the year was just... Bizarre. Waking up in our tent in the morning, our camelbaks would be completely frozen solid, but in the afternoon the temp would be in the upper 90s, sometimes spiking to over 100 for a short time.		Anyway, about two weeks in, I was feeling pretty well 'climatized', wasn't feeling the "shock" as much from the crazy temperature difference and let my guard down. Didn't even realize I hadn't been drinking as much water as I should, stepped into a port-a-john (well the fuck over 100 inside those), and within 30 seconds, I lost my vision, balance, coherence, was instantly afraid I was dying, panicking grabbing for the door switch, falling out of the port-a-john with my pants undone, calling for my squad leader who I somehow remembered was nearby.		He got to me and I said I can't see, his voice was muffled, I couldn't even begin to stand up, I was shaking and tingling all over and it was difficult to breath. He carried me to a humvee a few dozen feet away, put me inside and turned on the AC. Called a medic and made me sip water while we waited for the medic. He also dumped a ton of water on me. Medic got there and plopped an IV in me and I was fine in minutes.		All of that happened in about 3 minutes, minus the recovery with the IV. And immediately before it happened, *I felt fine*. There was absolutely no warning or indicator. One second I'm going about my day, "lalala, I need to piss" the next second I'm dying because I forgot to drink water.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Freddit-","name":"t1_cju9cgf","parent_id":"t1_cju30o6","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1408424303,"created_utc":1408420703}

My hands felt weightless, my body felt like it was floating. I just remember trying to get my eyeliner straight. That's the last thing I remember. I woke up in a hospital about an hour later. 		The doctor said I had a heat stroke.

Apparently there was a grip of sexual harassment (never saw it, not that I was paying attention), and stories about a girl getting raped during Limp Bizkit's set.

And it snowballed after that.		Everybody was there for the music, so we did that. I never saw a fistfight, and I never saw a girl groped against her will. What I did see was a few hundred thousand people in one place to sample an enormous smorgasbord of music, sprinkled with some odd shit here and there, capped off by what was basically a riot.

It only rained (lightly) for like 20 minutes (during Metallica's set, right as they were playing One, which was cool), so any mud to be had probably didn't come from the rain.

The atmosphere was definitely a lot douchier in the crowds for some of the big-name rock bands and a lot more chill for some other genres or indie stuff. By the last day people were throwing almost-full beer cans during Godsmack, but during something like Guster everyone was super laid back, or especially the unannounced P-Funk show the night before it started on George Clinton's birthday, which was one of the best things there.		It really depended on where you were when during which sets what kind of stuff you ran into. I saw a lot of different kinds of bands, so I saw a lot of different types of crowds. I'd agree that it wasn't as bad in my experience as the media made it sound (aside from the rioting at the end, which is when we bailed), but some groups were definitely better than others.		I did get a sense that the brutal weather and extortionate pricing of everything were starting to get to people by the end, but who knows why exactly what happened happened? I'm sure those things didn't help, but I don't know what triggered the fires and looting. I could feel the tension leading up to it, like something was going to happen, but I'm not sure where it came from or what tipped it over from that point.

{"body":"I live in Arizona and this is a law in my state.  Water must be given freely to anyone that asks.  The only exception is at private residence, if someone knocks on your door and asks for water, they must provide their own drinking tool, however, you are obligated by law to give anyone water that asks.  Does not mean you have to let them into your home, but you do have to give them water, even if it means being a dick and making em drink out of a hose.  However, most people are reasonable and will bring them water.  Never heard of someone not giving a cup.		This is largely because it gets to be 110F(43C) or more in our desert for weeks on end, with several months of the year being straight 100 to 110(38-43C) deg+ weather.  My parents live out on the side of a mountain, who also happens to have a nearby connecting trailhead that trails off from a fancy JW Marriott resort in Tucson, AZ.  Trailhead is about 5 milies long, so not terrible, but it is amazing how many tourists get lost on that trail and end up on our street on the other side of a small mountain rather than back at the resort, some of them in pretty rough shape.		The resort even fronted the cash to make sure there was cell towers within range of the trail for all major carriers because of the issue, with even more aggressive signage.  Still, every year, I'd say half a dozen people end up knocking on my parent's door asking for water and directions lol, to which we kindly would just drive them back around the mountain and drop em off at the resort again haha.  If we were dicks, by law, we could be thrown in prison for not giving them water.

Ingredients:		* Hot dogs (like 8 or so)	* Hot dog buns (usually 8)	* Hard boiled eggs (about 6)	* Ketchup	* Mustard	* Shredded cheese (take your pick; she used cheddar usually)	* Aluminum foil		Dice the hot dogs and put them in a bowl. Dice up the boiled eggs and toss them in the same bowl. Pour some ketchup, little mustard, and dump some cheese on top. Mix it all up good with a fork or hand.		Heat the oven to 425-450. Take your mix with a spoon, and fill the hot dog buns with the mixture. Wrap them in the foil, and put them in the oven. Let them bake about 15 minutes or so. The buns should be nice and crisp.		Pull them out, let them cool, and eat. 		It may sound silly, but it is damn delicious. The best part -- it's extremely cheap for a good, unique meal (which is why she made it for us, since we were pretty poor growing up). They're also easily tossed in the fridge for later. And they are damn good cold.		The fun part I've had as an adult is experimenting with different ways to make them. Try ranch instead of ketchup and mustard. Add some diced onions and green pepper. Use mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce.

On top of that, if you have water for a dollar, when people get hungry they will remember that you are a good guy who sells water for a decent price, and be more likely to come back to you to get food and beer.		I agree with others that water should really be free at festivals, but if you have to charge, charge a reasonable price. As I have said in this thread many times before, the festivals I go to usually have free fill stations inside the venue, and that works out the best. You can refill your bottles free of charge, albeit with luke warm water. This also benefits you if you have cheap water because when people decide they want something other than luke warm water, they will come back to the cheapest vendor, you, for their cold water.		I think its time you think more about helping people in need of a basic human right, which will lead to better profit margins for you.

Also, state laws may vary, but in NC you are allowed to bring one factory-sealed bottle of water, up to 24oz. No water bottles, nothing opened. Also in NC, it is illegal for any vendor that sells alcohol to deny you free cups of water. The venues I work put large orange igloo coolers of water at each alcohol vendor, and at the large plaza areas. They aren't well marked, and nobody advertises free water, but it's there if you ask.

{"body":"What do you expect? Music festivals are run by corporations now. Outside Lands was just about as bad with the water situation. At one point they were limiting the amount of water you could get per turn. Meaning that if I wanted to fill up my Camelback, I'd have to wait in a 30+ minute line three times. Not only that but people are ass holes and just walk to the front of the line. It was fucking ridiculous. There was so much downtime between filling as well since each (up to) 25 oz cost $1 and a lot of people paid with card, meaning a credit transaction for each person in line, then fill the bottle. It took forever! Only three places to go to get the water as well. Such BS. There wasn't even an option to get water from a tap, it was either a small bottle or refill at a seven stage filtration BS. That was the other thing to stall the process, the filtration. FUCK! I'm surprised there wasn't a riot. With only a handful of employees working the stations and about 150 people in line we could have easily taken over.		I'll never go to a music festival again.

Market forces dictate that when the number of suppliers is limited (such as through permits/licensing or just plain resource availability), the price will rise.  		I get all that.  		Why do we feel the need to gouge on water, of all things?  At many places, it's forbidden to bring in containers with outside liquids.  Can't we allow water, at least?  Would it be such a burden to allow clear containers of water?		I know, I know, people will sneak vodka in and claim it's water.  People already do that.
