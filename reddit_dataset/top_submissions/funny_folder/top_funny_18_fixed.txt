That's why they don't hire immature kids and they fire anyone who slips through.  I saw multiple accidental releases in my time working there, and I also saw justified releases by the same people.  The ride is designed to be safe.

No, it doesn't.  I did not meet a single person while working there that would ever put their own pride above safety.  I have, however, seen people get fired if they violated safety protocols.

{"body":"When he has reached the "bottom" (v=0), the bungee will have been stretched to its maximum, and it will have all the potential energy as elastic potential.  You are missing the term for elastic potential 1/2 k x^2		If the bungee is tied to the railing, his potential will be transferred to the bungee.  The bungee will accelerate him upwards and he will eventually reach the top of the first bounce (lower than the jump platform), elastic potential turned into gravity potential.  Repeat.		One term that is missing is the "at rest" length.  Given the range 25m-50m, assume length=25m, drop=50m, so displacement=25m.		PE(person) = PE(bungee)	m g h = 1/2 k x^2	70 * 9.8 * 50 = 1/2 k 25^2	k = 109.76		Maximum spring force will be at maximum displacement: F = k x = 109.76 * 25 = 2744N.	Precisely matching counterbalance: 2744N / 9.8ms^-2 = 280 kg		Assuming a person can pull 50 pounds on a rope (222N, 22.68kg), it would take 12.36 people to exert 2744N (280kg) of force.		I think you are trying to determine the mass of a counterweight that would be lifted 1m (at most) during the bounce.		Take the 280kg and reduce it by (suppose) 1kg.  For most of the drop, the force will be less than 279kg on the counterweight, so it will stay on the ground.  At F = 279 * 9.8 = 109.76 x, or x = 24.91m, it will start to lift the counterweight, but the spring will already have (say) 99% of its potential energy already absorbed.  From that point, the mass will accelerate upwards.  [Ignoring: the moving mass changes the length of the spring]  The problem now is that the mass will continue to be accelerated upwards, so long as the force is greater than its weight.  The force will be greater as long as the bungee is x >= 24.91m.  So, once the jumper reaches the bottom (of a cycle), the mass will still be accelerating upwards and will only stop accelerating upwards until x = 24.91m, then it will decelerate (F - mg < 0) until it reaches Y m, where is has maximum potential and zero kinetic energy.  Then it will fall Ym to the ground.  Find m such that Y=1m.		Short counter-example: you are assuming that the counterweight has all potential energy and no kinetic energy when jumper is at v=0.  However, at v=0, the counterweight must have started moving upwards at some earlier time.  Since the spring force steadily increases (until v=0), the force of acceleration has only increased from the point the weight started moving, so its velocity > 0, and KE > 0.","depth":5,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"justin473","name":"t1_cqtniaf","parent_id":"t1_cqtlpge","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1430386038,"created_utc":1430382438}

This means that initially the counterweight is static, because force is not sufficient to overcome the static coefficient of friction. This energy is completely lost as heat, but you're factoring the whole thing in at a dynamic friction coefficient of 0.7.		Most likely, with 21 people, the force would *never* become sufficient to begin moving them forward.

When the guy comes back up from the bottom we see that he only gets about half way up, meaning he lost about half his potential energy to drag and rope friction, ~10,000J.

I'm not minimizing the challenge here, but at the same time I think many people are overestimating how hard it is. I am not particularly strong, in fact I'm a bit of a wimp.

Since the job was quite boring, you would challenge yourself to move multiple boxes at a time, and I could actually move up to 3 boxes at once.		The trick is having the load balanced and picking it up and sitting it down at waste level. Most people can easily move a load well above their body weight if they use the right techniques-- an actual weight lifter can probably do well over that with the right technique.  		While the challenge in this case is different, the solution is similar-- as long as you are properly braced against the load and you have a good grip on the rope, I have little doubt that most people could handle a 50kilo load falling 20M, and with a bungee cord that would be even easier.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SomeRandomMax","name":"t1_cqto117","parent_id":"t1_cqtmv2k","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1430388397,"created_utc":1430384797}
{"body":"Honestly, I don't think you really understand the forces involved here.		You can move those 3 boxes at once because you brace yourself and slowly lift them off the ground, you're never carrying *more* than 50 kilograms of actual force and you're slowly accelerating it, not rapidly decelerating it.  If someone dropped them off a 2 story building into your arms?  Not a chance you could catch them.  Drop them from a 20 meter height and they'd probably kill you.		F = MA.  The force of 50kg at rest is exactly that, 50 kilograms (the mass multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, ~9.8 m/s) or ~490 newtons. 		Travelling at 10 m/s (36kmh)?  The speed the average dense/heavy object is going to reach after falling for not much more than a second?  That instantaneous force is going to be over 100 kilograms, more than double.  Yes, elasticity will reduce this force and you'll also have some amount of shock absorption in your body, but you're trying to handle more than double the force or weight.		A bungee cord 20 meters long?  That 50 kilograms is going to be getting closer to 150 kilograms, elasticity will help, but it's not going to make you almost 3 times stronger than you usually are.  Even then *if* you were able to *lift* 150 kilograms, unless you weight *at least* 150 kilograms or close to it you're not going to actually be able to hold that weight, it's going to lift you off the ground or pull you over.		Hold a 50 kilogram box and then jump off a small step, maybe a meter, can you still support it's weight?  I doubt it.  Try jumping off something 5 meters tall, let alone 20 meters.		Your legs can support your weight with ease, you stand up every day.  Jump off a 20 meter height?

{"body":"That's not the same at all. There's nothing in a truck that "absorbs" the shock, and the energy  transfered is much greater. Incidentally this is why until we developed dynamic(stretchy) ropes, a leader in climbing could not fall. Even if the rope held, they were likely to break their back from the sudden impact. Modern ropes stretch and do not apply the full force instantaneously. While climbing gear can take shocks of 25 kilonewtons the human body cannot.		In rock climbing we regularly "catch" people falling several meters at a time, but the main issue we have is with friction, which is why we use belay devices(which basically just create a lot of friction)		The problem isn't having the strength to hold 150kg, which a lot of people that have worked out can do. The problem is in creating enough friction on a skinny rope to do it. With limited surface area on the rope they would probably not be able to generate enough and if it slips even a little they will get rope burn and likely just let go. And this of course assumes an anchor(otherwise the puller is just going to get pulled off the edge).		In summary, I wouldn't trust the strongest man in the world to hold me even on a bungee cord.

WELL, my dumb ass sits down cause its hot and I'm pretty tired at this point in the day and I had never ridden that ride until then. So the seat locks in place with my weight on it so when I stood up as they announced the ride will be launching I had nothing really holding me in place besides my shoulders and my legs pushing me up as hard as I can during the whole ride and my mid section swaying freely through all the flips and sharp turns. Here's a picture of how the seat looks to paint a visual, http://www.thecoasterguy.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/riddlers/sfmm_riddlers_03.jpg now I know there's a belt strap in the middle, but if memory serves me right I don't think there used to be one in the front there.

The last time (for obvious reasons I'm about to explain) we didn't feel... quite as secure, as we were slowly going up and reaching the top, I checked the metal bar as we neared the top.	Nope, it wasn't as secure as we thought, neither of us screamed, all I know is I grit my teeth so hard my jaw was stiff for the rest of the day after.	We got thrown around and sliding to either side of the cart, we definitely held on for dear life.  	We get to the end of the track, it pulls in to the boarding area and as soon as it stopped, we both swore so much I think we may have invented a few new words in the English language.		We explained what happened after we calmed down and nobody even checked the cart, nobody said anything or did anything, they just looked at us and carried on, it was as if we were both dead and didn't realise.	  	The rollercoaster is still going (luckily with no deaths as far as I've heard) we made a complaint but again, as far as we can tell nobody did anything, it was still in operation throughout the day, we stood and watched outside as more people got in and went up, several times we expected people to fall out.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SirJackGG","name":"t1_cqtob8x","parent_id":"t3_34d3f2","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1430389739,"created_utc":1430386139}
