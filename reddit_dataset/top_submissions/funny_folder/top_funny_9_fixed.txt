{"body":"My degree is in molecular biology, not physics so I can't elaborate or explain as a physicist could. So basically there's a fundamental flaw in modern physics. Newtonian physics cannot account for certain things we've learned happen at the atomic and subatomic level and with things like black holes in astrophysics. Quantum Mechanics begins to explain the discrepancies but the deeper you get into it, the more conjectural it becomes because we don't have the data to explain certain phenomenon we encounter at the quantum level (ie how it took decades to find the existence of the Higgs Boson despite theoretical proof something like it had to exist for a long time). 		There is a need for a grand unified theory of physics that is able to unify Newtonian physics with quantum mechanics into a coherent set of principles rather than existing models where we have one that works to explain things at one level of matter and the other to explain things at a different level that we don't quite understand fully. 		The quantum data from the black hole lets Murphy rectify this conflict and create the grand unified theory where Professor Brandt couldn't and likely didn't want to because of Plan B. This data then let the station they were building that was to be Plan A leave Earth's gravity and enter space. 		The stations that were built subsequently simply orbit in our solar system, probably at various points throughout so we can gather natural resources from various moons and asteroids. Remember there's more than one, which they elude to with how Murphy Cooper demanded to be brought to see her father and despite the old age they let her travel from her station because she is who she is and always was indomitable. 		The design of Cooper Station (and probably all the others) is common in science fiction because it simultaneously provides artificial gravity via the rotational axis and space to live/produce food in an efficient use of space (seen in more detail in Elysium or Mass Effect's Citadel). 		Humanity didn't die in the interim because they moved into the stations and built more to work as permanent colonies. The blight wasn't in the crops but rather something that was feeding off of the nitrogen in the atmosphere (and probably reducing the nitrogen available for nitrogen fixing bacteria and artificial fertilizer production that allow for plants to grow and for life as we know it to exist). Once they left Earth it ceased to matter because the blight was limited to Earth. 		TLDR Quantum data answers a central question of modern physics that enables the space stations to be built and function as colonies in our Solar System. Humanity survives in them, leaving the blight behind on Earth.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"foreveracubone","name":"t1_cnk2699","parent_id":"t1_cnjxwvu","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1420850617,"created_utc":1420850617}

I only made it through making snide remarks with my sister about every other scene.		The whole movie was just hot garbage, fucking Transformers 4 was a more enjoyable experience (if only for Optimus and the dinosaurs in Hong Kong and over the top product placement) that I had to sit through twice. The weird unibrow guy is Jar Jar levels of cringe. Every Legolas fight scene had me laughing at how stupid and needlessly over the top it was. I just stopped caring entirely when the Eagles came and dropped a fucking bear into the Orc army and played on my phone until the end.

{"body":"I felt the barrel scene was one of those ridiculously over the top action scenes that added absolutely nothing to the movie, except for flippy elves. Take that comment with the knowledge that I dig the flippy elf combat style, these movies just took it to eleven and kept it there.  		My explanation of that is Legolas in the original trilogy.  He was fluid, graceful, dangerous, but at least he moved and acted like a creature made of meat.  The "beyond human comprehension" levels of grace only happened once (the mammoth scene ... and to a lesser extent the shield surfing thing), and otherwise it was always kind of there but not glaring ... kind of like Tolkien style magic.  My favorite example of this is him walking on top of the snow while the rest trudged through.  Its in its own way just as unbelievable but it was understated and made for a good and unique character ... at least to me.  		In the new movies every scene with him was just triple inverted back somersaults while shooting a bow.  They also set up the dumb love angle while also trying to make Tamriel a badass strong female character ... and then Legolas has to jump in and save her anyway.  I think the love triangle should have ended with her pushing them both off the cliff and if I ever do my own cut of the three thatll be how that ark concludes.  Just Kili sacrificing himself trying to rescue her, the ork coming in for the kill, and her doing what it took to make the orc die, no avenging legolas.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DegeneratePaladin","name":"t1_cnl436s","parent_id":"t1_cnl3qic","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1420944948,"created_utc":1420944948}

{"body":"The most tragic aspect of George to me was that in a lot of ways he knew how to escape the hell he'd made for himself. The episode where he decided to do the opposite of his normal inclinations brought him more success in 24 minutes than he'd have in the entire rest of the series. 		His life was based on trying to chase an image, to create a facade of the people he saw at the top. But he was chasing image and not reality. The people in higher socioeconomic positions to himself were often both very honest and very eccentric. Basically what George himself was in The Opposite. 		Would he have found his idea of success if he'd kept up with that? It's debatable, but I think also not really the main point when considering it as allegory. To me the most important thing is that the message he received, that he saw, of those at the top was always a lie. They didn't reflect the professional image he occasionally tried to ape. They ranged from buffoons to madmen. He was trying to fit in by learning a language that they didn't actually speak. When in the end he could have been more successful in at least some aspects of life by accepting who he was, and being open about it.","depth":4,"score":31,"ups":31,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WaitingForGobots","name":"t1_cnk01c5","parent_id":"t1_cnjyqh4","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1420846515,"created_utc":1420846515}

Then someone found a pair of gloves lying around, and by some intricate use of double-sided tape, we managed to affix those to the sleeves AND his keyboard.  I had a small foam ball lying around, so we printed a copy of his employee ID picture in bigger format, cut out his face and stuck to the ball, then put the ball on the tube from a toilet paper roll and stuck that on top of the chair.  We then topped it off with a cap.		The guy sitting in the next cubicle SAW us do it, but I swear that he spent at least fifteen minutes every day talking to the dummy until the guy came back.
