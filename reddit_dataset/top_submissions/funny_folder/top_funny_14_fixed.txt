A more stringent pleading process would help reduce frivolous cases at the expense of widespread access to the legal system.

So the idea is the U.S. has a relatively low bar for making a claim and then incentivizes settlements to prevent the courts from being over flooded with more cases than it can handle while also offering some sort of relief to potentially legitimate claims and avoiding the even more costly discovery process.

{"body":"You mentioned this:		 > "Caution, this is hot!"		Which makes me think you are at least in part referring to McDonald's coffee. The reason they were sued and lost so astoundingly was because McDonald's coffee was *knowingly* served at such a hot temperature that if you were handed a cup and took a drink, you would hurt yourself. The warning of coffee being hot was not enough to absolve them of guilt. 		Additionally, there's a difference between an object or substance being dangerous, and how you house or store this object. 		Oily rags are not to be kept in open piles in your garage, even if you put a sign saying "please do not set on fire, highly inflammable." The reason is safety. 		This sign basically is an admission that there is danger. The duty of the land owner if he is aware of a danger is to make sure that people don't get hurt by it. 		Let's go step by step. Let's assume there's an alligator who eats everyone who comes in that is tied up just inside the property line. 		If there was no gate and no sign, would the owner be liable? 		If there was a gate but no sign, would the owner be liable?		If there was no gate but a sign, would the owner be liable?		If there was a rope or chain hanging across the entrance with a warning sign, would the owner be liable?		In each case, the property owner isn't really stopping people from getting in and thus is permitting a situation that a normal person would deem dangerous to arise. Not everyone reads English, not everyone reads. The fence in this particular picture is surely easy to climb over, so kids can easily just ignore the long rambling sign and skip it. 		In the end though, it's not about what's legal or not, it's about what is safe. If the guy is just bluffing and trying to scare people, he is really just opening himself to liability because someone can say "hey, I got hurt by X on this property" and blame it on him. If it's true that there's danger, he should make it harder for people to get hurt on whatever thing he's got there.		EDIT: Also, how many signs are there?

{"body":"The test for breach of duty in a negligence case is the reasonable person standard. However, generally there is no duty of care to trespassing individuals except to warn them of hidden artificial dangers, (especially if the trespassers are frequent/known or should be). So this would be like if you had a bunch of bear traps set on your property. Even still, while landowners generally do not have a duty to warn of open and obvious dangers, a duty may exist if the landowner can foresee danger from the conditions. So in the example of an alligator, danger would likely be foreseeable, and the reasonable person standard would apply with regard to breach. Different jurisdictions interpret this standard differently. 		One common way courts approach it (and I'm simplifying this) is to apply a cost-benefit analysis, in which a reasonable person is expected to take cost justified precautions (costs of precautions are less than the probability of a harm multiplied by the loss if it occurs).  So under this test you'd have to look at multiple different factors to determine what is reasonable with regard to an alligator (looking at custom, case precedent, previous incidents, etc.). 		Another distinction worth noting is that if this alligator is a pet and not a wild animal that just happens to be on your land then it would not be a negligence issue, but rather strict liability. Which pretty much means if something bad happens, you're going to be liable no matter what. The logic is that we want to disincentives people from owning dangerous animals that the society views as less than preferable. 		In both cases, there are also affirmative defenses that can be raised by the land owner who puts up a very clear and visible sign that accurately indicates the danger. Namely, assumption of the risk if the harmed individual knew of the danger and voluntarily engaged it anyway.		But with that said, all this stuff has very jurisdiction specific aspects to it, and as always it's best to consult with a lawyer if you think something's going to potentially be an issue.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"wiifan55","name":"t1_cjydb2y","parent_id":"t1_cjy9qu3","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1408811444,"created_utc":1408807844}

{"body":"IANAL, but from what I've read about similar situations, there is an expectation of a certain amount of due diligence in preventing people from getting onto your property if there is something on it that could be dangerous, be that an animal, a swimming pool, etc. Locked gates, difficult to scale walls or fences, and signs warning of danger / not to trespass are some of the basics that need to be taken.		If you have a tall brick wall, locked metal gates, signs saying not to trespass, and an open swimming pool within all of that and little Timmy decides to bring a ladder over so they can climb the wall and then drowns in your pool, you likely have a pretty damn good defense. If little Susie waltzes in through the gate you forgot to lock up and drowns, you might be held liable for her death.		If you have freaking gators on your property, the amount of effort you need to put in is likely higher, although I'd assume that if you live in a really rural area (doubt you have gators on your land in the suburbs... though I'm sure it's happened) you might be able to argue it's less likely a random neighbor is gonna wander onto your property, allowing you to have less precautions in place... I mean, if you own hundreds of acres and the gators are a mile away from the entrance, I'm not sure what would be expected of you... something like OP's picture?

The simple fact is that a sign that says "not liable for ____" doesn't change whether someone is liable for whatever you fill in the blank with, despite how much people wish they could create dangerous situations and then just tell everyone that it's not their fault if someone gets hurt.

{"body":"the "for some retarded reason" is an overarching public safety concern trumping an individual's right to ignore or unsafely maintain potential hazards on their property.  Children have a diminished capacity to understand their surroundings and the dangers involved, and so we take it upon ourselves as adults to understand said hazards for them.  It doesn't mean that you will be infinitely liable, but yes part of the "burden" of having a swimming pool is that you have to make sure you lock it up and keep it safe.  That's a consideration to make before you purchase one.  		Reddit is a funny place because you see countless instances of support for liberal or even socialist policies people support without question, but when it comes to the legal field, the entire community is so atypically anti-litigation compared to the other beliefs that it's hard to imagine any other reason than lack of understanding and/or being taken advantage of by lots of TV/mass media hyperbole and misinformation.  It's pretty sad since the anti-lawyer sentiment is really only against the lawyers that would be HELPING someone who is injured.  		Not to mention insurance is generally the target in these situations.  The reason you see "people" getting sued is because of state laws (often mirroring federal laws) that prevent the disclosure of the presence or amount of insurance, so you have to sue the individual whose policy you're targeting.  It boils down to a contractual obligation.  That's the entire reason we HAVE insurance.  That's another one reddit forgets all the time.		The problem many people seem to have (especially on this site) is assuming that every instance of liability or litigation ends with someone spending thousands of dollars and/or getting their entire lives ruined.  That isn't true at all.  Cases get filed, some settle, some don't, some get tried, others get thrown out.  Without knowing every fact and detail about a case, and about how the law applies to it, making snap judgments about "HOW STUFF SHOULD BE" is an uninformed and dangerous opinion that serves to limit remedies for those that are hurt through no fault of their own, and supports the very same BIG BUSINESS that reddit seems so quick to oppose in ANY other context.","depth":2,"score":21,"ups":21,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"birdcool","name":"t1_cjy9deu","parent_id":"t1_cjy7rpc","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1408796551,"created_utc":1408792951}

When other people's children drown in your swimming pool, OTHER PEOPLE have taken it upon themselves as adults to understand hazards and explain it to their children, as well as protect them from dangerous situations.		As far as I'm concerned, my own life decisions (wanting to swim in my yard) should not be impacted by the parents' life decisions (not looking after their children). If a fence is there and there is a sign warning others to keep out, then the entire situation (from a moral standpoint) becomes the responsibility of the parents to explain to their children how drowning is bad, how respect for other people's property works and how to be a decent human being.

Even where many people may not agree with it, it's based upon some logic that, explained properly, would at least make sense.  Does that mean all laws are good laws? Not really.		In this situation, though, one thing to keep in mind is that in your hypothetical, putting a cover on a pool that is fenced in with a sign is probably enough to defeat a claim against you.  Just because someone sues you doesn't mean they'll win.  And there's not even always a cost to defend.  Like I said at the outset, the consideration is weighing the benefits of enjoying a pool vs. the dangers that a child who doesn't know better may be injured if it's not properly secured.  		Post-tort reform, things are generally stacked against you as a plaintiff.  The public perception of the legal landscape is sort of stuck in the 80s because of what I mentioned before--a concerted effort in making every claim seem as frivolous as possible.  Also remember that many times articles are written by journalists who may not be getting the full details of a case, or they might not understand it and could overlook crucial details that matter within the litigation strategy.

If someone gets hurt they need to show that there was a breach of that duty and some injury or loss as a result.  Part of any negligence discussion should also include contributory/comparative negligence which factors in the injured party's own "culpability" in the events leading to their injury.  The issue of whether a minor can be held to be contributorily negligent is something courts have grappled with.  		To sort of address this from another, less complicated angle, you DO see plenty of instances of a family member "suing another."  I put that in quotes because like I alluded to before, they're really just making an insurance claim, but federal and state rules usually prevent the disclosure of the insurance information, so the named defendant will be the alleged negligent person.  These are examples of cases where people who aren't familiar with how the process works tend to point to "frivolous lawsuits" and condemn the legal process, when it's really just acting to resolve contract disputes.  So in effect yeah, you could have a situation where you sue your own family member for an insurance claim.

{"body":"In English law if you were to trespass you are still owed a duty of care under the occupiers liability act 1984 (as opposed to the 57 act which delas with the duty owed to lawful visitors)		A duty is still owed to another (i.e not a lawful visitor) for dangers the occcupier knew or ought to know about and that the he knew or has reasonable grounds to believe that a trespasser may come into the vicinity of the danger to keep the them reasonably safe. The test is one of reasonable practicality though and defences are available including providing adequate warning of the danger or taking steps to discourage  persons incurring the risk and no duty is owed in respect of risks willingly accepted by the trespasser. So yes in reality the sign should provide the basis for a defence to any litigation although in English law you cannot deliberately set a trap for a trespasser, such that if you deliberately put glass or razors on the  top of a wall to deliberately injure someone trying to climb into your property you will be liable for that deliberate injury.		Generally speaking though in English law you cannot contract out of your own negligence. So 'disclaimer' signs in car parks simply stating that the supermarket accept no liability for damage done are meaningless. If  their employee rams a trolley into your car they are still vicariously liable regardless of any sign they have erected.

{"body":"I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this?		If your referring to disclaimers/waivers they're generally meaningless. You cant contract out of your own negligence in English law. 	The duty of care owed to trespassers is limited and courts regularly accept a volenti defence where someone has clearly accepted the risk even if they were a lawful visitor in the first instance. eg in Tomilnson v cheshire & Congleton council (HoL) a visitor to a park ignoring a do not swim/dive sign in a pond, diving in and sustaining a spinal injury. In these circumstances the C moved from being a lawful visitor to the park to being a trespasser in the lake and whilst he was owed a duty under the 84 act the volenti defence was accepted by the HoL and the claim failed entirley. Warning signs of this type dont seek to preclude or exclude liability but are suffiicient to discharge the duty of care.		There was a similar case arising from the union rooms weatherspoons in Newcastle.
