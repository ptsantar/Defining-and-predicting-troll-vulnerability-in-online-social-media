{"body":"Huh, sounds like some shit my heroin addict cousin would do; except her delusional parents fuel the problem by saying it's not her fault. My relatives were living in my grandmother's home for a while, they claimed it was only going to be 2 months, and then 2 months turned into a year. Before my cousin moved in with my grandmother and her parents, she was living in a tent with her boyfriend, and being the good Samaritan my grandmother is, she let my cousin move in too. Well, as time went on, my cousin decided it was now her house and was inviting random people into my grandmothers home at all hours of the night, even had her boyfriend sleep over and got caught. This shit did not sit well with my deeply christian and strongly conservative grandmother, and she decided she had enough of my cousins bullshit. In the middle of this, her father (my uncle) came out and got in the middle of their argument and started yelling at my grandmother too. After all of this, my cousin, my aunt, and my uncle all hid in their rooms and refused to greet my grandmother in her own home, and even went as far as to lock the door behind her when she would go out for her mail, leaving her stuck outside until me or my mother would come over with our keys to her house, to let her in.		This was all during the first maybe 3-4 months of living there... shoot to the near end of this bullshit festival; My grandma is now on Xanax because the whole situation has stressed her the hell out and she absolutely refuses to take it because, and i quote, "I'm not some pill popper! I can handle it myself!" But, mysteriously, her pills began disappearing, only to be discovered that my shitty entitled cousin has been stealing her xanax pills and tried to blame my younger brother for it (to be fair, it was entirely plausible, he loves his pills, his acid, and his weed.) So this was the final straw, my grandma got up the courage and told them to basically get the fuck out of her house, and that was that.		Now another time lapse; cut to about two months after the move out. My grandmother had worked for Tiffany & Co. for a major part of her life, long enough to get some sort of offer where she got a really good deal on whatever she wanted in the store, so she treated herself and bought a 700 dollar pearl necklace. Well, magically after my shitty cousin left, so did the pearl necklace, ain't that some shit. Word got back to her mom who then decided to try and say it was me or my brothers who stole the necklace (okay.jpg.) Few weeks later, we find out she got popped by the cops for stealing methadone because she couldn't afford heroin, and her broke as fuck parents now paid money they didn't have to bail her scummy ass out of jail. My grandma still gets letters saying she's got a court date; which I'm sure she'll never go to. It got leaked from my grandma that she also used to watch her run outside to peoples cars, get in for 5 minutes, then hop back out and run inside. She apparently would do this at random times during the day and night. There's no saying for sure, but I can safely say that I am positive she was also dealing heroin/my grandma's stolen xanax from my grandma's own house.

The usual bar is 1 or 2mg if I remember correctly (can't remember, never was into benzos) 		White kid druggies have called Xanax "xanny", "bars" and "xanny bars" for a long time. There's also another popular benzo called Kolonopin that they call "kpins". 		"Barred out" is new black slang for doing Xanax (or other benzos, I'd imagine). To be fair, white druggies have called being fucked up on kpins being "pinned out" for a long time before that. 		Doing benzos was never big in black communities til very recently. It's all of a sudden gotten very popular to take benzos as a party drug in many black communities. Almost always with alcohol (which is fucking retarded and a death wish).

The change in influence and perception of this drug is obvious. 		Just like Molly. 		Kids who weren't already druggies or ravers did not know that term in 2006.

You could say that about literally every reddit conversation, that doesn't say anything about whether what **you** are saying is accurate. Even a reddit conversation about the popular slang in 1960's Harlem would be dominated by 20 year old middle class white dudes.		Yes, black people have popularized lots and lots of terms, but their use of a term is not a magical catalyst that causes a term to transcend a certain level of popularity. If a term has been used by *decades* by a group of white people, black people are not required to make it popular.		What has happened, however, is an increase in heroin (and pharmaceutical opiate) use, which is directly connected to benzo use. This increase is largely among *white youths*, but it does also mean that other groups will be affected.

Also not new, as I mentioned before. White druggies have called them bars for at least two decades. 		That said, the relatively recent burst in use of benzos among Black people as a party drug and their subsequent use of the term in social media had spurred the *popularization* of the term among hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young suburbanites who would have never heard of or used the term themselves. 		Bars are waaaaaay more common and popular now. It used to be only hardcore druggie kids used them recreationally. Now a lot of white bread suburbanite kids will do them on a Friday night like they would drink beer or smoke weed. 		In my opinion, I think we'll see a benzo crisis among teens and young adults in middle America in about 5ish years in the way we got an opiate crisis peaking in like 2012.

Benzos are kinda like opiates in that there are multiple synthetic kinds of varying strength.

They both give a sense of well being and I-dont-give-a-fuckness but opiates give a far more intense and obvious feeling of pleasure and euphoria. 		Xanax is one of the strongest. Kpins are strong too. Valium (diazapam) being a weak one. 		You feel loose, warm and woozy. You don't give a fuck about anything. It makes you out of it and kinda drunk feeling. 		It's honestly not that great of a high in my opinion. Opiates are leagues and leagues better because of the actual hardcore euphoria you feel. 		That said, benzos have become more and more popular among middle American kids because opiates have been cracked down on extremely hard, are expensive and everyone and their mom has some anxiety and depression disorder these days so there are mountains of easily accessible benzos.

But when you think of people who have a couple of martinis or a few glasses of wine or some beers - and have been doing so consistently for years it's a joke compared to the real alcoholism that involves people drinking a fucking handle of vodka A DAY. 		They have an alcohol habit or "routine." Either that or come up with a more drastic term than "alcohlism." "Morbid alcohlism"? It really isn't killing the casual drinker despite the regularity. It's a difference between being addicted to enjoying a buzz vs. numbing your mind to drown out sorrows or mental issues. Calling both "alcoholism" is frankly ridiculous when you know a real alcoholic. I would actually be offended if I had a family member who was a real alcoholic that drank themselves to death.		Please go watch "Rain in my Heart" the whole thing is on youtube. Watch the whole thing and you will immediately realize that calling a 4-5 beers a day person an alcoholic is a joke.

Eventually it'll fade up a bit like the Stealie did but they'll match in tone and color scheme really well. I'm going to have him progressively turn this into a half sleeve. 		I will say, getting to get stoned and watch king of the hill while you get quality work done is a pretty satisfying experience. It's not the most insane level of work but I also didn't pay much for it. I've seen much more intense work of his and my next piece is going to fit more into his grotesque and violent wheelhouse. I've had him tattooing "hippie"(translate: Grateful dead) stuff on me so far and he's great at it but it's not what he's doing on the reg.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"terrapincaboose","name":"t1_cqcwu4x","parent_id":"t1_cqcwrgz","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1429084530,"created_utc":1429080930}
