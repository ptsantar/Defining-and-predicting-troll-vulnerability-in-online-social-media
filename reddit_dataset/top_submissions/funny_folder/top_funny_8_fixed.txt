{"body":"My dad has a fear of them, but I wouldn't say it's irrational. The first month after he immigrated to America with my mother pregnant with me, he was robbed by a black man with a gun. Said black man was seen before in the area loitering around suspiciously. For someone who was trying to get used to a completely new country, language, and with a pregnant wife, this created a huge impact on him. Not to mention my parents started working at downtown LA later on and a large percentage of the blacks there didn''t leave a good impression on them either. It's not like my parents just hate every black person, but they're more wary of them due to a majority of their experiences. It's just like how people label Asians as bad drivers and should be watch out for while driving. While it's unfair to put that on the whole Asian race, I'm sure it stemmed from people largely having similar experiences on the road with Asian drivers and I even agree with said stereotype		Edit: I'm just here trying to make a simple point that my dad's fear is warranted due to particular experiences. Once I establish the fact that it's rational, people then start telling me that the rationality doesn't matter and that it's still wrong. Seriously people, get off your white horses and take off that white armor. A man was traumatized by such an incident where he thought his life was in serious danger, and following experiences throughout the years didn't help alleviate those feelings as he interacted more with said group. Now if you're going to still try to point out the fact that my father is in the wrong and that this is his fault for holding a racist view, I would like to see if all of you would hold the same views after going through the exact things my dad experienced and is still experiencing. Not only did he go through the mugging, shortly after were the LA riots. Not to mention that the man actually hung around in the area after he robbed my dad. I myself had a trauma with dogs when I was young since I was bit by the first dog I ever remember meeting, and since then I was traumatized by dogs and were deathly afraid of every dog I saw. I eventually overcame that fear as I grew up and was able to interact with more gentle and friendly dogs, but that wasn't the case for my dad. If most of the dogs I met thereafter the incident were aggressive and not friendly, I'd probably still hold that fear. Don't act as if you would never adhere to the same behavior if you were in the situation.

{"body":"You're correct that Republicans freed the slaves and wrote the content of the Civil Rights Act, but you're wrong about the rest of your reply.		**Every single segregationist in Congress was a Democrat.** Not a single Republican was a segregationist. **And these segregationist Democrats where quite liberal.** Harry Byrd, Robert Byrd, Allen Ellender, Albert Gore Sr., J. William Fulbright, Walter F. George, Russell Long and Richard Russell -- to name only a few of them!		These liberal Democrats supported segregation while they:		* opposed Joe McCarthy in the 50s,	* opposed the Vietnam War in the 60s,	* supported LBJ???s Great Society programs that expanded the welfare state to unseen proportions,	* and in the ???90s, they got 100 percent ratings from abortion-rights organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.		Republicans opposed these programs. They opposed them then, and they oppose them now. It wasn't until these segregationists died that the Republicans began to sweep the South, converting the majority pro-union labor Democrats to realize the progressive policies didn't work. It wasn't long after that jobs began to flow into the south.		It's hard to believe the South was so progressive because people like you have let progressive activists **rewrite history** when the facts are so easy to check.		While Reagan won the south in 1980 (among 44 other states), realize that he barely won! But those Democrats who were still in power never did support him or vote with him while the voter base continued to elect these Democrats but began to change their views.		**So the question is:** where are you getting your information because it doesn't back history at all? And it's so easy to check!		You really need to look at the policies of the Republican Party through the years because **you are absolutely confused** to think they are different from today's Republican Party platform. 		Part of your confusion -- besides thinking a reliable source of news is DailyKos or the Daily Show -- is that you've bought into the lie that progressive policies help the poor and minorities. But we're 50 years, half a century, into the Great Society. Black poverty remains identical to the time when the community lived under Jim Crow laws, also created by liberal Democrats. In the 1960s, blacks had an out-of-wedlock birth rate of 30 percent. Today's it's the inverse with 70 percent.		Where are the results?		Also, black unemployment remains twice that of whites. And crime rates that have never been seen before in history where black young men -- who've grown up without fathers in the home and comprise less than six percent of the population -- commit half of the nations' murders.		And third generation Hispanics are falling into the same progressive trap with broken families, high unemployment, and lowered incomes than the previous generation.		Where are the results?		For 50 years, we've followed progressive policies supported by segregationists with nothing to show for it. 		Maybe it's time for real change. Maybe it's time for minorities who vote 90 percent with Democrats -- and those who call themselves progressives and liberals -- to vote for the party that really does help minorities and support limited government and capitalism, with real proof of lifting up the poor in America and around the world.
