Obviously you need size limits on the container as well (which there are, for all containers/items [Section 1050.9 part g](http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm#restricted)), otherwise one person would be taking up way too much space.

The difference is that the severity of the bites draws attention away from this fact, so no-one really cares. The bully breeds are the most apt and potentially lethal fighters, but not the most frequent biters.  		Pitbulls -more so than many breeds- are highly trainable, and I speak from experience. Like any breed- get in there young, lead them, assert your dominance, set the tone, correct misbehaviour.		They are shitty accidents that don't need to happen when people are responsible about pet ownership. All dogs have the potential to bite -some more than others.

In the end, even a smaller dog can cause an injury to a kid. The variable between smaller dogs and pitbulls is the severity.		Where I take issue -and I suspect others do also- is the immediate assumption that the breed is inherently violent and aggressive. This simply isn't correct; they're more prone to it if left untrained is all. The *intent* to be aggressive or violent is not more present than with other breeds.  I can only speak based on anecdotal evidence, but I believe most dog owners do not bother training their dogs, and problems can arise in any breed as a result.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RochelleH","name":"t1_ckqlfzf","parent_id":"t1_ckqkalf","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1411507882,"created_utc":1411504282}

Yeah all those gun requirements sound like a bit of a pain, but we have some too.  We just have to pass a background check (make sure you aren't a convicted felon) which happens right when you buy the gun.  So any old person can pretty much walk into a Walmart and walk out with a shotgun, although there is an extra level of requirements for carrying a pistol or buying semi-auto stuff (AK, AR-15, etc), but it just takes longer to get approved, no doctor stuff.  I really like how it works in my state regarding storage, because our biggest thing is that you cannot allow a firearm to be accessible to a child.

{"body":">Something tells me you haven't ever been mugged on the street and had your ass beat, kicked in the head until you're pouring blood all over your shirt.		Too funny, more assumptions. As a white gay guy working with gang-affiliated youth and living in some of the worst areas of the US and several very dangerous cities in the world, I can promise you I've had my fair share. In fact, I have a TBI from the last time when two thugs kicked down my door and amused themselves by pistol whipping me repeatedly along with a few other fun tricks they knew. I've been mugged and jumped several times, what's your point? That I should be afraid? That I should demand more laws that no one will follow? 		I don't care about dog statistics, like I said I am not laughing at you about the dog, I'm laughing at your irrational fear. I would point out that all the talking you did about pits was related more to their owners than the dog, and am bemused that you would totally avoid a lone guy just because he's wearing colors. Being gang affiliated doesn't make you a bad person, in fact odds are that he's a pretty cool dude when he's alone. Also, if you're wanting to stay safe crossing and showing fear is not a great way to do so. Respect him, don't fear him. 		All the above is serious advice. I found the original comment funny but now I'm sad for you, which is why I'm bothering to reply. You don't need to be afraid! The world is awesome. Do you know how many people I've become friends with that admitted they were terrified of me at first and only talked to me because I approached them? Looks aren't a great way to judge people, I may look scary and so do others but we as people usually experience the exact same feelings, loneliness, nervousness, the need to be loved. Fear just keeps people apart and hiding from amazing experiences. Yeah, I've had my ass beat, I've nearly died several times, sometimes the experience is dangerous. But I don't let that make me afraid and neither should you. 		Do you want to reach life's end and think "I stayed safe"? Or think, "what a fuckin ride!"?

{"body":"Definitely not!  It's a killing machine. When those dogs turn on people like they often do...a grown man has trouble fending them off...much less a child. I don't like the idea of a wild animal bred to kill walking the street. 	 "Pit bulls and pit-bull crosses (not always easy to distinguish) have caused more than a third of the nation's dog-bite fatalities since 1979 and a comparable proportion of serious injuries."	"Today???s pit bull is a descendant of the original English bull-baiting dog???a dog that was bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head. When baiting large animals was outlawed in the 1800s, people turned instead to fighting their dogs against each other. These larger, slower bull-baiting dogs were crossed with smaller, quicker terriers to produce a more agile and athletic dog for fighting other dogs."  (Great...a more agile killer...)	"When a pit bull attacks, the injury inflicted may be catastrophic. First responders, such as police officers and firefighters, understand this as do members of the media, who are quick to report these attacks. Ongoing social tension also keeps pit bulls in the news. The pit bull problem is nearly 30-years old.8 In this time, most lawmakers have been "too afraid" to take breed-specific action to correct the problem. Due to this failure, horrific maulings continue to make headlines.	About half of all media reports regarding pit bulls involve police officers shooting dangerous pit bulls in the line of duty.  Since the late 1970's pit bulls have been used extensively in criminal operations for drug dealers, gang members and other violent offenders. The pit bull terrier is the breed of choice for criminals. This choice is directly linked to the pit bull's selectively bred traits of robust jaw strength, a deadly bite style, tenacity (gameness) and a high tolerance to pain."		"Depending upon the community in which you live and the ratio of pit bulls within it, yes and no. But whether a pit bull bites more or less than another dog breed is not the point. The issue is the acute damage a pit bull inflicts when it does choose to bite. The pit bull's "hold and shake" bite style causes severe bone and muscle damage, often inflicting permanent and disfiguring injury. Moreover, once a pit bull starts an attack, firearm intervention may be the only way to stop it.	When analyzing dog bite statistics, it is important to understand what constitutes a bite. A single bite -- recorded and used in dog bite statistics -- is a bite that "breaks the skin." One bite by a poodle that leaves two puncture wounds is recorded the same way as a pit bull mauling, which can constitute hundreds of puncture wounds and extensive soft tissue loss. Despite the "quagmire" of dog bite statistics, pit bulls are leading bite counts across U.S. cities and counties."
