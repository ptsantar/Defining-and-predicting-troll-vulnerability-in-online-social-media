{"body":">Your personal experience (and pure luck) mean nothing to those without degrees or certifications, so I emphasize again that degrees are essential to anyone reading this and considering IT.		You're dead wrong about this. It reveals a lack of understanding of probability, who that probability applies to, and what it takes to get a job.		I see this basic mistake all the time: someone will look at the correlation between degree and salary and come to an uninformed conclusion about the causation. Worse yet, they will take that correlation and try to apply it to me as if I must follow the average.		But let's look at my case and see if I'm where I'm at due to pure luck:	 	I grew up in a pretty smart family, my great grandfather had a mechanical engineering degree from Yale, my grandmother was the valedictorian of her class, and my sister was the valedictorian of her class. I consistently scored in the top 1 or 2 percent nationally and was in gifted classes (with my sister) from second grade up through 12th grade. My sister and I both scored very well on IQ tests, in the mid 130s/low 140s. My brother, who is much younger, also is near the top of his class and is going for his Phd. 		I played with the Commodore 64 and was into the BBS scene in middle school and used to do basic IT work for businesses with my friend while in high school. By the time I dropped out of college I already had about 10 years of IT experience. 		After high school my sister went to college, got her degree, and married a wealthy guy. I was hired by a motherboard manufacturer, worked there for a couple of years and then began working with the same friend who was now a manager at IBM. The chance of me getting the job at IBM was 100%- no chance involved. The hiring manager already knew me. 		Now I still work in IT at a datacenter as a senior systems engineer and make a good living. While you may say that I'm "lucky", I make about what other members of my family do. In fact, I'm quite average for my family.		TL:DR- Let me put it in simpler terms:		Let's say that everyone in this thread had a footrace and I said I was going to win. We hold this giant race with 1,000 people and I win. You boldly claim that it's pure luck because the overall probability of me winning is minute. My chances should be a tenth of a percent. So we hold the race again and I win again. And again. Finally in Scooby Doo fashion I take my mask off and I'm Usain Bolt. At that point you realize that the overall probability didn't really apply to me because you know my background. You know Usain Bolt is the fastest man in the world and it's not surprising at all that he won those races. 		Now I'm not claiming to be the Usain Bolt of the IT world but I am illustrating a point that it shouldn't be surprising that a person is able to hover around his own potential.","depth":8,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_crx10sz","parent_id":"t1_crx07ce","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1433550788,"created_utc":1433547188}

{"body":"> There are plenty of real reputable schools online		But online degrees in general don't get much respect with regards to college. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with getting your degree online, but generally speaking if you end up in a position of authority in any field and you say or do something people don't like they'll likely bash you for your online degree. I've seen this happen many times. You also have a much higher chance of getting scammed by doing college online. Basically, do it at your own risk.		Doing high school online like this on the other hand is fine because many people do it and college diplomas matter more than high school diplomas, even though an undergrad diploma is really just a "let-me-into-the-workforce" ticket.

{"body":"A quick rant:		It is important to realize this: The Postal Service doesn't receive government funding and is a business. However, it is still controlled by Congress, which doesn't allow them to act like a business. The USPS is still a public service and mandated service that is essentially subsidized because people need it and a private company might charge you more because where you live for example. It costs roughly $200-350 for every stop per year. But the USPS also provides a critical service in creating 600,000 good paying union jobs in the United States that people make a living on unlike the only larger employer....Walmart.		Then the whole issue is people complaining. Forcing a system like Cluster Boxes, would increase efficiency,save money, and improve security of the mail. But people are too lazy to walk down the street or stop quickly their neighborhood despite the Post Office not legally being required to deliver mail to the door....Especially in cities. Eliminating Saturday home mail delivery makes some sense(excluding packages,Express...etc) considering Saturday is not a business day. But every old person thinks that means their social security check or magazine will be delayed forever. Maybe expand their services to finances,e-documents, and preventing internet fraud...through e-mail perhaps. They can fix the stupid issue of pre-funding retirement benefits and become profitable overnight anyways		My dad has been a Postmaster for 15 years and I worked at there briefly while attending law school at night so I am biased.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BigCommieMachine","name":"t1_crx9bod","parent_id":"t1_crx62u1","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1433569114,"created_utc":1433565514}
