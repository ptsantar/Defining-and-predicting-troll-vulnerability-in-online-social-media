{"body":"This gave me a pretty morbid flashback to my childhood. My family was going for a picnic with our new dog. I was in the 4th grade and our puppy was pretty small, maybe a few months old. We all piled into the car and I had the dog in the back seat with my brother and me. We were sort of all in a rush and I didn't realize the leash was hanging out of the door when I closed it. The puppy was going nuts and got my legs all wrapped up in the leash inside the car. 		As my dad turned the corner, the end of the leash went under the back tire. The force of this must have been pretty crazy because it pulled the leash really hard. My leg slammed against the inside of the door. And broke instantly. I started screaming and of course no one knows what's happening. Dad stops the car and runs around. He sees the leash and immediately opens the door and starts trying to access the situation. 		The take me to the hospital where we're told my leg is broken in a few places. We explain what happened and suddenly I'm separated from my parents and being asked if I'm safe at home etc. I'm confused, but the gist is they didn't believe the story because it's so weird. My dad drove home, got the leash and brought it back to show it has crazy tire burn on it. They realize it's true and say it's sort of lucky it was my leg because other wise it would have been the dog's neck. FML. 		Anyhow, since that day I've been too paranoid to use anything but retractable leashes. I'm also massively paranoid about making sure nothing is ever left hanging out of car doors. I spent most of 4th grade in a series of casts starting with a full leg, then an up to the knee and it was awful. I didn't get to go trick or treating that year...		Anyhow, sorry for the long ass story, but I just wanted to say your dogs are smarter than 4th grade me.","depth":1,"score":169,"ups":169,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Marsandtherealgirl","name":"t1_cof068d","parent_id":"t1_coeyryk","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1423409356,"created_utc":1423409356}

When I grew up and got my own dog, I was hyper cautious and I only used retractable leashes. 		Sadly, the reason I couldn't go trick or treating was that Ohio had a freak snow/sleet storm that year (1994, if I recall) and I wasn't allowed to get my cast wet.

Anyway, he somehow managed to get on top of a cabinet, jump over a pipe a couple times and got his leash caught on it. Then a tried to jump from down from the cabinet. He hung himself and wasn't able to get back on top of the cabinet. So when I found him he was dead, hanging from the pipe on the ceiling. I got him down and wrapped him in a towel. Then I noticed he had bloody paws from where he had ripped out his claws on the wall trying to get back up.	My mom beat herself up a lot over that, being the one who forgot to take his leash off.

{"body":"It's wonderful that you're planning to get a rescue dog as a gift. However as someone who has adopted multiple shelter dogs, I strongly recommend that you surprise her with a a dog leash and big card announcing you're taking her to the shelter to pick out a dog. 		Why? Because most dogs past the puppy stage are particular about who they easily bond with. 		Plus, their personality and how compatible it is with its owner is much more important than how the dog looks. Before we adopt, my husband and I always request to spend at least 20 minute playing with the dog alone, ideally walking it around the block. (We leave an ID for collateral so they know we aren't going to steal the dog.) 		We try out multiple wonderful dogs before we find the one who seems to like us best (perhaps it's a pheromone thing? Or a memory of someone similar?) and has a temperment we enjoy. It's hard turning down perfectly good dogs in order to find the right one, but it's better to do that than to pick a dog that isn't as compatible.		We chose one of our dogs because when we went to an adoption event, it was sitting alone petrified, refusing to look at anyone or react to anyone trying to play with it. My husband sat down next to it and it immediately ran over and jumped in his lap. To this day, even though the dog loves me too, it's clear that his favorite person in the world is my husband.		So that said, unless you're getting your wife a puppy (much more mentally flexible in terms of bonding), I suggest you take her with you so her future dog can pick her as much as she picks it.","depth":4,"score":84,"ups":84,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eonaxon","name":"t1_cof2uux","parent_id":"t1_coezmdc","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1423415537,"created_utc":1423415537}

Imagine yourself in this situation - you're in the kitchen, about to cook your weekly stew. You chop all the ingredients up, put them in the pot etc. Now comes the time to stir it. "Fuck, where's the big ass wooden spoon. I swear I put it back last time." You start looking for it, but instead you just become more and more frustrated. And then you feel it. Something is poking your thigh. You turn around, and see the face of your furry friend, with the wooden spoon in its mouth, just kinda smiling at you. (true story, happened to me a few months back)  	Now the important question is - did you accidentally misplace the spoon and forgot about it, or is the dog so smart, that it hid the spoon and then brought it back in hopes of getting a treat.
