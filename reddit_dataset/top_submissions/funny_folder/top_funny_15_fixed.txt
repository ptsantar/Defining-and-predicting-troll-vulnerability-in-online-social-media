{"body":"Tbh I was joking.		I love my job. Yeah I work in a school which is more "human" as an environment than private sector, but still.		The way I think of it is this: If they didn't need help, I wouldn't have a job. If you find people who know less than you frustrating, IT *SUPPORT* is an awful job choice. Yeah, you do get some stupid requests which the person could well have done themselves, but it's about having sympathy for people, not just computers, and realising that most of the time that isn't really the case. And when it is, it's quite probably because they weren't focusing on the issue because they have their own job to worry about, which is stressful, just like mine. A little sympathy helps give people the confidence to try themselves rather than living in fear of looking stupid to the judgemental IT folks. I think waaaaaay too many people go in to IT support jobs because they like IT, whilst completely forgetting that they're not just there to play with computers, but *to support people.*","depth":8,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePegasi","name":"t1_comhp6n","parent_id":"t1_comhlr0","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1424039975,"created_utc":1424039975}

{"body":"They're not big words for that, because that's not what I'm saying. In turn, you're trying to sound smart through simplicity, but instead just missing the point. It's pretty hard to take someone super seriously when they use the "big words" excuse to boil shit down to childish simplicity, rather than actually trying to think about why someone's used one word over another.		I'm someone who friends and family will ask precisely that kind of "typical computer question", but also work educational IT support, where all you'll ever hear is how shit kids make your job, and how tech illiterate the staff are. Yeah, the answers to those questions are simple in isolation. But first off, my experience of "typical computer question" is more than just a one off piece of information which it's easy to remember in principle. And of those typical questions, I am definitively more likely to have to answer those questions the older the user is. This is a huge part of my life, it's not hard to spot people hamming it up to support cynicism, I see it with the grumpy fuckers in my job every day.		But just for the sake of argument, even those questions have their root. We're ultimately animals, and the best way to deal with people is to remember that in pretty much anything you do. How we approach any given exercise is defined by a ton of aspects of who and how we are. Plenty of people find computers intimidating, simply because they struggle with these basic interface models which other people seem to have zero trouble with. Basic concepts like what a "setting" is, or even the simple difference between the bookmarks bar and the bookmarks folder, and how you use each on different browsers that users often encounter for one reason or another. And when you first started experiencing computers at, say, 5-10 then you have this thing put in front of you when your brain is wired to be taking everything in and constructing models for it. Very young children pick up UI's surprisingly quickly, especially now with touch, but even with more traditional input and display.		Obviously this isn't a definitive constraint, and that's why I called it associative. Because there's an *association* between familiarity/comfort with common computing models and how much exposure you've had/how early it was. It's even looser because age doesn't definitively guarantee a certain level of exposure, but it's still definitely a factor.		>For the typical computer question, age-related learning differences play little???if any???role.		You may understand computers, but you clearly understand sweet fuck all about how the mind and development work, and how this affects everything right down to the simple, every day tasks. It may not always be directly related, and there is also the huge aspect of people who *just don't listen.* Wouldn't deny that for a second. But age and level of early/continued exposure to computers does play a role in how people think about them, how confident they are, how the process information, and therefore how competant they are. "little - if any - role" is just outright incorrect, and if that's where being concise is getting you then I think I'll pass.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePegasi","name":"t1_commtmc","parent_id":"t1_comlx9s","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1424050471,"created_utc":1424050471}

{"body":"It's associative, not fundamentally in-line. There is a dominant trend of younger people being *more* tech literate simply due to earlier immersion. Young people aren't universally tech literate, nor are older generations universally tech illiterate. But it's definitely an observable shift in overall tech literacy.		Importantly, younger generations don't even necessarily *understand* the workings of what they're doing. I work IT in a school and I often get comments along the lines of "I bet most of the students know more than you, eh?" No, I'm afraid not. They understand as much as they need to, to get by day to day, because that's how humans work in any context. We are, like all animals, focused on being *good enough.* IT professionals (or at least good ones, which I'd *like* to think I am) focus not on solving just the problems put in front of them, which is what people do in general (and kids do with tech, which gets them far enough to make older generations think they're tech genuises), but understanding the full model which encompasses both problem and solution.		Obviously there are a couple of kids who really know their shit, and I love talking to them and encouraging them, but for the most part kids know how to fix the problems they've run in to, but don't really understand the larger model of computing.

{"body":"It's so funny to me. I'm 19, so I was born in the mid-nineties, 1995 precisely. And during my early childhood, my parents bought a Gateway computer. As working middle-class folk in New Jersey suburbia, it wasn't uncommon to have one. Don't worry I'm getting to the point, but I used it since I was toddler. 	My mother claims that my sister and I learned to read using the ole Gateway, playing Reader Rabbit and Putt-Putt and Pajama Sam. 		So I've had experience with such "outlandish" technology for most of my life, but the thing that amazes me, is that my parents, both born in the early-sixties, are around the same age as the geniuses and entrepreneurs that developed the personal computer. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the first PC came out in the late-sixties, early-seventies? Commodore's, Intel's, and then the famed International Business Machine. So in 1973, when my parents were 10 and 11 years old respectively, would be the children of that era to first experience such technologies. And then at 20 and 21 years old in 1983, the Apple I is out and being produced by Wozniak and Jobs. 		My parents' generation have been around longer or just as long as computers and the majority have less knowledge than my generation does. But the only thing that I can think of that allows them to be less savvy with tech, is the fact that it rapidly increased in market size, demand, and just the general increase in improvements in the late-nineties and early-2000's.

{"body":"> The difference is that technology has risen from typewriters, not the other way around. Your daily life of using keyboards automatically adjusts you to using it.		I see what you're saying, but I'll play the other side for a moment. The controlling apparatus of a pc, the keyboard (and mouse, should be simple), comes directly from typewriters. So someone already familiar with decades of typewriter use should have a head start on a new pc user in controlling the device. Now they both need to learn the OS. The elder with typewriter still has the upper hand, especially with DOS or Linux.

{"body":"I too face this problem with the older generations. And I do think that growing up in an environment has something to do with it.		We grew up with many conveniences and that shapes the way we think. We think in terms of systematic approach and categorization because we grew up with computers. When I say on your phone go to settings>my device>sound>ringtones you probably know what I mean without me having to explain further. And if your phone had a different interface, you probably know that in order to get to the "ringtones" tab, but having no "my device" tab, you intuitively look for a "general" tab or something similar. All this sound second nature to you.		But for the older generation, most of these are alien speak. Because while we grew up in a time of computers and where rudimentary programming and technology knowledge is common (and it is pretty common for youngsters to actively pursue knowledge in how to use new technology), they grew up in a time where the new technology was still starting out. They started from having to do most things manually to getting used to technology that still requires effort (by our standards) to use. And there isn't a common culture in their generation during their youths to actively pursue knowledge of the new technologies. They were there to provide a convenience to them and that's all most of them care.		In another words, we are interested in how and why it works and used to the current tech level, they grew up only knowing that if they press this button, this particular thing happens. 		Take TV as an example. They had a TV, went from black and white to colour. They had a remote that turned on the TV and switch between channel. Make sure the plug is plugged in, make sure the antenna is up. Simple. Most tech in those days were simpler and more straight forward. 		But TV for us, well, we have a flat screen TV choice of LCD, LED etc., connected to a set top box connected to the cable modem and also my VoIP phone, router, hub and what not. And we have Cable free to air, pay per view, subscription channels, recording to a hard disk, I can surf the intent on my TV, turn my TV into a Karaoke Screen, download an app on my phone to use as a remove control for my TV. The possibilities are massive. And we learn them all at a age where we are most adaptive to new things, we learn faster.		On top of that, the old age comes into play. At an older age, their learning capabilities and mental faculties are not comparable to what they had when they were younger. They are slower than when they where younger, retain less knowledge than their younger self.		So sometime, when I get frustrated, I remember all these and give a bit of lee way, I become more understanding and explain to them again. 		Try this. Instead of frustratingly tell them why it works this way, tell them in order to do this, step 1 do this, step 2 do this etc and ask them to repeat infront of you. They don't need to understand why, I find that they can remember how to do a specific task if they just know the step by step rather than lumping all the how's and whys. We do things regarding tech because we intuitively know what to do based on how/why it works, it is pretty unfair to expect them to suddenly learn everything in such a short time.		Those rare awesome old people who seems to use new tech effortlessly, they started early. Why can't your old folks do the same? Well at thus moment they haven't started, and you can't ask them to go back in time to start learning,and for many, now it is too late for them to learn the whole syllabus on the new techs. So rather than getting frustrated, which only makes you feel negative, why not do the bet they can at this time and come online to vent the frustration out.

{"body":"Reminds me of this restaurant I used to manage.  The owner was adament about the temperature being 74 degrees. Exactly. The first thing he would do when he stopped in was check the temperature with his internal thermometer and then ask for the temp to be lowered or raised depending  on what he thought it felt like.  It didn't matter if we were on an hour wait or ticket times were at 30 minutes and nevermind the fact that we had a programmable  heating and cooling system that kept the place pretty close to 74 all the time,   if he wanted the temperature changed we were expected to drop everything and fix it. He signed the checks,  so I had every reason to oblige him. 		One day I found a thermometer that had  a cling on it that said 74 degrees. Exactly. I bought that thing without thinking twice and for 2 years I had that thing up at the host stand so he would see it right when he walked in. It turned into a habit that he would come in and check it first thing and he never said anything about the temp again, giving Attaboys and such about our attention to detail.  For 2 years.  Then one day he came in,  looked at the thermometer and must have noticed the cling lifting up or something because I watched him scratch at it with his finger and then,  as my anxiety started kicking in,  I watched him peel that damn cling off the thermometer to find a device that had stopped working god knows how long ago.  He just stood there looking at it for what seemed like a full minute before he finally pulled the thermometer off the wall and brought it to me to let me know that the batteries must be dead. He still had the cling in his hand when he left the building a short while later.  		We got the thermometer working but every time he came in after that day he would look at, and then touch, that thermometer.","depth":0,"score":197,"ups":197,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"papamajama","name":"t1_comckgh","parent_id":"t3_2vzanv","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1424029575,"created_utc":1424029575}

I've had older woman come in angry and distraught because "My phone broke! You sold it to me and now it wont work! What happened? I want a new one" I look at the phone, and tell them it was never turned on. I've also had some come in for tracfone minutes and I happily put them on the phone for them. I had this woman come in almost in tears because she added time on the weekend and "It says I have until the 19th [which was the following Monday] to add time but-but I added time!
