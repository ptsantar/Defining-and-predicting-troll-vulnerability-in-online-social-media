However since a byte can only take up to 256 values, you can't possibly write a number larger than 255 with it, leaving the maximum resulting file size to 255 bytes. For two count bytes for example, this number would go up to 65535, because that's as high as you can count using 16 bits. So using this theoretical simple RLE algorithm, one would need at least ceil(log2(5.0e+16)) = 56 bits = 8 bytes (plus one data byte that makes 9 bytes in total) to encode the aforementioned large file.","depth":7,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheSoundDude","name":"t1_creh5ly","parent_id":"t1_cregquf","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432072641,"created_utc":1432069041}

{"body":"Here ya go:		* The torrent file system has been replaced with magnet links		When you download a torrent, you start with a little ".torrent" file tells your torrent program who to contact and what it is you're downloading. Magnet links are URLs that describe what you want to download, and when you click it, it directly opens your torrent program, which uses the information in the URL to ask around for the rest of the data that would be in the ".torrent file". [Learn more](http://lifehacker.com/5411311/bittorrents-future-dht-pex-and-magnet-links-explained)!		* The entire site is now <90MB and infinitely mirrored		"Infinitely mirrored" is hyperbole that means there are many complete copies of the pirate bay website and its store of magnet links on various computers around the world.		* Hosting has been moved encrypted virtual machines, in the cloud		This is a bit vague, but in effect there are several pieces of very secure communication and storage happening. We'll come back to this.		* Cloud providers are unaware they're even hosting the site, in the event the install is nuked, a new VM can be uploaded in minutes and repointed.		The pirate bay machines aren't getting normal traffic directed to "www.piratebay.something". Instead, encrypted data comes in from somewhere and encrypted data is returned. It would be very difficult to correlate this with being "the pirate bay" and not some other kind of normal cloud computing use case. Even if the cloud computing company notices and shuts it down, they could just open a new account and look like any other customer again.		* The only pieces of hardware operated by TPB team are the transit router and load balancer which is diskless, encrypted, config loaded in RAM, and hosted in separate countries to each other, and the cloud host.		Okay, this is a lot of terms. A transit router is another term for a "label switch router", which is...you know what, screw it. The transit router's job is to take incoming traffic and forward it on somewhere else. A load balancer is a single device that takes in a giant pile of incoming requests and spreads them to many backend machines that handle the work. So, you contact the load balancer. The load balancer takes your request, encrypts it, and sends it to a transit router in another country. The transit router encrypts it differently and contacts one of those machines in the cloud we talked about above. The result goes back to the transit router, which returns the result to the load balancer. "Diskless" is important, because it means that the transit router isn't keeping any sort of log of who's sending what where, meaning that if somebody grabs it, it's not actually useful for identifying anybody.","depth":3,"score":653,"ups":653,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"captainAwesomePants","name":"t1_creg0xl","parent_id":"t1_credwja","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432070957,"created_utc":1432067357}

{"body":"Let's see.		1 instead of hosting torrent files which is what we used to need to start downloading a torrent, they now use a new technology that allows us to start downloading a torrent by just clicking a link, so they don't have to store torrent files or run a tracker (a server needed with the old torrent file system) this new special links are called magnet links.		2 Normally when you want to visit a website the url you type takes you to a server that hosts the website you are trying to visit. In their case the url points you to an intermediate server (load balancer) which in turn takes your request to another server which is the one actually hosting the website, the website is hosted in this second server but this server is hidden to you, you're dealing with the load balancer. Imagine you go to a store you need something and you ask the store clerk, he doesn't have it at hand so he asks a second person in the warehouse to go fetch it. In this example the store clerk is the load balancer and the second employee at the warehouse the second server that hosts tpb.		With that in mind imagine a lot of copies of the website which is really small, distributed around the world in several of those second servers, they only communicate with the store clerk (load balancer) thus they are hidden from us, the customers or police that also only get to see and interact with the store clerk.

This file then tells you where to find people who have the song.		in TPB, you send your request to a shell website. the shell website then sends that request to the real site with the torrent info. If they take down the shell website, they can reupload one in seconds. And they cant get to the real website since the router that tells you "hey dont go to IP 1.2.3 go to IP 4.5.6" doesnt save the data.		other things they do, the real website is hosted on clouds. This is like selling drugs in an apartment. Even if you get "kicked out" you can just pack up, move to another apartment, and restart (vs selling from a home where you are "stuck"). They also encrypt all of the data with a dead man switch. It has all the data encrypted, and unencrypts it when it needs to use it. But if it senses something is wrong (ie the shell goes down) it instantly deletes the unencrypted data. Lastly, all the different parts are in different countries. Going back to drugs, think how the US cant stop drug production in Mexico, and Mexico cant stop drug sales in the US. It makes it infinitely harder when several totally different organizations have to work together.		better?","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OmniaMors","name":"t1_crenap9","parent_id":"t1_creg2e2","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432083174,"created_utc":1432079574}

{"body":"I know you're probably kidding, but here's my take on it for those who don't understand too much technical jargon.		> The torrent file system has been replaced with magnet links	 	The site is basically just links to peer sharing. No files are actually hosted there, so no large amount of hard drive space is required.		> The entire site is now <90MB and infinitely mirrored		TPB could fit on a small flash drive, and has enough versions being hosted that getting rid of all of them would take ridiculous amounts of time; especially since people could keep re-uploading the copies of the site		> Hosting has been moved encrypted virtual machines, in the cloud		The people running TPB servers don't tell the hosting companies that's what they're doing; encrypted virtual machines basically means they're running operating systems within operating systems. (If you've ever seen someone run windows on a mac via Parallels, that's Virtual machine software. Basically, it's not just a computer running an OS that has bad shit on it, but rather an operating system within an operating system. It's harder to detect that way) Encryption is just security that is hard to break (obviously it's more than that but for layman's terms, why not?)		> Cloud providers are unaware they're even hosting the site, in the event the install is nuked, a new VM can be uploaded in minutes and repointed.		If one of these sites gets taken down, the people can upload a full copy of the site to another website provider by the same method with no real issues without any problems. 		> The only pieces of hardware operated by TPB team are the transit router and load balancer which is diskless, encrypted, config loaded in RAM, and hosted in separate countries to each other, and the cloud host.		TPB doesn't have much physical evidence that can be used against them because they just redirect traffic (think of an airport traffic controller with the torrents as the different planes) and the limited amount of physical liability they have is pretty hard to get into, as RAM is temporary memory. Them all being in seperate countries is obvious security so that you don't keep all your eggs in one basket. 		> In the event the cloud hosts drop out of communication with the LB for more than 8 hours, a self-desctruct sequence triggers shutdown of the servers, which can only be decrypted with the password.		> Even in the event they somehow manage to get a decrypted copy, it's essentially useless to them.		What can law-enforcement due after all the aforementioned security measures if they have a copy of their stuff? It's useless without locating all the individual parts.		------------------------------------------		It basically boils down to the idea that it's hard for law-enforcement to catch up when they're always being outpaced.","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cregk58","parent_id":"t1_credwja","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432071750,"created_utc":1432068150}

I tried my hand at programming once and fell asleep at the keyboard halfway through my first jaunt at Code Academy. I do stand-up. My brain just isn't wired for that kind of boredom. 		Also, fun story. My best friend's boyfriend is a software engineer and he used to be really weird about her smoking pot. We got him to try it one time and he never stopped. He became a regular smoker for day one, so I think something really jives with a programmer's personality when it comes to the pot.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"UhOhFeministOnReddit","name":"t1_crejl3p","parent_id":"t1_crej6kv","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432076592,"created_utc":1432072992}

{"body":"I am not really an expert on finding illegal servers on cloud providers, but some ways one could pinpoint them is:		1. Easiest way would be to cross-reference the public IPs you get from the DNS server with the ones at the cloud hoster. This is not possible because the public IPs point to the load balancer redirects the traffic to the actual instances (whose public IPs remain hidden).	2. Create a large traffic spike through a DDOS and see which instances receive a lot of traffic. This is generally already hard because there is a lot of noise to sift through. Becomes impossible if the traffic is properly load balanced / distributed among multiple cloud hosters or accounts.	3. I guess you could try to find an exact traffic stream by looking at all the incoming traffic and searching for a unique byte sequence. I've heard a few times of this method being used, but it would either require a lot of computing power if you look at all traffic in real-time or take a long time if you sample 5% of the traffic.	4. If you know what files are on the server, you could search all disks for them. Somewhat feasible, but might slow down the machines of paying customers. Can also be mitigated through encrypting your disks.		Generally the cloud hoster doesn't really have a (financial) interest in finding out if one of their customers is doing something illegal, and trying to find out might incur performance penalties on paying customers.		There are of course also human factors to find the hosted servers, like find out whose credit card is being used to pay for the servers (if it wasn't bought on the black market), but for authorities to look into these, they would first have to get a warrant / make the hoster cooperate.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hobofan94","name":"t1_creinqq","parent_id":"t1_creh99k","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432075041,"created_utc":1432071441}

This key is a unique thumbprint for every single torrent in existence. The other stuff is fluff to improve how to connect to more trackers, etc.		A magnet link isn't a file, it's just a link that has that hash key in it. Sure, you can add on more arguments to add stuff like a friendly name, just like you can add arguments to any web url.		Once the torrent program receives the Magnet link, it starts searching the 'torrent cloud' for any torrent that matches the hash key. It downloads the corresponding .torrent file wherever it finds it. The .torrent file tells the client the files to download, and off you go. Alternatively, if you already have the torrent file, you can skip the wait for the magnet link to find and download the .torrent file before it starts getting the files that are the 'content' of the torrent.		edit: auto-posted before I finished typing	Edit2: sources for additional reading:	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jothay","name":"t1_creel4z","parent_id":"t1_cree96l","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432068822,"created_utc":1432065222}

{"body":"It's not going away, ever. TPB might someday go down, but the principle of it, the ability to digitally share information, is never leaving. As soon as computers became commonplace, that changed for good, even before the internet. The internet just magnified the effect. The moment that people gained the power to copy CDs to their harddrive and Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V those files, the marketplace for information underwent a seismic shift. Music, film, imagery, words, software, all of these are just manifestations of information. Information that can be copied a thousand times in a second. They can't ever take that back, no matter what they do. They can only adapt to it. And they're doing that, just very very very slowly and sulkily, like a child dragged up the stairs to bed, screaming and grabbing onto every single baluster along the way.		The fact that we have spotify is one huge example of adaptation. Now for $10/mo. you can have all the music you want (minus taylor swift), whereas you used to have to spend $10 to get 12 songs or so, and if you lost or damaged the CD you had to spend it again. And look how popular spotify is, even though they still have a million little problems with their shitty fucking software. It's progress. Same with netflix....huge progress even though there's a ton of things people hate about it. Same with Steam. All of these are massively successful commercial ventures IN SPITE of tpb. Tpb is not killing business. It was always hard to be a musician: still is. It was always hard to be an artist: still is.

Yes, there's stuff there that's regarded as illegal, but there's also stuff that is: A) put there by the artists themselves (e.g., concert video/audio); B) cracked versions of software that is almost certainly illegal, but sometimes the only way to get software working that you *bought and paid for* because the vendor has used some poorly-coded DRM that doesn't work under newer versions of the host operating system and they've abandoned it; C) other types of very large data files or creative works that the creators have uploaded as a torrent themselves because of the ease of distribution (e.g., I've downloaded multi-gigabyte game patches).

Yes, this is sadly the only solution, aside from hosting your own DNS or using a DNS that hosts alternative zones for the seized name. Traditionally, the NS records at the registrar tell DNS where to query when there are no cached zones for a name, but this is problematic when a name is seized. I think it is time for IETF to discuss addressing the problem of domain name seizures with DNS. Currently, DNS offers nothing for names in this situation; we can set NS records with a chain of servers that are forgotten the moment the name is seized. The TTL (time to live) tells DNS when to purge zones, respecting the Swedish governments new nameservers. There needs to be a revision to DNS RFC to allow a "master TTL", or "MTTL" of some sort, an authoritative TTL that will be respected in the case that the NS records change:		1. In the event that a zone expires according to the standard TTL, DNS should retain the cached zone momentarily for further verification.		2. If there are new NS records and at least one matches the cached records, defer to the first match for results then verify that at least one of the new nameservers responds with the same results, purging the cache. Otherwise, retain the cached zones for the entire period of seven days or until the MTTL expires, whichever comes first.		3. Perpetually retain the cached zones if there are new NS records and none match the cached records.		This perpetually forces DNS to respect the cached nameservers until they are all synchronized, or for seven days, whichever comes first. This allows some protection for name owners at a level beyond just the registrar alone, which is the single point of vulnerability in a name seizure. Of course, this still allows the name to be seized, but makes it useless to the new owner for seven days, until the MTTL expires, or until they can also seize the nameservers. Name owners will still be able to transfer ownership, albeit with a little bit of additional difficulty in having to deal with DNS, but this is very standard stuff. 		The one fault that I see with this proposal is that a government entity could damn well seize nameservers and update the records in short order, which would eliminate the usefulness of this propossal, but it's at least a little added protection eliminating the confusion of at least the earliest people trying to access the website of a seized domain. The new visitors can then be properly notified to update their bookmarks and discontinue accessing the old domain.		There would need to be a whole series of actions at the private and public level to even get an RFC here, then all the various software authors would have to go and write the software. Clearly, this would take years to implement, but it seems damn well worth it. It's not only appealing to a legal defendent in a court-mandated seizure, but also in the event that a registrar's control panel is accessed by an unauthorized user. There's also the added benefit that it offers better counter-measures for nations with overstepping censorship.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"funknut","name":"t1_crel3uw","parent_id":"t1_crefgxn","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432079232,"created_utc":1432075632}

Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.

It becomes restless after spending too long without acquiring new gold for its hoard. Recognizing this, local pirates have come to a mutually-beneficial relationship with the hydra, giving it tribute in the form of gold -- a portion of their booty from raided ships -- which they pay by dropping the gold overboard when travelling past its lair.  	Authorities and bounty hunters seeking the pirates who are unaware of this creature's presence, will usually pass by without paying such tribute, and thus end up face-to-face-to-face-to-face with a very annoyed hydra.	___	**--Actions--**		**Multiattack.** The hydra makes as many Bite attacks as it has heads.		**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10', one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.		___	*Edit: Minor formatting edits, MAJOR stat edits (thanks to /u/Lazin for pointing out my mistake).*","depth":1,"score":1669,"ups":1669,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"ItsADnDMonsterNow","name":"t1_cre9pta","parent_id":"t1_cre6059","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432061287,"created_utc":1432057687}

I don't think we're arguing that they are chaotic because clearly they feel rules do not apply to them, and they don't have to follow any rules they chose to ignore. 		What we disagree on, would be whether they are good vs. neutral. I don't believe their cause is completely noble. Their cause is self-righteous and self-serving because their actions indicate their primary motivation is to watch movies and TV shows and use software for free (free as in beer, not as in freedom) and to allow as many people to do so as possible. Their secondary motive seems to be simply to be rebels and to gain notoriety. A tertiary motive seems to be to mock established the authority and to irritate the likes of MPAA and RIAA as much as possible. The amount of hubris the original founders had was incredible.		They might claim they working on a noble cause, that they work to promote free speech and remove impediments of distributing ideas and works of art, but they hardly do anything to promote free speech or unknown artists. This is very much bonk to me. If they are out there distributing ideas, they would at least have a track towards distributing scientific papers, editorial thesis, music compositions and other forms of knowledge that are typically locked away  in some exclusive library. Instead, they're focused on what's popular: recent movies, pay-cable shows, etc. most of which have absolutely no trouble getting distributed to the masses. To me, the cause they've stated is merely an argument in their legal defense to justify their existence and avoid penalties.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"newfor2015","name":"t1_crekser","parent_id":"t1_crejeox","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432078665,"created_utc":1432075065}

Now it uses [magnet URIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme#Design) almost exclusively. 		When you downloaded a torrent file from TPB, it was **only coming from TPB** (or some other CDN), which meant that if TPB went offline, so did access to those torrent files. 		This is why magnet links are superior; an entire collection of magnet links is significantly easier to store than, say, an entire collection of .torrent files, both in terms of space and logistics. If TPB goes down, those magnet links will still work just fine, as they use [DHT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) to find peers.","depth":9,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"life-is-fubar","name":"t1_creefp4","parent_id":"t1_cree0eg","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432068591,"created_utc":1432064991}

{"body":"Want to know an interesting historical fact? This has happened before in Sweden, more than 180 years ago. The Swedish government lost then too.		In December 1830, a newspaper called "[Aftonbladet i Stockholm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftonbladet)" was started. It criticized the King and the Swedish government heavily. In fact, it criticized them so much that the newspaper's publishing permit (Sw. *utgivningsbevis*) was revoked by the government, effectively banning the publication of the newspaper. 		The founder, Lars Johan Hierta, then managed to obtain a new permit through nominal partners and started a new paper. He called it "Det Andra Aftonbladet", in English "The Second Aftonbladet". Again the publishing permit was revoked and the newspaper banned. But Lars Johan Hierta got a third permit, and called his new newspaper - you guessed it - "The Third Aftonbladet". And so on, and so forth.		This went on for years until "The Twenty-Sixth Aftonbladet", when the government finally gave up. Not long after after, the Swedish Parliament abolished the right to revoke the publishing permit, and [Lars Johan Hierta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Johan_Hierta) is sometimes referred to as the "father of the free press" in Sweden.		Today, [Aftonbladet](http://www.aftonbladet.se) is still one of the largest newspapers in Sweden. Go figure.		So, last time this happened it didn't end well for the Swedish government then, and I have a feeling if won't end well for them now either.","depth":0,"score":105,"ups":105,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NacMacFeegle","name":"t1_creggz0","parent_id":"t3_36i6nn","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432071616,"created_utc":1432068016}

Smaller groups that don't us a more traditional publisher though, they generally get a much more significant portion of the money from the sales (minus things like hosting and transaction fees and such).		Thus, buying or not buying the big name stuff tends not to have much effect on the actual creators. With smaller creators though, it does.		>without attribution or financial compensation		I don't know about anyone else, but this one is quite ideologically different from general piracy IMO.  	With copying and distributing, you aren't specifically gaining anything from it (except, perhaps, good will from the people who get it from you). Everyone still knows who made it, and how they can support the creator. Many people sadly don't support the creators even then, but at least it's an available option.  	Non-attribution and unlicensed derivatives though^^1, are specifically profiting off of someone else's work, without allowing the original creator to get any of the profit (or recognition) for the work themselves. While it might not always be actual monetary gains that someone gets from this, it's the same principle at play.  		___		^^1 Of course, unlicensed derivatives have a bit more leeway depending on the terms required and the attitude of the creator. If a content creator is a total jerk about things, or the terms are seen as unreasonable, (which are both mostly subjective, admittedly) people aren't going to be too torn up if people don't comply with the license portion.

I partly disagree. Software is a nice-to-have, not something you absolutely want and need. When people decide on whether or not to use a program they take the costs and benefits into account.

Making him pay 5$ will make that person not even consider the software anymore. What is the result? As a firm you just threw away free marketing.

Torrent sites are not the problem, they are a symptom of the problem. 		Just a crazy example; If creators and consumers were more directly tied together economically and consumers would be able to support creators with small amounts not possible today (e.g. 0,01$) and this became a part of mainstream culture, people could pay a small amount a month for hundred or thousands of creative projects and nobody would give a shit about torrenting anymore.		This is technologically possible today, but not really legally possible.		There are so many possible solutions to this problem that benefits both creators and consumers more than what we have today. But it doesn't benefit the people who move the money so it won't happen any time soon.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Smotchkkiss","name":"t1_credpj3","parent_id":"t1_crebosv","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432067498,"created_utc":1432063898}

Bands like Iron Maiden want you to file share their music. They know it's not costing them any money and that it'll spread their music to those who will go see their shows and even boost their sales online. Trent Reznor made over $750K with an album consisting of music he made completely available online for free!		If all the sites I could download from disappeared I wouldn't turn around and start buying the content. I wouldn't experience the content at all and they'd get no word of mouth from me. Thus, these companies would just lose money generated by word of mouth by me and those like myself.		TLDR- I'd buy it all if I had money, and in the end, Piracy increases sales/not the other way around.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Borglover42","name":"t1_crejs69","parent_id":"t3_36i6nn","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432076928,"created_utc":1432073328}

{"body":"replace "poor" with "consumers" and "rich" with "RIAA/MPAA" and you're correct. The problem with current copyright policy in the United States is that not all content creators are equal under it. There are media companies that can and do steal content from the little guys. When that happens, the little guys have a very hard time getting their cut of the profits. Check out Smarter Every Day on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6A1Lt0kvMA		He had a clip from a video that HE recorded and produced stolen by a media company and featured on their Facebook page. They cut out the name of his channel, his sponsorship, everything. That video got millions more views than his original on YouTube, which earned Facebook tons of ad revenue from hosting the video. When he contacted Facebook, they took so long to address his concern about the theft of his work that in the meantime the video garnered millions of views. Copyright law is a myth. It is not law because it is not enforced consistently at all. That being established, why should consumers care about what the RIAA and MPAA say about piracy when companies who are big enough and rich enough can steal from smaller content creators with impunity?","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"UKDMike","name":"t1_crel5ik","parent_id":"t1_crek6uf","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432079318,"created_utc":1432075718}

{"body":"Am I? You share something illegally, torrent sites facilitate the transfer while I download it illegally. 		Do you not think those sites make revenues? 		So let me ask you this: you spend years learning C#, Java, and or C++ among other things. You invest countless unpaid hours (in the span of months) creating a utility or good for people to purchase. Sometimes for a modest fee, sometimes for a higher premium should the product apply to a niche. Someone copies your program, puts it on a torrent site, and someone else downloads it. Who is most at fault?		In order: 		1. The person stealing your product and enabling the further proliferation of theft. 		2. The website facilitating the transfer and enabling the further proliferation of theft. 		3. The person stealing your product to use for themselves. 		The culture of piracy baffles me. Users that steal a person's property are quick to blame that person for a lack of security, lack of access or huge mark ups. Thats like blaming a rape victim for not carrying a gun or being particular for who they will date/sleep with. In this regard, Internet pirates are no better than victim blamers in rape cases. 		Make no mistake. Even large security companies are always at a loss when initially designing a product. When you don't actually purchase it, you are taking money from the mouths of the employees children. Nobody thinks of it that way-they view the shallow impact of damaging a company. But nobody ever considers what piracy does to the actual people who design the product. 		You cannot steal a product and then think you have the right to complain about fair wages when you're trying to circumvent the system and get away with not paying someone a wage yourself. 		Piracy disgusts me. I grew up with it. As a consultant for a large company and a hobbyist programmer, I would conservatively say over half of the people I know or work with do it. Literally all of them have no clue that they're essentially setting a precedent and awaiting that bullet to come back and insert itself into their foot when they design a popular product. 		So yeah, I know how piracy works. Excuse me for being a decent fucking human being and considering the impact it has on the team of programmers who work their asses off to design a product.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NobleHalcyon","name":"t1_crelvvd","parent_id":"t1_crei78f","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432080628,"created_utc":1432077028}
