{"body":"The treaty of Versailles was a slap on the wrist. It hurt but it wasn't that bad. There were several factors that lead to the depression that Germany was in in 1923, one was the poor management of the funds for the war, one of the core ways for paying back the credits that Germany took to finance WW1 was the money they would recieve from the other states that they won against. A very large part of the war was financed using credits that couldn't be payed back afterswards since the war was lost. 		Another factor was that when Belgian and french soldiers occupied the Ruhr sector, the German government orderd everyone to stop working in this zone. There were 2 million people working there, and since Germany didn't want to give the econmiec power to france and since it couldn't take it back trhough military action there was a passive resistence. For example no one worked. BUt all the wages were still payed by the German Government. Money was beeing printed night and day to acquire the funds for 2 million workers (and other things, but this was also important.) ,		In the end the Treaty of Versailles was never really inforced, at least not the financal part of it. In 1932 there were 3 billion Mark left of those 260 billion Mark that should've been payed back at the beginning, the banning of big and heavy weapons was taken back a few years before etc. Still the right used it for propaganda, to make the people believe that recession was not Germanies or their fault.

I do not think this has anything to do with resources. I think it has much more to do with the family environment. 		When I was a kid we didn't have much resources, we were supported by my dad who was a machinist. Yet my families habits were to always do something intellectually stimulating. We'd always be reading, taking something apart, working on something, etc. 		This is embarrassing to say, but my dad used to drive around on trash day looking for projects to work on. He's find bikes, lawnmowers, weedwackers, old radios, etc. Then he'd take them apart to find out why they were broken. I watched him fix all sorts of things, and it required hardly any money (since it was trash). 		I think most of the reasons being given by people are designed to be politically correct. It's as if they've been tasked to figure out a problem and that some reasons are "off-limits". So they have to come up with a very agreeable answer. It might not be factually correct, but it's politically correct and won't draw much backlash.		One of the politically incorrect reasons could be that of intelligence. It's known that intelligence is an inherited trait much like height, and it's also known that intelligent people tend to make more money than people of lower intelligence. It's entirely possible that due to sexual reproduction and social strata that intelligent, wealthier people tend to have intelligent children who then also tend to be wealthier.","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_crowxd8","parent_id":"t1_cros4u6","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432918395,"created_utc":1432914795}

There are so many challenges to creating and operating effective summer programs in the places that need them the most.		You need to find funding and appropriate spaces. Then you need to find administrators to run the program. Educators to create curricula. Volunteers (or people willing to work for nearly free) who will teach it. People to train them how to teach the curriculum while managing children who are sometimes bitter that they are spending their summer in school.		Then you have to find the students. You need to find students who are willing to go and parents who are willing and able to let them. Students need to commit to the program, and so do the parents.		Not something that's easy to do. The hardest part, though, is the funding.

{"body":"Because why go to the effort of creating brand-new, funded summer programs with their own bureaucracy, when you can just capitalize upon the system already in place?		In many other countries (China, Japan, Australia) the school year is year-round, with breaks between trimesters/quarters. More frequent, shorter breaks means kids retain more of what they learn, teachers get paid more, and the infrastructure is utilized more effectively. 		What is the point of a full 14 weeks off in a row when you're between the ages of 6 and 17? Very few people in that age group would go for long (>2 week) backpacking trips alone, and most do not have a parent who is unemployed or flexibly employed enough to do something for more than 2 weeks. So why not stagger those weeks off throughout the year?		Also, the U.S. primary and secondary educations systems are not doing well by a variety of measures. It's possible that one of the reasons for that is the mere 180 schooling days - compared to, for example, Germany's 240. 		I will concede one downside is that students who currently rely on summer jobs when they are 16 & 17 won't have them anymore - but the more time you're in school, the less time you have to spend money, and from a skills standpoint, I think the time would be better spent learning more in high school than washing dishes or scooping popcorn.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"belowthreshold","name":"t1_crottp3","parent_id":"t1_crorn5z","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432913647,"created_utc":1432910047}

{"body":"The [2010 TIME article](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2005863-1,00.html) is an interesting read:		> Dull summers take a steep toll, as researchers have been documenting for more than a century. Deprived of healthy stimulation, millions of low-income kids lose a significant amount of what they learn during the school year. Call it "summer learning loss," as the academics do, or "the summer slide," but by any name summer vacation is among the most pernicious--if least acknowledged--causes of achievement gaps in America's schools. Children with access to high-quality experiences keep exercising their minds and bodies at sleepaway camp, on family vacations, in museums and libraries and enrichment classes. Meanwhile, children without resources languish on street corners or in front of glowing screens. By the time the bell rings on a new school year, the poorer kids have fallen weeks, if not months, behind. And even well-off American students may be falling behind their peers around the world.  	&nbsp;  	The problem of summer vacation, first documented in 1906, compounds year after year. What starts as a hiccup in a 6-year-old's education can be a crisis by the time that child reaches high school. After collecting a century's worth of academic studies, summer-learning expert Harris Cooper, now at Duke University, concluded that, on average, all students lose about a month of progress in math skills each summer, while low-income students slip as many as three months in reading comprehension, compared with middle-income students. Another major study, by a team at Johns Hopkins University, examined more than 20 years of data meticulously tracking the progress of students from kindergarten through high school. The conclusion: while students made similar progress during the school year, regardless of economic status, the better-off kids held steady or continued to make progress during the summer--but disadvantaged students fell back. By the end of grammar school, low-income students had fallen nearly three grade levels behind, and summer was the biggest culprit. By ninth grade, summer learning loss could be blamed for roughly two-thirds of the achievement gap separating income groups.		TL;DR: Summer vacation increases the disparity in academic achievement between the income classes.","depth":0,"score":472,"ups":472,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elee0228","name":"t1_cropaa3","parent_id":"t3_37pdnm","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432903851,"created_utc":1432900251}

I think it should be treated as  piece of literature and analyzed as one. We do this to the other religions in world religions class, and Hindu students like me (who sat through our teacher calling our religion a mythology and the Abrahamic faiths religions) were able to take learning objectively about our beliefs without melting into a pool of doubt so I'm sure that Christian students can take it as well.

{"body":"Let me start with this: I like Europe quite a bit.  Was always a fan of the scenery, and a fan of the healthcare systems, as well as the (greatly varied) food.  I became a fan of football, (and not the American version), in 2010, and supported Chelsea FC ever since.  I can honestly say that I have given European countries an open and objective mind. 		With that said, this is why what I find you having posted as ridiculously ironic.		The common complaint towards Americans from Europeans is that we are ignorant, intolerant of cultural differences with others, and over-reaching.  The irony is that you've done just that and failed to see it entirely.  I'm not calling you daft, ignorance is after all simply being unaware.  But here's the problem with what you've said.		Half our population does vote for Republicans, the other half votes for Democrats.  Here's the deal, neither side really trusts the government, especially the Republican side.  And, to use your own argument against you, they are correct to distrust a government that wages unjust war where war crimes are committed.  They have an argument to distrust the government because of the NSA's massively overzealous spying.  They have a right to do it because of the Bush Administration surging into Iraq, giving no-bid contracts to Dick Cheney's company, Haliburton, and allowing the housing-bubble to burst unabated.  		We have quite a lot of reasons to distrust our government.		To your point about Snowden, I have zero interest in John Oliver.  No idea what he said or did in relation to U.S. citizens not knowing who he is, but the majority I've talked to have heard of him and what he exposed.  Most who view what he did as a bad thing are also grateful for the good to come out of it.		As far as religion goes, we do indeed have some religious nutjobs.  But it's just that, some.  There are less and less every year.  The dying-out of religion in the West is not absent here, I assure you.  		Also, thank you for proving my point about stereotypes.  You actually agreed with what I wrote, that stereotypes are filled with partial truths that can be only be applied to a small portion of the people in that group.  Thank you for proving my point.		As for healthcare, this is a massive, massive issue here.  I will reiterate to the top of my post, and say that I am a fan of European healthcare systems.  The problem with it here, is that we have about 320 million residents here spread out over 9,147,420 square kilos.  We are a massive country, and one that has felt very disenfranchised with their government for a decade at the very least.  Many are reluctant to accept our government to run public healthcare, because our government is pretty much the most inefficient government in the West.  Our government has shown to be power hungry and breaches human rights constantly.  By having public healthcare we make the government that much bigger, and more of our tax dollars get lost to corruption or inefficiency.  That's the big reason why people do not want it.		This country is not full of these people as you claim.  You do not live here from how you are phrasing it, you are basing your claims off of what the media tells you.  If you truly believe that Republicans are batshit and that dems are the guardians we need, then that's all fine and good.  But many here don't.  I love that Democrats want gay marriage, I love that they are in favor of legalizing marijuana.  I don't know how to feel about public healthcare honestly, I see a lot of good and a lot of bad.  I absolutely *abhor* their view on gun laws.  I feel the strongest on gun laws, and while I vote Libertarian where applicable, if I ever have to vote Democrat or Republican I will vote Republican because of the gun issue. But that's just my own personal stance.  A LOT of voters here are like that, they have an issue that strikes the strongest with them and that determines a lot of how they vote.  When you combine that with a 2-party duopoly, you get 0 effectual change, and a whole lot of the same bullshit.  A considerable number of Americans, myself included are fed the fuck up with our government.  But as long as the 2-party duopoly is in play, we can't fix it, short of having a full blown revolution.  And it's not bad enough here for that currently.		Hopefully you come away with better insight into why things are confusing here.  Hopefully you also keep an open mind when considering public healthcare here and the issues the US faces with that in mind.  I believe you would have a much more enlightened view for having done that.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DouglasTwig","name":"t1_crpswwz","parent_id":"t1_crpsfxn","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432988330,"created_utc":1432984730}

No its not wrong, I agreed with you there. And not in my experience at all they are not, they are called owners because that conveys the full reality. Owners tells you they are shareholders but they are also more than that. They are the sole or controlling shareholders, calling them owners gives the full information. Just calling them shareholders doesn't' convey the full reality. 		People say owner when it is applicable because it conveys more information, that the person is more than just a typical shareholder.

This means that because of Time's status and the group they employ all would be considered as having some kind of ability, insight or information that would better the situation of someone by some amount they are morally required to do so.		The point about it being private doesn't matter. A moral responsibility is a requirement regardless of your rights.		Your rights don't afford you some kind of absolution from disdain.

The media have privileged access to information and are afforded protections that the typical citizen or firm would not have, and part of the reason that the press is given these privileges is because they serve the interests of the [public's right to know](http://www.freepress.net/blog/12/01/24/publics-right-know).

If you go back a decade or so, paid leave was a pretty standard thing outside of low wage serving jobs. When my father started working at fords, and later Chrysler, he received two weeks paid, plus sick days, from day one. My mother worked in retail even received paid time off and sick days. I understand that's how things go in a market where the employer holds the bargaining power, but the fact is, paid leave is becoming rarer and rarer. And as you said, many employers frown upon taking time off. My previous job had me averaging 80-110 hours a week with no overtime and taking time off was a no no. Whereas in other developed nations, paid leave is not the decision of employers. By law you are given time off and employers may add on to that but not take it away. Again, yes I'm young, and currently no paid leave isn't an issue because I'm single with no dependents. And yes, things do change when you put in 10 years at a company, but even then, the age of working for a company for life is disappearing.

{"body":"I completely and utterly disagree with you. Living standards do not need to fall, and the problem with the US economy has nothing to do with preserving standards of living. 		The average US worker is extremely productive. The average US worker's real wages haven't increased particularly much since the 1980s. Certain areas, especially admin and middle-management expand, but that's mostly to eat up overhead, instead of to pay the real value creators more. 		To illustrate the problem: Billy can do the work of an average employee in 1/4 the time. E.g., he does 40 hours of work in 10. Despite this, Billy is not compensated for the additional value he adds to the company, since he is paid the same (or near the same) as everyone else in his position and experience. Since Billy cannot recoup the 30 hours of free time he might otherwise enjoy, and since he is not paid for what he contributes, Billy has no incentive to work harder at work. Instead, as a rational individual, he rations his work to fill time. 		Now, especially for office workers, imagine that everyone is enjoying those efficiency increases thanks to technology, and yet they can't use the time savings and aren't compensated for their production. That's the problem in the US economy at virtually every level: wages don't reflect the value of labor.		The data reflects this: people spend less of their face time working, and company profits are at record highs. 		Companies hold disproportionate bargaining power. They keep real wages low, and often force expenses down by shifting the real cost of things off to other parties. The average american is simply not being fairly compensated for their work.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Xon","name":"t1_crp3pmo","parent_id":"t1_cros2qy","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432928357,"created_utc":1432924757}
{"body":"> I completely and utterly disagree with you. Living standards do not need to fall, and the problem with the US economy has nothing to do with preserving standards of living.		Regarding "needs to fall": over the last 40 years, there has been very little actual economic expansion that is not funded by increase credit expansion.  If you factor out credit expansion, which many economists don't like to do, there hasn't been much actual economic growth since Carter left office.  The problem with credit expansion is that it pulls demand forward, giving people access to things today that they can't yet pay for.  This is healthy to a degree, because it allows demand to track more naturally and that helps level off economic activity that is required to met demand.   But as we have seen in the recent past, too much credit expansion leads to lowered underwriting standards, which leads to counterparty risk.		When I see "standards of living need" to fall it is not a prescription, it's reaction to the fact that wages have stagnated.  		> Companies hold disproportionate bargaining power. They keep real wages low, and often force expenses down by shifting the real cost of things off to other parties. The average american is simply not being fairly compensated for their work.		1.  Yes, companies do hold disproportionate power.  This is because of an oversupply of workers, and a policy incentives that make this so.  But it's the truth, and so that's that.		2.  Wages are not low because companies keep them low, they are low because labor is oversupplied for demand.  Demand is weak because credit expansion has been largely tapped out - without more credit, and without higher wages, there is insufficient demand to justify more production, more services, etc and so we have an oversupply of labor.   In fields without an oversupply of labor we have booming wages (it's just these fields are not a significant source of economic activity to really heat the economy up).		3.  About fairness, this is deeply opinion orientated.  In my opinion, and the way most economists look at it, workers are paid what they can demand and get from employers, and nothing more.  Wages are low for macroeconomic reasons, not because any one or any number of workers demand it, and not because companies want it.		Now back to standard of living, given that I don't want it to fall, but that they should be falling.  They should be falling, for three primary reasons.		1.  For whatever the reason, wages are stagnant.   	2.  For whatever reason, costs are rising.	3.  For whatever reason, credit expansion as slowed.		The rest is all window dressing.  Economically speaking, in this environment, living standards must and should fall, because the money has to come from somewhere.  		(And there is plenty of data to suggest living standards have fallen, and continue to fall).","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_crpakwi","parent_id":"t1_crp3pmo","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432939063,"created_utc":1432935463}

Sixty years ago this was the case-- college was for lawyers, doctors, scientists, engineers, teachers, and people who didn't need real income (read: wealthy people) but wanted to be involved with more intellectual pursuits. Everyone else, the VAST majority of the population, was prepared enough out of high school to get a good job and start earning money and contributing to society.

In this system, kids are given 2 (or 3. I can't remember) 3-week breaks of the course of the year, as well as normal holiday breaks, more staff development days, and they retain the winter break. It saves on space because kids take different breaks at different times, so there are always less kids in the school which fights the over-crowding. ANYWAYS, I never felt overwhelmed while I was in elementary because I was given more frequent days off. Besides, most kids love the social aspects of school, right?

{"body":"Here's my guess. School employees are underpaid. The teachers know that, but put up with it because they get a 2-month break in the summer, plus holidays and whatnot. A lot of teachers (including myself - speech pathologist) work in the summer to supplement our income. A lot of us don't, because it's nice to have such a long break. But if you take that two-straight-months break away from us, we no longer have that choice. Those that want (or need!) to supplement our income with a summer job have to do baby-sitting and dog-walking for a week or two here or there, instead of having two months to work a regular job.  Those who just want the nice long vacation don't necessarily want a bunch of shorter breaks, either. So even if they weren't necessarily working more days, there is a cost to losing the opportunities to PRN or work a summer job or through-hike the Appalachian Trail. It would take a higher salary to compensate me for the loss of summer vacation.		Don't get me wrong... I think kids (and adults who would otherwise need to find child-care over the summer) would benefit from switching away from our 10-month 180 day calendar. I think that a 11.5 month, 210 day school year would be great for our country and our kids going forward.

I have been working for a university for about 7-10 years now, have my masters degree from here, and pretty much lived most of my life in this.  The richest, and 'brightest' do go to colleges, mostly for grad school, but where do they go when they are finished? Generally back to their own country.  I also know that countries are catching up really quick regarding their technical expertise.  For example, a recent PhD grad (a friend of mine), went from here to Spain for her postdoc, and now works in india as a researcher at a data mining firm.  Also, us holding onto qualified and prestigious faculty is also not necessarily guaranteed.  If they can't get decent graduate students and support for their projects, they will move on.  That could be in country, or out.		I do still strongly believe that our work needs to be in fixing/figuring out the K-12 area, so that there's better and more qualified undergraduates instead of people slacking off, which then hopefully leads to some research being done by undergraduates, which leads to more graduate students, and so on.

Often someone in that position has little or no education, and/or has a criminal record that makes them nigh unemployable, so finding a new job is not whatsoever the same level of difficulty or even possibility as it is for average educated people. It can be incredibly difficult, so the idea of being like "meh this job sucks" and leaving for a different one, while it may make sense for the more privileged among us, does not make sense for them.		>Get rid of some stuff, sell it.		Assuming they have extra "stuff", the extra stuff they have is worth anything, they have access to anyone willing or able to buy that extra stuff, and they have time to deal with selling stuff.

You need to write one application and slightly modify it for different positions. You need to write one single curriculum vitae that you send with every application. You need to take one single photo of yourself that you add to every application.	Writing the inital application is the hardest part. It's one single page that you need to write (half is even enough). You can do that over the course of days, even when you have close to no time. Use Email applications, no cost for paper & postal service. Even when you have close to no time, it's not unrealistic to send out one application per week. Over the course of just two monhts, you will have applied for 8 or 9 jobs.		> Assuming they have extra "stuff", the extra stuff they have is worth anything, they have access to anyone willing or able to buy that extra stuff, and they have time to deal with selling stuff.		The selling part is optional, just to raise some money for the moving truck. The more you can sell, the less space you need, the smaller the Truck can be. If you still need a 7.5t Truck, than you have far too much stuff.	Also the whole thing doesn't need to happen within one week. As already mentioned above in the write application part: Take your time. It takes as long as it needs, don't rush things. Make a list of items you really don't need, put them up for sale during the time that you apply for jobs. If somebody wants to buy something, set a meeting time at your place that suits you, not the buyer.		> Cooking takes time and some amount of planning and mental energy.

That's complete utter bullshit. Cooking a decent meal doesn't take more than 10-20 minutes. You can leave your kids unattended for 20 minutes. You can even make them cook a meal with you and help you. There are plenty of platforms that you can look up recipes for cheap meals that don't take long and still taste better than any fast food.

And independent study hall is almost always limited to the school environment. I don't know any students who were provided transportation, or the funds for transportation, to get home to a garage to work on auto, welding, etc. projects that summer provides ample time for. I haven't heard of students using their study hall time to travel out of town to an observatory, or across town to a museum. It's usually limited to what's in the library, what's online, and whether some of the wood/mech shop teachers would allow students to work unsupervised in their facilities (which is next to never, from my experience). Which lets kids have time to read, but...that's not exactly a real win when compared to how that time could be used outside of these confines.

{"body":"I'd hesitate to say there are solutions equivalent to what a large chunk of time like summer break can offer. Kids can hardly play regular baseball(to provide an example) games when they have 3-4 hours of homework a night. Restricting games to weekends, or the breaks they'll have, isn't exactly a solution. having a few months of open time to schedule activities, sports, etc. makes things a hell of a lot easier. Maybe if homework was done away with, and kids had evenings entirely available to them, there would be less issues with scheduling and time management, but it's flat out hard to manage sports leagues when half the students won't be able to find any time to participate.		Same with school clubs, and independent study. having large chunks of time helps flexibility in scheduling. Trying to wedge these things into school hours, or the supervision of schools, just makes a mess if the rest of the school system isn't overhauled to accommodate them. Maybe if more schools could ensure kids get thorough, specialized coop placements, or provided special programs that were fully funded and allowed students access to certain avenues of interest, hobby, or study, then it'd be a different story. But those things don't tend to exist, at least at a sufficient level, in public schools. If we're to get rid of summer break, we need to ensure that the benefits of summer break are not lost or diminished. I don't believe a trade-off at the cost of important areas of development is worthwhile.		And of course many students lacked some of these resources already, but that's the failure of the school system, the community, and the local government. If summer break is to be done away with, there have to be gains in every category to make up for the loss.

{"body":"I actually agree that summer vacation is an archaic concept that should be abandoned.		Instead, I would prefer a method more similar to what many "desk jobs" employ: school is full-time, but you get several vacation days that you may use throughout the year (with parental permission).  School still occurs on these days, and whatever work occurs while you're out would need to be made up.		But, at least this theoretically balances the need for breaks while avoiding the "brain-drain" that occurs after being out of school for a prolonged period of time.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iamdrjonah","name":"t1_cros9bj","parent_id":"t3_37pdnm","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1432910912,"created_utc":1432907312}
