He didn't "steal" the general topic of parenthood or football, but that *specific concept.*		"I'm kind of an asshole" is *not* a joke.  It's a *subject.*  It's a *topic* about which someone could write jokes.  This is the downside to the kind of comedy where you just kind of talk about something in a meandering way: you can't claim someone stole from you just because they talked about the same thing, unless they stole a specific funny phrase.  Louis C.K's "bit" and Dennis Leary's "bit" on the same subject aren't the same "bit," they merely share the same subject.  All of the phrasing and specific concepts  and setups and punch lines are different.  It's clear that neither is derivative of the other.

If that were the case, then comedians would quickly be left with nothing left to talk about, since every time one of them discussed a subject, it would forever become off limits.  Can't talk about drugs, Cheech and Chong already did it.  Can't talk about white privilege, Chris Rock already covered that one.  Etcetera.

"Politics" isn't a topic, it's an entire category of topics: "Congress is ineffectual," "the President is an idiot," "fundamentalist Muslims are just like fundamentalist Christians," etc.   There are a lot of different funny ways to talk about each of those topics even within the category of "politics."

It's not approaching the topic in any different way.		If the topic "I admit that I'm an asshole and I'm not going to apologize for it" is a "bit" that can be "stolen," then Louis C.K. "stole" it from Andrew Dice Clay.  Is Louis C.K. therefore a hack, and the Dice is therefore a genius?  Does that change who your favorite comic is?  Further research might reveal that Dice "stole" it from somebody even earlier.

{"body":"> First off he doesn't act like everyone is stealing from him so that is just BS.		I don't know about that... I watched the show where he sat down with Dane Cook and had it out.  It was a powerful scene, but I feel like he was stretching in pressing his case.  Like, once he's talked about a general subject, he claims the power to tear anybody down who ever talks about the same subject again by accusing them of "stealing," even if he grants that it might have been unintentional, and that it was delivered completely differently.		Apparently: no matter how they approach it, no matter what wording they use, if there's ever a chance anybody saw Louis C.K. ever talk about a given topic, then if they ever talk about a remotely similar topic, he thinks they "stole" from him.		*FUCK THAT.*  It's an incredibly egomaniacal approach to comedy.  It's fucked up.  Which is part of his comedy: that *he might be wrong.*  (see: narrator, unreliable)  		The point being, Louis C.K. is an asshole.  But he has a bit about that, which (per you) Dennis Leary "stole," so you have to agree that your idol must be an asshole.  So maybe you shouldn't listen to him (again, see: narrator, unreliable)  .  Not only that, but he owns the trademark on being an asshole!  You're going to take the word of an asshole regarding what "bits" he "owns?"		>  You can at least admit without Louie that his asshole bit and song would never exist.		I have a pretty good feeling that Dennis Leary would still have done a bit about being an unrepentant asshole, exactly the same, even if he'd never seen a Louis C.K. set.   Because: he's actually an asshole.  Dennis Leary had a pretty strong comedic voice before Louis C.K. came along.  His bit about it is funny in a Dennis Leary way, not in a LCK way.  They're two completely different comedic voices.  I doubt if LCK was the one to make Dennis Leary first open his eyes and realize that he was an asshole, and was still OK with it.  I don't think they were *that* close.		But if LCK doesn't claim that Dennis Leary stole his "bit," then why are *you* making that claim?  Fuck you, for trying to speak on his behalf.  And maybe you should sit down and think a while about why he *hasn't* made that claim publicly, himself.  It's not like he's shy about calling people out on that shit.  He doesn't need you to do it for him.		In any case, let's go ahead and grant that comedians being incredibly self-deprecating and honest and open about their faults and problems is something that Louis C.K. did *first.*  Let's assume that he was the fucking Moses from the Mountaintop with that shit.  Forget about Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, or everybody else before your boy.  Because apparently your knowledge of comedy starts the day that LCK got critical acclaim, and there was no such thing as comedy before the moment that LCK singlehandedly invented self-aware and/or self-deprecating comedy for the first time in human fucking history.		"Fuck you, you ignorant idiot."  (Picture LCK chanting this in chorus with me while pointing at you) (Larry David is standing in the corner looking conflicted and uncomfortable.)		Question: should we disallow self-deprecating honesty from any other comedians, under the complaint of "stealing," or should we have more comedians feel free to talk about their faults, be open and honest, and speak from the heart?  LCK has spoken at length about comedians who have inspired him.  Should he abandon those approaches and try to do something that he wasn't inspired by, in order to avoid "stealing?"  Or should he go ahead and continue those approaches?		If you follow the LCK apparent surface narrative of "doing anything similar to anything I've ever done counts as stealing" then we get *less good comedy.* Whereas, if you let him merely be a benchmark that inspires other comics  to speak openly and brutally honestly about their own lives, we get *more good comedy.*		Which would you rather have?  Less good comedy, or more good comedy?		If you side with "less," then neither I nor LCK have any use for you.  You have no moral leg to stand on.  Because at the end of the day, **the only thing that matters** is: more people getting more better comedy.  There is no "moral" principle that's higher than that.  And if you're trying to take that away from us in the name of some copyright bullshit, then **fuck you,** and fuck the concept of copyright.  I'd rather laugh more often from more sources, rather than have less sources to laugh from.  Because I actually *like* comedy.

Such as:		>>Well yes, Dorian, the retrieval of post-modern socie ??? is that a bunny?		>**This is perfectly acceptable, as long as your protagonist isn???t losing their train of thought every other paragraph.** Too many ellipses can detract from the effectiveness of the prose (and some readers and writers find it irritating to no end).		[Kentlaw](http://www.kentlaw.edu/academics/lrw/grinker/LwtaEllipses.htm) does not talk about ellipses being used as pauses, but that makes sense since it's in the context of law which is formal as opposed to informal reddit comments.

{"body":"First off,		As a worker in a game shop, the cards against humanity people are the worst. They refuse to sell the product to retailers, forcing people to order it online. It is an example of the worst type of developer. 		If you see a copy of Cards on the self at a store, that store had to buy it at full price and often it is marked up at least 10 because that store must not lose money on a product.		Then you, the consumer, complains that the store is not as cheap as the website and the great majority of customers blame the store when it is the company you should be complaining about.		Now, the Cards team will tell you that it is due to this bullshit reason or another, but the real reason is greed. Many game shops are tired of companies like Cards Against Humanity, who want all the profit and do not support the community of board and card gaming. 		While the game is good, it is just a rip off of apples to apples with more risqu?? words. Apples to apples is owned by a company that supports game shops, by the way. If you are looking for a kid friendly cool game which was out way before Cards, I suggest Apples to Apples.		It's sad when a company will not support the game shops and the community by not selling to distributors.

{"body":"I want to point out to anyone thinking of trying this themselves: This kind of joke only works if you stick to the bit.		These kinds of interactions can read as either friendly teasing or subtle criticism. When you tease your friends, you exaggerate their negative traits, like if you tell your fat friend "Hey, can you pass me the butter if you're not eating it?" When you're subtly criticizing someone, you tend to hedge your statements so that they're facts. "Hey, uh, can I have the butter? You probably shouldn't have it anyway."		So if you try this with someone who doesn't know yet if it's criticism or teasing, you have to commit to the bit. If you softpedal any of it, it's no longer exaggeration, so it sounds like you're being passive-aggressive instead of fake-aggressive.		For an example, let's just change one word in the response to OP:		>You ~~definitely~~ *probably* just ordered the first expansion instead of the fifth. It's fine. You're probably just dumb. We're sending you a free 5th expansion to make up for how dumb you are.		It still works okay (because the context is clear, more on that in a sec), but it's much easier to see that as a judgement on OP's ability. She said he "definitely" made a mistake, and there's no way she could know that, except that OP is definitely dumb and definitely at fault. With that word choice, she's exaggerating past the point of plausibility. OP is sure that it's a joke now.		There are 2 other reasons why this works, both related to context rather than content: 1) OP set up the joke. He's teasing. That's important. You don't want to end up trying to tease someone who's pissed off. 2) She's saying "yes" instead of "no". She's offering a free set of the 5th expansion, so it's no longer a conflict. It's clear she's using humor to deflate the conflict, so there's no chance she's just trying to escalate.		I tease all the time, with customers, close friends, strangers on the train. It's a good way to diffuse conflict if the conditions are right. But you have to remember the 3 rules:		1) the other person has set up the joke.	2) you're not telling them no.	3 and most important) you commit to the bit. They have to know you're kidding.		If you're just starting out, stick to situations where the first two are true, and commit to it fully. There's some leeway on the first two rules, but not on the third.

{"body":"Dude, **of course** it's the same sentence, but there's a thing called **conventional style**, which depends on the language. Its role is to separate all the information you want and make the message stand out, so it follows certain layout rules.		English-language letters **require** a capital letter after the greeting, whereas German-language letters, for example, don't have that rule - the letter body typically starts with a lowercase letter.		If the conventional style followed proper grammar, any letter would start like this:	> Dear Anna, you still haven't returned my dildo. Love, Elsa.		Because even breaking the line in the middle of the sentence is not the most correct thing to do normally.		Conventional style says that it should look like this:	> Dear Anna,	> 	> ??	> 	> You still haven't returned my dildo.	> 	> ??	> 	> Love,	> 	> Elsa		Much more readable *and* you can instantly work out who is sending the message and who is supposed to receive it.
