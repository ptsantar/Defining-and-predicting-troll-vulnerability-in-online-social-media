Reluctantly she would move and I would sit in the right spot, but she would still sit in the middle, right next to me. I could ask her to move over, but that would be weird and she would think something is wrong and that I'm mad at her for some reason.		After finally getting the setup all right, I'd pull the move.

{"body":"While I'm not a fan of MLP, from what I've heard, I understand that it's target market is actually now kids this age, or even older. From what I gather, the creators set out to make a kids show, while still injecting their own brand of entertainment which appealed to them. Now that the show has progressed and gained a cult following among this age group, the cult has become the mainstream. The episodes are now made with the older group in mind.		There's a documentary by John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: TNG) that I keep meaning to watch: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronies:_The_Extremely_Unexpected_Adult_Fans_of_My_Little_Pony. It was inspired after de Lancie's personal experiences with meeting fans at conventions. At first he was grossed out, but later realised that bronies are real people with real feelings and real passions that aren't so different from ours.		In my opinion, disrespecting a person or a group of people based solely on what decisions they make that don't negatively affect others is morally reprehensible.		As far as myself, thinking back the only things I can really think of that made me an outsider were my music tastes at the time (mostly listened to classical), being in band, and being more passionate about video games than anyone I met. I never got beat up, but was definitely bullied psychologically. I did have prejudice at that time toward other facets of "nerdy" culture, like anime. I thought all those kids were weird and was repulsed.

As to the rest, ignoring negligence is a complete disregard for accountability on the part of the one that caused the injury. Why bother creating a safe space when you aren't held accountable for injuries caused by your design?		We don't live in Fallujah. We don't expect danger in everyday circumstances. There is a minimum standard of care that we demand of those that design the products we use and the environments we live, work, and shop in. Being unaware or unprepared for such unexpected danger isn't a lack of personal responsibility any more than eating produce from the grocery store without first testing it for poison is.

My comment was really highlighted (highlit?) in your last paragraph where you talk about the minimum standard of care. My point was that people in the US believe that the standard should be incredibly high on the part of the manufacturer/(system), whereas pretty much every other country in the world doesn't adhere to such high standards.
