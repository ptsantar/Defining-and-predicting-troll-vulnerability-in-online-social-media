Taken is a movie, Albania is a safe country, we don't traffic people like cattle, we don't go out killing people (last murder in my city was like 3-4 years ago) if an american/european/asian/african child thats missing would appear they would get sent home to their families and the kidnappers arrested, just like any country in the world, in fact an american would probably be safer here than in most western countries since we are close allies to the U.S .

{"body":"JJ Watt gives out full size candy bars. Says its one of his favorite parts about being rich.		Edit: [Proof](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-Watt-reciprocates-the-tidal-wave-of-fan-4469807.php)		>Watt was really excited to give out Halloween candy in his new home his rookie season, passing out sleeves full of candy bars to each kid.	This past season, the traffic was a little bit different. More parents came with their kids. Some kids arrived in different costumes. Some people lingered at his house longer than a reasonable amount of trick-or-treating time.	If the Texans give him an extension, as they're likely to do before his contract expires after the 2014 season, and Watt knows he'll be in Houston longer, he might move to regain some privacy. But he doesn't want to do that.	"I love my house," Watt said. "I'm not a gated community kind of guy."			[And another one](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/pete-prisco/24642045/watch-texans-star-jj-watt-is-bigger-more-focused-than-ever)	>Watt is such a homebody that one of the things he does each year is to get sheer joy out of handing out candy on Halloween. He sends pictures to staffers with kids and fans coming to his door dressed in his No. 99 jersey, something that truly flatters him when they do.	Oh, and he makes sure they know he gives out the big bars of candy. No little bars for this big guy. But that's about the only type of bars you will hear next to Watt's name.

I wanted to make sure we had a variety of treats to break up the monotony of getting mostly sugary, cheap stuff from other houses.		The parents that even bothered to come to our house told their kids to only take 1 thing and hovered like bats, despite our assurances that "No really, we have MORE than enough for everyone. We expected them to take a couple things."

{"body":"It is. Costumes get more and more expensive each year, even the cheaply made flimsy ones. Most kids change their mind too often for someone to have the time to make one, and not everyone has the skills to do so. 	It costs an arm and a leg to buy candy, so not as many people give it out. Not as many people giving out candy means you're paying $$$ for a costume your kid is going to wear for a block. Of the people who do give out candy, it's usually weird shit no one has heard of and your kid doesn't even want to eat it. 	Here in Ontario the weather has been absolutely terrible the last few Halloweens as well, last year it was pouring down rain and freezing..so unless you get the costume a little big for your kid for them to layer, they end up having to wear a jacket over their costume. So you spent $$$ on a costume that doesn't even get seen.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"La_Strada","name":"t1_cl93alh","parent_id":"t1_cl930gb","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1413293712,"created_utc":1413290112}

This is fairly acceptable, however, they confiscated things from over 100 students by searching their backpacks. It was some seniors cigarettes or sometimes something as small as a pocket knife on a key chain, but people were pissed. The faculty refused to give anyone their things back because it "could be involved in drug related activities". There was a kid in my class whose medication was confiscated, and they only gave that back with a visit to the nurse and a parent coming I'm. There was some general anger about punishment with no rules being broken.		Edit: they did get 3 kids though when they sniffed cars. They're allowed to search vehicles via a little pass you need to park on property that says "you will submit to a search of your vehicle if asked".

{"body":"it really depends on the area you live in etc.  If you live, or at least go trick or treating (collecting candy door to door) in a rich neighborhood, you get full sized or King Sized candy bars.  If you go to your average middle class neighborhood its gonna depend on the person, sometimes they give you one fun sized piece, other times they give you a hand full of different sizes, that varies from person to person.		Usually a family will buy 2-3 bags of fun sized candy, some more some less. so maybe around $15-$30 U.S for it all together. It also depends on if you live in a neighborhood full of kids or not. My neighborhood only has about 10-15 'little' kids in, so my parents usually give them a handful or two of candy and only spend about $15 max on the whole debacle. 		Yes, Halloween is only on October 31st.		And nothing really happens to those who don't participate. People who dont want trick or treaters will usually turn their porch light off so that nobody approaches the house. While others really go all out and decorate their yards / houses / dress up themselves.  		It's kind of a thing for children really, teenagers and adults tend to go to parties of some sort.
