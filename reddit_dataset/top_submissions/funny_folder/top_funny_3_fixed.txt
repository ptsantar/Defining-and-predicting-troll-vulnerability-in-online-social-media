Humans invest a huge amount of energy in brain development, energy which can't then be invested in the ability to walk out of the womb or feed oneself. There is a limit to how much energy the mother can be reasonably expected to invest in the offspring while pregnant before the state of being pregnant starts to impede on the mothers own success. Humans also have notably vulnerable pregnant females, with more of the mother's energy going to the offspring than any other species. This huge investment in brain power creates an equally huge burden on the parents to support their offspring for over ten years before true independence. This is an extraordinary amount of time, considering similar species such as chimpanzees or gorillas can be independent closer to age five or six.

{"body":"Infant mortality rates in Africa/Asia in 1950 was about 180 per 2,000 live births. Roughly the same rate as in the US in 1915. So one could say that even in 1915 getting to your first birthday was a pretty big deal.		Of course in the middle ages it was much much worse with infant mortality rates of between 15 and 20% (i.e. 300 to 400 per 2,000 live births.) In other words the infant mortality in 1915 USA was about 50 to 60% of what it was in the middle ages. The infant mortality in the USA didn't drop to below 25% of what it was in the middle ages until the 1940s. Right now in the US it is about 5% of what it was in the middle ages.		So, yeah. Just a few generations ago even in the US it was a big deal to make it to the age of 1 year. Most children weren't even named until they were 1 year old, and many births weren't even registered until then. You can still see this in Catholic sacraments as a child is usually not "christened" until they are about 1 year old. That is when they used to get their first name. (i.e. Their "Christian Name".) Before christening the children were just referred to as "baby" or "junior" etc...

{"body":"I'll take your underdeveloped throat and raise you a completely undeveloped esophagus. She got it fixed at about 2 and was eating pretty normally by 3, but holy fucking shit, the toddler phase...		Most parents realize that it's difficult to keep foreign items out of their kids mouths during the toddler years, and it's surely a struggle for everyone, but imagine going through that knowing that *every particle* has to be surgically removed. I gated my child into one area of the home and was maniacal about what went in and out of that area, but then we'd have someone over and all bets were off. 		It's like, I know these people mean well and just want to see their loved ones, but I've never wanted to stab people in the eye with a screwdriver so bad. My father in law would come over and empty the change in his pocket onto the coffee table. They had to leave so we could run to the ER real quick and have a penny surgically removed. Another relative brought toys and left a small piece of the cardboard packaging on the floor. Another surgery. My mom was cooking in the kitchen and thought she'd let her play in there while she cooked. She ate some diced onions that fell on the floor. 		I remember one time we had a social worker out to the house to evaluate her for PT, OT, speech, that kind of thing. I remember she spread her paperwork out on the floor and my DD immediately crawled over to check things out. I frantically yelled "She's going to eat your paperwork!!!" to which she replied "Oh, it's okay, I have more". -_-		And then people would complain that we weren't visiting them enough!

It is a little harder to get the bikers speed so I took the average biking speed from google, which is 9.6 mph or approx. 14 ft/sec. I estimate her distance from the path of the car when she falls to be about 15 to 20 ft assuming the car is about 5 ft wide.	From the time she falls to the time the car passes her projected path is about 1.25 seconds.	In 1.25 seconds the girl travels 17.5 ft.

I'd say that for the dads, when they see their children in danger, the brain switches into full overdrive, doesn't think twice, just acts immediately, it doesn't check twice like it would otherwise.

{"body":"When it comes to infant care (especially if it's your first child and the first nanny you have hired) it's a great comfort to parents who cannot stay home. On the one hand, freedom in childhood to do reckless things like ride down the stairs on a crib mattress, play in a creek by your house that's filled with leeches and snapping turtles, and do ninja jumps off the couches (I did every one of those, just to name a few) can be very important to a child's development. But on the other hand, a parent's first responsibility is to not let anything detrimental to their development, including abuse and other forms of harm. Yes, my three siblings and I turned out fine, but what if we hadn't?","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KathrynTheGreat","name":"t1_cr8h7sf","parent_id":"t1_cr8gpdi","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1431573469,"created_utc":1431569869}
{"body":"Yeah that's all very understandable. And certainly baby monitors are a good idea. And please let me say that I don't want to tell anyone how to do their business. The following is all assuming we're talking about kids as they get older than toddlers and develop increasing amounts of independence.		I would just worry that there are psychological consequences to filming your kids' behavior all the time. I get that we want to reduce risk, and having this tech available might put one in a position where they think "if only I had cameras, then this wouldn't have happened". But I could easily imagine kids not experimenting and not having adventures because they know they're being watched. People act differently when they know or even think that they're being watched and judged for their actions. If there is never a time when they're not being watched, when will they even discover who they are as individuals? How would they even know what independence means? 		The tools are available to basically have your kids' every activity be monitored. So people are going to use them. They reduce a certain kind of risk. But they may introduce new kinds of risk that are harder to imagine or anticipate because they're occurring in the kid's mind.		I can only imagine if I was being watched all the time as a kid, I wouldn't have made many mistakes. Because of fear of being watched and judged more than anything else. I also wouldn't have learned anything because I would never have a chance to do anything without being subject to judgment. 		Surveillance as a child-rearing tool isn't like having a baby monitor or child-proof medicine bottles. It's convenient for a parent but potentially could turn a kid into an impotent, fearful wreck. How do sheltered kids turn out when they enter the real world? Sometimes fine, but sometimes they go apeshit because they've never had a chance to experiment. Cameras watching your kids all the time is a pretty extreme kind of psychological sheltering, in my opinion.		This is all assuming the parent would use the recordings as a way of saying "I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar". Which they would. Why wouldn't they? They have the tools. What if they don't use the tools and regret it later? That's always the fear. That's why people put kids on leashes. Most of us see that as degrading and unnecessary. I personally think constant surveillance is degrading and, while it could be very useful, incurs a psychological toll that could be far more harmful than letting your kids get into the kind of trouble we all got in when we were young and thought our parents weren't looking.		Sorry for the wall o' text. And while I may disagree with the idea, I would never blame a parent for going the camera route.

{"body":"I'll try to keep this brief.		[A dad catches his infant from falling off the couch](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/35uyik/dad_instincts/)		Score of +9,000 at present, 98% upvoted. 		>Ah yes- babies. Doing their best to die, and make you look like a total asshole. [+3,400, top]		As always I like the top comment, but it gets jerked to death (also as always). Babies want to die, 		>as a toddler who disassembled anything with screws, outlet plates were obvious choices.  my dad snuck up when I was caught in the act and flicked the back of my hand. his answer to my crying was "did that outlet bite you?  probably shouldn't play with it then." 		>dad parenting.  it's effective. [+400]		If mom did it she'd be a bitch. Dad parenting - effective.		Next we have 6 gifs of dads with quick reflexes stopping kids getting hurt. Thousands and thousands of upvotes, each with Reddit gold. 		>god, babies suck at staying alive..[+600, top level comment]		Yep, same as before, just as upvoted.		More gifs of superhero dads with quick reflexes. 		>That look she gave him afterwards definitely means he's getting some tonight. [+300]		What look? That half-second where she looked at him? There was no look. Seriously, [see for yourself](http://share.gifyoutube.com/m6807g.gif). There isn't so much as a facial expression. 'He's getting some tonight' - dads are not only heroes, they are getting that action too. Except, you know, they're not, not really. It's just some weird fantasy dreamed up by internet boys, I have to assume. "You stopped the baby from falling off the couch, I must reward you with grateful sex".		There are a million comments like "Second gif: didn't even drop his other kid while making the catch. Impressive." [+350]. All praising the dads.		If gifs aren't enough, there are anecdotes about people's hero dads.		/r/dadreflexes, /r/dadjokes, it's all here, all positive.		>His wife is just like, "I am so wet right now."[+150]		She's really not. She's really, really not. She's lifting her infant back onto the couch and out of harm's way.		>>All I saw was her saying, "why the fuck aren't you watching her?" [+60]		No, no you didn't. That didn't happen. That gif is less than 10 seconds long, why are you lying about things that we can easily refute and debunk? Why is this upvoted? Because mom is an ungrateful cunt, but dad is a glorious superhero, that's why.		>>>In a sea of idiots who thinks that face means this dad is getting some action, the married men know what's really going on here.		>>>It's "obviously his fault" so he is most likely not being praised for his amazing save.   [+50]		It's just endless, it really is. Where exactly does she blame him? When? How? Why? It's not there. They can't hate the mom because she does nothing wrong, so they imagine that actually she is a friend-zoning blame-mongering blue-balling ingrate. And if we have to lie to each other and to ourselves to get this anti-mom hatefuck going, then that is what she shall do, because glorifying dad makes me hard, but villifying mom is what makes me cum.		>>>>"We are so getting a babysitter this weekend."[+60]		>>>>>"We are so getting a babysitter this weekend."[+60]		Endless. Sorry, I know I know, brevity.		>I came here looking for comments on the wife's nice tits. So, yeah. I'm that guy. [+40]		Well I suppose mom still has one use. 		There you have it. Dad is a superhero, mom is a bitch. Not the worst thing we've ever seen on this site. Oh, bonus research: search metareddit.com for 'dad' and 'father' and they're all really positive, jokey subs. Search 'mom' or 'mother' and it's all /r/asamother, /r/badmothers, and porn.

I sat him on my leg and hugged him, and instantly began to cry with emotion. He hugged me and said he was so scared and thank you. There was someone standing ~3 feet away from him, and was in process of going into the pond him self (a family friend).		After i got dried off, realized i ruined my iphone, had some nice cuts on my feet from my dive, he told me it took me probably 2 seconds from when he hit the water, to me getting in the water and him out, and that he had never seen something so amazing.
