I have used one popular one in Python called 'Beautiful Soup' which is very powerful. I used it to scrap a wikipedia page for facts based on a certain day (August 13 facts for eg). The catch here is that is requires you to parse the HTML DOM and your app can break if the web-site changes a few things in the layout or naming convention (since you are basically traversing the DOM either using the current layout or 'id/'classes' in HTML whose name could change). 		Also, in order to automate it, the URL structure should be fairly structured so you can query different pages using URLs, and then run the script to scrape data from it. For example for my fact scraping, I hit the following URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_13 	Note that here, if I want any other day (October 29), I just change the last field in the URL to October_29 and hence in such a way, I can scrape facts for all days.

{"body":"It's actually a fairly new concept introduced to me this quarter in my Programming Concepts course, so someone with a better understand of it could probably explain it better. But how I understand it is this:		Lexical analysis is what breaks things up into tokens for the parser to go through. So, say for example he's using python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape Netflix for movie data. When you load a webpage into a BeautifulSoup object to be parsed and manipulated, it must go through and strip down the webpage into lexemes (sometimes just called tokens) so that the parser can go through and figure out if the grammar and syntax of what you just loaded makes sense. It's the job of lexical analysis to, for example, say anything in < >'s in a webpage is a tag, and lump them into a category for the parser to understand. Lexical analysis in the context of say, compiler design, is what tells the parser that "IF THEN ELSE" etc. are conditional keywords, and things like "INT STRING ARRAY" etc. are identifiers. It's then the parser's job to figure out if you used those tokens in a way that makes sense.","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Smith7929","name":"t1_cyur2co","parent_id":"t1_cyup8fh","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1452590433,"created_utc":1452561633}

{"body":"Great website - the "available on netflix" is an awesome feature. I'm hitting the age (early 30s) where I'm finally running into people who haven't seen extremely iconic movies (according to my generation) so a website like this which aggregates all the ratings is nice so I can link people to movies that everyone has said are good. Great UI implementation too!		Some requests - worded from the perspective of a user who would send this page to a friend to encourage him to see some good movies he hasnt and hopefully they'd explore the site after to find more movies (I hope these are seen as more helpful than critical) :		_Note: I'm assuming you're the web developer so the following is written with language intended for developers._		1. Could we get a token in the url so we can deep link to movies pages? I know angular will make this difficult or impossible (maybe a history pushstate?). I'm on your homepage, I see a Movie, click it and it shows me a modal with a video - but the url doesn't update, so I can't link this to a pal and say "here's that movie you need to watch, look everyone reviews it highly"		2. Could you put the movie names in actual markup on the page (within .film) so Control + F works? A cheap solution would be putting an absolutely positioned div with the movie title in each film div and give it an overflow of hidden - control F should still find this. They won't see what they've searched highlighted, but the page will jump to it and confirm it exists on the page. Note : .film is floated so overflow:hidden could have some weird effects.		3. Could you make clicking the cinesift logo up top go back to the default landing page and/or reset all search filters? So if I play around with some search settings, I can just click the logo to start over.		4. Could you make the directors searchable from the search bar? Wouldn't even need to explicitly state this is as a feature, but would be nice if just searching "Tarantino" brought up his films. Perhaps instead this could just be a fallback when a title search returns no results? 		5. The grid/list view chugs really bad when you have lots of elements (you've triggered infinite scroll a bunch of times). In my case $('.film').length was 240 and it took 28 seconds to switch on the chrome profiler, also locked the entire browser then crashed it (whew - reddit or RES saved this post). I'd consider purging the container, then just outputting the first "page" of videos again. Also the toggleables show a noticeable delay too once you have lots of videos - If you turn on paint-flashing in your console you'll see that expanding _any_ search option causes a full page re-paint.		6. Having the "advanced search" link change places after opening it is a little confusing - might be more ideal to keep it on the top, in the same place it shows in it's open state.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lucidentropy","name":"t1_cyun8nz","parent_id":"t3_40gr9e","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1452584177,"created_utc":1452555377}
