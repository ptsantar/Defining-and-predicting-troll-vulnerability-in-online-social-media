{"body":"#####&#009;		######&#009;		####&#009;	 [**Mammalian diving reflex**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian%20diving%20reflex): [](#sfw) 		---		>The __mammalian diving reflex__ is a [reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex) in [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) which optimizes [respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology\)) to allow staying underwater for extended periods of time. It is exhibited strongly in [aquatic mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_mammal) ([seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped),  [otters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter), [dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin), etc.), but exists in weaker versions in other mammals, including [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human), including babies up to 12 months old (see [Infant swimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_swimming)). [Diving birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bird), such as [penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin), have a similar diving reflex. Every animal's diving reflex is triggered specifically by cold water contacting the face  – water that is warmer than 21 °C (70 °F) does not cause the reflex as strongly [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*], and neither does submersion of body parts other than the face [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]. Children exhibit the reflex more dramatically than adults, and can thus potentially survive longer. This is for a variety of reasons, including higher surface area to volume (so they cool faster), and better recovery from oxygen deprivation. In a 2012 case, a 21 month old child inhaled cold water and was immersed for approximately 25 minutes, being pulled from the water with no breathing or heartbeat, and was revived in hospital after approximately 50 minutes without a heartbeat. He was warmed up slowly and brought out of a therapeutic [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma) after two days, making a full recovery. 		>		---		^Interesting: [^Blood ^shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_shift) ^| [^Thoracic ^wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall) ^| [^Darren ^O'Donnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_O%27Donnell) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmj2quh) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cmj2quh)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autowikibot","name":"t1_cmj2quh","parent_id":"t1_cmj2q6r","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1417574232,"created_utc":1417545432}

The goal is to get the heart rate up then break for a minute then do it again. 		Even if your heart rate isn't high, do this anyway. It's great for your cardiovascular system.
