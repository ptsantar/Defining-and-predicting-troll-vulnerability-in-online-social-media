{"body":"Edit: [Here's the interactive version.](http://electronsoup.net/nsfw_subreddits/) (Working on getting the labels to show.)

This map is based on [/u/uglyasablasphemy's 'related subreddits' data set](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3z2fc8/this_is_how_reddit_looks_like_if_you_link_every/). I simply filtered out all the non-NSFW and quarantined subreddits, as well as any 'orphaned' subreddit (no incoming links from another subreddit). There are 2267 nodes and 14437 edges.		The graph is laid out in [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io) using the ForceAtlas 2 layout*. The subreddits are sized by number of subscribers (though not to scale, otherwise big subreddits would take up too much space). The colour scheme uses Gephi's clustering function, so subreddits of the same colour are more closely related to each other than to other colours. Zoom in and see if you can discern any themes to the clusters - I believe some are content-related (and quite obvious) while others are not as clear. There are some peripheral subreddits with no links; these were linked to by one of the orphaned subreddits, and thus have no visible links.		**Non-default layout settings: Prevent Overlap = true; Scaling = 100; Stronger Gravity = true; Gravity = 2.0*","depth":0,"score":1525,"ups":1525,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"flashman","name":"t1_cyj6ecr","parent_id":"t3_3z4k7v","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1451757305,"created_utc":1451728505}

{"body":"A female dogs vagina is tighter and more muscular than a humans. They also have a ring muscle that is extra sensitive for a male human as it lines up perfectly with the head of the average male and works wonders on the glands. A man can sit perfectly still and the female will milk him to orgasm. Their internal body temperature is over 100 degrees. And this is out of heat.	When in heat they are more demanding for attention and they are significantly tighter. The vaginal canal changes texture and has little nubblies just past the ring that make a human males head almost too sensitive. Causing the most powerful ejaculations you could ever feel.	Dogs and humans have been living together for tens of thousands of years. The harmony between the two as sexual partners is something like no other.	Partners of the same species cant even come close to what dogs and humans can do for each other.

{"body":"Not really sure why it's controversial outside of misguided social movements personally. I had a comment accusing me of claiming women have no sex drive because they have different porn habits from men in this thread already. Alrighty then.		Either way it's basically verbatim from what I was taught in sexual psychology and evolutionary psychology when I was in university. A woman's youth (and many attractiveness features are tied to youthfulness) is very impactful on her fertility, while it is far less impactful on a man's fertility. On the other hand, more so historically than today, a man's resources were the biggest impact he could bring to having healthy offspring. But historically in the context of evolved preferences makes perfect sense, seeing as the female role in society only changed in the past 10,000 years (I figure pre vs post agriculture had to have started these changes). On an evolutionary timescale, that's quite insignificant.

I couldn't stand to watch straight porn for a number of reasons. one, lots of young girls hate their bodies and can't stand to watch a woman in porn because of it, and two most straight porn is about submissive women getting dominated and humiliated, not to mention all the fake orgasms and fake nails and fake boobs. A lot of straight women find that offensive and always carry around that perception of porn as being about degrading women. There is very little straight porn that has hot guys and lenghthy cunnilingus. Or submissive guys, shit, you can only find those in gay porn.

{"body":"As a woman, I'm always sort of surprised at how many young girls are down to post nudes on a site with millions of strangers (and they aren't getting paid for it). I'm not a prude. So I'm not against this by any means. I also can see the appeal of it being a thrill, knowing people are looking at your naked body and getting off on it. And one aspect of it, is getting compliments (boosts their confidence). 		But I guess it just kind of surprises me at how young a lot of these people are, and how one sided it is (a lot more girls than guys doing it). Although with Reddit being mostly male, I guess it's not a shocker. Even crazier, when I see girls post pics of their face though. Like damn. 		Not sure if this was accurate, but I saw something on Reddit last year, that said the #1 fantasy/fetish women had (in this big survey done), was Rape. So it's always fascinating to me, to see how Rape fantasy is so prevalent in terms of what woman like (assuming those surveys were accurate), and that so many women on here love to have strangers ogle and masturbate to their naked bodies.		Of course all that said, fetish + gone wild is someone being in control (which is different then someone in real life coming up and harassing you in a normal setting where you aren't even consenting, or in the mood). So that makes sense. It's just, most of my life, a lot of the women I've known, always seem to say they want the opposite of what it feels like they actually want?

{"body":"Thanks for that insight. I can relate to that. I mean, as a woman, it can be really sexy to have someone dominate you. It's not my personal fetish, so it's not something I always want. Because I also like gentle guys (I know, everyone is different). But I can still understand the domination aspect.		I appreciate you explaining that it's probably that, vs the idea of an actual rape (I mean, a fantasy/rape). That makes a lot more sense to me. 		I just still find it interesting, because at least in my experiences, almost all my female friends (and a lot of the women I've been around), it just feels like what they are saying, isn't what they actually want. Again, Reddit doesn't = the entire world. And everyone has their own subjective and unique sexuality. 		Sometimes I just see all the women on Reddit, and I feel so out of touch lol But I will say, I've always respected an individuals sexuality. I don't care how kinky/messed up it is, as long as it's consenting adults, I'm all for it. I never got why some people are judgmental about that kind of thing. As long as people are enjoying their life and not bothering anyone else, right on.		I guess, my post probably came off really stupid. I sincerely apologize. It's hard to convey what I'm trying to say. I guess sometimes I just compare myself to other women, because I find it interesting to see what other women actually like. And it just feels like, overall women are going in a direction that seems contradictory to what I've always thought women liked or disliked. And it's just fascinating to me.
