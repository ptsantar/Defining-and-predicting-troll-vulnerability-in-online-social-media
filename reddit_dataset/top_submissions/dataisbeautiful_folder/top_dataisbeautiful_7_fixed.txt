{"body":""The Ol' Reddit Switcharoo" is a meme in which you point out a [paraprosdokian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraprosdokian) phrase in a Reddit comments section by replying "Ahhh, the ol' Reddit switcharoo" and linking to the most recent previous instance of the meme. In theory this produces a perfect chain, in practise it's a mess.		Raw data source is the reddit comment corpus by [/u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix](	https://np.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/)		Algorithm:		1. Regex scan to find all comments that loosely match the format of a switcharoo and save them as a list of seeds.	2. For each seed, walk down the tree until it reaches a dead end at the root. If that root is newly seen, add it to a list of roots.	3. For each root, walk up all reachable branches and save the nodes	4. Prune all leaves. These mostly consist of switcharoos that don't contribute to chain length, and all meta discussion. (this step is skipped in the force directed version)	5. When a chain crosses through a deleted comment or banned/private subreddit, connect the severed root to the most recent available node (these links are shown in red)	 		Visualised in [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) via [Ruby Graphviz](https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz), annotated in Photoshop.","depth":0,"score":1363,"ups":1363,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"faymontage","name":"t1_cvwv7tn","parent_id":"t3_3og4hs","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1444684250,"created_utc":1444655450}

{"body":"It breaks my heart that you're getting downvoted.		I mean, I understand why. Some people are probably sympathizing with geeky women who want to fully immerse themselves in the joy of their hobbies and professions but can't because they're constantly getting hit on, putting up with lewd humor, and overall constantly being reminded in a multitude of small ways that they're seen as women first and programmers second, being made to dedicate a corner of their mind at all times to thinking about how their gender plays into their current situation when they'd rather use those neurons to keep track of what's on the call stack. 		I can only understand the lived experience of a geeky woman from the outside, but to the extent that I can feel for someone who is having a problem I've never had, I do. From that perspective, comments like yours are making life a little harder for geeks of the fairer sex. This isn't intended as a criticism because I know that effect wasn't what you were going for.		At the same time, I remember vividly what it was like to be a teenage male geek, socially awkward, but with a strong desire to connect. I was shy most of the time, but some part of me understood that when two people get into a passionate discussion about something they both love, things just flow. Nobody wonders what to say, and the mutual respect and admiration just circulates back and forth, building as the conversation goes on and on. People who do that tend to end up hanging out together, their relationships growing and strengthening over time. I had that experience many times with my good male friends, but the thought of one day leaning on a woman's workbench, staring down at a PCB as she deftly soldered components into place leaving perfect, shiny, concave joints filled me with a feeling I couldn't properly describe. Part of it was desire, but not a sexual kind. More than any other part of her, what I wanted to see after that was her sparkling eyes as she plugged her invention into a power supply and was rewarded by indicator LEDs illuminating solid and steady. I wanted to laugh in delight with her in our mutual connection to the machine, and through that, to each other. But when I looked around, I saw few women who loved technology that way, and in them I did not find the same desire for connection that I felt. I began to wonder whether I would ever find someone like that, and if I did, whether we would develop a relationship in which she felt I was as rare and special as I felt she was. It was a lonely feeling.		Maybe I'm projecting, but I imagine that's the feeling behind your comment too. If so, please accept a big internet hug. I hope things turn out the way you want, either with the woman you were asking about or with someone like her.","depth":6,"score":25,"ups":25,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goatcoat","name":"t1_cvxo9ec","parent_id":"t1_cvxf3oq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1444730132,"created_utc":1444701332}

In the force directed graph, the actual position of a node doesn't mean anything (no x or y axis), so you want to just position each node to minimize the connections crossing over each other. "Force-directed graph drawing" is a method for deciding the position of each node. It is actually a physical simulation in which each connection is like a spring, and each node has a charge that repels other nodes. You start by positioning each node randomly, then run the simulation for as many cycles as it takes for an equilibrium to form, then save those positions.		It is showing a tree structure that starts at the original switcharoo, then all the switcharoos that link to that, then all the switcharoos that link to those, and so on.","depth":1,"score":32,"ups":32,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"faymontage","name":"t1_cvx68v6","parent_id":"t1_cvx5syg","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1444702867,"created_utc":1444674067}

{"body":""The Ol' Reddit Switcharoo" is a meme in which you point out a [paraprosdokian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraprosdokian) phrase in a Reddit comments section by replying "Ahhh, the ol' Reddit switcharoo" and linking to the most recent previous instance of the meme. In theory this produces a perfect chain, in practise it's a mess.		Raw data source is the reddit comment corpus by [/u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix](	https://np.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/)		Algorithm:		1. Regex scan to find all comments that loosely match the format of a switcharoo and save them as a list of seeds.	2. For each seed, walk down the tree until it reaches a dead end at the root. If that root is newly seen, add it to a list of roots.	3. For each root, walk up all reachable branches and save the nodes	4. Prune all leaves. These mostly consist of switcharoos that don't contribute to chain length, and all meta discussion. (this step is skipped in the force directed version)	5. When a chain crosses through a deleted comment or banned/private subreddit, connect the severed root to the most recent available node (these links are shown in red)	 		Visualised in [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) via [Ruby Graphviz](https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz), annotated in Photoshop.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"quarter93","name":"t1_cvxno34","parent_id":"t3_3og4hs","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1444729221,"created_utc":1444700421}
