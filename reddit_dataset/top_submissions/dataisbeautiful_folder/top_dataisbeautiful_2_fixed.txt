I'm a guy so this may be a little unusual but to me it's the part BEFORE the orgasm that's the best and maintaining that for as long as possible and holding off on orgasming even when I easily could and I have to put in effort not to is when it's most pleasurable. A split second after I orgasm it's not as pleasurable as before and it's just sort of too sensitive. I also may be a little unusual in that sometimes I ejaculate a little bit (but it's more precum and less semen than one with an orgasm), even multiple times when I've tried real hard, before I actually orgasm. It happens when I let myself go over the edge ever so slightly and then stop myself rather than fully letting go and if I do it fast enough I don't have an orgasm or a refractory period, stay just as hard and it continues to feel just as pleasurable.

{"body":""is it just about popping one off"	a slang term for having an orgasm.. is it about the orgasm only?		"totally forgettable" - Uh yeah, is it totally forgettable? Is it so severely lacking in pleasure as compared to the orgasm it hardly even factors into whether or not the sex was good or you remember your orgasms rather than sensations before the orgasm when you think about sex?		There's nothing inherently negative about anything I said, but since you're a whiny bitch who must say otherwise harmless things with a bitchy, adversarial attitude you projected your own shitty attitude onto my words. You know what my actual motivation was? Curiosity, like I said, but you can't seem to believe because you must be the sort of person who thinks they already know everything and would only ask those sorts of questions to try to prove your own misguided point.		If I ask "why do you like this?" rather than more specific questions I probably won't get the answers to the questions I am interested in.		The only reason you interpreted ANYTHING I said as negative is because you do those things with belligerence and ASSUMED my motivation was to put people down and think myself superior.		So yeah, you are the dumb, intolerant and overly defensive one.

You are not asking if the orgasm is the best part, you are asking if the orgasm is the best part because the rest is totally forgettable and lacking in pleasure.  Again, do you not see the difference?  		Your inclusion of "just" and "totally forgettable" are negative connotations.

If you were genuinely curious, that would be obvious from your questions and you wouldn't need to point out that you are curious.  Further, you would give equal (or nearly equal) time to your questions as the context of your questions.

{"body":"To be fair, I'm not necessarily saying it *should* last much longer. What I'm saying is that I tend to want it to last longer because it's more pleasurable overall and ends up being more satisfying in the end. I didn't realize that other people were that much different because nobody had explicitly said as much. For such a basic behavior and such a commonly shared experience I'm surprised that two completely differently approaches are considered more rewarding to individuals. It's hard-wired in a primitive part of the brain and I thought would mean nearly identical behavior with the usual sorts of variation. Hell, I just read that some people strictly DON'T like orgasms.		It'd be like finding out that everyone else craves sugar and that's why they eat it but the taste is forgettable and they just want it over with so they no longer have the craving. And for them, the best part is a brief moment when the last bite sates the craving completely, albeit temporarily. In this case, though it's not exactly like sweets, because it'd more like the dessert or whatever starts out okay, then each bite is better and better but if I give in and have slightly too big a bite suddenly it's cloyingly sweet and I don't want anymore for a while. If I just keep nibbling at slightly bigger bites, with less and less room for too big a bite, it gets tastier and tastier up to a point that's more or less limited by the quality of the dessert.		It's not just sex. Even masturbating I've pretty much never enjoyed orgasming in under 5 minutes. It's not as pleasurable and it sort of drains me while also being notably disappointing. There is one notable exception though: when I haven't done it for a "long time" (like a week or more) and it's been bugging me almost non-stop to the point I actively avoid looking at attractive people because I know it'll just make me crave it an uncomfortable amount. In those circumstances, I can finish quickly and feel satisfied, but I've noticed even during those times if I just let it last a little bit longer than the minimum it not only starts out better but gets way better. Sometimes it's too much for me to resist though.		And if my partner prefers one way over the other I'd certainly like to know.

{"body":"Actually NOT liking orgasms could be any range of mental health issues, so more likely AFRAID of orgasms, is what those ppl mean.		It's quite possible that the "do it quickly" ppl are less empathetic towards their partners needs.	The "take it slow make it last" ppl like yourself are more engaged with their partners needs and realise this is a more fulfilling way to go about things. I know that's my option.		A lot of this is down to societal and personal conditioning though, if your social group sees sex as something to be ashamed about that's more than likely how you will feel too.		If it's seen as something to get over quickly, that's how you will view it.		If it's viewed as something to rejoice and enjoy and savour .. Well that's what you'll likely do.		Of course people's internal views and proclivities can throw all that off too! Which is why there are such a wide variety of sexual variations and we are more than likely all the richer for it!		I'd largely agree with your view that "I thought everyone else had sex this way" and by that I mean unhurried, long lasting and fulfilling. However feedback I have gotten is that this is not the case. Current SO is delighted with the situation though, and if I remember rightly was initially shocked that sex could be that good.

{"body":"You know it might be that big a problem. For one, condoms can dull sensation enough that you more or less need to work up to the same level of pleasure rather than getting there right away and you may even need to put in much more effort to push yourself over the edge. For another, if you are cumming that fast you can just orgasm, keep pleasuring her (I'm assuming you're a guy who likes girls), and go again relatively soon (less than 5 minutes to as much as 15 for the refractory period, depending - I think less for younger men).		But, supposedly there are things you can do as a man to help with control. Yeah there's stuff like thinking of baseball or whatever the cliche is, thinking of something disgusting or unsexy but that's not necessarily needed either though in a pinch it might help.		Have you ever tried to stop urinating midstream? When I first did it it actually hurt. Like, it was more than just uncomfortable it was a little painful. But if you practice this it becomes merely uncomfortable and then you can do it more easily and it's not so bad. I've heard the same muscles are involved and from personal experience I think this is true. It's something similar to if not actually kegels and I've heard those help men with control too though I'm not as sure about that. Also, you can practice holding off for a little bit when you masturbate. Just a little bit of progress can add up. A couple seconds can become minutes and once you can delay gratification for a bit you can do it a lot longer.

{"body":"Yes I did, well sort of figured it out anyway. It's one of two things (or maybe it's both) you need to do to get a period to show up as an Activity. I'm not sure which is the more connected thing, but I just did them both and it works. One is, you have to make sure your heart rate is in the target zone for the whole duration of the activity. So if you keep the default HR zones, I think you have to be at the minimum of the fat burn zone (which will be set dependent on your age). You can either keep the default zones or set a single custom zone.		Two, you have to have the activity last longer than 10 minutes. So what I did is set the monitor on your wrist to begin activity mode by pressing and holding the button, then once you're done and it's longer than 10 minutes and your HR was up in the active zone, you can end the activity with a long button press again. Now when you sync, that time should show on your list of Activites. In the desktop webpage, if you click Log, then Activities, there's a list there.
