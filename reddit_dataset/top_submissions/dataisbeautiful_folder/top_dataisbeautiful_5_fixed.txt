{"body":"I generated these graphs using Google BigQuery reddit [post](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_posts) & [comment](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments) datasets for the period January - December 2015. From the BigQuery data I computed a "total karma" value for each redditor, which is plotted on the graph versus the rank of that individual (rank 1 being the user with the highest karma).		For the purposes of this visualization, "active" is defined as a user making at least one non-deleted comment or post during 2015. This comes out to a total of 10,444,708 active redditors. If lurkers were included in the total count, the 1% would have an even larger karma percentage.		Graphs were generated using Python, Panda, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, then put together in Photoshop. Happy to answer any questions you may have!		This post was inspired by this [/r/showerthoughts post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/422cxe/i_bet_the_top_1_of_redditors_have_more_karma_and/) yesterday.		I have created a CSV in the form "author, karma" that contains all the karma earned by each redditor in 2015. It can be downloaded [using this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tllle5txl8b2re/2015_karma.csv.zip?dl=0) (note: the file is 174.7 MB uncompressed, 74.2 MB compressed, and it's shared on Dropbox &ndash; please don't download it if you won't be using it, since otherwise I'll run out of bandwidth).

I suspect this is a simple case of a man who simply likes to masturbate while imagining all the other people he's helped, and is helping, to ejaculate. Sitting fervently sorting his porn with one hand, it is needless to say that this bot likely started as a simpler tool for pulling images above a certain size from subscribed blogs and tumblers so he could most easily sort through them himself - z to go back, c to go forward and x to save possibly.. or maybe it was mouse clicks left to save and right to discard... Our masturbating hero would have found it easy to collect vast stores of porn this way, maybe the intent was always to share it or maybe that just evolved when he looked at the huge stack of porn and said to himself 'what am i even going to do with this?' Either way the bot got advanced to include some subreddit tagging system, personally i'd do it with numbers down one side of the screen and the keypad to enter through lists so pressing 3-6-2 might navigate through 'location-based, beach, /r/beachpussy' for example - that way i'd learn the more common ones but could have complex ones in there for special occasions.

{"body":"I am the creator of KarmaLB. Reddit's requirement (when I made the leaderboard) was that an automated request could only be made once every two seconds, which is required to prevent overloading the site. Due to that restriction, the leaderboard needs to prioritize stat updates across all users. Currently, stats are updated for users that make a post on the front page or a top level comment on a front page post. It also updates stats for any user that is entered into the search box. So for top users and very active users it is fairly accurate. If you compare the top 10 users from the [CSV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tllle5txl8b2re/2015_karma.csv.zip?dl=0) to the top users on KarmaLB you'll see that KarmaLB is more accurate, which makes sense because the data in the CSV only goes to the end of 2015.		For example: /u/Isai76 has 3,680,189 total Karma. [KarmaLB](http://www.karmalb.com/user/Isai76) shows 3,675,996 while the CSV says 4,039,304.

It's happened before:  	  	http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/cheating-reddit-auto-votes/  	  	The bad thing is, casual posters don't know enough about it to be able to say immediately, ok this isn't for me. They post thinking, ok I'll explore this karma thing, but usually end up not getting too many votes or much out of it. They become frustrated with the site and just move on or post what they want regardless of karma.   	  	Karma was supposed to be an incentive to raise the quality of submissions. Then it got gamed into what it is. There really is no point to it now on the bigger subs, at least.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ghost_in_the_trees","name":"t1_cz8139b","parent_id":"t1_cz7zuqo","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1453516193,"created_utc":1453487393}

We must grow the lower and middle Reddit class or else we will soon find the top 1% has all the karma. The top 1% stashes all their Reddit gold in banks in the Cayman Islands while the rest of Reddit must struggle to find just a little karma to get by. The karma distribution gap is only getting wider and we must have a full on Reddit revolution. First, we need to get Reddit United reversed so that karma whores don't receive dark up votes from their karma PACS. Secondly, we must move to remove karma from Reddit altogether. We will make sure all who have been gilded pay their fair share. My last step will be to shut down the big Reddit banks. I will take all steps to insure the constant up votes to Reddit's wealthiest are no more."","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Erkle26","name":"t1_cz8316z","parent_id":"t3_425zk4","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1453518866,"created_utc":1453490066}

{"body":"This is a great example of the 80/20 principal at work. It's a world wide phenomenon that appears in almost every aspect of life. Basically it states that 80% of the results come from 20% of the causes. 		I use it in business a lot. 20% of our products produce 80% of our revenue. Therefore we can focus on those products, and get rid of the other 80% of the items that barely even sell. 		Or in the world of automobile driving, it's common to find that ~20% of a state's drivers create 80% of all the traffic accidents every year. 		Or in your own life: 20% of your efforts create 80% of your success. The rest of the stuff you do in life to try and make your own world better is pretty much pointless. 		Other examples can easily be found; the 80/20 rule is just the baseline. The same principal is seen in different ratios such as 90/10, 95/5, or 99/1.

The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950), who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he did not claim to have originated it.[1] The French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.[2] It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach[3] (1856–1933).","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SpaceToaster","name":"t1_cz88my3","parent_id":"t3_425zk4","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1453526741,"created_utc":1453497941}
