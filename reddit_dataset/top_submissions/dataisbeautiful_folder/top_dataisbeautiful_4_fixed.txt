{"body":"While you are largely correct,there are some inconsistencies with that statement. There were still many Russian families that got very lucky and had no deaths, and countless other Russian families who *completely* perished. If you were in the Western part of the country, then your family almost certainly did not go unscathed. But if you lived east of Moscow, and had no family members get drafted or die in an air-raid, then your family might have all survived the war unharmed. Though of course, the vast majority of the Russian population lived in the western parts of the country.		Also it is incredibly important to note that this figure was not simple "Russian" deaths--this was in fact *Soviet* deaths. Meaning Ukrainian, Belorussian, Caucasian, Central Asian, Siberian, Baltic, and even many Poles/others who had been annexed into the USSR following the partition of Poland in 1939.

{"body":"Yes, and the fact that it took it away from my doorstep is a very good thing. When wars were frequently occurring on my doorstep, the death toll was enormous.  And as representative democracy spreads, then those countries which now have to deal with conflict don't have to deal with wars on THEIR doorsteps. 		Yes, there are many conflicts occurring around the world, which fail to be covered by our media.( Importantly, those wars are investigated and studied by academics, NGO's and international organisations like the UN.  Why?  Because war is seen as a terrible tragedy and something civilised people abhor.. not a typical state of things, a noble struggle or simply one aspect of human existence).  Try to imagine if pretty much EVERY country in the world was like those countries currently at war.  That is what the world has historically been like. The change has been enormous.    		 Yes, the world wars of the 20th century were enormously deadly, as was the crusades, the mongolian hordes, the Spanish conquests of the Americas and the many other wars listed on that page.  		However, the critical point is that the incidence of these wars is dropping, and has dropped dramatically over history.  I, as a citizen of planet earth, am much less likely to be the victim of death by war now than at any other time in history.

Killing nearly 90% of all German soldiers is pretty good for a army whose " tactics are terrible, your equipment is shit, your morale is low."","depth":5,"score":64,"ups":64,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"linesreadlines","name":"t1_crq9e74","parent_id":"t1_crq8yqf","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433052476,"created_utc":1433023676}
{"body":">The USSR used 1400 million tonnes of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food in WWII. The Lend lease accounted for 17 million, about 1% of that total. I hardly doubt they would have "crumbled" without that 1%.		Aha, but they were the important parts.  To quote [History Today](http://www.historynet.com/did-russia-really-go-it-alone-how-lend-lease-helped-the-soviets-defeat-the-germans.htm): "**researchers estimate that British-supplied tanks made up 30 to 40 percent of the entire heavy and medium tank strength of Soviet forces before Moscow at the beginning of December 1941"**, and that's merely British aid in one sector.  		---		The objective of a military campaign in the 20th century and beyond became the destruction of the institutions of governance and war.   Factories, military centres, barracks, government offices and so on.   The killing of soldiers was secondary.  As the war in the East showed, the careful deployment of advanced weaponry was more effective than the slaughter of thousands (or hundreds of thousands of men).  		**The point of war is *not* to kill soldiers, it is to force surrender or the collapse of enemy authority in a territory.**  Killing enemy soldiers may become part of the achievement of said goals, but it is not the purpose.  These objectives are distinct, and the fact you don't understand that suggests a deep misunderstanding of modern conflict.  		An army of ten thousand swordsmen is no match for a hundred men equipped with modern military equipment.   This change to warfare became evident in the early twentieth century on the battlefields of World War One, but was ultimately proven in WW2.  The atomic bomb is of course the ultimate example- achieving what hundreds of thousands of American casualties may not have achieved.","depth":6,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"interiorlittlevenice","name":"t1_crq9lct","parent_id":"t1_crq9e74","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433052907,"created_utc":1433024107}

{"body":"The fact that US companies profited off of the war is the reason our technological advancements between 1940-1945 were probably greater than any other 5 year period in the history of the planet, and the reason that every single one of our allies had cutting edge equipment, excluding possibly the soviets, who were never really an ally.			When the war started, I'll just use the Imperial Japanese Air Force/Naval Air Forces as an example as compared to the USN Air Groups. At the start of the war, the main Fighter aircraft of the Japanese AF and Navy was the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The standard USN Fighter was the Grumman F4F Wildcat. The Zero outperforms the Wildcat in almost every way. Despite that, the USN had a kill to loss ratio of around 6-1 for the entire war due to superior tactics. This was deemed unacceptable by the Government. So they offered a contract to any company who could make a better fighter aircraft. So Vought came up with the F4U Corsair. Air kill ratio of 11-1. Still not good enough. And Grumman, not to be outdone, rolled out the F6F Hellcat, with a 19-1 kill ratio in the Pacific. The reason for this, is that as American and Allied technology progressed, the Japanese stayed stagnant and used variants of the A6M until the end of the war. Their technology had progressed, and they had learned from their mistakes, yes, however they had no money or industry to produce enough of their modern fighters, such as the Kawanishi N1K which is considered one of the greatest piston engine fighters ever produced. If we had kept going at the rate of everyone else, nobody would say that American industry was a big factor in the war. But they do, and it was. We produced more aircraft than almost of all our allies and enemies combined. We produced more tanks, excluding the USSR-who mostly produced T-34 tanks, which were somewhat combat ineffective vs. German Tigers and Panthers- than all of our allies and enemies combined. We produced more ships than all of our allies and enemies combined by a SIGNIFICANT amount. I'm really sorry, this kind of turned into a wall of text but discounting Americas contribution to WW2 is asinine and I didn't even talk about the British contribution of cracking Enigma or the Manhattan Project. But that's a completely different story.		TL;DR This isn't a pissing contest, we all helped defeat the Axis.

{"body":"German here		This is a difficult topic and generalizing towards any direction will lead to wrong conclusions.		Let's start before the war: His nationalsocialistic attitudes weren't the reason for Hitler getting elected. Sure, the core of the NSDAP have always been nazis, but most of the Germans have simply been disappointed by the [Weimarer Republik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic).		It should be noted that Germany had huge economical issues after WW1 including a [hyperinflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic) and obviously the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Germany also had to pay reparations for their loss in WW1. Hitler had already been imprisoned in 1923, but his charismatic personality led people to vote for him for the simple reason that he gave them work. Hitler credited himself with the invention of the Autobahn, which was mostly a clever sort of propaganda. People didn't care/realize that his economic success was based on producing arms and military ressources and also making debts that could only be paid off by winning a war.		Hitler's anti-semitic attitude was known by the people of Germany, but sadly people appreciated having found a scapegoat for their problems. It should also be noted that Hitler never won a majority in a democratic election and only got one by dispelling the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) from their seats in the Reichstag.		Right after the war most Germans have tried to renounce any involvement in war crimes or knowledge of them. This includes both soldiers and civilians. I have often talked to my grandma on her experience of the war and she confirms these views, but on the other hand she was still a child and remembers how she was more afraid of a thunderstorm than the bombs. So she might not be the most reliable source.		On the other hand this photo of [German soldiers reacting to the cruelty of the camps](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZGd49YXPF70/U1Hxi1s_yEI/AAAAAAAAI9A/ompb_iIuKW4/s1600/German+soldiers+react+to+footage+of+concentration+camps,+1945.jpg)  supports her views.		There are many examples of Nazis being proud of themselves even after the surrender though (Amon Goeth from Schindler's list might be one of the most popular examples. To anyone who hasn't watched the film I highly recommend it.)		The [Nuremberg trials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials) concluded that most Germans weren't Nazis and the Wehrmacht not a criminal organization to a scale of the SS, but still commited severe war crimes.		The modern view on the question is more critical of the Germans in general. Germans are accused of Whitewashing themselves from war crimes that would've been impossible to carry out without the assistance of the Wehrmacht. Here is a list of [war crimes of the Wehrmacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht).		Sorry for some inconsistencies in the post, but in the end it is very difficult to conclude who knew what especially since significant details have been hidden or distorted by all involved powers.		My personal view is that most Germans didn't know what was happening until it was too late, but didn't act against the Nazis to save their own skin. There are some (sadly very few) resistance movements though (The ["Weiße Rose"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose) and ["Operation Walküre"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot) are common examples). On the other hand soldiers have deliberately commited horrific crimes, that have never been demanded by their military leadership, so I would not consider them "just soldiers".		There is lots of misinformation going around considering the war, although there is a ton of material available (often in visual form), so feel encouraged to research on your own. Independently thinking citizens are crucial in preventing another war with similar scale to WW2, so please find your own political opinion. The worst thing that can happen to a society is people not caring.","depth":4,"score":290,"ups":290,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"varysthespider1","name":"t1_crqd5dt","parent_id":"t1_crq7qma","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433060587,"created_utc":1433031787}

{"body":"At least here in Germany. The term "Nazis" is mostly reserved for party members. So, the administration. Like, you'd say stuff like "Nazi concentration camps" because the Nazis administrated those. Or "the Nazis started the war" because the party gave the orders. However, you'd say "The SS arrested people on the streets" (or the Gestapo? I'm not sure who actually came knocking) or "The Wehrmacht raped their way through Poland" (though, you might hear "The nazis invaded poland" depending on the perspective you're looking at).		Usually, we use whatever organisation was involved. That becomes quite important when you go into more detail since there were a lot of organisations. The Schutzpolizei (which is the organisation that is now our police force) was obviously also right under the SS. However, in my city, they were heavily involved in supporting a resistance group that made it possible to surrender the city to the Americans without a single shot fired and prevented the destruction of the whole city (90% of the buildings were already damaged at this point). If you wanted to talk about events like that, just calling everybody a Nazi would blur those lines.		So, for me, just saying "Nazi" sounds wrong. However, I understand that for non-Germans, the differences are not important since you usually deal with the big picture and sub organisations of sub organisations of the SS probably don't matter.		However, everybody who says that it's an insult or disrespectful should probably stop speaking for other people. Most Germans, especially the ones my age, are very well aware of what happened and see it as part of our history.

Also, a maybe important disclaimer: I've never heard the "the Wehrmacht wasn't that bad" nonsense before I found reddit.

I believe it was after Stalingrad that when they were coming back West, the ticks with the typhus came. They saved some, I believe Ukranians on the way back. I think from 42 to 45 was the timeframe for that.		Towards the end of the war, the allies bombed German supply runs and obviously destroyed any food runs they were getting. They bombed German cities, and what are you going to do in wartime? Feed your PoW that you're shipping out, or your soldiers and citizens? At the end of the war, Berlin was starving.		There was never any document stating to kill all Jews. They cooridinated all of this in the 40s, without written documents? They had millions of documents, but whoops! No documents for mass extermination.		The commonly seen pictures such as [this](http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/holocaust-men.jpg), are used to say how horrible the conditions were in the camps. But, the reasons for this is the causes I said above. Burning a body when it has typhus is actually the best way to dispose of it after it has it. The amount of time it takes to burn one, is about 2 to 3 hours. Elie Wiesel says TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND bodies were burnt a day. Does the math seem off to you?		They also used pictures of dead Germans and said they were Jews. How about this?		>>SS chief Himmler responded to reports of large-scale deaths in the camps with an urgent letter on December 16, 1942, to camp system administrator Pohl:		>>"Efforts absolutely must be taken to reduce the death rate in the concentration camps by improving the nutrition and, whenever possible and necessary, the working conditions. The camp commandants are to be held personally responsible for this."		>>Glücks went on to order that		>>"[…] camp physicians must use all means at their disposal to significantly reduce the death rate in the various camps. […] More than they have in the past, the camp doctors must supervise the nutrition of the prisoners and, in cooperation with the administration, submit improvement recommendations to the camp commandants. [...] The camp doctors are to see to it that the working conditions at the various labor sites are improved as much as possible.		>>The secret directive concluded:		>>"The Reichsführer SS has ordered that the death rate absolutely must be reduced."		>>"The mid-day lunch should consist of 1.25 to 1.5 liters – not thin soup, but thick, substantial meals.		>>Receipt of additional [food] parcels is to be encouraged.		>>Meal time and proper digestion requires rest. For this reason, there should be sufficient rest periods at mealtime. No unnecessary marches. The food should be brought to the people, not the people to the food.		>>In addition to warm food, clothing is needed to keep the body warm and protect it from cold. This is especially important in the case of prisoners who work outside.		>>Care must be taken to ensure an undisturbed night-time sleep period of at least seven to eight hours.		>>Roll calls should be kept as brief as possible."		http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/		>>At least into early 1942 (see entry for March 7), it was seriously proposed to round up all the European Jews and ship them to Madagascar, which was to be forcibly acquired from France. This fact, of course, is of central importance to the holocaust: if the Nazis wanted to ship them out, then obviously there was no plan for mass murder. To further complicate the traditional account, we need only observe that Chelmno, Auschwitz, and Belzec were all allegedly underway in March 1942. And in fact it is worse than this, because **talk of deportation continues right up until the end of the war.**		>>[...] **I should note, by the way, that the German language does indeed have words for ‘killing’: morden, ermorden, töten, totschlagen, totschiessen. Goebbels had no shortage of alternatives if he wished to discuss literally killing the Jews. This is, after all, a personal and private diary. Consider his situation: Should the Germans win, he has nothing to fear. Should they lose, he must have known that his own death awaited, along with the ‘destruction’ of greater Germany—again, nothing to fear. Why hold back? So the reader might be wondering: Does Goebbels ever use such explicit terms? In fact he does: once. If I may temporarily leap ahead to one of his final entries, 14 March 1945, we read that certain soon-to-be-victorious Jews are calling for no mercy on the Germans—to which Goebbels replies, “Anyone in a position to do so should kill (totschlagen) these Jews like rats.”** 		>>**There we have it—an unambiguous call for murder. Except that it’s three years too late. One wonders, though, why, on the exterminationist thesis, Goebbels didn’t resort to such language much sooner. Perhaps it was only at the end, when the Jewish-backed Allies were slaughtering innocent Germans by the tens of thousands, that the Nazis began calling for their deaths.**		http://inconvenienthistory.com/archive/2014/volume_6/number_3/the_great_holocaust_mystery.php		Explain that to me? Explain them saying they have to stop deaths. If they were "systematically killing them", why would they care if they lived or died?		Here are some extermination camp propaganda myths:		>>**Abandoned Extermination Claims**		>>**Since the end of the Second World War in 1945, many claims about mass killings in German wartime camps – claims that were once widely accepted and backed with apparently impressive evidence – have been quietly dropped. No reputable historian still accepts, for example, the claim made by the Soviet prosecution at Nuremberg that at one camp the Germans used "special electrical appliances for the mass murder of the doomed"**. Prisoners allegedly were killed there in a special "building where the floor was electrified in a special way".[5] Similarly discredited is the Nuremberg claim by the American prosecution that Jews were systematically killed at the Treblinka camp by steaming them to death.[		>>**No Documentary Evidence**		>>**The German authorities kept astonishingly detailed records of every aspect of camp affairs.[13] Remarkably, though, there is no contemporary documentary evidence of homicidal gassings or of a policy of mass extermination in the camps. Not a single contemporary German document mentions or even refers to killings of Jews in gas chambers. Nor are there any contemporary plans or diagrams of extermination gas chambers. There is similarly no documentary proof that any of the various rooms or buildings said to have been execution gassing facilities were, in fact, ever used as such.**		>>**What 'evidence' there is for mass extermination in the German wartime camps consists entirely of dubious 'testimony', either from a handful of German officials (such as the now discredited "confession" of former Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höß), or from a small number of former inmates.**[14]		>>**'Eyewitnesses' of gassings are rare. Only a small number of persons has ever claimed to have seen such execution gas chambers in operation, and their scant descriptions of homicidal gassings are typically cursory, vague and/or contradictory. As a number of historians have acknowledged, such testimony is not very credible. Holocaust historian Gitta Sereny has warned that quite a few of the familiar 'eyewitness' testimonies are nothing more than baseless hearsay.

Can't believe that you're denying that the gestapo wasn't an SS organisation when it's literally it's parent agency and the guy in charge was literally Reinhard Heydrich.

As far as circlejerk subreddits go I don't think you're making a strong point by associating with any of them, if anything I think it makes you look like a tool.

I'll help you out with one of your so called scrutiny;		"When he was informed of the massacres, General Omar Bradley told General George S. Patton that U.S. troops had murdered some 50-70 prisoners in cold blood. Patton noted his response in his diary:		    I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the Officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, so nothing can be done about it.[15]"			Ironically Bradley actually had some honour and the guy got life imprisonment but was released a year later, so much for life in prison. It's not about the holocaust or warcrimes it's about you labelling every wehrmacht soldier as a nazi which is just false.

{"body":"Opinion Research Business (ORB) poll conducted August 12–19, 2007, estimated 1,033,000 violent deaths due to the Iraq War. The range given was 946,000 to 1,120,000 deaths. A nationally representative sample of approximately 2,000 Iraqi adults answered whether any members of their household (living under their roof) were killed due to the Iraq War. 22% of the respondents had lost one or more household members. ORB reported that "48% died from a gunshot wound, 20% from the impact of a car bomb, 9% from aerial bombardment, 6% as a result of an accident and 6% from another blast/ordnance."[26][27][28][29][30]		The Lancet study's figure of 654,965 excess deaths through the end of June 2006 is based on household survey data. The estimate is for all excess violent and nonviolent deaths. That also includes those due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poorer healthcare, etc. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% confidence interval) were estimated to be due to violence. 31% of those were attributed to the Coalition, 24% to others, 46% unknown. The causes of violent deaths were gunshot (56%), car bomb (13%), other explosion/ordnance (14%), airstrike (13%), accident (2%), unknown (2%). A copy of a death certificate was available for a high proportion of the reported deaths (92% of those households asked to produce one).[32][33][34]		The PLOS Medicine study's figure of approximately 460,000 excess deaths through the end of June 2011 is based on household survey data including at least 132,000 deaths that were caused directly by war-related violence. The estimate is for all excess violent and nonviolent deaths. That also includes those due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poorer healthcare, etc. 405,000 deaths (range of 48,000 to 751,000 using a 95% confidence interval) were estimated as excess deaths attributable to the conflict. They estimated at least 55,000 additional deaths occurred that the survey missed, as the families had migrated out of Iraq. The survey found that more than 60% of excess deaths were caused by violence, with the rest caused indirectly by the war, through degradation of infrastructure and similar causes. The survey notes that although car bombs received more significant press internationally, gunshot wounds were responsible for the majority (63%) of violent deaths. The study also estimated that 35% of violent deaths were attributed to the Coalition, and 32% to militias. Cardiovascular conditions accounted for about half (47%) of nonviolent deaths, chronic illnesses 11%, infant or childhood deaths other than injuries 12.4%, non-war injuries 11%, and cancer 8%.[2]","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"somefreedomfries","name":"t1_crq9n13","parent_id":"t1_crq9jj9","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433053005,"created_utc":1433024205}

Also, there is a link between respect of sovereignty and peace and security. In Iraq for example, the bloody civil war would not be possible or would be at least less violent if the US did respect Iraqi sovereignty instead of destroying the Iraqi state.

De Gaule really loved the idea of independance, which made him  dislike the principle of the cold war, and two power fighting each other. In his mind De Gaule was not seeing two side clashing each other, he was seeing a lot more countries, which should had their own opinions, and shouldn't have to decide which superpower they had to follow.		That's one of the reason he decided to leave Nato, he didn't appreciate at all the fact the US were giving the order. In his mind the cold war was a war between the US and Russia, and all the other countries were only embrigaded in it.		Communism has never been an ennemy in France, lot of people didn't liked the idea obviously, but unlike how it was in the US, France has never been in war against the communism. That being said, De Gaule didn't like the URSS, him who love the idea of independance couldn't like the URSS, which were doing the perfect opposite everywhere they were going.		Also the fact the soviets helped the Viet-Minh in indochine didn't helped for example. But overall France had much better relation with URSS than any other countries in the west at that time. To be fair having even the slightest relation with them at that time was already better than anyone else. The US pretty much forbid any member of nato of talking with URSS, France not being a member of NATO anymore were an exception.		In most French mind, France weren't in war with URSS, the US were. Everybody knew that in case of a conflict we would side with the US, but until then we were neutral with the URSS.		But that didn't change the fact the french were more or less aware of what was happening in the East, and obviously they didn't liked that.

"Several issues arose during the war that threatened the alliance. These included the Soviet refusal to aide the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and the decision of British and U.S. officials to exclude the Soviets from secret negotiations with German officers in March of 1945 in an effort to secure the surrender of German troops in Italy. The most important disagreement, however, was over the opening of a second front in the West. Stalin’s troops struggled to hold the Eastern front against the Nazi forces, and the Soviets BEGAN PLEADING for a British invasion of France immediately after the Nazi invasion in 1941. In 1942, Roosevelt unwisely promised the Soviets that the Allies would open the second front that autumn. Although Stalin only grumbled when the invasion was postponed until 1943, he exploded the following year when the invasion was postponed again until May of 1944. In retaliation, Stalin recalled his ambassadors from London and Washington and fears soon arose that the Soviets might seek a separate peace with Germany."","depth":4,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"toxicass","name":"t1_crq8tzf","parent_id":"t1_crq8l4v","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433051290,"created_utc":1433022490}

Another example of Poland getting the dick: Polish forces had the [Warsaw uprising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising) where they nearly retook the city of Warsaw from the Nazi forces. They were very close to securing the city when Soviet forces advanced on the city. The Polish forces were expecting "enemy of my enemy is my friend" to hold up, but the Soviet forces diverted away from the city, despite request for assistance. This forced the Polish uprising to negotiate with the Nazi forces to ceasefire. This resulted in the uprising forces to evacuate to the city to other locations, most of which were concentration camps, where the rebel soldiers were executed.		The soviets then took Warsaw with ease, since the Nazi forces were weakened from fighting the Uprising.

We like to think of numbers on a human scale such as counting distance in feet or counting to 10 on our fingers.

When someone tells me 70 million people died in WW2 or our next closest star is 25 trillion miles away, to some extent I understand what this means but I certainly can't appreciate it further than thinking "those are very large numbers".

That is the utter dominance in military power in the bi-polar and now uni-polar world.

Monopolies of power run the risk of abuse, where a powerful state bullies a weaker one. There are too many examples to count since 1945. These conflicts are inherently unequal contests, where the powerful side either wins, or gets tired of fighting and decides the costs are not worth the gains. What you do not see is contests among relative equals. A fair fight is great in sports, but WWI and WWII show how horrific they can be in real conflict.   	   	The theory is called hegemonic stability. I'm a US military veteran, which obviously colors my view.

{"body":"DPT is the democratic peace theory which has two forms: monadic and dyadic. The monadic form is the idea that democracies are more peaceful than non-democracies (which has been proven false), the dyadic form is that democracies do not go to war with other democracies (which has a large body of evidence to be true, but is entirely dependent on the arbitrary metric by which one defines as democracy). The DPT was formulated to explain the so-called "democratic peace", which is the post-1945 peace between democracies.		This is the subject of a lot of research within IR, I actually wrote a research proposal last semester that relates to the DPT tangentially. In addition to the democratic peace we have also identified an autocratic peace (dyadic). This lends to the idea that the democratic peace was not because of any intrinsic characteristics of democracy, but rather that regime similarity is the significant factor at play. There has been a small amount of research on regime/political similarity on the democratic and autocratic peaces, but they (in my opinion) got erroneous results because of poor indicators for regime similarity (polity IV aggregate score).

{"body":"The problem with aggregate polity IV score is that it is from -10 to 10 (-10 pure autocracy with 10 being pure democracy) with 0 being the middle score, well this doesn't measure the similarity of regimes. What this does measure is how democratic or autocratic nations are. The closer you get to a score of 0 the less useful the polity IV scale is because it is actually a score that is an aggregate of other smaller indicators. A hypothetical could be that two states both have a 0 score, but actually have every indicator opposite of each other but by this metric be "fully similar" because they are both 0. My research proposal addressed this actually, my idea was to disaggregate the polity score on a dyadic level, and to then take the mean % similarity of all indicators. The problem is the polity scale is bipolar when regimes aren't necessarily just democratic or autocratic, it assumes a dichotomy that isn't the truth of the situation.		Generally we use Correlates of War data, usually 1816-2010 or so. Here's a link if you're interested: http://www.correlatesofwar.org/. This is to determine which dyads were at war in which years. The polity IV score is the other variable, so we can assign each dyad scores. What ends up happening is it boils down to the effect of polity score on the probability of entering an interstate conflict, usually using logit analysis. There are a couple different ways, you'll see how they do it if you can get a hold of the paper.

{"body":"So, the whole story that people from the US and Great Britain like to hear is that Leopold II and the Belgian government were big bad wolves in the Congo free state. This, however, is only partially true. For example, the myth about the hand cutting is utterly false, the only reason they had hands is because of the bullets. The Belgian were and still are lazy fucks, so we told the Congolese to go shoot eachother, but to be sure the conscripts were not stealing the bullets they were given, they had to bring a right hand for every used bullet. Which is why there are pictures of buckets of hands taken in Congo. Back to the core now: Leopold II was a diplomatic genius, and managed to talk the other great nations into conditionally giving him Congo, they did but only later realised Congo was crazy rich. Notice that I said him, it was his backyard, it was not really a colony, it was literally his, like you own a house.He did terrible things in Congo and arguably some good things were done too. But it really became a problem when some British guy published a book that was overly exaggerating the problems in Congo, after this, nations went down on the king and he had to pass on his colony to the state. In the video he states 10 million, that is a very very high estimate, as the official estimate is 5 to 6 million. Sources go as high as 8 milion. (respecable ones).Why is this completely stupid? Because the only reason why it is so well known is because a knobhead brit published it. Whilst GB was happily murdering away in india.

This figure was used in Steven Pinker's book The Better Angels of Our Nature, where it is presented as proportionally the largest atrocity in history with the loss of a sixth of the world's population at that time,[18] though Pinker noted that the figure was controversial.[19]			Historians such as Charles Patrick Fitzgerald argue that a claim of 36 million deaths is incompatible with contemporary accounts of the war.[20] They point out that the numbers recorded on the postwar registers reflect not only population loss, but also a breakdown of the census system as well as the removal from the census figures of various classes of untaxed persons, such as those in religious orders, foreigners and merchants.[21] For these reasons, census numbers for the post-rebellion Tang are considered unreliable.[17] Another consideration is the fact that the territory controlled by Tang central authority was diminished by the equivalent of several of the northern provinces, so that something like a quarter of the surviving population were no longer within the area subject to the imperial revenue system.[22]","depth":0,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Putupmydukes","name":"t1_crq5yl7","parent_id":"t3_37v0ne","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433045428,"created_utc":1433016628}

So Vasily would not have technically done "most" of the killing at Katyn, but he sure as hell did a mind-bogglingly large amount of it.

That's not really a great way to approach it either.. Canada went to war automatically in 1914 when Britain declared war, but we symbolically declared was independently during WW2 at a different date (although we were still required to go to war under Britain). As a Canadian, it's an important symbolic distinction, so it's more of a personal gripe, but I can understand why someone might have thought it was okay to lump us in with the empire.		- Second, the announcer does take some political stances, which I try to avoid as a general rule. The numbers should tell the story, not your own ideology, bias, etc. I'm not necessarily saying I disagree with any of his stances either, but when you tell a story, and add something which is debatable to a certain extent for much of the population, it takes away from the true, nitty gritty, bare understanding that is statistics IMO.

{"body":"There were at most maybe a couple dozen *armed German resistance* fighters. At that low of a level, it is completely inaccurate to call it a "resistance" and far more accurate to call it "malcontents". What were they resisting? Their country invading and profiting off other countries? People like to play up this myth that the Germans suffered just as terribly under the Nazis as other nations did but that is simply a lie--while many "undesirables" were purged from Germany, your average typical German did quite well under the Nazis (barring those who died fighting for them obviously) and supported the Nazi regime up until the final stages of the War. 		Everyone likes to claim that just because most Germans weren't *registered* Nazi party members, that they were innocent of all guilt for what happened. Except you didn't have to be a registered Nazi Party Member to vote for them and support their views, and the Nazis enjoyed *overwhelming public support for their aims and actions.*		That doesn't mean that the Germans of today are somehow guilty for the crimes of their ancestors--far from it. Germany has completely abandoned that past and made major efforts to ensure that they will never again be such a source of evil. But that doesn't mean that you get to just white-wash what happened and pretend that only a "small number" of people somehow singlehandedly hijacked the German nation and embarked it on such an overwhelming crusade of tyranny *without* the enthusiastic support of most of the German people.		It's important to acknowledge this fact because of the lesson it teaches us today. That a whole nation, that *any nation*, can in fact become so terribly corrupted--that we don't just need to be vigilant about "the few" who might commit evil, but must in fact constantly police ourselves and our societies to avoid blindly falling into a path of hate, tyranny, and disregard for the rest of mankind.		Ironically, you don't often see many Germans in Germany so openly taking such an apologistic stance on the subject (barring the inevitable radicals of course), as much as you see people of German decent in America taking this stance. And considering that German ancestry is the largest single ethnic ancestral background in the U.S., this view is surprisingly common among the slightly-informed. Seems like a natural reaction to hearing one's ethnic ancestry be associated with "the bad guys" by the society around you--which is understandable, but doesn't mean it's correct.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jaquestrap","name":"t1_crqa32q","parent_id":"t1_crq8pbp","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433053930,"created_utc":1433025130}

{"body":"If he had said Nazi Forces i would be totally alright with that. 		The Nazis controlled the military so calling German soldiers Nazi Forces is nothing less than the truth. Calling the soldiers themselves Nazis is the problem. The overwhelming majority of them probably were Nazis or at least racists and anti-semites and those aren't the ones i want to defend here. Even "defending" the ones that willingly fought for the Nazis **without** subscribing to their idelogy leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth. Maybe they wanted to save their loved ones by joining the military but they must have known that they would inevitably also support the Nazi regime. Therefore this is mainly about the thousands of conscripts who didn't want to fight. Who were forced to and therefore became victims of the Nazi regime. Their suffering isn't compareable to that of the many jews in Auschwitz or Warsaw but they were victims non the less. A close family member of mine was conscripted during the war, later charged with [Wehrkraftzersetzung](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrkraftzersetzung) (for saying  "Ich glaube der Krieg ist verloren"/"I think the war is lost" in a bar in late '44) and imprisoned in Buchenwald were he died of untreated Pneumonia in early '45. He was undisputably part of the Nazi Forces but not on his own accord and he also undisputably was a victim of the Nazi regime. He claimed that he hadn't killed a single soul when he had returned from the front and we will never know for sure wether that's true but from what i have been told about him (i never met him obviously) i am convinced that he wasn't a Nazi. And even if **he** was there are thousands of stories like this so at least some of them are bound to be true.		Some Germans were victims of the regime too and some of them were victimized by conscription. They were part of the Nazi Forces and they were at the front but - at least to me as a relative - it's important to not call them Nazis. The 14 year old children who operated the FLAK in Berlin in '45 weren't Nazis either. The [Poles that were forced to fight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_in_the_Wehrmacht) were no Nazis. Historically this might not be important or to you this might not be important and i can comprehend that. But to the relatives and decendants and even friends of these people - some of whome lost their lives for a regime they despised - this is a very very important distiction. I don't expect them to change it in the video, i think as a whole it conveys a very powerful and significant message - one to which a lot of the people who were forced to fight would probably wholeheartedly subscribe - and  i just wanted to share my personal opinion. Most people will probably not notice it and that's fine. I just wanted to put my perspective out there.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Steve_the_Stevedore","name":"t1_crqwgcc","parent_id":"t1_crqu0g7","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433116987,"created_utc":1433088187}

The US was a power transitioning into the technological age, while the soviets were a largely pastoral society barely post-industrial.  Each brought to the party the tools they had.

{"body":"he forgot to mention that almost half of all soviet military deaths were POWs. Germany killed more than half of all the soviet soldiers it captured in the entire war after they had put down their weapons, 10 times as many as the Soviet Union allowed to die once surrendered. Both sides captured about the same amount of POWs during the war, and if the Soviet Union killed as many POWs as Germany did, the body count would have been pretty close to the same. Germany's wholesale massacre of POWs makes the stats pretty lop-sided, and for a country like the Soviet Union, with Stalin as a leader, and his complete subversion of the military structure with the Stalin Purges prior to the war where he pretty much uprooted the military ranks by jailing or executing countless officers / commanders, as well as his military doctrine of not allowing huge armies to retreat in the face of encirclement, the Soviet Union actually did an incredible job fighting this war. Also, near the end of the war, German generals were incessantly disobeying Hitler, retreating large armies in order to save them from being cut off by the Soviets, saving millions of German troops from capture or destruction. Soviet Generals didn't have the luxury of doing the same thing, or millions would have been saved from falling in German captivity, where they had over a %50 percent chance of dying, as proven by statistics, which would have altered the death count very significantly","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"solsolace","name":"t1_crqttf1","parent_id":"t3_37v0ne","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433111031,"created_utc":1433082231}
{"body":"One thing I think we are missing from the video are population counts of the countries mentioned. I think that would really give perspective to how the death counts affected the countries involved. I have done a quick bing search(I live in China google is banned) and got some numbers; 		1939 populations	US - 130,879,718	UK - 46,467,000	USSR - 168,524,000	Germany - 69,623,000		1941 populations	US - 133,402,471	UK - No reliable census	USSR - 196,716,000	Germany - I couldn't find info however something of note that I did come across was the fact that German fertility rate was at its lowest ever before the Nazis came to power. Which is perhaps a representation on how German life was at the time.		Also I have read a lot of the comments and came across a lot of comments like "We won the war!" These arguments are pointless but I think you should all research some of the most strategically important battles of WW2 and read what historians say about the significance of the battle. Here are a few suggestions to get you started;		Battle of Midway	Battle of Britain	Battle of El Alamein	Battle of Stalingrad	Battle of Normandy	Battle of Moscow	Battle of Kursk		How about some other important events and nations activities such as the Yugoslav Partisans, The Enigma code, Vichy French, Fall of Singapore etc	For those that say The Soviets won the war I ask this question. Would the Nazi invasion of Poland have been so successful if the Soviets didn't invade? Would the Japanese have been able to spread so swiftly through Asia if the Soviets hadn't signed a non-aggression pact? For those that said the US won the war I ask this would America have been able to fight so affectively if they joined the war earlier? If Britain had fell how would America have successfully joined the war in Europe? I don't think anyone did say the UK won the war however I think their contribution was significant especially in regards to the battle of El Alamein which stopped the Germans opening up a second front on USSR but lets ask this? Would the UK have been able to continue the fight if they hadn't been supplied from the US or had the assistance of their colonial powers? 	Long story short every single event and country involved in WW2 is significant. We can't really speculate but we should have an idea of what happened.	Some interesting things I found while looking for those population numbers was the declaration of war by Thailand and Sweden's not so independent role.

While it is not clear what started the famine and who was responsible, it is undisputed that it could have ended if the British wanted it to.			The viceroy had entered India into WW2 without consulting Indian leaders in 1939 (4 years before the famine), which led to resignations in the legislatures and the start of the civil disobedience movement.

{"body":"If you guys are truly interested in learning more about this in depth, I suggest reading the [The Better Angels of our Nature](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107244-the-better-angels-of-our-nature) By Steven Pinker. From Goodreads:		>Faced with the ceaseless stream of news about war, crime, and terrorism, one could easily think we live in the most violent age ever seen. Yet as New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker shows in this startling and engaging new work, just the opposite is true: violence has been diminishing for millennia and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species's existence. For most of history, war, slavery, infanticide, child abuse, assassinations, pogroms, gruesome punishments, deadly quarrels, and genocide were ordinary features of life. But today, Pinker shows (with the help of more than a hundred graphs and maps) all these forms of violence have dwindled and are widely condemned. How has this happened?		>This groundbreaking book continues Pinker's exploration of the essence of human nature, mixing psychology and history to provide a remarkable picture of an increasingly nonviolent world. The key, he explains, is to understand our intrinsic motives- the inner demons that incline us toward violence and the better angels that steer us away-and how changing circumstances have allowed our better angels to prevail. Exploding fatalist myths about humankind's inherent violence and the curse of modernity, this ambitious and provocative book is sure to be hotly debated in living rooms and the Pentagon alike, and will challenge and change the way we think about our society.		I absolutely recommend this book to everyone, there is really no other way to put it. A surprising side effect this book has had for me is that I don't get angry any more once I realized how warped my world view had become after a lifetime of watching News, politicians and talking heads. On nearly every issue, humanity is becoming much more peaceful, but you wouldn't know it from the echo chamber we live in. It really takes the fear out of living and gives the reader trust in the future and hope for humanity. 		It is a daunting book to undertake at 830+ pages of statistics, facts and data, so for those afraid to tackle something so large, I suggest the [Audiobook](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature-Audiobook/B005POZZAG/ref=a_search_c4_1_3_srTtl?qid=1433021901&sr=1-3). I read the book then about a year later listened to the audio, very well done and worth the listen.		Also, when reading reviews, be aware there was a campaign against this book by political parties who posted negative reviews without ever reading the book. For those of us in the book industry, there is a growing issue of review spamming books on political grounds so always be wary when a particular review stands out as odd.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_Book_Suggester","name":"t1_crq8qc0","parent_id":"t3_37v0ne","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433051075,"created_utc":1433022275}

It is an example of tyrannical politics meeting tyrannical politics and clashing. I would encourage any who are more interested in this to take a look at the Russian invasion of Finland. It perfectly displays Stalin total lack of regard for the well being of his people. 		It is easy to argue that the Russian leadership structure had been left with no choice but that excuse doesn't pan out when the battles they commanded are more closely examined. It was arrogance and in my opinion the most brutal dictator Russia suffered during the period of the war was Stalin him self. 		We will never again see casualty numbers anywhere near those the world saw during the second world war, short of nuclear war anyhow..		Modern weapons have made fortifying positions to the extent that they were fortified during ww2 absolutely pointless.

That is what I said here 		>> When speaking of Auschwitz specifically he used the revised numbers... 		and here 		>> As he uses the correct 1.1m victims		If you actually **paid** attention to my post...yadda yadda..		As for the 6m number, 6m has been used as the main number for about 45 years now. The calculations for the 6m number include a death count at Auschwitz of more than 4m Jews. 		Around 1990 (when, due to the collapse of communism, Soviet records became available to Western researchers) Auschwitz' death numbers are officially reduced by more than 3 million victims, a drop from more than 4m dead to about 1.1m Auschwitz dead. Of the 1.1m Auschwitz dead about 950k were Jewish, in total we have a drop of more than 3m Jewish victims. They even went out and bought a brand new plaque - [Old on left, new on right](http://www.whiteswillwinparty.org/wp-content/uploads/mindcracker.auschwitz-plaque-change.e.jpg).		Now, would you explain how the following sentence can be accurate when that 'total of 6 million' does not reflect the drop of 3 million? 		> The total 6 million deaths is accurate		If I do a math problem such as		A) 35K + 165k + 4m + 300K + 290K + 210k + 1m =		and then I to do this problem		B) 35K + 165k + (4m - 3m) + 300K + 290K + 210k + 1m = ???		Will I get the same answer to both problems? I don't think so, yet it seems you do.			**Edit** Again as this subject is sensitive let me say these changes and inaccuracies are not about Jewish people trying to trick others into believe more people were killed in the Holocaust than there really were. My curiosity is solely about the never changing number of 6 million when the numbers used to claim 6m have been reduced so radically. 		One reason for the confusion about number of deaths is the Soviets. The Soviets lied about many things they found. They lied about many camps (and not just about Jewish victims.) They claimed hundreds of thousands killed at Camp Y yet records now available (since the fall of Communism and access to these old Soviet documents came about) show fifty thousand really killed at Camp Y.  At Majdanek the Soviets claimed more than a million and a half were killed yet records now prove less than 100,000 people were murdered there. Auschwitz isn't unique in being a victim to Soviet propaganda. Much of the information provided by the Soviets, information we now know to be created fiction, was used against Germans during the Nuremberg trials. Great propaganda got great results.		The 6 million number isn't fact, it isn't remotely near factual. In fact the 6 million mythos is based heavily on now disproven Soviet propaganda. We no longer use the incorrect numbers that were based on that Soviet propaganda for the camps so we should no longer use the incorrect number built from that same propaganda for the total number of Holocaust deaths. 		To end: Nazis were just as evil if 3.5m or 4.5m or 5m were killed. Yet using correct information, teaching historical accuracy, pushing legitimacy are all more important than staying quiet about this incorrect claim simply because the claim is super sensitive and some people believe the claim to be historical inerrancy.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BobIsntHere","name":"t1_crr233t","parent_id":"t1_crq9wtu","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433127829,"created_utc":1433099029}

{"body":"> Auschwitz is notable for being a single location of extreme death tolls.		At quite a number of Soviet "liberated" camps we find these inaccuracies. One example is [Majdanek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdanek_concentration_camp#Death_toll) where the Soviets had claimed upwards of 2m (1m being Jewish) killed by Nazis yet records (accessed since the fall of the Soviet Union and availability to the records occurred) now show less than 100k total killed at the camp.		We also have instances such as Katyn Forest where the Soviets massacred tens of thousands of Polish officers and then blamed the massacre on the Nazis.		The Soviets were desperate to turn opinion against Naziism before and during the war and later the Soviets were desperate to get their revenge on the Nazis. The Soviets lied to accomplish both. This lie has been proven, it has been repeatedly proven, and it has been proven to be an incredibly successful and large lie.		In the Auschwitz and Majdanek examples we see the Soviets having claimed up to 5 million deaths that never occurred. Just two examples and 5 million that never happened.		The Soviet information, other than information which has been re-verified since the fall of the Soviet Union, needs to be considered highly doubtful and treated as "not-verified".  As only the Soviets "liberated" these death camps, until we can investigate all those old Soviet records we can not know the truth about the camps. 		Also - and this is in general to anyone reading this - the video claims only around 125k Roma were killed. This number is grotesquely low. New revisions state upwards up 700k Roma were killed. Roma were even the first people executed in gas chambers. In several nations the entire Roma population no longer existed after the war. The Roma lost upwards of 70-80% of their entire European population during the war. 		This needs to be noted too. I know no Roma, I know Roma in Europe are still treated 'uniquely', but they suffered as terribly as anyone else and no group suffered a larger proportional loss than they yet they are so rarely even mentioned, not even the courtesy of a routine reference when discussing the Holocaust.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BobIsntHere","name":"t1_crr5ab6","parent_id":"t1_crr2qwr","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433133855,"created_utc":1433105055}

{"body":"Like, nice graphs bro but the numbers are all over the place and the moralising message about the non-existing peace is just all kinds of fucked up. 		Data is beautiful, information is shit tbh. Like don't get me wrong, the data *is* well presented, but he just seems to be entirely arbitrary about what numbers are being used here. Where did the 20 and 40 million people under Stalin and Mao come from(Pretty much all figures about how Stalin killed X people for eg include an arbitrary number of people that were killed during World War II), for example, and why were they relevant for a video about wars? 		If we're including "Battle Deaths" then what constitutes a battle? Was each civilian personally shot or bombed by an enemy combatant, or did they die of secondary causes? About 2 million people seemed to disappear from the death counter in the concentration camps as well, mostly political dissidents(Communists, Trade Unionists, Liberals, Certain religious sects etc). 		imo there seems to be a fair deal of fouling up of the numbers here and a bias in presentation, but *graphically speaking* it's good and managed to get across a message of "Shit tonnes of people died". The message about how we're more peaceful today though is total shit. We have peace *in the developed world*, like come on, I know it's hard but sometimes you need to give a shit about everywhere else. There are as many refugees around now as there were at the end of WWII, so this great peace a'int real. Weapons have just gotten more precise so you don't have as many civilians bombed to fuck.		Also, colonial wars didn't end in the 70's. The last colonial conflict was arguably 1990 with Nambia's war of independence. And of course, we can't forget how entirely useless "war death" data is if we don't actually count people who *died as a result of the war*... The parameters just seemed to be entirely arbitrary. Like again, seeing as we're only counting battle deaths, that then excludes famines, illness etc. which make up a massive about of war death and suffering, especially today, which kind of puts a dent in how good this actually is.		Sorry to rain on everyone's parade here but someone needs to be critical instead of touching myself to a graphically impressive video which is otherwise very flawed.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cyridius","name":"t1_crqklwb","parent_id":"t3_37v0ne","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1433076865,"created_utc":1433048065}
