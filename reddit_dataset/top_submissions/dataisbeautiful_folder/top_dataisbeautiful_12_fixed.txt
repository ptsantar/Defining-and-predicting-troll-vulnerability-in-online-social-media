{"body":"Fertility decline is a really exciting phenomenon to see play out! The chart shows how American and Japanese age-specific fertility rates compare from 1947 to 2010 using data from the Human Fertility Database. Coding is done in R and the image assembly in Premiere. When I viewed the animation for the first time last night, I was really surprised to see the sudden drop and rebound in Japanese fertility rates for 1966. After searching for some kind of coding error and confirming that the dataset did indeed contain an anomaly, a quick google search explained the mystery.		The curse of the Fire Horse. There are 12 animals and 5 elements in the zodiac. Every 60 years when the Fire Horse comes around, the Japanese attempt to not have children for fear of birthing an unlucky daughter unsuitable for marriage. I found a recent journal article that studied the long term consequences for those that did happen to be born in the Fire Horse years of 1906 and 1966 and the data are fascinating!		The 2014 article is called Lives of the Firehorse Cohort: What the Statistics Show by Hideo Akabayashi, an economist at Keio University. Some fast stats:		* 25% decline in births from 1965 to 1966	* The all time Japanese record first-child ratio of births is 1966 at 50.9%, even though the TFR today is ridiculously low.	* The 1966 cohort has higher levels of education than neighboring cohorts (possibly less competition to get into schools)	* The 1966 cohort has a lower probability of marrying than neighboring cohorts		Aside from the Fire Horse being my favorite demography story to tell at parties from now on, it’s pretty neat watching how Total Fertility Rates for two countries can be about the same with totally different age-specific fertility rates. Also how the Japanese Total Fertility Rate starts higher than the USA and ends up way lower. Just goes to show how quickly things can change under the right circumstances!

They know they are ridiculously easy to influence, which is why they are going after influences, and tricking themselves into being something else. Its ironic since feminism claims it wants to change the society in which male traits are valued. To change it, it apes male traits. 		A good example of social engineering working in the opposite direction of feminism is the "leftover women" phenomenon in China. You tell women, rather unsubtly at that, that its "socially undesirable to be X, and they will fall over themselves trying to be Y.

{"body":"It's because women have low sex drives while men do not. They both enjoy it. But only one gender goes "after it" with zeal. To the point that in almost every human society, women are the ones who get asked out, and men are the ones who ask. 		In other societies (non-Western), there is a societal expectation of getting married/having-kids. So men will go after women and women are more pressured to take a chance. 		Wealth of a country, also makes a difference. Women have jobs/careers, they don't think about marriage except in their 30s, they don't think about kids until it's almost too late (~35). (both men and women are more picky and not willing to settle down or always looking for a better partner). Men typically tend to be more professional in the Western world and less likely to engage with women due to societal-taught social anxiety and fear of rejection, even when they think there is a chance they might like them.		In Western societies, men and women are typically believed to have no difference neurologically. Families do not pressure for getting married/kids as much. Families teach daughters and sons to go to college and get a job to be self-sufficient. Unlike in Eastern countries, people don't typically talk/socialize with strangers or neighbors due to a strong sense of safety. (the days of bringing pie to your neighbor are gone).		Finally, both men and women are told to pursue what they enjoy, so typically you'll find in Western countries science/engineering fields filled with men (they like helping people indirectly), you'll find liberal arts/medical filled with women (they like helping people directly). But in Non-western countries, women are much more pressured to go seek jobs like engineering, doctor, science. 		I may have missed at least 2-5 other reasons and small factors that culturally create the situation where family-raising is not favored in certain societies. 		Another reason could be the internet. Many people in Western world just decide they don't want to do anything but have fun or do their own hobbies alone. They may have addictions to TV or games or some other activity. People plug in their headphones everywhere or awkwardly look at their phone instead of talking.		Typically I also find that in Northern Europe, people tend to be colder and more distant. They are very afraid of embarrassment, have anxiety problems, and don't like to interact with strangers and like to keep to themselves. They don't like to socialize as much despite being quite happy with their own lives and having a lot of success in life.		If you find some of the things I say controversial, or think "it's like this everywhere", I am telling you. Live abroad for some years. You will notice a drastic change in social customs. 		You may have went to a starbucks, maybe even sat down and imagined yourself as sociable, maybe you went with a friend.

So let's get to the point, TFR is a rate often thrown around to imply we are either increasing, sustaining our population, or we're ageing/declining. But the catch is TFR is taking into account of *all* births from all the women that can have children. 		So the way TFR works in an example is that todays TFR takes all the births from 1970 - present, a TFR from 1965 is taking all the births from 1920-1965 and giving you a rate. So you could have a grandmother that has a child (the mother) in 1975, and she(the mother) has a child in 1995. So a TFR of today includes the child and the mother's birth in the TFR. 		So to reiterate, and I hope this makes it much clearer, if you [get the raw data of the fertility rates](http://i.imgur.com/1oUhlFA.png). Here you can see there's no rate for a 28 year old in 1995. that's because when the data was collected in 2012, there were no 28 year olds today (2012) that were born in 1995; that data doesn't exist until 2023, which is when all women born in 1995 will turn that age. So the link above is giving you the TFR for 2012 for women born from as late as 1997. 		So this is why a country at one stage can have a TFR of approximately ~1.6 for a few years, and have a growing population. Maybe because of immigration, or the generation that is venerable isn't that large in proportion to the population now, and perhaps the children of a larger generation are now having children, and the Crude Birth Rate is higher than the Crude Death Rate. Thusly leading to a positive Rate of Natural Increase. 		So does TFR correlate to a declining population? Well that depends on who you ask. Some demographers will say there's a correlation and we must aim for 1.9 and above. Others say it doesn't matter.		**TL:DR** Total Fertility Rate is like driving a car, and you can't see the road ahead, but you can see where you've been in the rear-view mirror. Age-specific is better, but it's the same thing essentially.","depth":3,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CatoMagnaCarta","name":"t1_cu0dp67","parent_id":"t1_cu0c52g","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439418219,"created_utc":1439389419}

The TFR had fallen to 1.75, so naturally you would think people are having less childen because the rate suggest less women are having children.

{"body":"True, however if we want to see see a change in say family structure, or when women are having children, and how many then it would be best in my opinion to see [all age specific fertility rates](http://i.imgur.com/q8X8HPC.png). TFR just clouds this data to a figure that encompasses the past two generations of fertile women. 		Also the thing is countries that didn't have a baby boomer generation like say Finland (its the first one I thought of) and a country that does, like USA. Well at the moment Generation Y is now at a stage where most of them are fertile, and a good half have graduated, and are in long committed relationships. So to get back on track, this generation are more often than not children of the Baby Boomers, and USA had a massive growth where the Baby boomers were larger than the silent generation. So therefore Gen Y is population bulge (and in most nations with a baby boom) larger than Gen X; now (and the next decade) is when this generation will start having children, causing another generation bulge.		Now Finland didn't have a baby boomer generation, this perhaps explains why their venerables (65+) are a larger share of the population than most European nations. 		So TFR could decline throughout the 1990's and early 2000's because the Gen X is smaller than the Baby boomers, leading to a lower TFR, but now it's Gen Y turn to bring their A game and we could see a TFR increase. I hope you understand where I'm coming from, my point is TFR is severely overrated.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CatoMagnaCarta","name":"t1_cu0giro","parent_id":"t1_cu0fgls","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439422687,"created_utc":1439393887}

This is an easy mistake to make because in layman's terms "fertility" seems to mean to mean the *ability* to produce children. You even used the term yourself: "Just because people are fertile doesn't mean they are trying to have kids". But this is technically incorrect: we can say that a couple has a high FECUNDITY but aren't trying to have kids (they are physically capable of having kids but taking methods to prevent it), but if they haven't actually reproduced, they aren't very fertile. 		*Edit: original language made it seam like fertility count completely ignores people who don't have children.

{"body":"If you refer to my response to hob196, I explain Total Fertility Rate. So CBR is Crude Birth Rate, it's the amount of children born in a year per 1000. and NIR is Natural Rate of Increase of a population. 		Here OP provides data of age-specific fertility rate. So how this is worked out is we can collect data of how old the woman is when they give birth. The issue I have with TFR is that it's like driving and you can't see the road ahead, but you have a rear-view mirror, and you can see where you've been. 		So like today's TFR is the rate of children born to fertile women, but a TFR in 1995 includes all births from 1950-1995. But of course the fertile age for women that gave birth were born from 1936-1981. With Age-specific fertility rate we can see whether women are having children earlier in life or later. 		This [data here](http://i.imgur.com/q8X8HPC.png) shows age-specific fertility rates, and shows that women in Australia are having children later in life than they did in the late 80's, and early 90's. If you look, you can see a fertility rate increase for the 30-34y/o category and 35-39y/o. Also there is a decrease in the 25-29y/o and 20-24y/o. But the TFR is the sum of all these age groups to give you one fertility rate. This is the rate that newspapers, and people like to use to say whether a nation's population is sustaining itself or not.		There is no semen or egg production. It's as simple as how many children are born and how old the mother was.

{"body":"Yes I sometimes forget how big and diverse the US are. But this answer is interesting. Just saying I don't want to deny anyone the right to choose when or if they want to have kids. I might be biased as a CF person but I find this answer interesting because I have pretty much the opposite opinion.  	I think you should start at 29. Fertility peaks for women between 20 and 31, but even after that you can only expect a decrease of ~3% each year until 35. It is down by about 50% comparing 31 and 39. So early to mid 30s sounds good to me. So much for that. This is how things can play out after HS, there are many other ways to do things but I will take this as an example because I know it best.  	HS at 18/19 + 3 years minimum for college + 2 years for uni (which is done straight after college around here by most people). So now you are 23 to let's say 25 (with some buffer time). Now you try to get your first job and build a career. Probably not the best thing to get pregnant while you're still at your first job/position. Add 2 years for promotion now you are 25-27. First time you have a bunch of disposable income and your own place. Time to explore the world and do stuff you like, find yourself, have fun, find what really moves you.  Give it 2-3 years if you want to, now if you really want kids you are 27-30 years old, good time to start. I personally would add some career years but whatever.  	That being said if you start working straight out of college you may want to go back for a higher degree later still or need longer to build your career to a good point to have kids.  	That is one of many possibilites to do it ofc. But how you arrive at 20-25 as a good age is beyond me. If you start working straight out of HS maybe....but I have no idea about how stable an environment one can expect with these qualifications at taht age and if it is suitable for kids.   	**TL;DR:** The years of 23-28 for me are those when you sort yourself out, work/career is stressful enough you need sometime for yourself before you start child-rearing - just my 2c  	*PS:* I might be wrong about this but in my pov taking time off of work for parental leave or to do stuff with kids is easier when you are better established already.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DOHDDY","name":"t1_cu0j72x","parent_id":"t1_cu0hqce","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439426624,"created_utc":1439397824}
{"body":"In the US, we don't really separate out college from university. The difference between the two is just that universities over graduate school programs for master's degrees. Here, too, most people who go to college go right after high school, but they finish around the age of 22. 		Because maternity leave isn't offered in the US, it doesn't make sense to establish your career first. Why work for 5 years and then have to quit your job to have a baby? Have your babies first, and then establish your career. Sure, money is tight, and you're probably on one income, but it's good to have your penny-pinching days (or salad-eating days, as my mom calls it). Also, it's good for kids to not get everything they want. 		By the time those kids are school aged, parents are about 30. That's not too old to start a career. Then kids are older when the parents have 2 incomes, which helps allow for kids to participate in school activities like band or whatever. 		That makes more sense than establishing a career first, spending the extra money extravagantly, and then having kids and needing to learn how to cut back on spending.

{"body":"If it's true that Japanese people statistically have fewer friends, fewer relationships (I'm assuming intimate), less sex, and are less likely to marry, I don't think it necessarily means they are "socially handicapped" and I don't think the cause of these phenomenons are due to social incompetency. 			Though Japanese people do have the fewest [digital friends on social networks](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11501625), it may suggest "a culture that embraces fewer but closer friendships." [This 2009 survey of Japanese interpersonal relationships](http://whatjapanthinks.com/2009/11/04/friendships-from-high-school-figure-highly-in-japan/) shows that the majority of those surveyed met their friends in high school. Social competency is not only measured by the number of friends you have, but by one's ability to maintain high quality and mutually satisfying relationships. It appears that the Japanese people value maintaining the relationships they already have over forming new ones. It may be for this reason you and your many foreign friends found difficulty in making close Japanese friends. I'd also comment that those coming from a society which values popularity, it's easy to mistake the cause of their small number of friends for social incompetency, but it's more probable that it's a difference in social values between countries causing a misunderstanding. 			So the phenomenons of fewer relationships, less sex, and less marriage may not be a result of social inadequacy, but of an entirely different cause apart from the individual. These issues are more likely institutional and due to things like a demanding workplace, conflicting social pressures, and an overall unattractiveness to what relationships, sex, and marriage may bring. [An expectation to work rigorous schedules, work unpaid overtime, and take less vacations](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/31/national/japanese-workers-average-16-hours-unpaid-overtime-month/#.VczM-bJVhBc) strips employees of their time to spend with a significant other. From what I learned in class, Japanese business careers may often force individuals to choose between a high-paying career away from their families or a low-paying career at home that makes it near impossible to support a family. Women are more independent and ambitious, seeking their own successful careers; yet, conservative attitudes in the home and workplace persist. [1 in 6 women in Japan suffer workplace discrimination over pregnancy](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/08/national/social-issues/1-6-women-japan-suffer-workplace-discrimination-pregnancy-survey/#.VczP7LJVhBc), commonly known as "maternity harassment." Also, women are expected to be the sole caretakers at home and do all the typical housewife chores alone, even if they are in a married relationship where both are working demanding careers. As a woman in a working society like this, I can imagine a single life focused on my career as way more attractive than a life in a relationship if that means extra work and discrimination at the workplace. 			As for hikkomoris, there is an estimate of about 1 million hikkomoris living in Japan. With a population of over 126 million, hikkomoris account for not even 1% of Japan. Hardly an epidemic. It's probable that there is a similar population of hikkomoris living in the United States, but they lack the name and visibility that Japanese shut-ins have. Does that make Americans socially handicapped? Not at all. 			Countries with higher suicide rates than Japan are Lithuania, South Korea, Hungary, and Latvia.

IT IS a culture deeply based on shame as many in the thread like to point out, but they have certainly made it easier for themselves by taking out the human element in these encounters. Also while their sex education is not that great, their overall education and the cultural factors like the importance of chastity and purity (e.g. IDOL culture where an idol is prohibited from having a boyfriend, and many others..) create a heightened sense of responsibility in the teenagers who, unlike their counterparts in other countries, imho, don't say "fuck it" and do the irresponsible as often.","depth":2,"score":46,"ups":46,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LongtailedNovelist","name":"t1_cu0djyz","parent_id":"t1_cu0cxd3","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439417972,"created_utc":1439389172}

They'd call you weird if you moved out of your parents house and into another place that was in the same city though.		Funnily enough I was speaking to her cousin the other day.
