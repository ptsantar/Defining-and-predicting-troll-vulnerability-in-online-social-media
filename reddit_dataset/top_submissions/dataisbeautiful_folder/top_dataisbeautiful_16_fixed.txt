{"body":"> Of all the wrestlers in the world, he is probably the one with strangest and most detailed career, both on screen and off.		On screen sure. Off? Not even close. Antonio Inoki ripped apart one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world, had an MMA fight with Muhammed Ali, freed hostages in Iraq through wrastlin', and got fired from the Japanese diet for working with the yakuza. Fabulous Moolah was a sex trafficker, pimp, and arranged conspiracies to fuck over many people to get ahead. The Von Erich family clearly built their family home on a voodoo burial ground. MVP was involved in hi-jacking a cruise ship and did time in jail for it. Atushi Onita got into the Japanese diet, did aid work in Afghan, claims to have broke  Wilt Chamberlain's record of sleeping with 20,000 women, then got kicked out of the diet for using government cash to host a threesome with a porn star and a government employee after which he got his own DS game. Kensuke Sasaki beat a trainee to death. New Jack killed three people as a bounty hunter, was a coke dealer in ECW, and attacked a guy over giving him 7-up instead of sprite. There was a whole conspiracy where a Mexican wrestler had a Japanese wrestler he was dating plant drugs on somebody or something like that not too long ago. Dynamite Kid broke his neices knee-caps with a mallet for insurance money and would wake up his wife by shoving a gun in her mouth for fun There's loads more.		Undertaker's off-screen life is pretty tame by wrestling standards, all things considered. He hasn't killed anybody, gone to prison, and he's not a piece of shit.","depth":3,"score":158,"ups":158,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"_FinestJellyBeansRaw","name":"t1_csg9oru","parent_id":"t1_csg1a9x","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435118456,"created_utc":1435089656}

No big obituaries in national or international media about their lifes and demise. Sometime they don't even have family members or friends left who would be able to update the article.		So sometimes, people only learn about those deaths by pure chance or because someone dedicated enough tries to find out what has become of that person, contacts families, organizations, etc. and eventually finds out about the deaths years after the fact.

With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.

It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet, across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

{"body":"Faith in who? The governing body, that's who.		That's my main grief. I don't hate you, nor your brothers and sisters, what I hate is the governing body controlling us. I say "us" because I'm currently a Jehovah's Witness myself, by title anyways, not by choice.		Tell me, what do you learn at these assemblies and meetings?		Well for starters, the last week we learned in our service meeting, about how David was punished for not asking God's permission for a census. Something arguably helpful. The problem was that he didn't ask permission. Okay, his bad, but what did Jehovah do? He killed 70,000 of his own people. This kind of reminds me of something Lord Farquaad would do from Shrek		[This is the scene I'm talking about](http://donthatethegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/funny-Shrek-Lord-Farquaad-sacrifice-speech.jpg)		Then this past Sunday we learned that we shouldn't question Jehovah when he does things we don't "understand". I put it in quotation marks since what we don't "understand" is how he can justify attrocities such as the one I just mentioned or how about when King David sent Bathsheba's husband to be put on the front lines, just so he could get his weiner wet, then instead of just giving him herpes or something, he killed his firstborn with his now wife? Hadn't god said a few books before that he **specifically** would **not** punish a child for the sins of the parent? Yes, in fact I have it here,		*Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.*- **Deuteronomy 24:16**		A few books later...		*The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.*- **Ezequiel 18:20**		But before all that God had already said the following in Exodus 20:5-6		*I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.*		Yikes.		But according to Paragraph 10 of Sundays Watchtower, I wasn't even supposed to question his authority.	 	Take a look of this excerpt of said paragraph		*" As we get to know Jehovah better as a Person, our love and appreciation for his ways will grow to the point that we do not need an explanation for everything he does. Be assured that such appreciation will grow in proportion to your efforts to study and meditate on God’s communication  through his written Word."*		Let's analyze that.		> As we get to know Jehovah better as a Person, our love and appreciation for his ways will grow to the point that we do not need an explanation for everything he does. 		Personally, this was my first red flag. The writers, (under the supervision of the GB) imply that one can reach a love for Jehovah so high, that we will not require an explanation for the things that leave us plebeians questioning whether or not he is loving.		This bothered me, because by that logic, if we **do** question then we don't love Jehovah enough yet; There's something wrong with **us** for questioning something he did.		According to the study, we should *all* reach a certain spiritual nirvana where we don't question him.		The Bible paints it differently in some cases.		For example, when Abraham was outraged at Jehovah for wanting to destroy Sodom and Gomorah,  He was utterly flabbergasted that he would do such a thing, so he **questioned** him, and God was willing to sit down and let Abraham question.		You can find the whole exchange in Genesis 18:16-33		We are led to believe thatAbraham didn't love God enough since he questioned him.		This is where I ask you, who do you have faith in, The Governing Body, who said we shouldn't question God, or the Bible, which gives biblical precedence to questioning God in times of apparent injustice?","depth":9,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thisguy4357","name":"t1_csgkxjx","parent_id":"t1_csgeotm","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435137596,"created_utc":1435108796}

{"body":"Bravo! Very objective arguments laid out clear. 		When I was in doubt about faith, those points didn't suffice to turn the lever for me because in the typical JW's reasoning they wind themselves out with vague insinuations of context and such. What really hit home was the following: 		Gideon was in doubt as was Lot. He received the mission to hunt down some Baal worshippers but didn't believe the order came from god right away. So he put up a test and said he will do it when some minor miracle was given that concerned only his question and didn't harm or advance anyone. God agreed. Twice. So if the bible is god's word and we're given a mission as well, we should have the right to put up a trial on our own. Furthermore, Mat 24:9-14 states that in the end times, god's servants wil be in a lot of trouble. Mat.28:20 states that Jesus will be there for his servants in these times. According to the bible, the Apostles and early christians had a lot of unearthly support as well.		So to any JW arguing: Just put up you own little trial and see what happens. Such a trial is supported by biblical examples and you will see the result yourself.

For a while, I tried to reconcile my religious beliefs with the scientific facts I knew were true, but it just doesn't work.  You can't believe that evolution is true if you are a JW, but evolution is very obviously real if you do any learning about what it actually says and is.  The breaking point for me was when they came out with that new brochure about creation a couple years ago.  I was really hoping that it would show me where I was wrong.  Instead, I got arguments like, "Hey, this thing is really complicated, it totally couldn't have just randomly happened!"  I did not find that a convincing argument.  Also, because I knew quite a bit about evolution, I quickly saw how the publication misrepresented what evolution actually implies, and attacked this strawman version of the theory.  Either the writers had next to no knowledge of the subject, or they were being blatantly dishonest.  When I researched the quotations from scientists in the brochure and saw how they were taken out of context to support the anti-evolution view, I knew it was the latter.

Yet, their confidence lies in a social and financial system that has no lasting future.” Watchtower 2012 Jun 15 p.23		“Are we encouraging young ones, who are often steered by schoolteachers and others to pursue the world’s higher education, to set spiritual goals instead and pursue the highest education—divine education?” Kingdom Ministry 2011 Oct p.3		“Higher education: Jesus warned against ‘seeking your own glory.’” Watchtower 2011 Jun 15 p.32		“What, though, of higher education, received in a college or a university? This is widely viewed as vital to success. Yet, many who pursue such education end up with their minds filled with harmful propaganda. Such education wastes valuable youthful years that could best be used in Jehovah’s service. (Eccl. 12:1) Perhaps it is not surprising that in lands where many have received such an education, belief in God is at an all-time low.” Watchtower 2008 Apr 15 p.4		“Rather than looking to the advanced educational systems of this world for security, a Christian trusts in Jehovah.” Watchtower 2008 Apr 15 p.4		“University and college campuses are notorious for bad behavior—drug and alcohol abuse, immorality, cheating, hazing, and the list goes on.” Watchtower 2005 Oct 1 p.28		“A university degree does not guarantee success in the job market.

Why not? Because all the evidence in fulfillment of Bible prophecy indicates that this corrupt system is due to end in a few years.

Therefore, as a young person, you will never fulfill any career that this system offers.

It may involve only a difference of weeks or months, not years." Watchtower 1968 Aug 15 p.499		"The fact that fifty-four years of the period called the "last days" have already gone by is highly significant.

Hertel ’65 writes that he is “teaching the Bible as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, getting to know my wife of 33 years, Bobbie, a little better, enjoying my four granddaughters, and teaching and doing research as an adjunct professor in the Department of Biology at West Chester [Pa.] University.” Retired after 35 years with the USDA Forest Service, Gerard works on African violet habitat descriptions and forest health monitoring." 	http://archive.umt.edu/montanan/f03/cnotes.html		In addition, Gerard Hertel's last name is omitted in the English version of Awake!

Behe's university has made him to publish a disclaimer that his opinions are not supported by his colleauges and the university, instead, they strongly disagree with him....

They certainly are not in any sense endorsed by either Lehigh University in general or the Department of Biological Sciences in particular.

You don't need to look very hard to find horror stories of sex abuse scandals, spousal abuse, etc. Of course JW apologists will tell you that these are either isolated incidents, blown out of proportion, the free choices of the participants (don't get me wrong- it's not like Scientology where they'll literally put you in an internment camp; but between the cult-like encouragement to minimize association with anyone who is not a Witness and the draconian Disfellowshipping procedure, many find themselves held mentally/emotionally hostage), or even the outright fabrication of the Devil and his followers.

{"body":"And where did you get your information from, their website?  They are not entirely open about their disfellowshipping practice because they don't want to scare away new converts.		I was disfellowshipped for 2 years because I had sex with my girlfriend a couple times.  During those 2 years, my sister, who didn't live at home, did not speak a single word to me.  My parents still talked to me because I still lived with them, so they had to.  All of my friends that I grew up with did not speak a single word to me for 2 years.  I went to the meetings, and everyone pretended like I was not there.  They would not even make eye contact with me.  If they saw me in public, they pretended like they didn't know me and kept going.  That's how disfellowshipping actually is, I don't know where you got your information.		And about the anti-science question, they are anti-science while claiming to be pro-science.  Basically, they are for any science that agrees with their doctrine, but against any science that disagrees with them.  "For the most part, they don't believe in evolution," no, **they absolutely do not believe in it.**  You are **not allowed** to believe in evolution and be a Jehovah's Witness.  You can't even believe that it's a mechanism that God used to create diversity in life, as the Catholics do.  If they find out that you believe in evolution, they will talk to you about it and try to convince you why it's wrong.  If you don't recant your belief in it, you will be disfellowshipped.  		Besides that, they believe that humans have only existed for 6k years, and any human artifacts dated older than that are just dated wrong because they claim that dating methods are unreliable.  Also, any fossils of human ancestors, like Australopithecus or Homo erectus, are just fossils of unrelated ape species, and the scientists are lying about them being human ancestors.  Also, Neanderthals are either just humans that looked different, or some JWs use them as evidence of the Biblical Nephilim.  		JWs also believe in the water vapor canopy theory for where the water of the Biblical Flood came from.  They believe that the entire planet was one jungle-like climate while the canopy was in place, until about 4k years ago.  This is their explanation for why there are fossils of trees under the ice in Antarctica.  That entire theory is so scientifically wrong that I don't even know where to begin. 		Interestingly enough, they never go into much detail about genetics, probably because that's the biggest piece of evidence that debunks almost everything that they teach.  It's hard to believe that humans have existed for only 6k years when you have to go back almost 300k years to find a genetic common ancestor of everyone alive now.  It's also hard to believe that all animal species on Earth were wiped down to a mating pair in a global flood 4k years ago when the resulting genetic bottleneck that would occur as a result of that doesn't exist.		So yeah, they are pro-science only when it fits their ideology, and they are for a lot of pseudo-science as well.

Of course, this is completely crazy, so they had to change the proof to something else, and now use the scripture in Daniel.  And of course, they never talk about how the original proof for 1914 had to do with the pyramids, the rank and file JWs have no idea about this.

Of course, one problem is that the only people who believe that Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 are the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Scholars and archaeologists all agree that it was 587.

Watchtower 1989 Sep 1 p.19		"Similarly, Jehovah is using only one organization today to accomplish his will. To receive everlasting life in the earthly Paradise we must identify that organization and serve God as part of it." Watchtower 1983 Feb 15 p.12		"Is it presumptuous of Jehovah's Witnesses to point out that they alone have God's backing? Actually, no more so than when the Israelites in Egypt claimed to have God's backing in spite of the Egyptians' belief, or when the first-century Christians claimed to have God's backing to the exclusion of Jewish religionists." Watchtower 2001 Jun 1 p.16		"During the final period of the ancient world that perished in the Flood, Noah was a faithful preacher of righteousness. (2 Peter 2:5) In these last days of the present system of things, Jehovahs people are making known Gods righteous standards and are declaring good news about the possibility of surviving into the new world. (2 Peter 3:9-13) Just as Noah and his God-fearing family were preserved in the ark, survival of individuals today depends on their faith and their loyal association with the earthly part of Jehovahs universal organization." Watchtower 2006 May 15 p.22 "Are You Prepared for Survival?"		"There are billions of people who do not know Jehovah. Many of them in ignorance practice things that God's Word shows to be wicked. If they persist in this course, they will be among those who perish during the great tribulation." Watchtower 1993 Oct 1 p.19		"If we stop actively supporting Jehovah's work, then we start following Satan. There is no middle ground." Watchtower 2011 Jul 15 p.18		"But Jehovah's servants already belong to the only organization that will survive the end of this wicked system of things." Watchtower 2007 Dec 15 p.14		"But if we were to draw away from Jehovah's organization, there would be no place else to go for salvation and true joy." Watchtower 1993 Sep 15 p.22		"Only Christian witnesses of Jehovah who successfully pass this test will survive and come forth like fire-refined gold for God's use in his precious new order." Watchtower 1985 Mar 1 p.14		"And while now the witness yet includes the invitation to come to Jehovahs organization for salvation, the time no doubt will come when the message takes on a harder tone, like a "great war cry."" Watchtower 1981 Nov 15 p.21		"But Jehovah God has also provided his visible organization, his "faithful and discreet slave", made up of spirit-anointed ones, to help Christians in all nations to understand and apply properly the Bible in their lives. Unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that God is using, we will not progress along the road to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do." Watchtower 1981 Nov 15 p.27		"They must appreciate that identifying themselves with Jehovahs organization is essential to their salvation." Kingdom Ministry 1990 Nov p.1		"Those who will form the nucleus of the "new earth", a new earthly society of rightly disposed people, are being gathered during these last days. They are already nearly seven million strong, in at least 235 lands and in some 100,000 congregations. These millions have been learning the righteous and just ways of Jehovah, and as a result, worldwide they enjoy a unity that is cemented by Christian love. Their unity is the most pronounced and enduring in the history of the world, a unity exceeding anything experienced by Satan's subjects." Watchtower 2007 Aug 15 p.26		"What will happen to young children at Armageddon? The Bible does not directly answer that question, and we are not the judges. However, the Bible does show that God views the young children of true Christians as "holy." (1 Cor. 7:14) It also reveals that in times past when God destroyed the wicked he likewise destroyed their little ones." Reasoning from the Scriptures pp.47-48		"Children are affected by the course of their parents, and parents are warned that their iniquity is visited on their offspring unto the third and fourth generation. (Ex. 20:5, 6) Parents are commanded to instruct their children in God's way, and if in these last days parents refuse to heed the divine instruction and warning they bring destruction upon themselves and their small children at Armageddon. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Eph. 6:4) According to justice God can leave such children dead, for, as Ezekiel showed, all die in their iniquity." Watchtower 1950 Nov 15 p.463 Questions From Readers		"By all the evidences this system of things is hastening to its final confrontation with the God of justice at Armageddon. Parents and children who fail to gain the "mark on their foreheads," that is, an adequate appreciation of God's moral standard, are sure to suffer. Parents will be held accountable for their children, and children will suffer for the failure of their parents." Watchtower 1968 Feb 1 pp.83-84		"Do not conclude that there are different roads, or ways, that you can follow to gain life in God's new system. There is only one. There was just one ark that survived the Flood, not a number of boats. And there will be only one organization- God's visible organization - that will survive the fast-approaching "great tribulation." It is simply not true that all religions lead to the same goal … You must be part of Jehovah's organization, doing God's will, in order to receive his blessing of everlasting life." You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth p.255		"To ensure their salvation, Noah and his family needed to exercise faith. This meant following instructions and the leadings of Gods holy spirit. During the great tribulation, it will be just as imperative that we follow the leadings of the holy spirit and obey Jehovahs instructions through his organization." Watchtower 1991 Sep 15 p.17		"In the near future this generation will see the foretold “great tribulation” that will bring an end to this present wicked system. (Matt. 24:21) At that time none of Jehovah’s faithful servants, the only ones surviving, will mourn over the destruction of the wicked. To the contrary, they will rejoice, even as Moses and his people rejoiced at the destruction of Pharaoh and his army." Watchtower 1977 Jun 1 p.345		"Any person who wants to survive into God's righteous new order urgently needs to come into a right relationship with Jehovah and His earthly organization now. Why is there such an urgency about coming to Jehovah's true worship now? Could not a sincere person wait until he actually sees Jehovah's executional judgments beginning, and then quickly come over to His side? While that might sound appealing to some, would there then be enough time to build the right relationship with Jehovah? The evidence from the Scriptures answers, No." Watchtower 1981 Nov 15 pp.16-17","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RomanVargas","name":"t1_csgepv3","parent_id":"t1_csgdcyf","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435126333,"created_utc":1435097533}

It's all just so insane how you people can keep buying this.  I hope you'll wake up when they change that again in a few more years.

That's why I only quoted the part that I did, because it sure doesn't sound like anything they would ever print.		I don't put much value in what the Bible has to say anymore, so believing anything in it is more important than the family bond just doesn't compute with me. At one point I would've agreed with you, but those days are well in the past.		To me, the Bible is a collection of ancient literature that holds some historical and some moral value. I don't believe it is the source of ultimate truth and understanding. It can't be the claim and the explanation and then also be the evidence of what it claims at the same time. 		I don't believe it is meant to be taken literally. Adam and Eve were not real people who were created just ~6000 years ago. Strong evidence shows of man's existence, advanced as we know him, going back well over 100,000 years. No original sin means no need for a ransome sacrifice. Evidence proves that the Flood as described in the Bible didn't happen, you just have to look for it. Languages being confused at the Tower of Babel didn't happen. We can trace the progress of language, it's roots and branches, back thousands of years before the time frame of the biblical story.		Anyone can say that their beliefs are from the Bible if they scripture hop enough. Really they should say the beliefs are based on their interpretation of the Bible. If they did that then it wouldn't be so easy to stand behind the Bible as a shield to justify hateful and hurtful actions.

My problem is with the GB, the corporate organization and the entire system from top down.		Maybe they're deluded or just victims of it all in a sense too, I don't know.

The term had only scattered usage prior to the 1990s, usually as an ironic self-description, but entered mainstream usage in the United States when conservative author Dinesh D'Souza used it to condemn what he saw as left-wing efforts to advance multiculturalism through language, affirmative action, opposition to hate speech, and changes to the content of school curriculums.[1] The term came to be commonly used in the United Kingdom around the same period, especially in periodicals such as the Daily Mail, a conservative tabloid that became known for the trope "political correctness gone mad."		>Scholars on the political left have said that conservatives and right-wing libertarians such as D'Souza pushed the term in order to divert attention from more substantive matters of discrimination and as part of a broader culture war against liberalism.[2][3] They have also said that conservatives have their own forms of political correctness, which is generally ignored.[4][5][6]","depth":2,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"09112001","name":"t1_csghtij","parent_id":"t1_csggtk2","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435131824,"created_utc":1435103024}

That's not only dishonest, it's completely insane - people have figured out that they don't have to work in order to live.  Republicans cut too far in the other direction - they want to cut everything with a whiff of social requirements, because the Democrats have gone completely insane with increasing government taxes and programs.  Obamacare, as it turns out, is now going to attack employer-provided healthcare plans, and require them to pay a 40% tax on plans which the government deems "too generous."
