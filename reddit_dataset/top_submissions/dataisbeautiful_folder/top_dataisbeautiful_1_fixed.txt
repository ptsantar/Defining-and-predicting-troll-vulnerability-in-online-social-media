{"body":"Fuckin' Dexter...		EDIT:  I feel like a lot of people are missing one of the fundamental things about the shit show that the end of this series became.  After season 6 (which was decidedly less thrilling than 4, the pinnacle), Dexter was renewed for "2 final seasons".  They knew for two years.  Two.  Years.  TWO YEARS!  They had two years to come up with a way to end this story that so many people invested themselves into and, not only did they fail to deliver on a proper ending for the main character, they failed to come up with any reasonable plot at all.  I actually rode with season 7 because I saw it essentially as the first half of the final season.  But by halfway through season 8, it was clear they weren't even trying.  They were introducing new characters whose plots went nowhere, leaving characters who were around from the beginning with no resolutions... it was the worst.  The WORST.","depth":0,"score":2172,"ups":2172,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cu858up","parent_id":"t3_3hkjsz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440013749,"created_utc":1439984949}

{"body":"I don't know how far into the series you got, but I just wanted to give my 2 cents on the show as a whole before getting to the finale. The first 2ish seasons are far different from the rest. It was very much a dark comedy to start, with focus on family and death and all that, but still lots of goofy quirky moments. For about half of the third season it actually gets incredibly dull. I almost stopped because things get almost too cheery, and there didn't seem to be any sort of conflict going on. But I was glad I didn't stop, because they were clearly setting up some really dark destructive for the characters and the show takes a massive turn in that season. Then, for the last 2 seasons, the characters become more broken and torn apart and completely fucked up that it was amazing to watch. While still having hilarious moments, it became far from a comedy, much like Breaking Bad wasn't a comedy but had moments thrown in that were hysterical. There were some incredibly emotional and strong moments, and some of the most important messages on life, death, family, and relationships than I've seen in any other show. The last half of season 5 is such an emotional rollercoaster that really builds up to the finale (specifically the final scene), that just describing the scene itself doesn't do the impact of the finale justice.		But, if you still want to know, without going into too much detail (but obviously some), the last scene starts with one of the characters getting ready to leave the house so they can start a new life/career on the east coast. They don't want to leave and be so far from the family, and they're also afraid of what the uncertain future will hold for them. As the character is driving away, we see a 5-6 minute montage of what happens to the family over the next few years - people getting married, children being born, birthdays being celebrated, and ultimately, each characters death.

The final episode is one of the characters leaving on their own to do their own thing.

Also, one of the central characters dies about four episodes before out of the blue, so the last few episodes have been wrapping that up.

Season 5 seemed to be like an even more forgotten season than any of the others, as far as meaningful references in future seasons, character progression etc., from what I can remember, Debra is really the only one that had anything in that season that contributed to her character progression, in that she let Dexter and Lumen get away at the end which later builds into her taking further liberties with the law.

In another season, he killed a guy who turned out to be 100% innocent, which happened because Dexter didn't stick to the code. Then I think in season 7, Rudy shows up as his Dark Passenger.

Finales are very difficult to do. They have to stay true to the show but still give a sense of closure at a satisfactory ending.  Those two things do not naturally go together.  A good TV show makes you believe that a lot can happen in an episode but everything fundamentally stays the same.  That's the only way you can both care about what is happening to the characters but continue to love them year after year. 		The Futurama finale is one of the best. It is very much a futurama episode with traditional sci-fi tropes with a touching ending while throwing in some great jokes and being mean to Zoidberg. It also resolves the Fry and Lela story showing that they really and truly are in love.

But the truth is, he wasn’t ever going to finish the list. The basic idea of the ending was that while he was stuck on a really hard list item he was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it. Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it. They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl. He asks them where they got the idea of making a list and they tell him that someone came to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else. Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with list and that he’s finally put more good into the world than bad.

The officer on board is shown Sheppard's ID and immediately drops all intention of arresting the people on Serenity and treats Sheppard's wounds and seems to show him great respect.		In the comic, Sheppard reaches a relatively high rank within the Alliance before causing a military disaster so bad that he is immediately dishonorably discharged and shot out of an escape pod into the desert.

But it's more of a storytelling flaw that probably would have been smoothed out if presented properly through the show rather than through a secondary channel years later.

It ultimately left me feeling like they were just trying to produce the minimum number of pages required to publish something and sell it, rather than wanting to create the comic out of a legitimate desire to tell a story.		I can summarize the comic by saying "Sheppard had a bad childhood, joined the brown coats to infiltrate the Alliance, rose through the ranks, got a bunch of people killed in an ambush, became a drunk, then joined a monastery, also his name is really Henry Evans", and you will have all the information the comic gives you. They don't explore his character, they don't explore why he hated the Alliance so much, why he was so immediately willing to go on an undercover mission that could get him killed and required the loss of his eye, how he felt betraying the Alliance after being a model soldier for decades, what it is that actually drove him to the bottle, then what following that drove him to God.

Dramas have a much better chance of doing this as opposed to sitcoms like Scrubs or HIMYM, as sitcoms are about the mundane week to week shenanigans and not the underlying story, but dramas definitely aren't excluded from being ruined by weak writing. The most fun I ever had watching television was Lost, but when you invest in these deep, intricate, compelling mysteries that seem to have some underlying meaning and then they just get ignored and spit balled in to something else next week at the writer's table, exposing their frivolous nature, it's just insulting.

{"body":"I found this on imdb a few months ago that **perfectly sums up why it was  good ending**. 		-------------------------------------------			Regardless of all the talk about the hate for the finale, it was truly a great and epic finale. Remember this was a 9 year show and a lot has happened...		Here is a counter to most of the criticism I've seen:		The Robin/Barney wedding was important because it's not about the fact that it failed, it was great because of how it happened. And how it subsequently aligned with Ted leaving NYC. And they did move the entire 9th season around how he met the mother. The entire season was each characters run in with the mother somehow before Ted finally met her.		When Ted met the mother, it showed true love. But clearly the difference was that of true love vs. your soul mate. He had his fantastic life with the mother and essentially had his cake and got to eat it too with Robin at the end. Remember, almost 20 years had passed since he met the mother...You have to put it in perspective that they went through over 20 years in 2 episodes and did it pretty flawlessly in my opinion.		At the time he met the mother, he knew his time with Robin was over. He didn't love her and absolutely fell for the mom. For good reason. Their characters were perfect together. They couldn't have cast a better mother. The creators had a vision from start to finish. From season 1 to the end. And they stuck with it. A lot of people are not down with that. I loved it.		Let's look at the final scene: the blue horn. Bringing it back to the very first pilot episode. You don't find many shows that can do that after 9 seasons.		Look, the show was ending. They had to wrap it up. The story WAS about how he met his mother but then his kids told him otherwise. Ted didn't even realize his story was about Robin the whole time. This show as a whole always came down to Robin, every narration talked about Robin or what she was doing. Ted said from the first time he saw her that he was going to be with her and that "it always goes back to Robin." Also Remember, at this time the mother had been dead SIX YEARS. Life moves on.		During Robin's wedding realizing that Ted was the guy she should have been with. From season 1 to stealing the blue horn to the last season tracking down the locket. The scene where Robin says she should have ended up with Ted was a perfect ending to the first episode of the two.		The point was that Ted knew he loved Robin from the second he met her and Robin realized that after marrying Barney that she made the wrong choice.		They also ended the show exactly how the pilot started 9 years ago. Robin wanted to travel the world and be famous and Ted wanted a serious loving relationship with children. Both got what they wanted and then ended up together. They lived their lives for 15 YEARS before getting back together. The fact that they focused on Barney and Robin's wedding the whole season and then got them divorced THREE YEARS later was extremely realistic and not surprising at all since they were always sketchy about going into the marriage in the first place. And no can say that Barney and Robin divorcing was not a realistic outcome. She even knew it was wrong the day of her wedding and that Ted was the right guy.		Also AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, you forget that Ted was the mom's second choice as well because she was engaged to that guy that died on her birthday and the one she broke up with right before the wedding.		At the end of the day, it was a great ending primarily because it was so REALISTIC. His relationship with the mother was absolutely beautiful. You truly felt what they had for each other. In the first season, Robin referenced that Ted would be the one who got away but the timing was wrong because she wanted to be famous. Then when she got that, Ted got his kids, and the timing was right. That fact does not remove one bit of greatness from the relationship he had with his mom and it doesn't take any of the love away from that. She died. It was 6 years later. He loved the mother with all his heart but she died and he needed to move on.		The mom was essentially insignificant to the story but she added the perfect touch. It was always about Robin and throughout the years, people lost sight with all the sub plots, but it was always about Robin. The future Ted narration ALWAYS talked about Robin. These episodes incorporated SO many amazing references from past seasons, especially the first. When you end a show, not everyone will like the ending but they had to keep the vision they had. 9 years was a long time but they stuck to their story which was great! Even using a clip from his children from 9 years ago! Imagine the non-disclosure agreement on that one!		The last 4 seasons didn't have much Ted and Robin but the last season really showed how Ted and Robin were really meant for each other. The fact that Ted did all that stuff with finding the necklace, trying to get over Robin, etc. And then he met the mother. So at the end, it truly showed us through all the bull *beep* they were still meant to be together.		Ted knew that from the beginning and Robin found that out after marrying Barney.		I think the main problem people have is putting the timing of going through decades of life into 40 minutes and not fully accepting that fact. A lot changes in decades. Hands down this is one of the best sitcoms of all time and that ending really made the show even better. My favorite scene was when him and the mother meet under the yellow umbrella and they just go through years of episodes in one little scene. It was truly beautiful. The whole thing was truly beautiful. For the short time they had to fit that all in, they did a phenomenal job! One of the Best Series Finale's EVER. When the dust settles and the fans who hated it will see that it was truly the perfect ending.		The fans had less than 5 min to react to the mother's death, the kids had 6 YEARS. thats huge, so Ted did nothing wrong, grieved the mom and loved her to the fullest and at the right time in their lives when back to Robin, his soul mate.		This story is about love (the mother) vs. soul mate (Robin) and fortunately for Ted he got both. (Ted was 52 when he went back to Robin)!

You're still looking at it like she's a main character.  If Marshall died, we would have need time to digest it.  Despite the implication (i.e. her name is in the title) and the desire of the audience, she was a very minor character.  The journey was 99% and the destination (i.e. the Mother) was trivial.  		I felt the same way even up until I sat down for the series finale.  Then I remember thinking "Ok, we're going to meet the mother and see their happy ending.  But... why do I even care about "meeting" her and learning about her?  The show is _over_ and they've barely introduced her."  That helped me minimize the mother's role and I wasn't thrown for a loop when she died.		We thought this whole story was about how Ted met the mother, but when it came down to it, he talked about her very minimally over 9 seasons and we barely "met" her.  Yeah it sucked for Ted, but I felt more emotion when Marshall's dad died or Marshall and Lily fought in the last season.

If you liked Korra and are interested in the art books, I have the three that are out and they are really amazing.  		The comic order goes like such:		* *The Lost Adventures* (one shots taking place during the *The Last Airbender*, not associated with the current comic book Avatar sequels)	* *The Promise* (Part 1/2/3)	* *The Search* (Part 1/2/3)	* *The Rift* (Part 1/2/3)	* *Smoke and Shadows* (Part 1/2/3)(Not released yet)	* There are also [Free](http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/18-734/Free-Comic-Book-Day-2011-Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Star-Wars-The-Clone-Wars) [Comic](http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/22-422/Free-Comic-Book-Day-2013-Star-Wars-Captain-Midnight-Avatar-The-Last-Airbender) [Book](http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/25-449/Free-Comic-Book-Day-2014-All-Ages) [Day](http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/27-244/Free-Comic-Book-Day-2015-All-Ages) one-shots that were released.  You might need to do some digging to find the 2011 and 2013 ones.	* *Korra* comics were recently announced, and will be written by Michael Dante DiMartino, but we don't know when those are coming.		I believe there are places you can view them for free... if you go that route and like the series, please consider buying them to show your support.

I always thought the central conflict, the climactic moment, wasn't Aang going into the Avatar State (which was otherwise another contrived moment) but Aang almost killing Ozai in the Avatar State ("FIRELORD OZAI, YOU AND YOUR FOREFATHERS...") and controlling the Avatar State for the first time and sparing him. The show had set up a conflict of ideals (airbender) vs. responsibility (Avatar), and true to its optimism, Aang found a way to preserve both (which fits the show's tone imo). Whether energy bending (i.e. the mechanism) was DEM or not, the fact is that he already knew how he wanted to defeat Ozai (remember his joke about "We'll put him in a bunch of glue so he can't bend anymore!") and he just needed to find the mechanism to find it.

{"body":"How I saw the ending: 		Tony has and does view everything in life as a moment waiting to be murdered for everything that has happened. The final scene is portrayed in moments where the director makes you think he could be killed at any moment. Particularly by the young Italian looking man that goes to the bathroom who he watches closely, this is reminiscent of the Godfather's Michael Corleone going to the bathroom to retrieve a pistol that was hidden in the toilet to commit his first murder and descent into a criminal life. 		Tony feels especially vulnerable in this way in front of his family, because that in his mind is the worst way it could happen.		The scene itself also has a double meaning/ending, which is that Tony could've been killed in that last moment. It is related to a quote he once said in the series. I can't remember or find the quote but it's along the lines of:		"You'll be happy, you won't notice anything, you won't see it coming, and then...Darkness. Edit 2: ~~And it'll be your best friend who does it to you."~~ that parts definitely from Donnie Brasco.		It's a brilliant ending.		Edit: FTR there are a lot of people talking about how they think the ending went one way or another for sure.

Every person watching anything now wants everything shown to them, in all its glory. They wants someones death right in their face.

The abandonment of technology was also not surprising and it also sort of explains why stories of Earth were regarded as legends rather than solid fact.  After settling in the twelve colonies following the exodus from Kobol, the colonists likely destroyed all of their technology (they did this in the original series, though I don't know if it was explicitly explained in the re-imagined series).

{"body":"Okay so on a plot level 		* Yes the flashforwards were a "purgatory," although I dislike calling it that, that exists in some future after they all die and everything on the island actually happened	* The point of the island was to hold back some unknown malevolent force, there is literally a cork but the island itself is a cork	* Jacob's brother after being killed by Jacob interacted with the malevolent force and became a living embodiment of it aka the Smoke Monster	* I forget about the water tbh	* The point of the Swan was to study the island's electromagnetic properties but when they were building the Swan the hit a pocket of massive electrical energy that nearly destroyed the Island. Later the Swan was built and the number system was put into place to discharge the energy periodically. 			But I think the crux of the show isn't the mysteries or the good vs evil plot with Jacob and the Man in Black but rather the show is about the characters and learning how to move on. That's the reason why I dislike calling it purgatory because it's more of a metaphor for the time all the characters spent on the island, their deep connections to one another and a testament to how far they've come as people. They all started off as horrible, broken people with shitty lives but they helped each other to move past that. So literally, plot wise, they do go to purgatory and all move on together but it's much more meaningful than that and I feel like so many people missed that.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheParhelicCircle","name":"t1_cu8go8z","parent_id":"t1_cu8fgji","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440033865,"created_utc":1440005065}

{"body":"Given the current format of television with longer story arcs, I really feel there's a great potential for a new series.		Discard the reboot universe. Pick an interesting period of Star Trek's history and tell an extended story that covers shorter seasons, with hour long episodes. 		The key thing, which the reboot lacks, is a sense of character development. Kirk had the benefit of a logical side, brought forward by Spock and a more emotional and compassionate side brought forward by Bones. Similarly Picard's whole crew supported him with what could be seen as differing aspects of humanity. This drives a sense of character development. Also the sense of exploration is also important, but primarily Star Trek was always a vessel for exploring our humanity.		You could take a character like Picard and show some of his 22 years aboard the Star Gazer. There's plenty of fuel in the story of a young and impetuous man becoming a leader - while also becoming a bit hardened and a little more emotionally distant from his crew.		It works as a counterpoint to TNG where in the beginning he's cold and distant, and over the series connects more with his crew - think of that final scene of All Good Things where he ends up sitting with his crew and playing poker. Except this is perhaps a more melancholy ending.		Or you could always pick a less well explored period of Trek history. It means the story has to stand up on its own two feet. Rather than how the reboot stuffed itself with poorly thought out bits of fan service (am I supposed to care that this shell of a character says 'I'm a doctor, not... whatever'), it's a solid story in its own right. 		You could tell an espionage story set during the Klingon-Federation civil war. Explore that furthest edge of Federation morals where a crew has to survive undetected, without carrying the rest of the Federation into war, but also serve the objectives of ensuring that the Federation is prepared for any kind of conflict heading its way. The story becomes less about the obvious fact that they don't start a war, but about who they become along the way.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vonn84","name":"t1_cu9bgfn","parent_id":"t1_cu88j1s","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440093564,"created_utc":1440064764}

But the ultimate answer had nothing to do with science. Instead, we were told that the island had a cave of magical light. It was just… magic. And there were some guys playing a wager about good and evil, which somehow translated to the main character having to put a cartoon-looking plug into the cave’s light hole. As if that wasn’t ridiculous enough, the show spent pretty much its entire run telling fans that no, the characters were not in purgatory. They were on a literal island. But the final season showed characters in two realities – one surviving on the island and one as though they’d never crashed. And the final episode revealed that’s because the ones where they hadn’t crashed were them all in some limbo-type of reality after they had died and they were all waiting to go to heaven together. So fans’ first guess was pretty much 100% true. There is a contingent of fans that will defend this as a good finale, but it’s like dealing with someone defending their abuser.","depth":3,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pewpewlasors","name":"t1_cu8i05j","parent_id":"t1_cu89x25","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440035715,"created_utc":1440006915}

It was an insane ride, and what kept it all together is the WONDERFUL cast. It was, despite all, an extremely strong character study, and perhaps fittingly, the finale concluded that.			The mysteries? Yeah.... that was a bit of a blunder, but at the end of the day, when it comes to mysteries, it's always the trip that matters, not the destination.

Lost was really the first show that made people actually go on the internet and discuss the story with other fans.

{"body":"One of the worst in history right there.			http://www.therobotspajamas.com/the-worst-sci-fi-tv-finales/			>No one will defend this finale, not even the actors from the show or the showrunner. Okay, the executive producers will. Because they basically used their power to make the final episode which they had the gall to say would be a “love letter to the fans” and instead stomps on the characters fans had invested in for four seasons. Manny Coto ran the show and knew there would be no fifth season. The final batch of episodes told interesting stories about the Eugenics War and a hybrid Vulcan/human baby between the will they/won’t they couple of T’Pol and Trip, created by a guy trying to create anti-alien sentiment (played by future Star Trek Into Darkness actor Peter Weller). It was a really good season. And then the executive producers, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, stomped in and created the single worst finale I’ve ever witnessed.		The show jumps ahead six years and we quickly learn that the episode we’re watching is actually a holodeck recreation and that Riker and Troi, from Star Trek: The Next Generation, are supposedly watching this so Riker can make an important decision. It’s set during season 7 of that show even though that was made 11 years ago and the actors look every bit of it. It’s so insulting to suddenly turn the denouement for Enterprise into something a character from another show is watching to help him make an unimportant decision. It breaks up T’Pol and Trip and then, in a super-forced and completely unnecessary moment, kills off Trip. There’s no emotional weight to it. It’s just a thing tossed in to spice up a dull episode. It really, really, really sucks. Notice I haven’t even mentioned Captain Archer, the protagonist? He’s bringing the ship to the signing of something or other that forms the Federation but he’s really not important to the episode. None of the cast is. It’s all about Riker having fun on the holodeck.

{"body":"Korra had an awful ending. Her character plot was all over the place all season long and squandered. The overall story arc and character arc was fumbled in the finale and made no sense. And as someone that was shipping Korrasami back in Book 2 the ending was not earned at all.		But even ignoring the last 10 min of the episode which felt hollow and fumbled, the actual structure of the episode was a mess. At best, I think it did a good job with the action sequences and incorporating the side characters. But when it came to the actual plot itself and the characters, the finale really falls apart.		It's just so depressing how badly they dropped the ball with Kuviras plot and how in the last 15 min they try to make a person who created slave camps, was basically racist, and who was willing to use a Nuke on an entire city -- as just being misunderstood. The ground work for Kuvira being more than a mustache twirling villain was not there. And having Korras final plot tie to Kuvira and have her relate to Kuvira was just beyond bizarre.		We got no real closure from the group. The worst aspect of Korra was always the relationships (they were often anemic, and characters spent so much time apart it never made sense why they were even a group or friends at all). And while I can accept that friends over time may grow apart, that was never a plot set up. So instead it really deprived the audience from any closure. 		To top it all off, we get an out of left field resolution of Korras character arc by realizing she needs to have more compassion (Korra lacking compassion was never her characters plot/obstacle). 		I really thought Book 4 was a missed opportunity. Almost as if the writers had lost all steam and were just spinning their wheels. Much of the season felt squandered (they could have used that time to flesh characters out more or work towards character resolutions). I really wanted to love Korras ending, but thought it was really bad. Surprised so many critics gave it a good score. Then again, as a big fan of the world, I've always thought critics were a lot easier on Korra (Book 2 had a lot of issues, and even the creators have talked about that).","depth":1,"score":39,"ups":39,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cu89zuc","parent_id":"t1_cu86ffs","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440023925,"created_utc":1439995125}

They had an intended standalone miniseries in Season 1, and got renewed for three more seasons. That's why Season 1 doesn't flow into the following three too well- it had a hard-stop end.		The following 3 seasons had to try to do the work of a series 1.5 times its length. 		It comes down to simple math. Korra's 13-14 episode seasons had 286-308 minutes to work with for each story arc. while Last Airbender 20-21 episode seasons had 440-462 minutes to work. That's a minimum of *two hours* more screen time to build character relationships and smooth the edges of the plot.

That kind of mechanical feeling to the plotting and structure of Season 4 is what made it so overall poor. Actually, for all its problems (including an awful villain), I prefer Season 2 just because it has heart.

{"body":"I found this on imdb a few months ago that **perfectly sums up why it was  good ending**. 		-------------------------------------------			Regardless of all the talk about the hate for the finale, it was truly a great and epic finale. Remember this was a 9 year show and a lot has happened...		Here is a counter to most of the criticism I've seen:		The Robin/Barney wedding was important because it's not about the fact that it failed, it was great because of how it happened. And how it subsequently aligned with Ted leaving NYC. And they did move the entire 9th season around how he met the mother. The entire season was each characters run in with the mother somehow before Ted finally met her.		When Ted met the mother, it showed true love. But clearly the difference was that of true love vs. your soul mate. He had his fantastic life with the mother and essentially had his cake and got to eat it too with Robin at the end. Remember, almost 20 years had passed since he met the mother...You have to put it in perspective that they went through over 20 years in 2 episodes and did it pretty flawlessly in my opinion.		At the time he met the mother, he knew his time with Robin was over. He didn't love her and absolutely fell for the mom. For good reason. Their characters were perfect together. They couldn't have cast a better mother. The creators had a vision from start to finish. From season 1 to the end. And they stuck with it. A lot of people are not down with that. I loved it.		Let's look at the final scene: the blue horn. Bringing it back to the very first pilot episode. You don't find many shows that can do that after 9 seasons.		Look, the show was ending. They had to wrap it up. The story WAS about how he met his mother but then his kids told him otherwise. Ted didn't even realize his story was about Robin the whole time. This show as a whole always came down to Robin, every narration talked about Robin or what she was doing. Ted said from the first time he saw her that he was going to be with her and that "it always goes back to Robin." Also Remember, at this time the mother had been dead SIX YEARS. Life moves on.		During Robin's wedding realizing that Ted was the guy she should have been with. From season 1 to stealing the blue horn to the last season tracking down the locket. The scene where Robin says she should have ended up with Ted was a perfect ending to the first episode of the two.		The point was that Ted knew he loved Robin from the second he met her and Robin realized that after marrying Barney that she made the wrong choice.		They also ended the show exactly how the pilot started 9 years ago. Robin wanted to travel the world and be famous and Ted wanted a serious loving relationship with children. Both got what they wanted and then ended up together. They lived their lives for 15 YEARS before getting back together. The fact that they focused on Barney and Robin's wedding the whole season and then got them divorced THREE YEARS later was extremely realistic and not surprising at all since they were always sketchy about going into the marriage in the first place. And no can say that Barney and Robin divorcing was not a realistic outcome. She even knew it was wrong the day of her wedding and that Ted was the right guy.		Also AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, you forget that Ted was the mom's second choice as well because she was engaged to that guy that died on her birthday and the one she broke up with right before the wedding.		At the end of the day, it was a great ending primarily because it was so REALISTIC. His relationship with the mother was absolutely beautiful. You truly felt what they had for each other. In the first season, Robin referenced that Ted would be the one who got away but the timing was wrong because she wanted to be famous. Then when she got that, Ted got his kids, and the timing was right. That fact does not remove one bit of greatness from the relationship he had with his mom and it doesn't take any of the love away from that. She died. It was 6 years later. He loved the mother with all his heart but she died and he needed to move on.		The mom was essentially insignificant to the story but she added the perfect touch. It was always about Robin and throughout the years, people lost sight with all the sub plots, but it was always about Robin. The future Ted narration ALWAYS talked about Robin. These episodes incorporated SO many amazing references from past seasons, especially the first. When you end a show, not everyone will like the ending but they had to keep the vision they had. 9 years was a long time but they stuck to their story which was great! Even using a clip from his children from 9 years ago! Imagine the non-disclosure agreement on that one!		The last 4 seasons didn't have much Ted and Robin but the last season really showed how Ted and Robin were really meant for each other. The fact that Ted did all that stuff with finding the necklace, trying to get over Robin, etc. And then he met the mother. So at the end, it truly showed us through all the bull *beep* they were still meant to be together.		Ted knew that from the beginning and Robin found that out after marrying Barney.		I think the main problem people have is putting the timing of going through decades of life into 40 minutes and not fully accepting that fact. A lot changes in decades. Hands down this is one of the best sitcoms of all time and that ending really made the show even better. My favorite scene was when him and the mother meet under the yellow umbrella and they just go through years of episodes in one little scene. It was truly beautiful. The whole thing was truly beautiful. For the short time they had to fit that all in, they did a phenomenal job! One of the Best Series Finale's EVER. When the dust settles and the fans who hated it will see that it was truly the perfect ending.		The fans had less than 5 min to react to the mother's death, the kids had 6 YEARS. thats huge, so Ted did nothing wrong, grieved the mom and loved her to the fullest and at the right time in their lives when back to Robin, his soul mate.		This story is about love (the mother) vs. soul mate (Robin) and fortunately for Ted he got both. (Ted was 52 when he went back to Robin)!

It was a detective show.  It was the most immersive, detailed, and hyped mystery in the history of the medium of television.  Yes, it had characters.  All stories have characters.  Yes, some of those characters developed, and yes, that was a good thing.  But character development didn't drive that show, and neither did the dozens of "shipping" derivatives that portions of the fanbase obsessed over.  No, what drove the show was mystery, was suspense, what drove the show was, at its core, JUST WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON ON THAT ISLAND?  		I can't even believe this point is debated.  		Mystery permeated the entire show.  Specifically, mystery ABOUT THE PLOT.  It was *the plot*, not the characters, that was the show's entire essence.  And not just the show, but the entire phenomenon around the show THAT THE CREATORS FOSTERED.  They fostered it with a weekly podcast from the two of them, which always took questions on the mysteries and always, ALWAYS, implied that there would be answers.  Answers we were *starved* for. And they stoked the fires of our passion for answers [knowing full and god damn well that they'd never pay it off](http://uproxx.com/tv/2015/01/a-writer-from-lost-came-forward-and-admitted-to-what-we-knew-all-along/).		Still not convinced?		[The Lost Experience](http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lost_Experience) was an actual, real-world, go out and find shit on the internet and in real life mystery that we all could participate in and solve.  There were puzzles that revealed more information on the Dharma Initiative, what they were doing, how they were doing it, who was funding them, why they were funding them.  It was information we couldn't live without because we had bought in so hard to the MYSTERY they were asking us to solve.  They promised that there would be answers, but they only ever answered things with more mystery.		Every season finale, come to think of it, ended with a mystery. 		Season 1 - A HATCH?! What the fuck is that?		Season 2 - "We're the good guys, Michael."  What?  The Others are the good guys? How?  What are they doing?  Why does everyone need to stay away from their side of the island?  Why wouldn't people be able to find the island if Michael tells them where he came from?  HOW DID A POLAR RESEARCH STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE FIND THE ISLAND?  Why are the numbers so goddamn important?		Season 3 - FLASH FORWARD!?  What the shit!?  What happened?  How? Why? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?		Season 4 - TIME TRAVEL AT ANOTHER DHARMA STATION ARE YOU SHITTING ME?  A WHEEL OF TIME?  THERE'S LITERALLY A WHEEL OF TIME?  WHAT.		Season 5 - Wait, Locke is now the man in black?  Why?  Why did Jacob let Ben kill him?  What are they fucking doing?  WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY?		Season 6 - Is that a golden bathtub plug?  OH JUST GO FUCK YOURSELF.				There was a great article written about the finale once it was all over.  The author of that piece [encapsulates the problem perfectly](http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2010/05/25/the-betrayal-of-mystery/).		>I’ve got no problem with sorcerers, demons, and magic caves as elements of a heroic fantasy.  I do have a problem with a story that pretends to be something rational, only to drop such elements on the audience at the eleventh hour, to cover the embarrassing inability of the writers to finish what they started.  Not even the most satisfied viewer of the Lost finale can pretend the show began with an honest confession that its puzzles were random and insoluble.  A commitment was made to the fans, both implicitly through the scientific trappings of early episodes… and explicitly through interviews given by the producers… that it would all make sense in the end.		>The show achieved its greatest popularity during the years when eager fans flooded chat rooms with theories about The Numbers, The Hatch, the island’s fertility issues, the “sickness”, the frozen donkey wheel, the “special” children, and countless other plot twists.  If the producers had stated none of these riddles would ever be solved, most would be completely forgotten, and some would simply be dismissed as sorcery, those chat rooms would have turned into ghost towns overnight.		>It’s not merely a question of riddles left unanswered.  The show lied to its viewers, repeatedly.  Remember Juliet saying “it worked” after the atomic bomb went off, followed by the last season’s opening shot of a submerged island in what appeared to be an alternate timeline?  That wasn’t some sort of clever misdirection.  It was an outright lie.  The reason everyone immediately rewinds The Sixth Sense after seeing it for the first time is that it plays fair. It shows the audience certain things, with complete honesty, and the audience misinterprets what it’s seeing.  It’s the difference between pulling a quarter out of someone’s ear with sleight of hand, versus knocking them unconscious and stuffing a coin in their earlobe.  The kind of cheating indulged by the Lostwriters will cost them their feet, if they ever run afoul of the madwoman fromMisery.		>**What happened at the end of Lost is the betrayal of mystery.  Storytelling requires a commitment of trust between author and audience.  Lost squandered six years of that trust.  None of the plot elements from the first two-thirds of the story had anything to do with its resolution.**  The end of the story came from out of left field, as if the Harry Potter series had ended with a cop shooting Voldemort dead.  Sorry about all the fuss and bother, Harry.  Guess that whole “Chosen One” thing was just a dead end.  You were still a great character, though!  Give our best to Ron and Hermione!		>**That final scene in the Church of the Non-Denominational Afterlife was touching, but it was almost a separate story from the ugly mess lurching to a halt between the endless commercial breaks.  Jack’s painful walk to his final resting place gave his character the dignity of a tragic, yet uplifting end.  It matters that the reasons he died, along with everyone from unborn children to Dharma scientists and unlucky French explorers, were pulled from the creative oven half-baked.  Too much of their collective story was left to our imaginations, and we aren’t the ones getting paid millions by ABC Television to write this stuff.**			Lost had so much potential, and its audience gave it so much trust.  The showrunners had so much talent there, so many tremendous actors (Terry O'Quin and Michael Emerson were fantastic, and a large portion of the cast were well past good for most of the show) and set designers, so many tools to do something brilliant.  And all of it was squandered to keep the hype train going, and the money coming in.  Fuck Lost.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"arjuous","name":"t1_cu8h89e","parent_id":"t3_3hkjsz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440034652,"created_utc":1440005852}

Albeit, I guess I would say that it was bad in comparison to its average performance, but I thought it was good as far as series finales go, as well as considering it came out of season 9 which was kinda bogus to begin with.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MrTheoTwombly","name":"t1_cu8ybcc","parent_id":"t3_3hkjsz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440060499,"created_utc":1440031699}

{"body":"Let me just summarize quickly why your argument is invalid:		1. The series is called "How I Met Your Mother", not "How I Met Your Mother But I Ended Up Being With Uncle Robin Instead". Ted leaves in the fucking middle of the goddamn wedding reception because he "has to move". And then he doesn't move at all.	2. The mother dies? After 9 fucking series she's magically killed in like a 15 sec scene?	3. The whole season 9 is based on Robin and Barney wedding - and how the two mature during the seasons, how Ted leaves Robin go (twice - he "blesses" Barney when he proposes and with that episode in which she flies out as a balloon), how they are different with respect to Marshall/Lily but they still work. And again, two scenes later "Oh guys, we divorced. Meh". In the same episode in which their wedding reception is!!!	4. Barney's growth is one of the most beautiful things happened to the series. And of course, let's make him a dad! Without even seeing the "mom". And, let's make him change again because now he's seen her daughter.	5. Lily and Marshall basically disappear. They do.... stuff for the whole episode, but nothing considering a finale.	6. Marshall becomes a judge. Yeah! But, I couldn't care less at this point of the episode.		To summarize, that's what happens in a 40min timespan:	- Ted's goodbye to his friends at the wedding reception	- How Ted Met The Mother	- Robin and Barney divorce	- Lily's new pregnancy	- Barney becoming a father	- The Mother getting pregnant — twice	- Ted's wedding	- The Mother dying	- Ted bailing Robin. Again.		I mean, that's the definition of a fucked up episode that has killed all the characters growth that did span towards 9 seasons.","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"klimtom","name":"t1_cu89fm9","parent_id":"t1_cu87vqf","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440022983,"created_utc":1439994183}

The story was never about their mother.  The whole thing was about Robin.

{"body":"I found this on imdb a few months ago that **perfectly sums up why it was  good ending**. 		-------------------------------------------			Regardless of all the talk about the hate for the finale, it was truly a great and epic finale. Remember this was a 9 year show and a lot has happened...		Here is a counter to most of the criticism I've seen:		The Robin/Barney wedding was important because it's not about the fact that it failed, it was great because of how it happened. And how it subsequently aligned with Ted leaving NYC. And they did move the entire 9th season around how he met the mother. The entire season was each characters run in with the mother somehow before Ted finally met her.		When Ted met the mother, it showed true love. But clearly the difference was that of true love vs. your soul mate. He had his fantastic life with the mother and essentially had his cake and got to eat it too with Robin at the end. Remember, almost 20 years had passed since he met the mother...You have to put it in perspective that they went through over 20 years in 2 episodes and did it pretty flawlessly in my opinion.		At the time he met the mother, he knew his time with Robin was over. He didn't love her and absolutely fell for the mom. For good reason. Their characters were perfect together. They couldn't have cast a better mother. The creators had a vision from start to finish. From season 1 to the end. And they stuck with it. A lot of people are not down with that. I loved it.		Let's look at the final scene: the blue horn. Bringing it back to the very first pilot episode. You don't find many shows that can do that after 9 seasons.		Look, the show was ending. They had to wrap it up. The story WAS about how he met his mother but then his kids told him otherwise. Ted didn't even realize his story was about Robin the whole time. This show as a whole always came down to Robin, every narration talked about Robin or what she was doing. Ted said from the first time he saw her that he was going to be with her and that "it always goes back to Robin." Also Remember, at this time the mother had been dead SIX YEARS. Life moves on.		During Robin's wedding realizing that Ted was the guy she should have been with. From season 1 to stealing the blue horn to the last season tracking down the locket. The scene where Robin says she should have ended up with Ted was a perfect ending to the first episode of the two.		The point was that Ted knew he loved Robin from the second he met her and Robin realized that after marrying Barney that she made the wrong choice.		They also ended the show exactly how the pilot started 9 years ago. Robin wanted to travel the world and be famous and Ted wanted a serious loving relationship with children. Both got what they wanted and then ended up together. They lived their lives for 15 YEARS before getting back together. The fact that they focused on Barney and Robin's wedding the whole season and then got them divorced THREE YEARS later was extremely realistic and not surprising at all since they were always sketchy about going into the marriage in the first place. And no can say that Barney and Robin divorcing was not a realistic outcome. She even knew it was wrong the day of her wedding and that Ted was the right guy.		Also AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, you forget that Ted was the mom's second choice as well because she was engaged to that guy that died on her birthday and the one she broke up with right before the wedding.		At the end of the day, it was a great ending primarily because it was so REALISTIC. His relationship with the mother was absolutely beautiful. You truly felt what they had for each other. In the first season, Robin referenced that Ted would be the one who got away but the timing was wrong because she wanted to be famous. Then when she got that, Ted got his kids, and the timing was right. That fact does not remove one bit of greatness from the relationship he had with his mom and it doesn't take any of the love away from that. She died. It was 6 years later. He loved the mother with all his heart but she died and he needed to move on.		The mom was essentially insignificant to the story but she added the perfect touch. It was always about Robin and throughout the years, people lost sight with all the sub plots, but it was always about Robin. The future Ted narration ALWAYS talked about Robin. These episodes incorporated SO many amazing references from past seasons, especially the first. When you end a show, not everyone will like the ending but they had to keep the vision they had. 9 years was a long time but they stuck to their story which was great! Even using a clip from his children from 9 years ago! Imagine the non-disclosure agreement on that one!		The last 4 seasons didn't have much Ted and Robin but the last season really showed how Ted and Robin were really meant for each other. The fact that Ted did all that stuff with finding the necklace, trying to get over Robin, etc. And then he met the mother. So at the end, it truly showed us through all the bull *beep* they were still meant to be together.		Ted knew that from the beginning and Robin found that out after marrying Barney.		I think the main problem people have is putting the timing of going through decades of life into 40 minutes and not fully accepting that fact. A lot changes in decades. Hands down this is one of the best sitcoms of all time and that ending really made the show even better. My favorite scene was when him and the mother meet under the yellow umbrella and they just go through years of episodes in one little scene. It was truly beautiful. The whole thing was truly beautiful. For the short time they had to fit that all in, they did a phenomenal job! One of the Best Series Finale's EVER. When the dust settles and the fans who hated it will see that it was truly the perfect ending.		The fans had less than 5 min to react to the mother's death, the kids had 6 YEARS. thats huge, so Ted did nothing wrong, grieved the mom and loved her to the fullest and at the right time in their lives when back to Robin, his soul mate.		This story is about love (the mother) vs. soul mate (Robin) and fortunately for Ted he got both. (Ted was 52 when he went back to Robin)!

The last 4 seasons didn't have much Ted and Robin but the last season really showed how Ted and Robin were really meant for each other. The fact that Ted did all that stuff with finding the necklace, trying to get over Robin, etc. And then he met the mother. So at the end, it truly showed us through all the bull *beep* they were still meant to be together.		Ted knew that from the beginning and Robin found that out after marrying Barney.		I think the main problem people have is putting the timing of going through decades of life into 40 minutes and not fully accepting that fact. A lot changes in decades. Hands down this is one of the best sitcoms of all time and that ending really made the show even better. My favorite scene was when him and the mother meet under the yellow umbrella and they just go through years of episodes in one little scene. It was truly beautiful. The whole thing was truly beautiful. For the short time they had to fit that all in, they did a phenomenal job! One of the Best Series Finale's EVER. When the dust settles and the fans who hated it will see that it was truly the perfect ending.		The fans had less than 5 min to react to the mother's death, the kids had 6 YEARS. thats huge, so Ted did nothing wrong, grieved the mom and loved her to the fullest and at the right time in their lives when back to Robin, his soul mate.		This story is about love (the mother) vs. soul mate (Robin) and fortunately for Ted he got both. (Ted was 52 when he went back to Robin)!

{"body":"Honestly, the Series Finale for Dexter was probably one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.  	  	  I loved the symbolism, the torment, and the acceptance that Dexter went through.  How that which he had longed for over the seasons, to truly feel, to be a real human, was granted, but with it came the deep pain and suffering of realizing who he was, and how he had affected those around him throughout his life.  How in the last few moments of the season he is forced, by his new found humanity, to make the decisions which would protect Hannah, and his son.  He knew Harrison would be safe with Hannah, as she only killed to protect herself and those she loved, so he could trust her. The symbolism of the final phone call, how he pretended to be that strong Dexter before tossing it into the sea, completely severing them from his life. The killing and burying of his sister, his final victim at the spot of so many evil men, while dressed in his kill attire, Deb shrouded in white, sinking into the darkness as a sort of purification, an innocent sacrifice, was very emotional, very deep.  Then as he drove into the storm, full throttle, in hopes of ending it all, and as a symbolic gesture of killing the old man that was Dexter, and embracing who he now was.  Then the cutaway, his coworker mourning at the death of Dexter the death of the fake that they all knew and loved and the irony that he was now truly that person. Then the finale scene, that shows him, being more dead now than he had ever been in his entire life, and that only occurring after he had found his true self, his humanity, which forced him to lock himself away from all that he loved.  Being human instead of freeing him to experience the joys of life, now condemns him more than the dark passenger ever had. 	  	  It was one of the best endings to a series I have seen.  It resolved so much, and truly gave closure in the best way possible.  I felt it was much better then him getting away and living a happy life, or him getting caught, or even killed. It was also left open, and if the creators so choose to, they could pick the series back up.  For all we know, Dexter could have amnesia after his suicide attempt and wandered the country, working odd jobs, struggling to remember who he is... Maybe even now, Dexter who once found his true self, is now, once again trapped in a fog of dreams, of memories of who he once was?  	  	  I have seen many shows, and many finales, and Dexter is by far my favorite.  I have watched the final episode over a dozen times, and each time I find myself deeply engrossed, and in awe of the beauty of it. I only wish more people could have seen just how incredible it was, and how it was indeed the perfect ending to the series.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sirdomino","name":"t1_cu88ttg","parent_id":"t3_3hkjsz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440021929,"created_utc":1439993129}

SPOILERS--->			Rather than interpreting the "cut to black" ending as Tony getting killed from behind, which is still a reasonable conclusion, I view it more as the audience finally getting killed off.

Especially since towards the end of the final season, when everybody was getting knocked off, it was only fitting that we as the external viewer had our "lights out" moment and never saw it coming, very much in the way that things ended for several main characters.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"St0rmborn","name":"t1_cu8fbon","parent_id":"t3_3hkjsz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440031970,"created_utc":1440003170}
