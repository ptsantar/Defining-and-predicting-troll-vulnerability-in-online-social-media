{"body":"How replayable it is depends on how much you enjoy reading and trying out different paths in order to discover the events present in the game, as the gameplay itself isn't engrossing. A single circumnavigation will likely take you around 1-1.5h and you'll probably want to do it a few times because there are several regions to visit that are obviously mutually exclusive. You have to manage the finances and health of Phileas Fogg, your master, and plan out the trip certain regions are more easily traversed with specific items, such as winter clothing for Russia, and other items unlock interactions with characters - as these aren't immediately obvious, if you're one to fine comb a game to discover everything there's **plenty** to see here. I played it for 6.5h, according to Steam, and IIRC I went around the globe three times (through Russia, Asia and America/Ottoman Empire, Middle East and America/North Africa, India, Asia, America and Iceland).		&nbsp;		If you think this might be your cup of tea you should also take a look at [Sunless Sea](http://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/), a text-based game with a Lovecraftian theme that focuses on exploring and upgrading your vessel.

As for cars, the speed largely depended on the road, not the engine. A 1915 Model T could do 35 mph over flat ground, and it was considered to be a cheap entry level car in its day. Quite a few of its competitors were capable of maintaining modern highway speeds in the upper 60's to low 70's (though not for long...the engines in those early cars required a lot of maintenance).

Technically what I did was call our routing algorithm from London Heathrow to every known major airport in our database (around 3,500 airports). I can do the same thing with flights disabled quite easily.		Rather than airports however, we could route from London to a set of large cities (either by population or some other metric), which might be more accurate when flights are disabled (as we may get more train/bus/ferry routes). Unfortunately however we don't have ocean liners or cruises in our data at this stage, so cross-continental routes won't appear.

{"body":"Miles here from Rome2rio.		Hi, and great questions!		> Do you have a description of the tools you used to create it?		I actually wrote a custom tool to query our routing engine and generate the durations between London Heathrow and around 3,500 airports around the world. Generally the results will be flights only, but if there is a faster option (say, a train or even a shuttle bus) between two airports, that would have been selected. I can re-run the tool and find out what mode of transport was selected for each airport pair if there is some interest in it.		> I made something similar earlier this year and had some issues with the contours until I started using maptlotlib.		Would love to see it!		> Also, I presume for places that are outside cities you have to assume a certain walking speed?		Sort of. For each airport I've included a 500km (311 mile) radius around it, and assumed an average driving time of 50kph (31mph). In order to cut down the running time of the tool, I disabled driving directions and just assumed a "crow's fly" radius.		In an ideal world, I would have routed London to every pixel location on the map and not disabled walking or driving directions (these use our own custom in-house GraphHopper servers). While this would have produced the most accurate map with our data, it would have taken an obscene amount of time to run. I could probably give it a go if I can find some spare hardware :)		> How do you calculate the travel time to the middle of Siberia?		So using what I mentioned above, we routed London Heathrow to each airport, with a 500km radius at a travel speed of 50kph.

{"body":"Hi Miles,		Thanks for your detailed response! I spent a long time trying to find a free airplane routing API, but never succeeded so I used the [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/) to calculate travel times from all the major cities in Europe to a few thousand different train stations in Europe. I then interpolated those to a grid, and then calculated contours using Matplotlib. The resulting maps are [on my blog here](http://emptypipes.org/2015/05/20/europe-isochrone-map/), if you're interested.		It'd be really cool to do something similar with flight data. I don't suppose you have a public API, do you? It'd be neat to see which areas are furthest away by flight. Then again, London is probably a good proxy for most of Europe :)		If you're ever interested in making an interactive map and need various scripts for gridding and contouring, I'd be happy to document and share [what I wrote](https://github.com/pkerpedjiev/train-travel-times-europe). 		Finally, as somebody else said, what could be both informative and useful, would be a map colored according to price. Although the prices may not be as continuous as the travel times.

In their [Shipping Reports](http://www.tristandc.com/newsshipping2015.php), there are often notes about ships that have arrived but which have to wait to offload the passengers because the seas are too rough. Getting from a ship to the harbour requires a trip in a Zodiac.
