We have succumbed to Reddits rampant viral/guerilla marketing.	In return we deserved respect.					If we would simply not indulge in the use of Reddit for a month (two is better) you would force some changes in attitude. It takes cooperation from a large enough group of people to make this work.					I'm on board with the proposed **Reddit Blackout**: a mass-evacuation of reddit. Complete silence about reddit. No linking, no reading, no commenting, no upvoting - **NO participation**. Don't even look for alternatives like voat because that only draws "what's-up-with-reddit?" attention and makes whoever we flock to a target. When you have the sort of following that reddit has had and lose it, it's hard to get it back.	Reddit is ad-revenue dependent. If we are the product then take the product from them - Take revenue and investor confidence away from them.		**Support the cause -  Repost in relevant topics.**","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CuriousAnomaly","name":"t1_csrefi3","parent_id":"t1_csr0mjs","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435989143,"created_utc":1435960343}

However, when you see weight, what does it mean? Someone who could have a weight that seems high, but they are also tall so thus they just appear fit. Someone could have a weight that seems to be average or even low, but they are very short and thus appear chubby. And that doesn't even take into account muscle mass vs fat. Trying to imagine all this in your head based on raw numbers is not something people are going to do or take a risk on when meeting a stranger when level of attractiveness is a high priority. Thus, it makes more sense to list weights as slim, fit, average, overweight, obese, etc. since these are the end-result descriptions people would be trying to determine anyway.

{"body":"I didn't say it was inaccurate, but rather that it's a measure people don't frequently use nor do they know how to calculate it, thus qualitative descriptions are more familiar to people. People have been tracking their height since childhood, and all it requires is a tape measure. People understand numerical incomes because they know the various lifestyles certain dollars can afford and how it relates to their current lifestyle.		But BMI requires calculation that people are unfamiliar with, and more importantly, many people don't know their own BMI. Dating sites are all about relativity. It's easy to list exact heights because you've known your height your entire life and routinely track it, thus you can instantly know if someone is taller/shorter than you. Listing income is easy too because you are always fully-aware of your own income and instantly know if someone makes more or less than you.		However, when people don't know how calculate BMI and don't know their own BMI, it becomes a useless number. If you don't know BMI ranges, don't know how it compares to yours, and can't imagine a BMI-based body type in your head, it means nothing to you. If someone gives you an exact height of an individual, you can likely imagine how tall that person is because you've been exposed to exact heights your whole life. But if someone gives you the BMI of an individual, you personally may be able to imagine what their body looks like, but many others can't because BMI is a meaningless metric to them.		Again, it's not something that's wrong with BMI itself, but that people are not frequently exposed to it and thus cannot establish relativity or instantly know how it translates to physical appearance, thus qualitative descriptions are better. Even if they are subjective, they narrow down the field, then from there you would simply look at someone's photos to determine if the description is accurate to you.","depth":15,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GoldenChrysus","name":"t1_csr6deb","parent_id":"t1_csr5yk4","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435974053,"created_utc":1435945253}

{"body":"I don't think the long term answer is another reddit clone.  I think the problem with content voting sites is that they are naturally unstable.  Websites like reddit, digg, and slashdot didn't fail because of single events, single events just provided a tipping point that made users realize how displeased they were with the website.  The problem is that the voting-based system of content generation just doesn't work very well at getting new and interesting content to the top.  It tends to encourage groupthink and reposting the same type of shit over and over again.  Also, as the site gets more popular and accepted, the more power users and interest groups become the ones that influence content.  To the point where today, your average user has an almost impossible time getting original content seen by people on large subreddits.  Smaller subreddits provide a temporary reprieve, until they get big enough that the signal to noise ratio drops to the point of it becoming almost a parody of itself.		Moderation seems to help somewhat, but even extremely heavily moderated subreddits like askhistorians have over time been overrun with reposts, poor quality responses, and "rule creep" which has brought it closer to the reddit groupthink meme subreddits that it's desperately tried to avoid.		So I think the solution is that someone's gotta reinvent the "social news website" genre for a larger internet if they want it to be sustainable in the long run.","depth":2,"score":33,"ups":33,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"deadjawa","name":"t1_csr2nrs","parent_id":"t1_csqyzbk","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435966997,"created_utc":1435938197}

{"body":"I think the problem with content voting sites is that there will always be the incentive for people to cheat a bit to get on top. If it's something like a repost--it's no big deal. But now there's business involved, for example, that rumor flying around that reddit was going to try to make money off of AMA's. Comics, things that you can make money off of with merch and stuff...this becomes people's livelihoods, and they have more incentive to try to manipulate the system to their advantage. So problems arise on the user side and the creator side. With so much at stake, someone eventually is going to fuck it up.		The voting system is very addictive, and it's part of how the userbase got so huge. I think it's so much easier to get your content buried in other websites. If it's a regular forum, people know that their comment will get buried if it's not new, so they don't comment. They don't read/participate in threads that aren't very new, not at the level they do at reddit, because they know if they have something to say no one will be around to read it or discuss it.		Others may not agree, but I find the upvoted comments pretty interesting. Not all of them are. I don't think all the interesting/intelligent/deep discussions go buried all that often, although that does happen. I think reddit encourages dissenting opinions. I know of so many things I would have been afraid to say on other websites because I knew they would not be received well. The sites were too small/inactive and much less diverse than reddit. There are thousands of more exclusive forums, where there's no voting, no threads, everyone just quotes each other. I don't think reddit's problem is that it lets too many people in and popular stuff rises to the top. I think that's what makes it a place where you're more likely to find unconventional opinions and original content, tbh.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"memoriesofbutter","name":"t1_csrrycp","parent_id":"t1_csr2nrs","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1436022614,"created_utc":1435993814}

That would let users have a persistant history, I mean people like being anonymous in that their online identity is not tied to their real life one, but they want to have an online identity not just be a nameless voice in the crowd. The only downside is that given an incredibly slight chance that someone accessed the users computer and got access to their private certificate they could tie them to their online user. IMO if someone can get that access you are already compromised.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IrishWilly","name":"t1_csra70i","parent_id":"t1_csr4i9p","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435981041,"created_utc":1435952241}

{"body":"It's not that simple.		I was ~~a~~ *the* volunteer admin at a less-than-100k-posts forum site that passed 200k within the year I did my thing. I was pretty good at tracking down traffic-driven issues and fixing them. I quit being a volunteer admin when the site was sold and run for profit. No hard feelings; I just didn't sign on to make someone else a profit for free.		But as good as I think I could be at managing a high-volume site and keeping it running well, almost nobody gives a flying fuck about me or anything I say, think or do. Not complaining there, either; I'm just like most people whose daily babble and interests just aren't interesting enough to form and build a community.		The point is, a well-working site is not what a community runs on. There has to be a driver of interest. Eventually the community itself becomes a self-sustaining interest driver. (And then somebody tries to make money off of it, the community is offended and feels used...yeah this has happened a few times before.)		But the point is a perfectly-working and scalable and free and intuitive site isn't enough. It's the nerd in the corner that nobody talks to because it's boring as fuck because as well-designed and as well-run as it is, there are very few people who have an interest in just looking at or experiencing such a thing. The driver has to be content which ultimately means an interesting person or a few dozen of them and some moderators to manage the difficult parts of the interaction. The rest of us are just noise in aggregate.		I was going to suggest that if some moderators joined together and moved to another site, that is how reddit would finally crumble, but now I'm thinking that would also depend if the moderators are the ones driving the interesting content.		In any case, no single other site is going to get all the reddit communities or even the majority of them. Subreddits or groups of subreddits would individually have their most influential and interesting members form a caravan to another place to set up shop, and some people would follow them and form a new community.		So to correct you, anyone already good at maintaining and scaling a public social site *and* knows a number of influential content creators and moderators looking for a new home, this is a perfect time to see if they want you to build a site *for them*.

I must admit I do find the $ prefixing everything kinda obnoxious though. 		However nothing gets removed as far as I can tell and it's new so we should really cut it some slack and see how it grows. I'm looking forward to seeing how it expands. 		------		**[Voat](http://voat.co)** - Voat is essentially a Reddit clone - and that's OK. They have a karma system and the community is nice and welcoming and very open to discussion. It's very basic looking and if you're familiar with how Reddit works you'll be familiar with Voat works. 		They get a lot of flak for being down often but it's run by a small but dedicated team who take donations to try and keep the servers up so it's rather admirable that they're doing as well as they are as whenever Reddit messes up people throw it around to immediately jump ship. 		It's fun and fairly light though. 		-----------		**[Snapzu](http://snapzu.com)** - Snapzu is a much more polished looking link aggregator. You can post 'snaps' which are links/content to various channels that they call 'tribes' and it has a wide variety of subjects for you to explore. There's a rep system which accumulates over time with titles for you to get - but it does mean that those who have signed up earlier get more perceived clout than those that are new. At the moment you have to request an invite to join BUT they tend to dish those out quickly enough. 		I have to say though it's not as...strongly opinionated as Reddit which is a good and a bad thing as it lends to very passive and dull comments. 		-------------		[**Campus Society**](http://www.campussociety.com/invitations/1162) - This is purely aimed at university and college students so this won't be of any appeal those who aren't attending. You're grouped into channels where you can instant chat / post content with other students in your classes and university. This went live on Monday so it's very new in beta but there's also groups you can join similar to subreddits where you can chat / post and it's proving popular in London for a way of meeting new people who are at your university but haven't met yet.		It doesn't rely on upvotes / likes to determine user score but a 'GPA' system which goes up if users respond well to you and down if you're inactive over a long period of time or get reported by other users. 		*Full disclosure I'm part of the team here but if you have any questions I'm happy to answer them! (If your university isn't featured let me know and I can check that out)*			--------		**[Wechat](http://www.wechat.com/en/)** - Now most people assume that this app, and sorry it's app based, is primarily just for the Chinese due to it's massive Chinese audience. Which is fair as it used to be Weixin and it did start in China. It does however have a massive, and very engaged, English speaking community and while there's as bit of culture clash it's actually a very interesting community to be a part of. However to find good content you have to find public accounts from people who post that content so you do end up having to put a bit of work in to find content you like.		I really enjoy the personal touch of that because there's a much more personal connection with these people as they tend to respond often, use actual names/faces, and have a real passion for what they're doing but it can be rather intense at times. 		---------		**[Aether](http://getaether.net/)** - Another app based community however it's on the otherside of the coin. While Wechat is a hyperactive platform where you use your real name etc this is much more private scene which uses anonymous posting.		They're not likely to go down anytime soon though because their infrastructure does not rely on a centralised server setup but p2p. Their goal originally was simply to be a purely anonymous reddit so if you're privacy orientated this might be interesting for you but as it's links and not images etc most people might not find it that interesting - especially as it's in dire need of content and as anyone can pretend to be you it's hard to build any sense of community. 		------------		**[Yik Yak](http://www.yikyakapp.com/)** an interesting concept but the execution leaves something to be desired for the most part. Recent changes have improved the flow of conversation though which is good as you can identify who you're responding to and the community has taken steps to help cut down on abuse which was a problem early on. Yaks with -5 are deleted so the community polices itself.		Yaks are text based though and very short form so this might not appeal to everyone but it can be rather lighthearted and interesting for localised content. 		---------		**[The Student Room](http://thestudentroom.co.uk/private.php)** - This is an old school forum really primarily focused on UK students but it's got a wonderfully dedicated moderation team and a strong core community who are extremely helpful. Like most forums it is broken down into a wide variety of subjects/interests and users build rep through going their posts liked etc. 		It's rather solid but it is definitely focused more on the UK student crowd. 		----------		**[Stumble Upon](http://stumbleupon.com)** - This is how I found Reddit originally about 4 years or so ago as Digg was blocked at work. Stumble Upon is rather simple in its approach but it's a great way to view all types of content. Simply signup, select your interests, then click the Stumble Upon button and it'll randomly select you a tagged page/article/video based on what you selected. The community isn't really that big on commenting and what not, per se, but there is certainly something very addictive about clicking that button for new content. 		Honestly I had so much love for this website I fear to go back. 		-----------		**[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)** - This one is more for the tech orientated crowd and despite the overly abused 'hacker' title it's a great site for keeping in the loop with changes in the tech industry and for new and upcoming sites and startups.		After /r/technology took a tumble in quality I ended up just going back to Hacker News for quite awhile to be honest as it's simple, practical, and the community is very informed and helpful. 		-----------		**[Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com)** - This is a dedicated community focused on sharing and talking about the latest websites and startups. It's invite only if you want to discuss but you can vote until PH decide you're worthy of commenting. Some people complain of them being a tad elitist but I've met the team first hand and they're pretty dedicated to focusing purely on making a platform that's about showcasing the latest and greatest. 		Though it does get a bit dull seeing the same people leaving comments and the discussion can be pretty thin. 		----------		**(PART TWO IN  MY REPLY TO THIS COMMENT)**","depth":0,"score":945,"ups":945,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SobeyHarker","name":"t1_csr139r","parent_id":"t3_3bzlup","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435963788,"created_utc":1435934988}

{"body":"**[Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com)** I'm expecting a bit (see lot) of flak for suggesting Tumblr but if you stay away from the echochamber angry ranty people and explore some of the more popular tags you'll find that there's a whole wealth of quality content worth reading. They're more into their TV/Film fandoms and so if you're not able to stomach that kind of thing you might want to pass but for lighthearted content it's not that bad.		Personally it's not to my liking but it's a viable alternative that while hated on will more than likely have something to cater to your taste.		-----------		**[Newsvine](http://www.newsvine.com)** - I really like Newsvine  - it's a small company that focus on linking out news but it's nowhere as extreme as /r/worldnews and the community is rather interested in current events. Discussion is small / limited however so you really have to put some effort in to generate discussion but it can certainly be worth it if quality and not quantity of replies work for you. 		**[Frizbee](https://frizbee.co)** I really dig how Frizbee are with anonymity and their general mission. Their mods are vocal but friendly but best of all their against censorship and really want to see their community grow in line with that. Which pretty much lends well to open discussion. They're in beta and while the site could do with some fine tuning it's a great experience despite the lack of polish.  		-------------		**[Slicer](http://slicer.io/)** This is small and ran by a single person, as far as I'm aware, but I quite like to lurk on it and have a nosey around. Terms of use are pretty standard but I'm looking forward to seeing how this evolves as there's steady traction and I'm not entirely sure if the admin has made a decision on how he wants to grow his site. 		It can be a little messy though as the default page throws everything into "Any" as opposed to a space, which function like subreddits, but I kinda do like that as it reminds me of how /r/all used to be. 		Seriously though props to this guy if it's just the one person as it's really well done. 		-----------	Other sites, but I'm not familiar with them and will update post once I know more: 		**[Linkibl](http://www.linkibl.com/)**		**[Wykop](http://www.wykop.pl/)**		**[Hubski](http://hubski.com/)**		**[UPRISER](http://upriser.com/)**		Anyway I hope this is helpful to you /r/RedditAlternatives and I'd love to hear about any new ones that are coming out or that you love.

I don't must care about the politics of it all, but while once Reddit was a site of very subtle product placement amongst quality content, it has now become a website where the majority of the submissions feel like advertisement, dissenting conversation buried and a glorification of all submissions discussing the decline of the site. 		In short, it has become a site about the site itself, where the few posts that navigate away from that model seem to be advertising. While there may be another explanation for the data, it does suggest to me that other users besides myself have noticed this and are looking for an alternative. 			In the end, the web is in its infancy, and these are the business lessons for the next generation. Advertising revenue only comes when there are users, and must not violate the product.

It's the administrations job to figure out how to keep the servers up, support that community, and pay the people needed for those 2 tasks. 		Maybe in your job flipping burgers or something yelling at the boss will get you fired but as one of the only liasons between the management and the community, management should have done a damn better job in easing the transition if they had to fire her, and she better have embezzled a shit-ton of money or murdered someone in order to be let go so abruptly  		But, she probably stepped on the wrong toes or had a disagreement with management or some other dumb behind the scenes political shit that got her fired and the community being up in arms about it is the correct response. 		This long post makes it seem like I care more than I do. Reddit is a private company and its management's site to do with as they please. God forbid I have to find another website to go to if this place collapses, but I do think management needs to understand that it is the community that makes this place what it is, and alienating the community will destroy this site and any monetization potential they are planning on implementing really damn quick.

{"body":"I think the last guy didn't describe the situation very well though.  Victoria wasn't as important as her position was with the mods of more than one front page subs.   Her position had her interacting with the public and the mods.  The fact that there was never a second person in command or someone people were familiar with while Victoria was still working is a big problem.  Victoria's position was a small bone thrown to the mods of those communities which run this site.  That's right without the subs there would be no reddit, and those people were caught off guard.  That's a pretty big problem.  So this was a catalyst for those mods who see themselves as an important part of this site to be upset.   They feel ignored and abused, their time is taken for granted and their only support was removed without a backup already in place.		Victoria's position at this point in the companies history shouldn't have been just Victoria.  There should have been a clear chain of command who the mods could contact when this happened.  People get fired and Reddit wasn't setup for it.  It was a big misstep on reddits part not to have someone in place.  What if Victoria had quit one day?  Got hit by a bus?  All of those page view generating AMAs go to the wayside while everyone scrambles to sort it out.  This not only hurt the subs but really it could hurt Reddits if by removing the liason would have affected large profile AMA's.		So I state again, it's not that it was short notice, it's not that it was Victoria though that would have angered people, it's that it was done with no clear plan of attack.  No forethought of losing basically a whole department in one person.

No. Because if I had an issue with it, I'd never have come to reddit in the first place. THIS IS NOT NEW.	 I don't use the sub and I have no use for it. It's like getting upset that Fox News exists.
