{"body":"Two things.		The Iowa primary is significant not because Iowa is a swing state (it is), but because it's first.  Until that point, all we have is polling.  The significance is primarily in how it shapes the campaign narrative.  If Bernie Sanders is polling at 20% nationally and he gets 35% in Iowa, the narrative becomes: "Sanders is now running neck and neck with Hillary for the nomination".  If he gets 15%, it's: "How long can Sanders stay in the race?".  It's basically about the perception going in and whether the candidate exceeds, meets, or falls below expectations.  If you exceed them, you get a boost and can potentially build on that in the next few primaries.  If you fall below them, particularly if you aren't the favorite, you really have to get better results in the next few or your campaign is on life support.		The swing state thing is more significant in the general election (Republican vs. Democrat).  That's based on the fact that the election is almost entirely winner take all for each state and occurs all at once rather than spread out over time.  You get the same number of electoral college votes whether you eke out a win in Virginia or win Virginia in a landslide.  On that basis, a few states ("swing states") are crucial because they're close to a 50-50 split.  And since they all occur at once, the "media narrative" thing doesn't occur.  A candidate doing well in Iowa doesn't impact Virginia since everyone's voting at the same time.		The degree to which a campaign focuses on Iowa or one of the early primary states is basically a function of how well they feel they're doing.  If you're a long-shot candidate, you're more likely to really push your chips in on the early primary states so that you can do well there and turn your long shot run into headlines about how now you're a legitimate candidate.  If you're a favorite, you might not be so focused on the early primary states.  Example: if you're Hillary Clinton, there's no way you're dropping out of the race based on the early primary results, so you might prefer to focus on other states, reasoning that the bigger states are more important because they count more in the overall numbers.  		Sanders appears to be focusing on the early primary states, which you'd expect.  He has to do well in them, otherwise folks start to question whether he's a legitimate candidate and ask when he's going to throw in the towel.","depth":4,"score":314,"ups":314,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"saltydog75","name":"t1_cugs9e9","parent_id":"t1_cugqlb1","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440655695,"created_utc":1440626895}

{"body":"> so sanders voters will be encouraged to vote in the primaries to help his campaign		Yes, I imagine so. This will be my first primary, as its it's the first time I've been happy with a potential nominee. The effect probably won't be *too* great though. Most people, no matter what, won't give enough of a shit to vote in a primary unless they've been doing it for years. Bernie will motivate some previous non-primary-voters to go vote, by virtue of his policies. Hillary will probably motivate some (though I'd speculate less) by nature of being the first potential female president. Overall though the most important vote are the long-faithful, older democrats who consistently vote in primaries. Hillary has more of this institutional vote, which is more concerned with the success of the democratic party then the  integrity of the candidate's policy/record.		Excited young first time voters aren't gonna elect Bernie in a landslide. But there are decent odds, I think, that if Bernie can make a strong initial push (which it seems he can) he will attract the attention of Hillary's core who see her as the only safe or desirable option, and worry that any other options just create cracks in the foundation.		This is all just my observation and speculation of course. And I admittedly have a bias.		Edit: To clarify, Hillary has a stronger institutional presence than Bernie. She has leverage on her fellow democrats, and has spent years trading political capital back and forth. Bernie has been less willing to play ball, and probably doesn't have much dirt on his colleagues. This makes Bernie more appealing to grass roots movements but less so towards many that set the party narrative. To what extent each potential candidate dominates each group remains to be seen, and has potential to swing as the race goes on.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mihinomenest","name":"t1_cuh4vug","parent_id":"t1_cuh25ec","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440678620,"created_utc":1440649820}

{"body":"SaltyDog's explanation is right, but incomplete.		The reason Iowa has as much weight as it does, beyond being the first state, is because its population is considered to be somewhat representative of America's rural, agricultural population. If any candidate can win Iowa it means he can potentially play well among rural, somewhat conservative voters. Each of the early primary states were selected to provide some approximation of key voting groups in the US. Iowa's the farmers, New Hampshire is standing in for the WASPy New Englanders, South Carolina (for Democrats) is basically standing in for the Black vote, Ohio stands in for the industrial rust belt, etc.		Obama's win in Iowa was huge for two reasons. Not only did he prove that Hillary wasn't inevitable and instill confidence among Democratic voters in a not-Hillary option, but this was a Black guy from a major city who presents himself as an eggheaded technocrat rather than a populist who won a rural, center-right voting group. Up until then everyone was saying "Sure he plays well with big city elites, but he just won't get traction in the middle of the country."

And, to be fair, it should be.  Hillary has a vaguely Nixon-esque bunker mentality that pervades her activities.  She is so over-produced and over-calculated that it's creepy.  Maintaining a private server, beyond the notional bounds of open-records requirements, was clearly not done to further the interests of the State dept. or the American people.  It was done to give tight control to Hillary.			And, I'm a lifelong Dem saying this.  There is such a hunger among the people for authenticity, and the email thing is a perfect black box that reeks of inauthenticity.  The very fact that Hillary's team can't come up with tight messaging on why it's a non-issue is the reason why it's going to fester in the public consciousness and serve to further irritate both the base and independents.

{"body":"While true, I doubt it's particularly meaningful.  She was so much the presumptive nominee that her early number was overwhelming because both moderates and progressives supported her.  As Sanders has emerged, the progressive wing has moved from Hillary to Sanders.  Not surprising.  There's a chunk of the democratic party that finds Hillary too moderate and prefers a candidate farther to the left.  They were with Hillary early on and flipped to Bernie as he's become better known.  There's only so far that can go.  Once he gets the progressives (which alone won't put him over Clinton), his only way to keep increasing is to either win over those not for Clinton/Sanders or flip moderates away from Hillary, which is problematic.  There aren't many undecideds, and of those voting for another candidate, most are for Biden, which means they'll mostly go to Hillary since Biden is another moderate.  And moderates are tough to flip because Bernie isn't moderate.		Sanders just doesn't have the turbo boost Obama had in 2008.  They both followed an early trajectory of winning over the more progressive faction of the party, which is why their numbers right now are similar, but Obama's turbo boost was his incredible numbers with non-white voters along with running neck and neck with Hillary in money raised and endorsements.  Sanders just doesn't have anything like that to get him from the 20% range to 50%.  He's always going to trail in money because getting money out of politics is a big part of his platform.  He's never going to approach Obama's end numbers amongst non-white voters.		That's why Sanders will stick with Obama 2008 until early 2016, at which point Sanders will stay flat where Obama was skyrocketing from 20% to 50%.  He just doesn't have anything beyond being left of Hillary to draw on.  That's what folks who want to see the trend as an equivalency to Obama 2008 are missing.  It wasn't because he was progressive.  That's what started him on his run.  What put him over the top was primarily his appeal to non-white voters.  Look at how overwhelming his numbers were.  He was +40% to +90% over Hillary amongst black voters.

In the primary, yes she leads, but leads in demographics that are quickly caving to Sanders- particularly the elderly and black voters. Look at the trend.

Sanders does both, and his frequent powerful "headshot" line endings, particularly after practicing what lands in his extensive touring, will clean up. More importantly though, a focus on poll leads ignores primary strategy entirely. The ability of early primaries in rapidly altering voter preference is extremely clear and statistically robust - in these states Sanders is killing. This is not to say they are ultimately predictive, but even late poll deficits can be offset by early primary momentum. If you are suggesting that he will be unable to rally the centrist blocs that favor Hillary, though it is true she sits in the center of the polled ideological preferences of the party, centrists are most frequently willing to vote outside their preferences on policy focused campaigns. 		Nationally it wouldn't even be close. The dems as a whole would have to live sacrifice a newborn to lose the college. Of leaning and tossup states Democrats have much more room to play, while Republicans would have to hold all theirs and make substantial gains into states that lean dem.

At what stage are you talking about sanders being booted by middle America? Is it in the primaries?

If the "blue wall" holds (discussed here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/07/the-electoral-college-challenge-facing-the-republicans-in-2016/ though fivethirtyeight also had an excellent piece about why one might be dubious about this) all sanders has to do is maintain a positive favor ability and the democrats fall in line.

{"body":"Gonna hijack this comment to point out a crucial difference between 2007 and 2015: 2015 is essentially a two-candidate race, while 2007 was essentially a three-candidate race.		At this point in 2007, there were 7 declared candidates, and all of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards were polling in double digits. Roughly 10% of the vote was split between the other 4 candidates.		Today, there are 5 declared candidates, and barring an entry by Joe Biden (who is polling in double digits in polls where he's included as a hypothetical candidate), the race is pretty much just Clinton and Sanders. O'Malley, Webb and Chafee combine for only 3% of the vote.		In polls which include Joe Biden, Clinton's poll numbers take a bigger hit than Sanders, which indicates that Biden would primarily be pulling votes from the Clinton camp. That would also indicate that, were Biden to decide not to enter the race, or were he decide to enter and drop out, most of his supporters would migrate to the Clinton camp over the Sanders one.		This is the opposite of the effect John Edwards had on the Obama campaign. After Edwards dropped out in 2008, most of his voters moved to the Obama camp. That went a long way toward giving Obama the boost he needed to remain competitive in what became a two-person race.		This is all a long way of saying that, while Sanders has caught up with Obama 07 data, he's doing it amidst a smaller pool of potential candidates, he is unlikely to enjoy the boost that Obama did when the "third candidate" exits the race (or simply doesn't enter), and Clinton holds a larger margin over Sanders than she did over Obama at this same point.		I'm not saying that Sanders stands no chance at winning the nomination - indeed, he does keep climbing upward in the polls - I'm just saying that I find the repeated comparisons to the Obama 08 campaign to be a little disingenuous, both because they ignore the John Edwards factor, and because they ignore historical context. Obama himself was an "upstart campaign" exception to a larger rule - the DNC always has these upstart candidates running to the left of the mainstream candidate, and Obama is pretty much the only one to ever actually secure the nomination. The much longer list of candidates who were polling similarly to Sanders and did not secure the nomination include Howard Dean, Ted Kennedy (who even enjoyed some establishment support over the incumbent Jimmy Carter), Jerry Brown (twice), Bill Bradley and Gary Hart. I'm of the opinion that Obama will remain the exception, and that it's largely due to two factors - one, his outstanding charisma, which Sanders doesn't possess a teaspoon of, and two, the fact that Obama already had the support of a significant portion of establishment Democrats, which is something else Sanders lacks.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TitoTheMidget","name":"t1_cuhe6vf","parent_id":"t1_cug9e8v","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440709355,"created_utc":1440680555}

Second, the presentation:		It's very hard to distinguish between the two solid traces, because there is literally no indicator to differentiate them.  I initially was trying to figure out why the lower trace seemed to double back on itself.		The text labels on the traces are unnecessarily small, making them hard to read.		The X label is apparently every 15 days, which is strange and makes it difficult to quickly interpret.  There are also no tick marks, so it's a guessing game of how events actually line up in time.

Actually red has been associated with left-wing politics since the French Revolution, it is the color socialist parties use in the overwhelmingly majority of the world. 		Wikipedia: 	> **In politics, a red flag is a symbol of Socialism, Communism, and left-wing politics**; it has been **associated with left-wing politics since the French Revolution (1789–99)**. Socialists adopted the symbol during the Revolutions of 1848 and it became a symbol of communism as a result of its use by the Paris Commune of 1871. The flags of several communist states, including China, Vietnam and the Soviet Union, are explicitly based on the original red flag. The red flag is also used as a symbol by some democratic socialists and social democrats, for example the Avami National Party of Pakistan, French Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The Labour Party in Britain used it until the late 1980s.

Unbridled baron lords were treating workers like coal for the fire, and industry was uprooting traditional ways of life in devastating ways. Then we saw the very worst of socialism, totalitarian governments ruthlessly pushing a degree of collectivism completely at odds with basic human nature. Nowadays I think most socialists (especially democratic socialists) and most capitalists/libertarians agree that certain things work better under collective control (police, fire, roads for instance) while certain things work better under private control (entertainment, farming, most manufacturing and retailing). Socialist just seems to mean you think the scale is currently tipped too far towards private control, while capitalist/libertarian just means you think it's tipped too far towards public control.

{"body":"538 breaks down the significant differences very well.  Yes, Sanders' numbers are similar to those of Obama's in 2008, but Obama was running neck and neck with Hillary in money raised and endorsements.  He also had a huge resource to tap - huge popularity amongst non-white voters.  Sanders is trailing Hillary badly in money raised and has almost no endorsements.  He doesn't have an identifiable sect of voters to tap into other than progressives - certainly nothing like Obama had amongst black voters.  And Hillary's numbers are higher this year than they were in 2008.		Put it this way: looking at non-black voters, Hillary was ahead of Obama 57% to 43% in 2008.  Because black voters were so one-sided to Obama (85%) and represent a disproportionate part of the Democratic electorate as compared with the country overall, the end result was 53% Obama, 46% Clinton.  If you assume non-black voters stay the same and black voters shift to 50-50 between Clinton and Sanders rather than 85-15 to Obama, Hillary wins easily this year.  I can't find any reason to think she'll do worse amongst non-black voters this year as compared with 2008, and every reason to think Sanders won't come close to Obama's numbers amongst black voters.		And he's raised far less money.  And he's got almost no endorsements.  		That's why 2016 isn't 2008.  We know Sanders won't get close to 85% of the black vote, so he's got to be substantially more popular amongst non-black voters than Obama was in 2008 to counter that loss, and do it with a substantial disadvantage in money and basically no one from the party backing him.

Nobody was talking about the former, and the latter means nothing unless you specify.		> That last answer in the poll makes it seem like the US is incapable of competing in any manufacturing industry.		It is difficult when trading with countries that manipulate their currency, subsidize their export industries, and throw environmental and labor protections out the window.		It also doesn't help when "American" companies enter into joint ventures that unabashedly give away decades worth of development and know-how. Right now the only companies that make decent large jet engines are GE, Pratt-Whitney and Rolls Royce. All three are in their current position because they've been developing their technology since the end of WWII. Yet GE is happily giving that away to China. The CEO will cash in his chips before Chinese engines become a serious competitor. They also have great military value. The area of military aircraft where China is seriously far behind is jet engines. The Russians will sell them engines but they're not dumb enough to give away the know-how. 		> Flip this poll around and ask if they would be willing to pay 10-20% more on products so that manufacturing jobs get a 5% raise and you'll have a vastly different change of opinion.

Ricardo also postulated the "Iron Law of Wages", which said that wages would always fall towards the bare minimum necessary for sustenance.

You can achieve better if you're willing to build your resume. I am nothing special and I did it. A lot of years of sacrifice, but I did it, without any student loan debt either.		You are correct in the rate of minimum wage and it's adjustment for inflation, although, it's arguable to exactly how much you need, that is, there are many states in the union that have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum, with Washington state being nearly $9.50 an hour. 		Also, a cost of living standard must be taken into account as it can vary wildly depending on where you decide to live.		When I was much younger I moved 700 miles from my home city to lower cost of living, this was a choice I made, a sacrifice I chose to provide a better quality of life. It paid off as I now own a new 2000 sq ft home that if I had stayed where I was would have cost me nearly three times what I paid.		The "millenials" do not have it so much more difficult than the previous generations, they just face different challenges, every generation faces their own unique set of challenges. 		Look, you can argue all day that it's somehow impossible to get a decent job in todays world without an expensive education that costs too much to begin with.

{"body":"Sure		He keeps going around repeating the line "The U.S. has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth, and that has got to change!" RAH RAH. It's not true, when it was (almost) technically true it still wasn't true because the reports he's talking about used relative measures of income i.e. the children of other countries weren't in poverty because everyone in those countries is in poverty.		He's all about being the champion of the '99%' and rails against corporate greed RAH RAH, well and good but his solution is to raise taxes and implement a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour!? Has he ever heard of the global economy? Not to mention the massive burgeoning consumer market in China and India? You can't pull off a price fix when the competition is already under-cutting you, that's asinine, that's what our problem is in the first place, our cost of doing business, regulatory and otherwise is way too high.		He thinks technological progress means people should have to work less, which has never been true, and on top of that he thinks that the fact that we aren't working less is proof that we're being robbed by the upper class. That represents a deep misunderstanding of economics. In general technology extends what is possible and what is possible extends our requirements. Modern building codes, mechanized transport, electricity, modern medicine, and lately internet connectivity are all essential to our way of life now because of the infrastructure we've built around them, whereas before they were not.		He wants everyone to live on rainbows covered in puppies that shit gold. He does an incredible amount of telling people that he's going to do everything that is popular, but makes no realistic concessions. Higher minimum wage, better healthcare, less poverty, better education, more jobs, duh, I mean, of course why did no one else think of that?! The main crux of the issue is that 'jobs' are not a commodity, its the fruits of labor that bolster an economy not the mere existence of jobs, and any govt that thinks it can hand out busy work like prizes soon goes bankrupt when there are no more taxes to collect. 		He thinks wealth is a zero sum game, you can hear it in everything he says. Like a typical socialist he thinks great wealth represents a great hoarding of all the things that people without wealth need. As if wealthy people were merely stockpiling meals that could be given to starving children. In most cases great wealth represents the creation of great value to society, an addition to the economy not a subtraction from it, and the buying power such wealth represents is only as good as the economy it exists within. But Mr. Sanders doesn't understand any of that, or at least he isn't going to let it get in the way of a good campaign. So he's all about more regulation, but giving govt the power to _continually_ regulate business is what gives business the incentive to buy govt, which is how we end up with increasingly shitty patent laws and other wacky laws that suppress competition. 		He says he wants 'prizes' instead of patents. But a patent is just a prize that consumers vote for with money. That's taking away what are essentially crowd-sourced rewards for innovation and allowing govt to arbitrarily decide how useful they are.		I could go on all day, and most of Bernie Sanders' views which I referenced are represented pretty well in the Portland Rally, as well as a lot of other idiocy.","depth":2,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hOprah_Winfree-carr","name":"t1_cuh8cza","parent_id":"t1_cuh6dv0","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440688815,"created_utc":1440660015}
{"body":"Thank you for the lengthy reply, this is exactly what I was looking for.  First, regarding the increased minimum wage and raising taxes, It's my understanding that anti globalization laws would be implemented at the same time to negate that issue.  Secondly, technological progress will mean one of two things in the next 20-30 years.  1. People as a whole work less.  2. Mass Unemployment.  I say this as someone that automates skilled upper class jobs that pay $60k-$100k. Third, no politician will get elected by telling people that if you elect them they won't really accomplish much due to road blocks, bureaucracy, and making concessions. It may be the reality of things but no one is going to run a campaign on it.		For your next point, I have no issue with wealth, I do have an issue with people that play with other peoples money and then demand to not be regulated or taxed.  I also have an issue with people that think wealth should be passed from family member to family member without being taxed, despite the fact that inherited wealth tends to be gone by the third generation.  Regarding buying government, thats going to happen no matter what, whether it's to enact regulation in favor of your corporation or to remove regulations harming it. 		Having said all this, it will very difficult to institute all of his policies and remain budget neutral but that's pretty insignificant considering how long it's been since we've had an actual budget passed.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cui4dhk","parent_id":"t1_cuh8cza","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440751418,"created_utc":1440722618}
{"body":"`anti globalization laws` That's even stupider. Globalization isn't something to be prevented, it's simply the new reality. Building a bridge between countries then implementing tariffs to offset cheap imports negates the usefulness of the bridge, and worse, because of the cost of the 'bridge'. Cheap imports, and labor exports are an asset, not a problem, and ant-globalization activists want to burn those assets so that they can sell their own inferior ones, they are Bastiat's candlestick makers, and globalization is the sunlight.		`1. People as a whole work less. 2. Mass Unemployment` Well, I agree, but disagree. It all depends on hair-splitting definitions. If you conceive of work as something done for other people, and specialization is required, then yes, I agree. On the other hand, If you conceive of work from a solipsist point of view, in that while you may be doing work for other people, you do so only to do for yourself, and it's only an aberration of specialized environments where doing for yourself most effectively means doing for others, then I disagree.		`no politician will get elected by telling people that if you elect them they won't really accomplish much due to road blocks` It's not road blocks I was referring to, just the simple reality of not being able to have your cake and eat it too. And if it's impossible to get elected by telling the truth, then I think that's a pretty major problem. If it's not addressable then there's no hope for us.		`For your next point, I have no issue with wealth` I'm confused, I thought we were discussing Bernie Sanders' views. You're not Bernie Sanders are you? But who are you referring to here, the central bank, or wall street? The central bank plays with people's money, even the underlying value of the money people save, without their permission or even their knowledge, though their money may be locked in a vault.  Wall street 'plays' with people's money at the behest of said people, as this is nothing more than performing a service, they should be subject to the same anti-fraud and consumer protection laws as other financial service providers, which I'm fairly sure they already are.		And why should money not be inherited without taxation? What is the burden that dead rich people saddle their govt with after a long life of supplying the lion's share of tax revenue?

{"body":"Here's the thing about taxes.  We have a progressive tax system.  No candidate is going to raise the existing rates of taxation for people in the lowest two or three brackets.  That means 10% up to 9,225, 15% from 9,226 to 37,450, and 25% from 37,451 to 90,750.  So even if they raise the tax rates on people in the highest bracket (39.6% for those making more than 413,201) it only affects them for the money earned beyond that.  This leaves out deductions and incentives.  I think you'll find that the effective tax rate that most companies and individuals pay is a lot less than you think.
