{"body":"nah dude, a good third of them won't see their pension whenever they *do* retire. I mean it's their fault for virtually giving it away to whatever rich lobbyist convinces them that it's the American thing to do, but a lot of them are straight-up fucked.		It's so easy to squeeze future money out of people, especially boomers, because the future apparently doesn't exist: if you'll notice most of the issues they've made for us, the younger generation, are because of this lack of foresight. Since they were all spoonfed that by their retirement they'd all be rich and satisfied, not destitute and fucked-over, they had no problem "investing" by voting for people who took their money or allowed lobbyists to make it easy to take their money. They'll be sure to see their money one day!		Only "one day" came and went and these people are still working. Tons of boomers are staving off retirement because the second they retire, they're as good as unemployed and all the debt they've accrued and all the money they did away with won't be there to set them up on a time share in Cancun. They won't retire, and now *we* are unable to advance in our jobs above every level because they've gummed up the fucking pipes by never retiring and letting us take their places in the workforce. We have no good jobs, no high paying jobs, just shitty jobs with shitty money and shitty benefits and shitty lives because of it.		But they'll stay in their jobs until they die, because retiring with no money means no benefits that they require, no fake nonexistent pension to help them live after retirement, "retirement" doesn't exist for them. They can't quit and leave the world to us because then they're done for. 		allow me to present an allegory: they're like trees. In a forest, plants grow, they make seeds which scatter, then they die and become fertilizer for the new plants. They have to die, first, though, or they'll just block the light for every other little plant which will then be stunted, and soon you wind up with two parts to the forest: huge old trees which pose a fire hazard, and tiny stunted little saplings that can't go anywhere and compete amongst themselves for light. Ususally, a massive forest fire will "retire" the old trees and the new trees will grow happily upward and achieve their full potential, but right now, there has been no forest fire to help us out, so we're gonna sit here stunted until they *all die at once* over a span of 10-15 years, the economy fucking collapses, and all because they couldn't just step down when they should've. 		Japan is suffering this, right now. All their population is fucking old. Once they start to die/retire, Japan is in huge trouble: There are so few little sapling trees, and nobody is willing to plant "immigrants from other countries" to supplement their economy/forest, so once they're gone? Japan is fuuuuuuucked. And you think that's bad? 30-50 years from now, or sooner, China will experience the same, and so will India. 		Nerds always go "we need a new plague!" nah, we just need to wait until all the old growth is trimmed away. Sort of a morbid allegory, but you get me, right?","depth":4,"score":1457,"ups":1457,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"dripdroponmytiptop","name":"t1_ctu7is6","parent_id":"t1_ctu6atu","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438933255,"created_utc":1438904455}

{"body":"This is really fascinating and I'm glad you shared it. I'm not saying it's wrong, but it definitely seems exaggerated or maybe a bit sensationalized. It's undeniable that automation will cause a lot of job loss, but his tone of eminent doom is misplaced. He says that it's time to start thinking of ways to combat this phenomenon, but we have been for years. In economic terms, it's pretty much just figuring out the best way to reduce the supply of labor to match the decrease in labor demand. Universal Basic Income is an example of a proposed method to assist in lowering the supply of work.		Also, the horse comparison seems a bit far-fetched. The horses were phased out **by humans**, they didn't have a choice. They had no say in what was happening and didn't even know what was happening, which isn't the case for humans. Horses all of a sudden weren't needed, and they had no idea why. Humans can anticipate these periods of monumental change and prepare for them, as long as people are aware of the serious risks that this video did a good job of addressing.		And this may or may not be personal opinion, but in regards to the whole creativity part, I think that for a very very long time human creativity will be held to a much higher regard than automated creativity. Very very often these creative projects are a reflection of the creators life and what they've been through, and you just can't have that with automated creators. That's more of "what is going to sound like good music" compared to actual songwriters who use their music to express themselves. Maybe it will be different in the future, but human creativity obviously seems a lot more authentic than automated, and in my opinion "creativity" is something that should be authentic, unlike the other things these bots are getting better than humans at.","depth":10,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OnceAteABurgerAMA","name":"t1_ctuv9cm","parent_id":"t1_ctupz7b","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438990205,"created_utc":1438961405}
{"body":"Well, problem I have with a universal basic income is just that, it will be a basic income. Someone skilled working a good job makes much more than anything that can be called 'basic income'. So by transitioning from our current level of automation to this hypothetical "replace 90% of today's jobs" automation, those owning the means of automation will become ten times as rich, while 90% of us will be forced to live on what is deemed a basic income.		And this isn't farfetched at all, because economic inequality has been on a rapid rise ever since the 80s. I remember seeing a graph that I regret not having saved or bookmarked, that showed the productivity (GDP per capita) and the average income in the United States for the 20th century. Until the 80s both were rising proportionally, meaning the average man in the United States was benefiting from rising productivity, in large part due to automation. From that point onwards the average income plateaus, although productivity continues rising.

But they also spent it on obscure and seemingly pointless projects to a layman like you and me (perhaps justifiably so). This was Al Gore's point when he said he wanted to create a "lockbox" to protect these funds from the hands of government officials.		This would all be okay since the Social Security fund is invested in US bonds. We should be concerned, however, that the issuing entity (in this case the US government) can pay on the interest and principal payments when they come due. If the federal debt were lower, we could rest pretty easy; but in fact, the government has been dipping into these bonds for decades. If the federal debt gets too big, then we need to worry that Millenial taxpayers can make good on the bonds in the SS trust fund.

{"body":"You're right about all this, but I just wanna add a small clarification. The SS fund didn't get "spent". This is actually legally impossible. It's a purpose-built, ear-marked fund. It can't be "spent" on anything but SS.		You pointed out that the SS fund is invested in US bonds. This is a particular loophole the government came up with that essentially amounts to the federal government "borrowing against" the SS fund. The underlying principle kind of resembles how people can borrow against their 401k retirement funds. SS balances its bottom line right now by assuming that the federal government is going to make good on the bonds when SS needs to cash them in. In other words, the legal safeguards against the government plundering this fund has been thoroughly circumvented.		I'm a liberal as well, and *usually* I'm not worried a whole lot about the sovereign-denominated debt of any government that controls its own currency. Especially in the case of the US, with the US dollar's special position as the global reserve currency. There are a lot of monetary levers here that can actually pay off the debts with minimal adverse impacts.		The sheer *magnitude* of the debt to the SS fund is kind of staggering though, and that's a concern. Of course SS won't come knocking for it all at once. But the impending wave of Baby Boomer retirements are hanging over the fund like a dark, menacing cloud. SS might not cash the bonds in all at once, but it will at some point need to cash a LOT of them regardless. I think that the money they need is going to be *eventually* produced and we're not going to find ourselves in a ridiculous catastrophic situation.

That debt stored in “IOU’s” for the pension funds is already counted in the total debt owed by the federal government, it just so happens to owe some of that debt *to itself* rather than too somebody else.		Imagine you have the same person as your analogy, and they are in total debt of about 100% of their annual salary (most households have way more debt than this, you can easily pay that off over multiple years). Now, looking at that debt, they are actually *better off* if they owe 20% of that debt to *their own retirement fund* rather than to external sources. Since in this situation, there are no tax benefits to retirement accounts that the government can rely on (like the guy in your example), imagine that the guy has $40,000 in a bank account, but puts the Buick on credit since he thinks it makes his financial situation look better by have $40,000 in the bank but $40,000 more in debt (with interest) at the same time. Is that the smarter financial decision!? You can go ahead and argue that it would have been better not to buy the Buick, but there is no question that if it is being purchased, it shouldn’t be done on credit while you have the cash on hand, and so where the money comes from isn’t the issue *at all*.		This is the situation the US government is in - they owe money to themselves as part of the standard debt figure, but the money owed to themselves *is a better thing* (in aggregate) than the alternative of owing that same amount of money to others. People who claim that money was “stolen” or even misappropriated simply don’t understand economics or opportunity costs. It would have been *downright negligent* to keep that money in cash or some type of untouchable account while still borrowing the same amount of money from other sources and paying interest to someone else at the same time.

{"body":"I pretty much agree with everything you said. One thing to keep in mind for the US is that our overspending isn’t actually a problem of political willpower, but structural cost growth. Some of that comes from the aging population, but much more comes from outsized cost growth in the cost of healthcare. Our healthcare system/spending as a whole has been growing at an unsustainable pace and that drives [almost all of the projected growth in costs](http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Whats-causing-rising-spending-on-Medicare-Medicade-and-Social-Security.png) that makes those entitlements unaffordable.		On the other hand, [non-entitlement spending](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/images/pubs-images/44xxx/44958-land-Discretionary.png) (the stuff we actually argue about and “put on a diet”) has been shrinking consistently. Realistically, fixing the problematic incentives and structures within our healthcare system is infinitely more important than even raising taxes or cutting spending could ever be. No amount of taxes or reduced discretionary spending will support entitlement (mostly medicare by that point) spending of 30% of GDP 50 years from now, so that is the pink elephant in the room for us at the moment.		Also, while it is important that SS money get an adequate return, it is also really really important that it is in very conservative investments that don’t lose principle because US seniors don’t have much or any backup safety net beyond SS payments. It wouldn’t do at all if payments were invested in something with “comparable returns”, but suddenly lost 60% of their value in 2008 for example (like both stocks and many AAA rated bond funds). US bonds are probably the best place for those since they don’t have any currency risk, and maybe high end cooperate bonds could contribute a portion if there were enough of them, but with only 3-4 US companies rated AAA, those instruments probably don’t have enough available to move the needle on SS returns without dipping into riskier assets.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"compounding","name":"t1_ctwnbt8","parent_id":"t1_ctvq4u0","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439128935,"created_utc":1439100135}
{"body":"take a lesson from Canada's health care. Or Britain's.  First, universal health care is ESSENTIAL to Canadians. No party dares monkey with it. To keep costs down, the governments do several things: (UHC is run by the provinces, but the feds provide a good part of the money) 		- Doctors are either in or out. Since it's "Universal", nobody has private health care. A doctor not in the plan has to find patients who can pay cash. A doctor is forbidden to "extra bill". The fee schedule is what they get.  They are also "time limited" so they can't pump through 30 "full check-ups" in one hour to jack up revenue.		-along with that - the provinces set fee schedules and negotiates with big pharma since they are the major buyer. Doctors get paid well, but nowhere near USA levels. (My step-brother in Florida signed on as a neurosurgeon at an institute and my nephew claimed the signing bonus was half a million... not the thing that happens here)		-The health authorities pay quite well - a CEO of a health authority for a city of 1 million people would make $500,000 or so. Contrast that with where the CEO of a hospital in NYC makes $10,000,000. And that's an executive, not someone actually treating patients and bringing in revenue.   		- Hospitals are run by the government health authorities, so good luck finding a hospital not in the plan - only for the super-rich. Plus - I find US advertising for health establishments incredibly weird. Think how much money that is flushing down the toilet.		-the government lists what's covered and how much. So no plethora of forms, no finding a doctor in your plan, no arguing with the insurer whether it's covered or not.  Only one insurer, no question what's covered.   The health insurance is a civil service agency - you're not buying a CEO a Ferrari with the health care premiums; in fact, most provinces don't have specific premiums - just use taxes. 		Yet, supposedly USA per-capita spending on Medicare is higher than Canadian spending, but does not cover close to the 100% of citizens that Canadian coverage does.  You guys are paying more to get less because lobbyists have convinced congress-critters that guaranteeing health coverage is un-American. 		(Is there a downside? Of course. Some less urgent procedures could put you on a waiting list for ages; You don't need that gall baldder surgery right away unless you have pancreatitis - it can wait. Your hip or knee is painful, but you can still walk - so it won't be replaced for months. (Yet, if, like my wife's grandfather, you fall and shatter your hip, it is replaced that night - the most expensive part was us paying for parking to visit him).  It is hard to find doctors who have time, walk-in clinics are few so Emergency rooms are overloaded with walk-ins after hours.  Still, I wouldn't trade it for what you guys have.

{"body":"I'm glad you're bring this into this perspective. It's a concern that is entirely one of macroeconomics not of politics or of whether the basic system of SS works (it does).		Basically, you're presenting the idea of unsustainable debt, which is something that can look quite worrisome to the average person. This is what I meant by how the article was misleading in how macroeconomic national accounting works.		National debt is absolutely nothing like household or private debt; governments do not die or retire like people do, our government (like most governments in the world except for places like Greece and some African countries) has monetary policy independence and can change the macroeconomic conditions such as money supply inflation and interest rates, government debt is constantly serviced simultaneously as it is being taken up at the very same time (this is huge, it's not as though China will come knocking to ever collect debts, but that the government owes money to millions of people and funds and groups for which it has all individually made separate promises to service the loans, and it does, if you buy a TB with a 10 year or a 1 year maturity, you will get served precisely when it was contractually agreed upon), fiscal policy in an ideal world (free of politics) is meant to be a tool to smooth out cyclical shocks as it's primary purpose, and lastly even though SS is accounted in with government balance, it has no effect on fiscal policy and vice versa.		Basically it's more complicated than that, but because of the nature of national debt and the fact that the US has monetary independence means there will never be a reason for the US to worry about a default, and that's not just the US, but any other country that has monetary independence and isn't under obligation to commit austerity. Monetary policy will always be a tool to coordinate fiscal policy with and unless there's some sort of exogenous political crises, not being able to pay past debts is never something a country has to worry about. Too much debt *is* bad though, so I'm not saying there's no reason not to borrow forever, but it's bad because it negatively impacts long run growth after a certain threshold.		Also as I implied earlier, SS has no impact on fiscal policy and vice versa, yes in national accounting SS is included right next to it, but it's misleading to think that they're connected, it is technically "government spending" but it doesn't exist as a matter of fiscal policy.","depth":4,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"martong93","name":"t1_ctu8fjl","parent_id":"t1_ctu7nfe","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438934843,"created_utc":1438906043}

{"body":"Honestly that's just a really stupid article, it's kind of hard to refute it directly because it doesn't really even tackle the issues it's trying to present in any relevant way and it doesn't really represent the true problem. It makes a few back and forth claims that the "social security trust fund is empty", missing the point that there isn't just one fund and misleading the reader entirely about that.		Secondly, everything to do with problems the article is trying to present really all go back to the "debt ceiling." Here it misleads the readers again on some basic macroeconomic accounting and to the source of funding of SS. Debt ceilings are something that pretty much every macroeconomist thinks is entirely boloney, it's something that exists purely out of politics. So a debt ceiling negatively impacts programs such as SS, is that a problem with SS or a problem with the debt ceiling though?		This article is "not even wrong." It's misleading in understanding and non-informative, basically it relies on sensationalism, a few nice quotes taken out of context, and people's ignorance and willingness not to look at things any other way.		Everything it said pretty much went straight back to the debt ceiling or politics. It makes no comments at all on why things don't work, it just takes for granted and keeps repeating to the reader that there's a conspiracy to cover up how bad SS is, neither going into why it's allegedly so bad, nor really talking about how the debt ceiling is relevant to how SS functions or is supposed to function. It also implies that this will be the end of SS as how we thought we knew it, checks haven't been sent out before in the past many times when they were supposed to, and in the past the reason for that also went back basically to politics. So at best, there's a few people trying to sabotage the normal functionality of SS, and then articles like this come out and claim it's proof of SS's inherent inferiority. Politics.		Forbes in general is such a terrible place to get any kind of relevant understanding of economic issues, but I don't want the internet warriors here to come out and claim "but Ad Hominen!"

{"body":"It's pretty well documented that the birth rate of males vs females increases during times of war.  I'm not sure anyone knows what the exact mechanism for this is (I've read a few different theories), but the numbers don't lie.  Something is happening there.  Whether it's that war results in hormonal changes that result in males producing more Y chromosome sperm, or result in females creating environments that better suit Y chromosome sperm (aka sperm with the Y chromosome have a better chance at conception vs X chromosome sperm), or some combination of the two, idk.		Heck, there's even theories that war itself is more likely to result in the death of men who are predisposed to have female children than male children.  Meaning the survivors of war are genetically more likely to have boys than girls, even without any hormonal changes.  Here's one such theory on that topic... https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200802/the-returning-soldier-effect-i-why-are-more-boys-born		It's probably a combination of complicated factors.  Personally, I'm interested to see the birth rates of lefties during times of war and to see how that correlates (unfortunately, I can't find anything from a quick search).  There have been multiple studies that have shown stress levels in the womb from the mother have a direct relationship to the rate of left handedness (more stress = higher rate of being lefty).  This is why children are more likely to be lefty as the age of the mother at the time of birth gets older.  Older mother = more stress in the womb = more likely to be lefty.  It's also known that men are more likely to be left handed than woman.  So I'm curious to see the relationship between the two during times of war.  I hypothesize that one of the major factors is the stresses of war result in hormonal changes to the mother that result in the male sperm being more likely to survive and reach conception.","depth":2,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AllJuicedUp2451","name":"t1_ctue9sw","parent_id":"t1_ctu6dri","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438945310,"created_utc":1438916510}

However, male fetuses are typically more likely to survive miscarriages (I don't know why, I guess they're hardier than their sisters). During war time, it's no secret that everyone is stressed, but the stress of wartime puts an undo burden upon the mother, as she'll most likely only be eating miserly rations, and deal with the constant fear of losing her home, her men, and her stability. So to recap: mom is stressed= she's more likely to miscarriage, but she's less likely to lose her son because he's hardier(?) than his sister.		The peace following the war is hardly any better than the war. Society needs to be rebuilt, both physically, emotionally, and culturally. Mom is still most likely on rations, even though men are returning to the fields because it takes a while for them to produce adequate crops, and she needs to help rebuild her home.

{"body":"You think western countries stopping having kids cause 'we're so enlightened' is going to stop population growth? 99% of population growth is happening in the developing world where people have 5 kids each, in some parts of Africa, anyway. Even more in places like Niger. Do you know how many kids an american has? roughly 2.2 if you look at cohort fertility, but the most recent cohort had less than 2. 2.1 is needed to even maintain the population. When the population grows older, there are less workers, less tax income, less pensions, less welfare, and a greater payment on health services. A younger population (i.e. one that is at least *replacing* itself), is more balanced. 		Most western countries are not currently replacing themselves. In Germany, the year to year TFR is 1.4, and for the past 30-40 years the german natural rate of growth has been -200,000, per year. That means the population is naturally decaying by that amount, every year. The only thing preventing the actual population from decreasing is immigration. Immigration then brings a lot of issues, especially in such large quantities. The culture of a country like Germany, with leidenhausen, and mountaineers, and all that, would presumably disappear if the current trend continues. I don't think it will, I think we're looking long term at an increase in birth rate but I'm not sure when that'll happen. However, by promoting childlessness at least in the western world, you really aren't helping anyone. You're merely endangering our own cultures which won't be able to continue because our people die out, and thus you're causing (in the long term assuming these trends continue) civil unrest, and ultimately deaths.		If you are so hell bent on reducing the fertility of the human race, you might be better off looking at places like Africa, where the population is absolutely exploding. It's a sad state of affairs when a country like Niger or Ethiopia which simply can't handle such a massive increase in population sees the biggest increases in population, while a country like Germany is so tied up in social norms and economic wellbeing that its own people stop having kids. The health of a society, is shown through its fertility. If a country cannot even replace itself through reproduction, something is ultimately wrong with the way society is run. If you are interested, you might look on wikipedia for Demographics of [country], where there is a lot of information on current trends and growth rates. 		Other interesting trends are an increase in birth rate with education (recent correlation has been found, it used to be the other way round), and rich people having tonnes of kids as a status symbol. These kinds of things are going to shape our societies for years to come, and it means ultimately a shift in wealth, etc, because the middle class aren't really reproducing as much as everyone else. It could also mean, an increase in religiosity in places like europe (muslims tend to have more kids, and evangelicals) or even some parts of america (mormons have about 3 kids compared to less than 2 for mainline protestants, and even less for atheists).

People have to conceive children later in their life because of economic reasons, so those who are best "fit" are able to have more children (or children at all) who then go on and have more children.  		I wonder if this would result in humans evolving to have longer life spans?  Humans may develop latter in life to support having higher fertility in their thirties and forties and be healthy thereafter to raise their kids.  Also if we continue to have less and less kids we could then be able to conserve our biological resources on maintenance of a healthy life.
