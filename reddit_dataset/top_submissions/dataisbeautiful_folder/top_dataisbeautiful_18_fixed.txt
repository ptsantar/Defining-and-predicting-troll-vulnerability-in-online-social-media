Sorry, in context, your comment still doesn't make much sense to me. 		The English came into Australia and killed huge swathes of aboriginal people, as is their tradition upon entering a new land.  The English set up a colony, with the queen of England on their money, and continued their racist and genocidal policies.  The children of these English call themselves Australian, and continued to use racism as a wedge to benefit of themselves, and to celebrate this history by keeping the queen on their money.

{"body":"As /u/loercase said, [there are more than these two stanzas](http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/hope-a-d/australia-0146006). I believe /u/no-other-outlet and those debating him are wrong about the poem being in any way about genocide, or about Australian aborigines at all; it is always a mistake to view the past through a modern lens. Europeans' treatment of aborigines was not a topic of widespread debate or discussion until the 1960s, not least in part because their numbers had declined so much that by the 1930s Australians widely believed that they would naturally die out. It is also not about pollution; /u/megablast is mistaken, and /u/in_my_life is correct, on the meaning of "pullulate".		I also disagree with loercase that it's about a continent Australians don't understand. I agree with /u/gammonbudju that, rather, it reads like a tremendously eloquent and lyrical example of cultural cringe (/u/RemingtonSnatch is not wrong in comparing it to 9th-grade emo in motivation); basically, the motivation behind half the 19-year old Redditards on /r/worldnews and /r/politics, for whom the US is literally an impoverished fascist regime from which all fedora wearers m'lady themselves to better places like Scandinavia. When Hope wrote the poem he had was still in his early 30s. He had studied at Oxford, and like many young people no doubt unfavorably compared the familiar with the new, in this case one of the world's great universities. Britain and America are still the leading lights of Anglosphere intellectualism; imagine how much more of a backwater Australia must have felt then, when they were weeks away by ship. The poem should thus be read as a critique of (European) Australians who claim to have civilization in a continent that is dead and devoid of life, whether in terms of life, variety of scenery, or spiritual or intellectual thought.		That said, the next stanzas are vital:		>Yet there are some like me turn gladly home	From the lush jungle of modern thought, to find	The Arabian desert of the human mind,	Hoping, if still from the deserts the prophets come,		>Such savage and scarlet as no green hills dare	Springs in that waste, some spirit which escapes	The learned doubt, the chatter of cultured apes	Which is called civilization over there. 		Unlike the above-mentioned Redditards, however, Hope was a satirist, not a cynic. The difference is that the former hopes that his biting criticism will be heard by someone and ultimately improve his target. Hope still turned "gladly home" from Europe, and retained hope that his country would someday "the prophets come"; that is, those who would bring forth the leaves and shoots of intellect from the Outback. (Hope does not, in any way, indicate that he would be one of those prophets.) [One critic compares "Australia" to Mencken and Thoreau](https://books.google.com/books?id=UX1OS-S7N98C&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&source=bl&ots=mp5nE2sf7a&sig=dIBnaWv0iTk4Xuh9VKcK2xxqGKw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8mtC5_ZDKAhVM0mMKHTVdDfgQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&f=false); I think a more apt comparison is [Ambrose Bierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose_Bierce), specifically his brilliant *[The Devil's Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil's_Dictionary)*.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TMWNN","name":"t1_cyly8o9","parent_id":"t1_cylfhbf","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1451970587,"created_utc":1451941787}

Someone writing a similar poem about the US in the 1930s would surely have had in mind Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, as opposed to Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, or Miami, all among [the country's 12 largest metro areas today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_of_the_United_States) and larger than the first three.		That's partly a function of the fact that by never having much manufacturing Australia never had a Rust Belt that declined, but it doesn't change the fact that other cities like Canberra, the Gold Coast, and Hobart are still minuscule by comparison with the big five. There are also no obvious equivalents for "Las Vegas" or "Tampa" or "San Antonio", that is metro areas that could in a few decades become as large as the others; the likes of Wollongong or the Sunshine Coast are growing fast, but the big five are too.		Will Australia ever see a big, or even medium-sized, city on the north or northwest coast?

{"body":"I disagree with your first point - remoteness increases your need for long distance communication, for distance education, general telecommunications, because there isn't extensive mobile reception, and to run copper to your property could be hundreds of kilometers and cost an arm and a leg. - Satellite is something like 2kb/s down 1kb/s up on a plan - and costs heaps as well. Television reception isn't fantastic, so you'll have satellite for that - but no other options to speak of. Where as running a fiber line to a small town and hook up 30 houses, with other surrounding properties connection via long range microwave towers is a much faster way to go, and would cost heaps less anyway. - And I have no idea where your second point is coming from, digging up foot paths everywhere and the resulting roadworks causes way more disruptions then out in the middle of no where, and large distances can be covered with microwave towers rather than cable meaning you need less people to install in remote areas. I can see your cost argument however, I'll give you that one. Regardless, I'm much more looking forward to HFC rather than fibre to the house - as new versions of DOCSIS become available it will be much cheaper and easier to upgrade (only requiring a router replacement, rather then a tech to come and replace an expensive fibre converter), and for people who say HFC isn't fast enough, I have DOCSIS 3.0 fibre in my area, and it can support 1gb/s down 240mb/s up but there isn't a plan I can get on to use that bandwidth anyway, so I'm stuck with considerably slower net just because of plan limitations. But maybe when HFC hits my area at the end of next year they might change it. - TL;DR - Read the first half, and HFC will be cheaper to the customer and offer a fast cheaper upgrade path then cable.","depth":9,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"republic555","name":"t1_cylq788","parent_id":"t1_cylii8x","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1451959287,"created_utc":1451930487}

{"body":"It’s important to note that generally only 100% population diagrams can show population density. But even then, the density varies over several orders of magnitude and the eye cannot distinguish the necessary shades of colour proportionally, so we have settle for approximations instead. To achieve this, each ‘head’ of population is merged with its neighbours (spatial resolution) and the neighbourhood is given a colour scale (chromatic resolution). By using different combinations of resolutions, different aspects of the distribution can be revealed. 		The low-spatial-resolution partial-population versions (sampled suburbs and counties) are able to highlight characteristics like hotspots (50% red) and regional centres (43% blue). In the case of the splotch diagram, it uses low-spatial-resolution administrative boundaries which depict the isolation of rural towns *instead of* the density of their populations (since only one shade of blue is used).		The get the best impression of population density, you must look at high-resolution 100% populations. This includes the high-spatial-resolution low-colour-resolution yellow one and [this medium-spatial-resolution medium-colour-resolution blue-red version](https://i.imgur.com/lf7An8g.jpg)		Some of the challenges include: at low population densities, there’s a tradeoff between showing density or showing presence. The yellow version emphasises presence thus a side effect is that low densities appear more dense than they really are, while the medium-resolution blue version emphasises density thus a side effect is that low densities fade into the background.		So they are all a compromise and unfortunately most people cannot perceive the densities in correct proportion no matter what scale is used.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jnd-au","name":"t1_cyswmjw","parent_id":"t1_cysvqmx","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1452467718,"created_utc":1452438918}

But had we not, then any US President at the time would have problems in getting support from congress, which ostensibly is required for military action, if we didn't. Bare in mind that ANZUS is not an even treaty. It's very lopsided in Australia's favour in that the support Australia might receive from the US is very much more than Australia could provide the US in the event they are attacked.

{"body":"Gonna have to disagree with you bud. Australia has room to grow and its been constantly and consistently been promoted to grow. If Australia wanted to remain a first world and relevant country, it was found that immigration was a must, I forgot what the term was but it was something similar to "grow or bust". Multiple major government policies have been pushing massively for immigration and for high levels of immigration to be maintained so that Australia doesnt fade into irrelevancy with a GDP and global impact equivalent to a small pacific island nation. While we wont ever be as relevant as China or the US, its important, in order to maintain global relations and the way of life to be in that middling group of countries that can influence regional politics and not get steam rolled by everything. This is less relevant for an EU country as the EU membership alone grants influence, relevance and protections but for a country pretty much on the other side of the world of where things happen, its important to remain important.		>In 2011, 24.6% of Australians were born elsewhere and 43.1% of people had at least one overseas-born parent		Thats the national average, less immigrants settle in woop woop (middle of no where) so metropolitan cities like my Melbourne for example are 34.8% of the population being BORN overseas. We have an insanely large, prevalent and inescapable immigrant population that is pervasive of every part of life. Line 3 Melbournians up and one of them is likely to not have an Australian birth certificate, line 4 Australians up and one of them is likely to not have an Australian birth certificate.		Since WWI, the population has quadrupled and is on key for constant growth with constant immigration into the country. The acceptance of others forms a now constant part of Australia, multiculturalism has been promoted VERY hard since 1973 (lol, White Australia policy). While a country of 26 million cant take on 1.2 million like the US did with Indochinese refugees following the Vietnam war, we damn well tried and pulled well for our weight (185 000+) I think narrowly edging out Canada for most refugees settled per capita. Its even part of our national anthem, a line from the second verse ("For those who come across the seas, We've boundless plains to share")		While I get that its normal to take a swipe at muslims and be edgy. On the whole, its bloody Un-Australian to screech "Fuck off we're full" like bogan trash and generally you will be regarded as bogan trash for doing so. We have taken on thousands of people from various walks of life as a core part of Australian culture. Its just inescapable to know people who are born overseas or have parents born overseas, either way, they are Australian now as much as the guy living on the dole leading the Cronulla riots. We have been taking in "influxes of people" for decades now and are set to continue to do so with no sign of stopping. Like you have Andrew Bolt being a dickhead, you have people travelling from all over Victoria to end up in Bendigo to protest a building of a Mosque, but ultimately the people get accepted, they become Australian, the mosque gets built and the racists have to simmer in their shit despite given many outlets to be "casually" racist which is also somehow Australian as fuck. Poms are poms, New Zealanders are sheep fuckers, Wogs are wogs, Lebs are lebs,  Australians are confused when you cant call Pakistani people Paki because thats racist, here in Melbourne there is a distinctly large subset of people who call brown people curry simply because mistaking a Sri Lankan for an Indian is so much more worse, etc. You just have to accept the banter and move on.		I know plenty of muslims, none of them let their religion affect others any more than christianity or judaism affects others. You can go spastic because some people pray to Mecca, but while you can call them muzzies here, telling them to fuck off for being brown is distinctly unAustralian at its core.","depth":4,"score":43,"ups":43,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrducky78","name":"t1_cylilix","parent_id":"t1_cylebs5","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1451946198,"created_utc":1451917398}

In a nutshell, a democracy allows the majority to "vote" for representatives advocating whatever sweet-sounding bullshit they like, with limited regard for the unethical consequences that enforcing this will may impose on unwilling bystanders (the minority).

See above.		>Rights?		Just don't initiate force against anyone. That's key. You can sort the rest out with whoever you associate with. Have a quick read through [this](http://www.ancapfaq.com/fundamentals-2.html) to see how it could work with Dispute Resolution Organisations, a very popular solution.		You can pretend to have the right to murder and steal if you like, just try to act surprised when people exercise their right to defend themselves and their property (or rather send their DRO to hunt you down to exercise that right on their behalf).		Nobody said anything about no system of enforcement. Are you truly incapable of imagining how security could be provided without the government? You realise we do have countless private security companies in existence already, even under a government...?		>Local community?		It would seem natural that people within a given community would share more similar mindsets than groups from alternate communities. Just look at the effects of North African and Middle Eastern immigration into Germany at the moment. 		If you truly cannot imagine anything being done without infringing on someone's rights then you're a long way down the rabbit hole! I'm sure you meant that only in jest.		>Compensation? Who's gonna make me pay that, man? You and your no laws, no government, no police, no army and no jails? Good one, man.		Who said anything about no police, no army and no jails? I would certainly want police to defend my rights and to investigate and prosecute those who infringe them. I would certainly want some form of defensive security from foreign invaders. I would want some way to quarantine violent offenders from peaceful citizens. 		>Build an airport? With what? To what safety standards? Who flies the planes? Don't tell me I need training and qualifications and standards, man, I'm free. And if I crash or the airport foyer caves in on somebody's head don't send me to jail, man, because my rights, man.		You're welcome to build an airport with no 3rd party accreditation and hire inexperienced pilots. Good luck finding anyone to fly your death traps though! You must be paying well! But where is that money coming from if nobody dares to get on board? Tell me, would you buy a ticket for an airline with non-existent safety standards and incompetent pilots? If you crash or the airport foyer caves in, you're going to be sued for everything you've got anyway.		There are two common flaws in your arguments here. Let me point them out. 		First is that you refuse to acknowledge that anything can be achieved without force; you are unable to imagine how the things that government inefficiently and forcefully provides for you today, that you like and need, could be funded and provided voluntarily instead. This is the premise for your inability to understand how law enforcement could exist, how roads could be built, how land ownership could be recognised, etc. Just because there is no government doesn't mean that there are no "police". At least not if people want there to be police, and I'm quite sure most people do!		Secondly, you are disregarding individuals' agency. I pointed this out in response to the airport argument, in that if your airport is so fundamentally untrustworthy, unreliable, and dangerous, no paying customers will want anything to do with you. I think this may also be the premise for your inability to grasp universal principles; that is, if we consider murder for example, "allowing" murder is not preferable for anyone because it would also permit everyone else to murder them. You seem to make the assumption that people could go around raping and stealing while their indifferent victims passively accept this fate because there is no government to mandate that it's naughty. This is obviously untrue of anyone with any sense of self-preservation, hence the significant incentive to contract a security representative, hence the significant demand for such providers to exist. The benefit there is also that, as a voluntary agreement, you are free to take your business elsewhere if your "police" fail to meet your standards. Unlike government police, there is an actual incentive to perform.","depth":22,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BlacknOrangeZ","name":"t1_cz3t4xj","parent_id":"t1_cz3rbgq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1453229857,"created_utc":1453201057}

I was having lunch on the side of the track on the [Great Central Road](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Great_Central_Road_near_Tjukayirla.jpg) just out of Leonora, when some Belgian tourists show up in a rented goggomobil. Its early December and I'm thinking about my christmas holidays in the pleasant 34c degree heat. They say they've been on the road for 2 days now and want to know how much further it is to Uluru.		Its another 2.5 days drive at their pace, and their fuel range won't cut the mustard between the two furthest fuel stops on the road. No water, no food, no fuel, no radio (not even a UHF), no permit, just money for luxury hotels. The fuel gauge is sitting just above 1/4, they don't know if the roadhouses are open or even have stocks of opal fuel (low-aromatic unleaded replacement to combat petrol-sniffing in aboriginal communities). Diesel is the only fuel you can guarantee will be available.		The standard vehicle of the bush, the [Landcruiser 70 ute or troopy](http://i.wheelsage.org/pictures/t/toyota/land_cruiser/toyota_land_cruiser_128.jpeg), carries 180 litres of diesel for a safe range of 1200km. Its an icon of the bush for a reason, and there's a reason why they are still selling them 31 years on.		Then you get this mob show up in a Hyundai Getz being driven by people who've never seen a dirt road in their lives, who are planning to travel the equivalent of the width of Europe in heat they're vocally complaining about. They say they've got a 2 litres of water between them, they have no sleeping gear or food and plan to get a hotel at Uluru that night. Bear in mind it was 12pm and they had 1200km to cover, on a 110km/h road AT BEST (less in a Hyundai Getz) before nightfall.		There's no phone coverage, legally they should have a permit to drive on the road (which they know nothing about), they haven't looked at a map (all maps of the bush show distances, road conditions & where you can get fuel & supplies).		That's not my only encounter with an unprepared European either. I've attended 3 rented 4WD rollovers from lack of knowledge & experience of high-speed dirt roads, and lots more bogged 4WDs on side tracks with no recovery gear. Always with the tyres still fully inflated at 60psi too.		That being said, I've met a lovely German couple who rent a 4WD & camper trailer and go exploring the outback every year. I've run into them on two separate occasions on different years. They're well-prepared, know whats what and could've been travelling the bush their whole lives given their knowledge.","depth":5,"score":88,"ups":88,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BiasedBIOS","name":"t1_cyle34d","parent_id":"t1_cyld4lt","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1451931075,"created_utc":1451902275}

My favourite experience was a pretty flashy sort of bloke coming over from the US. His vehicle had been allocated to him, a [HZJ79](http://i.wheelsage.org/pictures/toyota/land_cruiser/autowp.ru_toyota_land_cruiser_78_cab_chassis_1.jpg) with a 5sp manual. He'd already said he could drive a manual, hence why this was provided for him. It turns out this claim was more of his idea of showing off than based on any actual skill.		Now I'm in the unenviable position of being alone with this Texan I've never met before, who's usual vehicle was an "F250 which is way better than this" (uh, no, its not), with a vehicle he can't drive. He jumped in, cool as a cucumber, and fired up the engine. It'd been parked in 1st gear facing a small 6x4 storage shed, which he promptly knocked over as soon as he turned the key. I told him we'd bash it straight, just reverse off of it. 		Can't even manage that. So here I am, with this bloke who just knocked down someone's shed, driving laps around this aboriginal community trying to teach him how to drive the vehicle. It finally clicks with him after about an hour, at which point he starts blaming the vehicle for everything and rubbishes the vinyl seats and generally doesn't have a good word about anything.		If only he'd told the truth about the auto/manual discrepancy, we would've given him a far more comfortable (with cloth seats!) [80 series](http://i.wheelsage.org/pictures/t/toyota/land_cruiser_80_std/toyota_land_cruiser_80_std_4.jpeg).		Strangely enough it is Europeans by a huge margin who seem to cause the most trouble, but to be honest there are way, way more Europeans than yanks in the bush. Beats me why that is so, but at a hunch I suppose it could be because there is no personal space in Europe. I'm also told by a lot of the Europeans I meet (who seem to come overwhelmingly from Belgium/Netherlands/Germany) that Australia is right at the top of favoured destinations.

{"body":"I work in the largely undeveloped area of Australia's south-west, bordered by Pt Augusta, Norseman, Newman & Alice Springs. Essentially the areas [explored](http://www.beadell.com.au/uploads/7/8/1/2/7812968/4122757_orig.jpg) by Len Beadell and his "Gunbarrel Road Construction Party" (so named because they made their roads straight wherever possible).		In the Atomic era of the 50s and early 60s these roads saw a lot of use servicing the test sites of Maralinga and Emu Field and some ancillary things like weather stations. Being part of the largest land-based weapons-testing establishment in the western world ([Woomera Prohibited Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Test_Range)), it was the ideal sort of place for atomic tests. 			In the 50s and 60s these roads were a hive of activity servicing various places associated with the rocket range and some aboriginal communities. Now, except for a few really useful ones, they're largely disintegrating into tourist tracks, and an average speed of 60km/h would be considered good on most of them. For some reason roads in that area seem [excessively prone to corrugations](http://www.communitywebs.org/fgvd/assets/Images/factsandfigures/anne-beadell-highway.jpg).		North-west of the GRCP roads is the Canning Stock Route, often considered the holy grail of overland adventures. 1900km of track, and that's about it really. Allow 3 weeks for the entirety, at least 350 litres of diesel (don't even think about petrols without a support truck), sufficient food/water for that length of time and sufficient communications gear (HF radio or satellite phone, preferably both for redundancy) and spares. Also some prior experience in similar driving conditions would be handy as well.		Typically you would have at least 2 vehicles in your party, so in the event one vehicle is disabled the other one has a chance of getting parts or getting out in the event it goes up in flames or something. I've done Wiluna to Kiwirrkurra solo via the Kunawarritji community which, at the halfway point, is the only settlement of any kind on the CSR.		Of course its never that easy, is it.		Some intrepid German explorers are on the side of the road at well 2A with a tent peg through the rear driver side, and a flat spare. They've rented a [bushcamper](http://www.britz.com.au/campervans-australia/pages/challenger-2-berth-4wd-camper.aspx) with the intention of "doing the canning". 		In their defence, they had 80L water & a plastic bucket (that is reasonable as there are wells), 180L of diesel which would get them to Kunawarritji assuming no problems (and they could afford $3.50 a litre) and a reasonable quantity of food. What they didn't have was a shovel, Maxtrax, an air compressor, a tyre pressure gauge, any tyre repair equipment, any off-road driving experience (playing in the mud in a paddock in Europe is not even relevant) any communications equipment and no tools or spares except his swiss army knife. They intended to cook all their food with the single, very nearly empty 3kg gas bottle they had.		Then they said they'd cook on a fire. Guess who doesn't have any firestarters, newspaper or firewood. They had no cooking equipment suitable for on-fire use anyway - it was all alfoil pots and pans that were worn thin before they left china, let alone after 3 years in a rental.		This was all a moot point anyway, as they only had 3 working tyres and I held the monopoly on tyre repair equipment and knowledge. First time I've ever charged someone for a tyre repair because, frankly, they deserved it.		In the bush it is pretty well accepted that shit happens, and even the best-prepared and experienced travellers can have a problem. If you've gone to the effort, you'll be helped out for free with a beer and a laugh and probably win a life-long friend while you're at it. If you've not done any research or gone to any effort, suddenly its "this snatch strap has 5 uses before it needs to be thrown away, and it costs $100. $20 + 5 dollar inconvenience fee thanks, or you can sit there for another 24 hours before some other poor sod comes along and takes pity on you." 		"This patch cost me $0.20 from hong kong, plus $0.03 postage. The rubber cement is 5% of 1 tube, a dollar value of $0.50. Oh and labour is $40 per 10 minutes. It'll also cost me $2.50 to get a can of spray paint to fix the scratch on my tyre lever - If you pay the full price of the can you can have the rest of it once I've finished using it. Oh and there's a brushing-out fee for my file as I've knocked this burr off the locking ring to stop it puncturing the tube"		They were appreciative, but they didn't like my passive-aggressiveness.		I travel heavy at nearly 4000kg (i.e. 2 ton of crap) but that is what every traveller out bush who must be able to do anything in any conditions does. I can drive from Perth to Alice Springs (2500km) on one 300 litre fill. They had a lot of fluff but not much gear of actual use. If they were experienced travellers and they had tyre repair gear they could probably do it with what they had, but they had no hope. This was all in April, where temperatures average around 33c. Way too hot for a inexperienced German traveller and things go wrong pretty fast at those temps. That's not even hot, but its hot enough for things to become fatal before someone else finds you.		As I do with other misplaced tourists, I show them all the gear I've got for the same conditions (with a bit of exaggeration to make it sound even more life-threatening than it already is) and compare it to their feeble efforts. I tell them the nearest motel will be happy to have them and to add me on facebook. 2/3rds I never hear from again, but there's two couples I've "saved" before who pick my brain for advice and now own 4WDs here for use when they come over once a year or so. Now they've got the right information, they realise just how stupid I thought they were when I first met them. I'd be comfortable going anywhere with them now they've got the right knowledge and gear. They love it now.		An hour behind schedule I continue with no further mishap, call into Kunawarritji and check road conditions into Kiwirrkurra. Also it might be good for me to check what I actually need to do for work while on my way. All good, so I head back into Alice Springs down the Gary Junction Road, the most northern (and probably the best-kept) of the Beadell roads.

Also when you're on high speed dirt roads you still want to drop the pressures a bit anyway for a smoother ride, less chance of punctures and better control.

{"body":"I could write a book, but looking at your post history you appear to be from the USA, so I'll pick from my list of things uniquely Australian.		I drive 1500km to work once a month, and do the same thing back again. While I'm out there, I do an awful lot of kilometres (900,000km on my work vehicle, almost time for a wash), so I see a lot. I was on a typical run from Ceduna to Kalgoorlie when this happened.		On any major outback route, sealed "roadstrips" are positioned strategically. These [airstrips](https://travelswithaidan.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/imgp1919.jpg) are normal bits of road except with a pedestrian crossing type thing painted at each end of the landing strip to demarcate it and widened shoulders to allow for aircraft turnaround.		The Royal Flying Doctor Service, quite possibly Australia's single most respected organisation, deploys small prop airplanes better equipped than an ambulance to anyone, anywhere in remote parts of the country, at a minutes notice. No cost, no arguing, no discrimination. 		When I was much younger I was involved in an evacuation where they landed on a bumpy, spinifex-covered paddock by the light of a couple of dim headlights and some diesel-soaked burning toilet rolls at 3 in the morning following an argument with a snake. I would be minus a parent had they not've done that. Everyone out bush will have a similar story. I've seen that plane come in for landing nearly 2 dozen times now, and it never fails to bring goosebumps to me.		Anyway, I got caught up in the road closure for [this very evacuation](https://www.facebook.com/royalflyingdoctorservice/videos/10152173562947252/?permPage=1) a few years ago now. I arrived just after the volunteers from the local (100km away) State Emergency Sevice crew arrived to close the road off after a shocking rollover leaving a couple of people lucky to be alive. I had nothing to do but wait, so I had afternoon tea while the roadhouse volunteers were checking the was clear of debris and ready for landing.		At the time I was a 26ish year old man, bearded, covered in dirt and dust with a wide-brim akubra and half my lunch down the front of my shirt. I broke down crying when that plane came into view. It just wouldn't happen anywhere else would it, in terms of how important that road is would be like shutting down access between Chicago and New York. It is the primary east-west link for road trains and most passenger traffic. The only other alternative being 1700km further north.

{"body":"all the external antenna will do in practical terms is make whatever minimal signal you do have more reliable, UHF radio being basically line-of-sight won't magically appear.		Australia is quite unique in the world that a lot of travellers will use HF (shortwave) radio to communicate with other travellers and base stations to forward messages. There is much debate between satellite phones and HF radio - I carry both + a PLB, but the satellite phone is a real pain to get a signal and use. Iridium drops out often, they all take a long time to get a signal and you have to ring someone up.		If you have mechanical trouble and you've got a satellite phone, you can reach a towing service for upwards of $10k. If you've got a HF, chances are you'll find someone a couple of days behind you that is only too happy to get some parts and bring them out to you.		The system costs nothing for all services except the radio and a yearly fee unless you want to use the radiotelephone interconnect, then you're charged per minute (and far more reasonably than satellite too). There are a number of providers, the most popular being VKS-737.		If you're only worried about medical emergencies, then you can write into the Australian Communications & Media Authority for a HF outpost licence which will let you transmit on the Royal Flying Doctor Service's frequencies. Even then, you might be in the middle of nowhere in the northern Simpson Desert and with VKS you'd know that there's a medical professional on holiday and they're only 20mins behind you, where the plane will still be several hours. Its happened before, and the same problem happens with satellite phones.		Unless you're doing top-secret work, HF is the better option unless you just want a last-resort safety net.

{"body":"Shortwave is just a part of the radio spectrum with frequencies above the AM band, and below the FM band, that is unique in that its signal bounces up and down between the earth and the ionosphere to allow transmissions to cover very long distances. Just last night I was listening to China Radio International from a transmitter site 9000km away, in clarity that would make you think you're standing under the transmission tower.		This brings us back to the Royal Flying Doctor Service radio network and the innovative pedal radio (before you had electricity on tap you had to pedal to run your two-way HF radio), which back before the advent of satellite phones and satellite internet was the only way people on remote properties communicated with their neighbours and indeed with the outside world. 		Some frequencies HAMs are allowed to transmit on do fall in the shortwave spectrum, and that is largely the most interesting as you never know who you might talk to, but you're more likely to end up with a bearded decrepit 65 year old on the other end saying "sierra fiver india too november three papa too oscar three" or some other rubbish, whereas the RFDS network is for the bush residents, by the bush residents. VKS is by travellers, for travellers and so on. HAM is by geeks (of which I am one) for geeks.		The children were observed to be very capable on the RFDS radio but to get any schooling would require their parents to do it (untrained), or go to boarding school (not a terribly practical option for a 6 year old), or do it strictly by correspondence, which is slow and doesn't really teach anything. Someone comes up with the brilliant idea of using the RFDS radio network to run school lessons, and thats what they did.		School of the air is the term you're looking for, and lessons and tuition are solely provided by satellite phone & internet nowadays. It is sometimes problematic, especially in rain, but it is still better than the old system. There are a number of different school of the air providers around the country, but they all follow very similar plans. Most families at their respective school will all come in to town once a year for the big school camp/meet-up thing. 		The students/families meet their teachers too, as at least once a year they will drive out and meet all their students at home and stay there for a few days to look at handwriting, arts/crafts etc and also just to get a better idea of who they've got on the other end of the computer.		all homesteads still have their HF antenna hanging from the roof, but like shortwave broadcast radio from Radio Australia, BBC World Service, Voice of America etc its sadly a dying thing being replaced by satellite and internet connections. Which is backwards, because shortwave is still the only communications medium that can't in any way be interfered with or blocked by a third party. Sadly I suspect the ABC's shortwave radio relays for the outback will be next on the hit list, plunging 10,000 or so people into silence unless they have a satellite dish (useless in a car).","depth":11,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BiasedBIOS","name":"t1_cynw60k","parent_id":"t1_cynv523","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1452104242,"created_utc":1452075442}

I can't say I'm familiar with any amateur HF unit, high end or not, that has selcall or the RFDS emergency red button, rendering it completely useless on the VKS/RFDS channels unless your emergency happens in the middle of a sked.		VKS base station staff have a good track record with the emergency services, and they're also trained specifically to deal with people experiencing emergencies to get all the information (a surprisingly hard job). If you're at the police station and someone comes in at 11pm saying he heard someone on the radio in distress and that he reckoned he said he was 20km north of Maralinga he'd be dismissed as a nutcase. Before that amateur even gets to the police station VKS will have people out and you'll be sorted before things start going truly sour.		Outback police/other emergency services are also members of VKS, so you may be lucky and be able to selcall them direct.		Luck on the amateur bands or luck in someone hearing you on VKS doesn't translate to a guarantee of safety in anywhere near the degree you have with a commercial set.		Also, being broken down is not an emergency in itself and now you're stuck with the disadvantage, same as the satellite phone, of the lack of community. When it could be a 2 hour and $100 job to get mobile again you could be up for $10,000 towing bill because your only choice was to get someone on the amateur bands to get a tow truck sent out.","depth":11,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BiasedBIOS","name":"t1_cynwu4d","parent_id":"t1_cynvnkj","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1452107060,"created_utc":1452078260}

{"body":"The cost to expand,house,cater is all much more here. Any resource Australia needs is excessively expensive because of the distance it needs to cover to get here. Australia exports everything and does not really have any manufacturing plants to process what it needs into a usable product.  We export raw materials to countries that have the capability to process it and buy back what we need to cover its population. Once you factor in their profit margin, freight (sea and road) The costs skyrockets like you wouldn't believe. Its not economically viable to have one major port and use the roads for distribution, so you have to bring everything large in by sea. Consider the size of Australia compared to your average country, consider the fact that its a continent with no close neighbors with manufacturing capability and you will realize that the cost to make or build anything here is fucking expensive.	 Now as it stands our government is already cutting shit left right and center to even out the budget because its already going in the red. To take in more immigrants that has already been promised would send the country in a financial spiral.		 The cities are already expanded to their max capacity, to use any of the surrounding lands and make it livable will cost money and time we just don't have right now. We don't have enough skilled laborers to take on the jobs required as it is let alone extra projects. Then we would have to find them jobs/provide healthcare/ or benefits which is generally more substantial than what other countries offer, but if we take them in then we would have to give them the say benefits as a regular citizen which would strain the budget to far. We can't use overseas workers to do the work because of the laws we have to protect local employment. Basically you're not looking at the big picture. For us to take in the numbers people think our land could handle would make Australia a third world country in no time.		Lets take our NBN (internet restructure to keep up with other countries) It was promised that it would be done by 2012 to 98 percent of the population. We are in 2016, its nowhere near complete, they have already gone double over the initial budget, They have had to sell of shares to private companies to help get it finished and lot of the services originally promised have had to be altered to a much slower more expensive to maintain service because the government can't find the money anywhere to make it happen. Shit like this happens here all the time. Thats just one service, one type of infrastructure upgrade that has caused such financial strain on the country that they don't really know when or if they can ever complete it. 	 	Heres another example, Australia stopped getting Panasonic plasma screens before everyone else. Reason being no matter what Panasonic did, because the product was so heavy, they could not sell it at a profit due to the shipping costs involved to get it to point a to point b. This is Panasonic we are talking about, and they couldn't find a way to turn a profit on their TVs in our market.		Now consider the big picture and consider every item shipped here is under the same restraints you can get an idea how it can be financially nonviable to expand the cities and towns at a rate required to house/pay/provide health care to the numbers our land could hold. Eventually, down the road, once improvements have been made it could be an option. But Australia is a very young country, its still developing and learning to sustain itself in a world where nothing comes cheap here. It is what it is.		I know that sounds racist and honestly I love would nothing more than to open the flood gates and let them in, but every politician that has faced this problem has had to come to the same conclusion...we can't handle it just yet, it will ruin our country like the motor industry ruined Detroit.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dropped_on_my_head","name":"t1_cymmyvq","parent_id":"t1_cylnrpo","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1452018317,"created_utc":1451989517}
