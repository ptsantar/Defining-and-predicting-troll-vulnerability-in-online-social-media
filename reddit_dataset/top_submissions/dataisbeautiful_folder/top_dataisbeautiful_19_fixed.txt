{"body":"I decided to jump on the bandwagon and grab a wireless charging	plate and a receiver for my phone (Samsung Galaxy S5). Both of them 	were purchased for as little as possible on Aliexpress, since I didn't 	want to be out a bunch of money if I didn't like it. Anyway, I had heard	that wireless chargers can tend to waste a ton of energy through heat so 	I decided to do an experiment. I logged battery percent and temperature 	(Using an app called Device Temperature from the Play Store) every 5 minutes	for both the wireless charger and the regular brick I got when I bought the	phone. I recorded the data in LibreOffice and imported them into Google 	Docs for the visualization.

{"body":"Personally, I love it.  I got one for my desk at home, one for at work, and one for the car.  Whenever I sit down at either computer, or to drive, I just toss my phone on the pad without even needing to look, and it starts topping off.  No messing with plugging or unplugging, I just grab it and go when I want to, and my phone is almost always topped off now.  I do still use a wire for overnight, or occasionally if I've been out and about for a while and my battery is particularly low.		One note though: usage patterns will obviously matter a lot.  I use my phone pretty heavily, and I can't normally get through a day without a charge, so it's a bit more important for me, personally, to charge it.  My wife has a phone with a bigger battery, and she doesn't use it much, so she just dumps it in her purse or wherever and charges once overnight, so she doesn't care.  As an aside, I saw a post in the past few days saying that keeping the battery above 40% is better than running it down all the way, which may compensate for some of the extra heat?  I don't know if that extra heat even matters that much.","depth":2,"score":410,"ups":410,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zably","name":"t1_cthdyyz","parent_id":"t1_cthdlfm","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1437996728,"created_utc":1437967928}
{"body":"Heat degrades a battery more than anything else, which is why laptops that just sit on a non-hard surface get so hot and experience battery degredation so quickly, usually getting to the point where the battery can't hold any charge after a couple years. That being said, I've been wireless charging my Nexus 5 since I bought it at launch in late 2013, and the battery still lasts about a day and a half with my light usage, which doesn't seem to be any less than when I got it. I've seen charts showing that batteries stored at 100+ degrees F will degrade by about 20% in a year vs. about 5% at room temp (this is without any charge/discharge cycles), but of course the phone is only warm (and not even 100 F) while it's actually charging, and then cools down once it's topped off. I'd guess my degredation due to heat is probably 10% after a year instead of 5% if I had charged with a cable.		My real problem is that when I don't have the wireless charger, I'll often just set it down without plugging it in "because it has enough for now", then I actually need it later and it'll be dead. With the wireless charger, setting it down IS charging it, so that problem goes away.","depth":3,"score":268,"ups":268,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"throwaway131072","name":"t1_cthfadv","parent_id":"t1_cthdyyz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1437999418,"created_utc":1437970618}

{"body":"> I've never used a wireless charger, but is having a cord really that inconvenient?		I also own a gs5 with a wireless charger, and I'd say yes.  First off remember that the gs5 has a flap over the USB port to maintain water tightness.  So every time you plug or unplug, you have to deal with that fuckwad flap, and if you rip it off entirely then the thing isn't watertight anymore (cock dammit!).  So that's a lot of daily irritation avoided simply by being able to leave the goddamned flap in place 95% of the time.  The second thing to remember is that any time you use a connector you're placing physical stress on that connector.  Use your phone long enough and eventually that usb port is going to break off of that circuit board.  Depending on your usage patterns you may not reach that point before you replace your phone, but I've had a phone with a "OK hang it upside down by its USB cord and it'll charge correctly" semi-broken USB port before, and it sucks donkey nuts.  (And since it's usually an old phone by that point anyway, not worth spending the $ to fix it.)

{"body":"I disagree with you on the convenience and I'd also say you're doing it wrong. If you are trying to do a short charge then you should use a cable because it will charge faster meaning you will get recharge more of your battery for whatever time you plan to have it there. Overnight this doesn't matter because the phone will be left to charge for a longer period of time (in which case the phone will likely be fully charged with either the cable or the wireless pad). 		As for the convenience portion, first, it is not hard to plug a charging cable into a phone. Somehow people break the connectors but I have never needed to replace any charging cables. Second if you ever want to use your phone while it charging with a wireless charger you will either need to use it while it's laying on the charging pad or you will need to disrupt the charging by taking it off of the charging pad to hold (this is an inconvenience in case you didn't catch it). This, in effect, places a much shorter cable on the phone because you cannot move it from the charging pad or it will stop charging. In the case of using a charging cable the phone can be held or laid flat while in use and the range of motion is only limited by the length of cable and the location of the outlet.		I didn't mean to sound mean if I did. I understand people view this technology differently and your needs may be catered to by wireless charging. However, I think overall current wireless charging technology is not in a place where it can be considered more convenient than wired charging.

{"body":"Literally the only reason I use the wire overnight is that when I use the wireless charger, it stops charging at 100% (probably to prevent overheating) which causes a light to flash, due to unsyncing from the wireless coils.  An hour later, when it's at 98% or whatever, it starts charging again, which causes another light to flash as it resyncs.  Repeat all night.  The wire doesn't do that.  This is probably a software issue for my specific phone, or some hidden option that I couldn't find with Google.		As for the rest, about convenience, it's completely subjective and based on an individual's needs and usage patterns, so I get it if not everyone likes it.  For me personally, I don't mind picking up the phone and interrupting the charge, particularly if I don't need to unplug or replug in a wire to do it.  I literally pay zero attention to my charge while at work, and just let it do it's thing, or not, based on whether I want to use my phone, leave my desk, whatever.		I will say, I'm not sure I understand why you are saying picking a phone up off a pad to use it is more inconvenient than picking up a phone off a desk with a wire attached (which is the only other option).

But I still think it's totally worth it. But this is purely subjective and depends on your usage pattern and financial situation.  	Efficiency is lower, but this is mainly important for heavy users who use their phone when charging or need a charge in the shortest amount of time. Not everyone is like that.

The increased convenience means I actually *do it* before my battery is sucking fumes, so I run out of battery less.

Anyway, I've been charging my phone this way for ages, and providing you have an accurate position with nothing in the way, it doesn't seem to heat up any more than a USB cable.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"canyouhearme","name":"t1_cthkehb","parent_id":"t1_cthcg2m","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438014284,"created_utc":1437985484}
{"body":"Both methods seem to slow down the charging during the last 10%. This is because these type of batteries are charged via a constant current then constant voltage method. This means they charge as quick as the charger and cable can provide until it hits 4.2v then the current slowly ramps down to maintain and stabalise the 4.2v. This is less pronounced on the wireless charge probably because it look longer to get to 4.2v and so was already more stable when it got there.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"normskilight","name":"t1_cthlho5","parent_id":"t1_cthcg2m","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438018781,"created_utc":1437989981}

{"body":"My wife and I both have Nexus 5s, and for some reason my Nexus 5 (with built in, bonafide wireless charging) gets really hot when I use the wireless charging pad, while hers stays extremely cool.

And then you get bizarre outcomes like my device being terrible for wireless charging, while another of the ostensibly same device is brilliant.

{"body":"Not to be pedantic, but the correct terms are constant-current and constant-voltage. 		Li-ion batteries have two limits with regards to charging - the amount of charge current (say, 1A), and the charge voltage (say, 3.7V). Under, say, 80%, the charger must limit the voltage, otherwise the charge current will go beyond 1A. Thus, the charger maintains a constant current while slowly increasing voltage. Once the voltage hits 3.7V, the charger will hold constant at that voltage, and the current naturally begins to drop off as the battery becomes more and more charged. At some point, the current will drop close enough to 0A that the charger decides it's fully charged and stops. 		Trickle charging is a technique most closely associate with NiMH and lead-acid batteries. These types of batteries lose charge very quickly (NiMH loses 1-2% per day), so you can very slowly trickle a small amount of current to them. Lithium Ion batteries do not lose a significant amount of charge over time, and should not be trickle charged. 		The reason the usb charger cools down is because it's working the hardest during the constant-current phase.

But Qualcomm's charging technology is nothing special. Battery charging time is limited by the battery itself and the safety guidelines for charging them. What Qualcomm is doing is helping phone manufacturers match charging capabilities of various batteries rather than going with a one-size-fits all approach. The whole "they use 9V or 12V rather than standard 5V" stuff is garbage because quick charging is done using regulated currents. You regulate the current flowing into the battery terminals to the maximum it can take until it's at 80% capacity. Then, the battery voltage is regulated and ramped up to its final safe operating voltage. A li-ion battery never sees more than about 4.2V regardless of what voltage the charger is running off of, otherwise it would overheat and likely explode. I design these things for a living.

Two separate but both very important bits of circuitry.

By delivering a high voltage with comparable amperage, either 9V, 2A or 12V, 1.5A, the phone gets more wattage from the wall that it would with a standard USB charger, even a 2A one (18W vs 10W). The phone can then take the additional wattage it has and provide it to the battery charging circuitry, which will obviously operate at the appropriate voltage for the Li-ion battery, but can use higher amperage. How the battery's percentage of charge goes up is totally up to the phone's battery charging circuitry and has nothing to do with the phone's power supply, except that it is limited by the phone's power supply.

{"body":"To analyze a bit the trends you see in those curves. It corresponds very nicely with the method lithium ion based batteries are charged with.		First there's a constant current charge, where the current going in to the battery is held constant. This is done to charge the battery quickly, however it can't allow the cell to go over ~4.2V so when the battery reaches ~4V it switches to constant voltage charging. In constant voltage charging, the voltage will be kept steady ~4.2V which means, as the battery gets closer and closer, the voltage difference will get smaller, and the current will drop. Then when the current reached a set point, it cuts charging. There's no trickle charging with lithium ion based batteries.		During the constant voltage charge, as the current drops, so will the heat output, and this corresponds nicely with your graphs :)		The reason the wireless charging seems more linear, might be because its rather limited in the amount of current it can deliver, and due to that, a smaller difference on the chart between constant current and constant voltage phases.		It's also why USB charging starts cooling off much quicker, as it most likely hits the constant voltage point much quicker.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"smuttenDK","name":"t1_cthm3vk","parent_id":"t3_3eq70d","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438021352,"created_utc":1437992552}

I can understand that people want the convenience of just throwing a phone onto a surface and having it charge, but go back a generation of products and you had nearly the same convenience without the negatives.  Old school handheld/portable phones (not cell phones) and early PDAs (like the Palm Pilot) had very simple docking stations that took no effort and didn't require any amount of alignment to get them to charge.  You threw them into their dock and they'd start charging because they were designed with metal contacts that would touch and self align very easily.		Today, however, most phones use a micro USB connector which is incredibly finicky and needs special attention to make sure the connector is pushed into the connector and even with good quality cables, the electrical connection can take a little bit of jiggling to get the device to charge.

{"body":">  I had heard that wireless chargers can tend to waste a ton of energy through heat		This is true, but from an overheating perspective, your losses are not going to be near the microprocessor. 		"Too Hot" is subjective, but chips can get up to around 80c (on the die) prior to a reduction in MTBF. After 80c the device requires derating, and after around 125c the device will fail pretty quickly. 		What you've measured is likely to be either a temperature sensor on the microcontroller or on the board near the microcontroller. Because the heat is dissipated in the transmitting coil (mostly) and in the receiving coil and conversion circuitry (to a lesser extent), you are not measuring the actual coil or conversion circuitry temperature. This will be the hottest point, with heat transferring according to the θ_ja value between the die of the chip and the temperature sensor. Likely, because they know this, and because of the rather low duty cycle of the charging circuitry, it's likely to be rated at a much higher temperature than a processor would be. 		Also, because of the improved current supply of the USB 3.0 chargers, I would recommend logging data against a 2.0 charger and wireless, because the charge rates are going to be much closer between the two. 3.0 is just crazy fast. 		In any case, the temperature you are reading is a pretty good indication of what the microcontroller  is experiencing, which is the main thing you need to protect anyway.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chcampb","name":"t1_ctic0ig","parent_id":"t3_3eq70d","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438066836,"created_utc":1438038036}

Charging cycles man, you get way better battery life out of devices by letting them run low on battery and taking the time to charge them up fully when you do.  With cordless phones though people would only pull a phone off the charger to answer a call then immediately charge it back up by putting it back on the base.

For those gifted with understanding of electronics and ohms law, picture air in the circuit with a huge resistance vs a metal like copper or aluminum in it's place in a wired system.	The time vs. temperature graph is interesting yet predictable.  I'm guessing the power transfer is restricted by factors like regulated transmission power (FCC stuff) and capability of the receiving electronics.

The OEM charger has a step down transformer coupled with four diodes and probably a good RC filter to clean it up which then connects to a power regulating chip which may all be on one IC so I will concede that it also has loss.  All inductive circuits do.  However, one must use more power if you expect to split the transformer with the primary and secondary coil being in separate devices.  Furthermore, since it can't be assumed that the user will place the secondary coil in perfect alignment with the primary coil, even more power will be introduced to make sure it will charge acceptably even with poor placement.  The process has far more loss and wastes a great deal of energy.  		On the grand scale of what the house consumes it is not a lot.

{"body":"I don't believe electrons need to be aligned at all, from my rudimentary understanding. In a traditional battery, you simply have an anode (-) and cathode (+) in an electrolyte. 		A chemical reaction causes a build up of electrons at the anode. This reaction has to stop once there is a sufficient build up, since they don't have anywhere to leave. But the electrolyte keeps them from going to the cathode. So when a circuit is created, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through the circuit. We need a reversible reaction for a rechargeable battery.		In a Lithium-Ion battery, lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode during discharge. They follow the reverse path with recharge. You must control recharge AND discharge currents and temperatures in order to keep the battery stable.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PremierDaichin","name":"t1_cthyog6","parent_id":"t1_cthnnth","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1438046928,"created_utc":1438018128}
