I think this may have something to do with how the film was shot. It was shot almost entirely in "magic hour" - the time in the day where the sun has gone below the horizon, it's still light, colors are extremely pronounced, but oddly muted, and there are no shadows. Meaning the film appears vibrant in color, but quite dark and sombre. But this frame capture format implies a much different look for the film - it gets the colors right - but totally doesn't convey the mood / energy / style of the film like most of the other ones on the page.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ex-Y-Zed","name":"t1_cwmumpz","parent_id":"t1_cwmrx46","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1446588376,"created_utc":1446559576}

{"body":"My process is as follows:		1. Configure VLC to play the movie and capture every Nth frame.  I typically capture every 96th frame, which seems to work pretty well for an average length movie.		2. Run a batch process in Photoshop to take each frame, apply a light gaussian blur to smooth out the color, then resize to 3 pixels wide.  Blurring and resizing (rather than cropping) results in a 3 pixel wide slice that has the predominant color of the frame, but also has slight variations from some of the other hues and values.		3. Use Imagemagick to take all the slices, stack them together, and export a PNG.  I can then use Photoshop to manipulate the PNG in any way if needed.		Other people use Imagemagick for all the frame manupulation, and still others use entirely different processes.  But this is how I do it.  I like the control that I have over some of the steps, and I've been happy with the results so far.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rocketmonkee","name":"t1_cwo6yq4","parent_id":"t1_cwnsmmo","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1446679503,"created_utc":1446650703}

{"body":"Let me get this straight:		You take each frame of a movie, about 24 frames per second, and so for a 2 hour movie thats around ~173000 frames or so; it averages to a pretty high number.		Each frame has however many pixels. If we assume HD that is 1920x1280 is ~2,460,000 pixels in a single frame.		So, you take the value of each pixel, which is represented by 3 bytes, 1 byte per color (RGB = red, green, blue = 3 bytes) and adds those bytes with the bytes of every other pixel; around 2,416,000 additions for each and every single frame. Then, you divides that number by the # pixels to get the average color of that frame in a single 3 byte value.		You then repeats that process for every single frame, correct?		Cool. Does it take a long time to process all that or not? I feel like the number of instructions would be around the 10^9'th or 10^10th power range, and so a Ghz processor would have no problem dealing with this in a couple seconds or so. 		Also, 173,000*3bytes=519kB.
