Some people think that Moore's Law is dead, but soon we will be able to harness the incredible promise of many new technologies such as quantum computing, neural circuits (like True North from IBM), carbon nanotube based circuits, superconducting materials, etc. 		My main argument is that eventually we will reach a point where computers will be powerful enough to simulate WELL over 100 billion neurons.

{"body":"The complexity of the brain isn't quantified by the number of cells present, just as transistor count is becoming a decreasingly significant metric for computing power. Moreover, neurons are nothing like transistors and we don't fully understand how they even function.		Each neuron in the brain can form thousands of links with others - raising the "complexity" figure to 100 to 1000 trillion synapses. Leading neuroscience research in [connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome) suggests that it's the varying strength of these incredibly complex networks that forms the true functional structure of the mind.  Even if we were capable of simulating every one of the 10^26 atoms in the human brain, we lack the technology to map the neurons and their connections with sufficient resolution in the first place. 		When true general artifical intelligence is developed, it will *not* be a model of ours.  It cannot be. It will be its own kind.

{"body":"In the Culture series, immensely powerful minds benevolently "rule" in a sense over a society made up of lesser intelligences, ranging from animals to somewhat powerful AIs (with humans in the middle somewhere). There are no laws, and it's a post-scarcity environment where most people live purely for hedonistic, artistic or personal intellectual pursuits. People live as they want, and decide things democratically when disputes occasionally arise (as in one instance where someone tries to erect a series of cable cars in the middle of a desert on a ringworld, but most of the ringworld's population think they're eyesores), with the Minds generally acting as facilitators for such systems.		It's well worth a read. Most of the books are about things on the fringe of the normal way of things in The Culture (if it was all about how almost everyone's life is perfect, it'd be boring). The people who work in the Contact division, for example, dealing with new, technologically inferior civilisations or even rival powers in the galaxy. The first book takes place in the middle of perhaps the largest war in the Culture's history (fought in a roundabout way to satisfy The Culture's need for a sense of purpose in an otherwise perfect and carefree existence), and its impact leaves a lasting scar on their society which is alluded to in later books.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rather_Unfortunate","name":"t1_cu7je8s","parent_id":"t1_cu7430h","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439963030,"created_utc":1439934230}

{"body":"I'm not sure how any of the stats you're citing are supposed to make your case.  Honestly, I'm not even sure what it is you're attempting to argue at this point.		You cite a decline in violent crime, which is irrelevant to the point of economic progress/regress.  I never claimed that things were getting worse *categorically.*  Obviously we've seen advances in many areas, but that doesn't mean that the average person is better off economically than they once were.		You cite drug abuse statistics which are A) also irrelevant and B) cherry-picked.		You cite poverty stats that show the current poverty rate is higher than at any other time for which you provide numbers.  How does that support your claim of economic progress?		You cite both an increase in women earning college degrees as well as a decline in on the job injuries and fatalities without providing any sort of argument for why these constitute evidence of economic progress.  More educated women in the workforce can be good, but why are many families with two working adults still struggling to make ends meet when a single income used to be enough to keep one parent at home?  Are people pursuing higher education because they're being provided with great opportunities to do so, or are they simply getting straddled with massive student debt in a desperate attempt to earn a decent living in an economy that no longer provides a living wage for most people without a degree?  Are less people getting hurt on the job because workplaces have become much safer or is it because many of the most dangerous industrial jobs have moved overseas?		Finally, your CPI and wage numbers.		First, I'm not sure why you skipped 1990.  It makes it so your percentage changes are not apples-to-apples.  Second, why not just show the total percentage change versus CPI directly since that's what you're interested in talking about?  Also, your math is wrong.  You want to look at percent change not absolute percentage of the previous data point.		Here's what I get:		Year | CPI | +% | AWI | +% | % Change v.

{"body":"Firstly, I'll clarify what I understand you to mean by capitalism, since it is important to define terms. If I am wrong, feel free to correct me as to what you meant.		I understand capitalism to be the private ownership of the means of production.  	 - *Private* meaning having the right of excludability over rivalrous goods. 	 - *Means of production* means resources that are used to make other resources. 		For example, I have built a factory on a piece of land that was previously unclaimed. This factory turns dirt (also from unclaimed land) into brick. Me running this factory means that someone else cannot simultaneously run this factory. This makes it rivalrous. In theory, I have a right to determine who can use my factory (exclusion) and who may enter, work at, or benefit from the products of my factory. That right is backed up by the appropriation of force (If someone attempts to gain access to the factory without my permission, it is defined as a type of trespass and is deemed appropriate to resolve with force).		Again, if this is not what you meant by capitalism, I'm by no means insisting on this definition, just explaining what I understand you to mean.		Conversely, even though it wasn't mentioned, I understand communism to be the common ownership of the means of production. That is to say, rivalrous goods are not excludable. Meaning, no person or group of people has the legitimate right to prevent another person from using any means of production. Some definitions of communism make a distinction between "private goods" which are not permissable and "personal goods" which are. Personal goods are goods that are *not* used to make other goods and can be posessed by a single individual (eg a phone, or a loaf of bread, but not a house). Again, depending on who you talk to or what school of thought, this could vary.		So having established the semantic framework, I don't see a particular problem with either of those ideas, provided that the people involved in them are doing so on a voluntary basis and don't violate the rights of the individual.		From studying capitilism and communism as philosophies and economic models, I have found one thing they have at their root -- They derive their ideals a priori from the rights of people. They both set out an initial framework of a basic set of values that hold person-hood as the highest of values.		Neither believe that people should be subjected to suffering at the hands of others, neither believe that theft, assault, murder, rape, kidnapping and fraud are acceptable.		So why are there overwhelming examples of why "Capitalist" and "Communist" systems end up abusing these ideals. What is the philosophical disconnect? In my opinion it is statism. When you actually analyze the flaws of what we call a "Capitalist" system, you find that the state actually induces Corporatism. When you analyze the flaws of what we call a "Communist" system, the state actually induces Socialism. These are perversions of the true philosophies and the reason why is because if you consider the definitions of those philosophies, there isn't really any room for statism, yet it will insinuate it self. The state will violate the basic tenants of both philosophies and use them to concentrate wealth and power into a ruling class that starts off intending well enough, but soon grows out of control piling on to the poor incentives it has provided for.		So what does this have to do with technology and automation?		I think both will allow us to side-step the state, and thus the statist rules that provide for the concentration of wealth and power. You see this every day: Take Intellectual Property, for example. An idea that allows the state to be the arbiter of the appropriations of what ideas belong to who. IP is violated millions of times a day without consequence or regard. Why? Because of technology. 		Take the financial system and the state monopoly on issuing currency: Fuck you, suddenly crypto-currencies.		Open-source, decentralized technologies are trending very quickly, and it precisely because they are safe from statist control. I think as of right now very few people appreciate the implications of this, but the process has already started and isn't likely to stop.		Technology renders the state impotent, and it is simply the correct implementation of technology that will make things like tax evasion and unlicensed commerce just as safe and easy as pirating software and music, or manufacturing an illegal firearm.		There is currently a movement that is open-sourcing large and complex means of production, thus decentralizing the manufacturing base. This disengages the state from productive activity since it creates commercial activity that it cannot track. If the state no longer has one central company to rock up on and say "If you don't do things our way, we will go talk to our friends in the banking industry and they will comply with our request to seize your assets. Sure, the state can still use violence and lock people up, but instead of them being able to leverage unilateral power over resources, they are rendered as ineffective as a bear fighting a swarm of bees. 		As automation technologies develops I don't see it concentrating into a few wealthy, powerful hands. I see it distributing over billions of individuals who want to lead peaceful, productive lives. I am optimistic for the future of technology because I don't view it through the lens of how things are now with a state, I see the information revolution rendering the state as obsolete as the industrial revolution did to slavery.","depth":4,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eitauisunity","name":"t1_cu7ky1d","parent_id":"t1_cu76wms","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439965581,"created_utc":1439936781}

And the resources we need to make these things only seem to become more and more scarce; not to mention looming effects of climate change on our ability to keep connecting all of the physical supply lines, which will in turn incur more political instability, and so forth. I believe it's a very human-centric view of the universe to believe the things we have will always continue to exist for us, and that they will also continue to unendingly improve.

{"body":"Open source technologies aren't quite ready to extract tens of millions of barrels of oil a year, but it's a matter of small steps.		By its nature, the state insinuates itself into pretty much all of the supply chains for necessities of society. Agriculture, medicine, energy, education, dispute resolution, communication, (and the most significant) currency and financial services.		The value of open-source technologies is that it significantly lowers the barriers of entry to produce that technology. This allows that technology to become decentralized and distributed. Take Cody Wilson's Defense Distributed project for example: He has published his designs and developed them as an open-source project. You can find all of these files anywhere you have an internet connection. This means that no matter what happens to Cody; no matter what threats the government, a corporation, or individual makes against Cody, those files are indelibly in the hands of millions of people who can then continue to share, improve those ideas, and produce them into actual products. Because of that project the world now irreversibly has quality designs for firearms. You can see this as a good or bad thing, but it's undeniable the idea that it illustrates. Regardless of the state's wishes, people will be able to have access to reliable plans to build a small, untraceable machine that can make untraceable firearms, legal or otherwise.		Why is that the case? Well, if there is a firm producing illegal firearms, the government can leverage their assets and freedom to make them comply with their demands. Even if there are a few individuals participating in this activity who can meet the high barrier of entry with the right tools and the right skill set, they are much easier to track. However, if those barriers of entry were significantly lowered to the point that any person with $800 and access to an arduino, the internet, and some off-the-shelf parts and tools can assemble a machine that will precisely pump out untraceable firearm after untraceable firearm -- well, now you have significantly more people participating in that activity. That is *much* harder for the state to shut down. Then you consider how quickly that technology rolls out and the state simply is left in the dust. They are one central authority that is fighting a swarm of thousands if not millions of anonymous, private individuals. 		Then you consider things like torrenting, deep web markets, cryptocurrencies, cryptographic communications, etc -- they all have similar effects. The government has been unable to stop torrenting, or even curtail it. Silk Road got knocked down and Ross Ulbricht is facing life in prison, but many additional markets sprung up in its wake and will not likely repeat Ross's mistakes. Cryptocurrencies are designed to be trustless and anonymous, hallmarks that are, again, difficult for the state to interfere with.		You have numerous open-source hardware projects that can be funded through crowdsourcing that can side-step the traditional rules of raising capital that the state heavily controls. People have more freedom to put their money behind the development of an idea, and because of cryptocurrencies, they can do so with the safety of anonymity.		Once you start seeing commercial grade, open-source manufacturing machines like a laser cutter, n-axis cnc mill, plasma cutter, 3d printer, induction forge, etc at a cost of thousands instead of tens or hundreds of thousands (see the project Open-Source Ecology), you have more people making more things that can also trade those things independent of the statist structure. They can couple that with technologies of cryptocurrencies and deep web markets and little can really be done to affect the overall picture.		The state, of course, can start heavily monitoring the internet, which it probably already is, but projects like MaidSafe stand to correct the effects of that. So, the state, of course can shut the internet down. The beautiful part of that option is that due to so much "legitimate" commercial activity on the internet, which the state taxes, it would be nearly impossible for the state to do so. Even if they did, there is so much tech laying around that could allow people to build an alternative communication network (see /r/hocnet). We are at a point in technology that no one organization could possibly stop people from communicating en mass and in private. 		As the state puts on more pressure, the rate of these developments only seems to increase.		Historically, when a state collapses, it takes all of the supply chains for necessities with it. This causes a great difficulty in the average person to meet their needs. When  people are unable to meet their basic needs they are likely to become violent. People associate "chaos" and statelessnes because historically when the state does collapse things get extremely chaotic. People assume this is because there is no longer a central authority to corral people and keep them in check. In reality, it's because the state took with it everyone's ability to meet their needs.		Technology has gotten to a point where it can allow us to sidestep the collapse of the state and build supply chains for needs that are insulated from that collapse, and do so before the state collapses.		I can develop this idea a bit more, but I'm already hitting with a wall of text, so if you are interested, let me know.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eitauisunity","name":"t1_cu8il5w","parent_id":"t1_cu7x1hj","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440036512,"created_utc":1440007712}

{"body":"There are a lot of gaping plot holes in the movie Idiocracy that make the story a lot more interesting when you stop and think about it. 		Let's look at the premise of the dystopia. *"As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species."* In other words genetic drift. Without any sort of selective pressures, alleles or traits that would have been weeded out of the population are allowed to exist. Driving factor for this genetic drift is that unintelligent people keep breeding uncontrollably, while intelligent people are more conservative and have fewer kids. 		However, we're faced with the Lek Paradox. The Lek Paradox can be summed up like this, [Persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic diversity in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_mating#The_lek_paradox) And in fact, it's very difficult to remove an allele from a population based on genetic drift. Heterozygosity will pretty much keep those alleles alive in an uncontrolled population, which means that this dystopia couldn't be caused by genetic drift. Unless there was a catastrophic event; the alleles or genes encoding for intelligence wouldn't disappear, they would just be less prevalent. 		So if intelligence couldn't be weeded out of the population, then where did it go? The corporations. Everything in their universe is still state of the art, it's just that all of the people are stupid. But if the people are stupid, then how is everything state of the art?  The doctor, Justin Long, is an idiot but they've managed to simplify diagnosing a patient by putting three probes inside of someone. That is a huge medical advancement. Their Google is now only used as a porn site, but it had to be made into the porn site in the first place. The navigation system used to track Luke Wilson's character exists and isn't fucking terrible, and I think the best example of their universe still being state of the art while the people are incredibly stupid is the show "Ow My Balls". Despite the show "Ow my balls" being terribly written, it's well produced. If it was a show made by idiots who don't know what they're doing, then it would look more like a shitty home movie than a well put together tv show. Yet there were multiple episodes and the TV show was essentially on demand. Someone had to write, film and edit the show before an executive could give it the Green Light to be on TV. If everyone was an idiot, then they wouldn't be able to operate the camera and the executive also wouldn't know if the show was good or not. 		That's because intelligence didn't disappear, the bourgeoisie are intelligent and the proletarians are stupid. The bourgeoisie are taking advantage of the proletarians and pandering to their every want or need. 		Disposable clothes? Check. Masturbation TV station? Check. T.J. O'Handjobs? Check. Brawndo? Check. Carl's Jr? Check. Starbucks Handjobs? Check. 		*Yeah but all of the politicians are morons too. How do you explain that?* The politicians are stupid because they are elected by their constituents to represent their constituents. If the constituents are stupid, then they'll elect someone equally as stupid or ignorant. We have that problem in our government all of the time. Also, the intelligent bourgeoisie don't want to get involved with politics. They're outnumbered and even if they were elected, no one would want to listen to them because it feels like they're talking down to proletarians. So instead, they influence politics instead. In the movie Brawndo's parent company bought the FDA, FCC and USDA.  		Idiocracy isn't a world where intelligent people don't exist.

{"body":">Persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic diversity in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists.		I think there's an additional explanation for this that's really simple. The urge to mate and somewhat-related need to feel affection experienced by most humans drives them to settle for less desirable mates, allowing the undesirable trait values to propagate readily. As far as evolution's 'motivations' go, crappy children are better than no children; alleles will hitch a ride on any vehicle they can get.		A bigger problem with that narrative in Idiocracy is that (aside from specific inherited illnesses) intelligence is only very slightly heritable.

{"body":">  If we started transitioning to self-driving trucks tomorrow, it would still be a smooth takeover as open positions get filled first and then the existing ones as the old guys retire.		Why would they only replace drivers as they retire? There will be massive layoffs as transportation departments switch to using self-driving trucks. They can run 24/7 (168 hours per week), as opposed to to the federal limit of 60 hours per week for truckers, which means you get 2.8 times the road time for a self-driving truck as opposed to a human. Self-driving trucks do not need to rest, so they can make as long of a journey as you need in one straight trip, which reduces shipping times. You do not need to worry about reliability, self-driving trucks will always show up for work. There are no training or recruitment costs for self-driving trucks. The trucks themselves will be safer, so insurance costs will be lower. Computers are better at judging traffic than people, which means the truck will be driven as efficiently as possible, resulting in lower maintenance costs. With a large system of self-driving trucks, they can report traffic conditions to each other, which means they can automatically adjust to take the fastest route possible. Not to mention you do not need to pay a self-driving truck a wage. That's cutting out a $20,000 - $60,000 expense *per truck*, which will easily pay for itself in a few years. Expect any sane transportation company to trial self-driving vehicles for a couple years, then immediately purchase an entire fleet and lay off their entire driving staff.		Commercial drivers will not exist in 30 years. The entire industry will be gone because at some point self-driving will be a standard feature of new cars and trucks. So when a company buys a new truck, it will already be able to drive itself, so they aren't going to pay a driver to.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Oughusktaiunten","name":"t1_cu7nn7r","parent_id":"t1_cu7a1oa","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439970239,"created_utc":1439941439}
{"body":"It's very difficult to talk to people who are as enthusiastic as you are about self-driving vehicles.  That sub is very nearly a cult.		In short, you're right about everything you just said, and I won't disagree except to say that it simply won't happen overnight.  Business doesn't work that quickly, labor and unions don't move that quickly, and I expect that human drivers will still be needed for extremely complex maneuvers for a while until the AI gets good enough.  For instance, self driving trucks may be amazing at first at interstates and terminal to terminal shipments, but I can easily imagine navigating end use deliveries in strange locations would need to be done by hand.		There are also financial reasons to go slowly.  Businesses don't replace assets that are still new, so they'll keep human driven tractors until they're depreciated.  All existing docks will remain the same, and wont change for decades because companies wont put in new docks just because a shipper wants to use a different truck.  They will pull the same trailers in use today.  The new AI trucks will have to conform to existing standards, so they won't be perfectly optimized vehicles for self-driving and will have to look like, haul like, and move the trucks of today, etc etc.		Plus, there likely will only be two or three companies able to produce self driving trucks at first, so they will be hard to get and expensive until the industry adopts can meet demand.

{"body":"It's not that I'm enthusiastic, it's that I see it as an inevitability. An inevitability that most people are ignoring. It wont be overnight, but within a decade of the first commercial self-driving truck becoming available I expect all major competitors to have switched over. 		People thought exactly as you do when the web was first coming around in the early 90s. By the time the new millennium rolled around, every major business had a website. We went from 15% of homes having access to a computer, to half of all households having one [in just a decade](http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p23-207.pdf). Self-driving cars wont be as revolutionary as the internet, but they will be close. And the difference will be that people and organizations wont have to buy their own vehicles, rentals will be a very large market. They can just lease it. When one truck can do the work of almost three human drivers there is no way they're going to drag their feet on that. If a business has enough potential openings for 30 drivers, they could just order 10 trucks as soon as they're available, and once they've got the logistics worked out in a few years, the rest of the staff is gone.		Uber recently made a statement about wanting to replace their drivers with self-driving cars. When the average person spends [$9,004 per year](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm) on transportation it wont be hard to break into that market. If they offer a travel package that covers the average person's needs for $375 per month they cut their travel expenses in half, and everyone is going to jump on that. The first company to deploy that technology is going to be the one that wins that multi-billion dollar industry, so it's an arms-race at this point.		There are around [3.5 million truck drivers](http://www.truckinfo.net/trucking/stats.htm) in the US. That's 3.5 million salaries that do not need to be paid. Unions might not like it, but that's a *massive* cost savings from a business perspective. All of those people will be out of a job in 20 - 30 years. Every freight hauler, auto hauler, tanker hauler, bus driver, limo driver, cabbie, pizza guy, UPS/Fedex driver, garbage truck driver, and the list goes on. They are all screwed if they don't start planning soon. That's why I get so worked up about this, it's a tremendous problem that is about to happen.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Oughusktaiunten","name":"t1_cu7tqw5","parent_id":"t1_cu7rvsm","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439980712,"created_utc":1439951912}

Uhm, except it's been the backbone of nearly every major revolution in human history?

Okay, so she didn't actually say it, but [via Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake#Attribution)		>Although this anecdote was never cited by opponents of the monarchy at the time of the French Revolution, it did acquire great symbolic importance in subsequent histories when pro-revolutionary historians sought to demonstrate the obliviousness and selfishness of the French upper-classes at that time. **As one biographer of the Queen notes, it was a particularly useful phrase to cite because "the staple food of the French peasantry and the working class was bread, absorbing 50 per cent of their income, as opposed to 5 per cent on fuel; the whole topic of bread was therefore the result of obsessional national interest."**		It has also been shown that high food prices are linked with social instability and rioting, via the [New England Complex Systems Institute:](http://necsi.edu/research/social/food_crises.pdf)		>**The importance of food prices for social stability points to the level of human suffering that may be caused by increased food prices.  The analysis we presented of the timing of peaks in global food prices and social unrest implies that the 2011 unrest was precipitated by a food crisis that is threatening the security of vulnerable populations.  Deterioration in food  security  led  to  conditions  in  which  random  events  trigger  widespread  violence.**   The condition  of  these  vulnerable  populations  could  have  been  much  worse  except  that  some countries  controlled  food  prices  in  2011  due  to  the  unrest  in  2008.   Food  price controls in the face of high global food prices carry associated costs.  Because of the strong cascade of events in the Middle East and North Africa only some countries had to fail to adequately control food prices for events to unfold.  This understanding suggests that reconsidering biofuel policy as well as commodity market regulations should be an urgent priority for policymakers.  Reducing the amount of corn converted to ethanol, and restricting commodity future markets to bona fide risk hedging would reduce global food prices.  **The current problem transcends the specific national political crises to represent a global concern about vulnerable populations and social order.**		I mean, if anything, this shows you don't even need to get as extreme as 99% of the population without income before social order would crumble.		I think people's problem really is that nobody actually wants to suffer violent, bloody revolution where half the population is killed or mauled just to be treated *fairly* by the people with access to resources.

Or to phrase it another way: we produce much more today than in the past, and for everything we produce today it would take many more people to accomplish without all of our technological advancements. Ergo technology cannot possibly create **more** jobs than it destroys. This is /u/eqleriq's argument.		I have some additional arguments. The article claims that our tech advances have given everyone more disposable income which creates demand for new products thus requiring new jobs. However they don't take any effort to show that this increased demand is truly due to technology, and I would argue that it is cultural instead. Our culture dictates that everyone have a full-time job (with fewer and fewer exceptions for house-wives/husbands), and since we're all busy with our jobs we buy more time-saving technologies, buy more fast or frozen food, buy new things instead of repairing old ones. Our culture also dictates that everyone buy more luxuries to "support the economy" and because otherwise you look like a cheapskate. It's a kind of self-perpetuating cycle. In a different cultural and political environment we could all be living more frugally, using fewer luxuries and primarily buying necessities. Thanks to technology our necessities generally cost much less than in the past, so we would require less money and less work to make that money. In turn there would be fewer jobs (or job hours) due to the decrease in convenience/luxury spending. So I argue that the possibility of this second lifestyle puts the lie to the idea that technology creates these jobs.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"robotnudist","name":"t1_cu8m3p4","parent_id":"t1_cu8ewmo","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1440041352,"created_utc":1440012552}

I shouldn't have let you bait me into giving my interpretation of his argument, because it's irrelevant. Nevertheless: 	2. [imply](http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/imply-infer/)  - Introductory stuff. We can't know what he was implying, we inferred different things.

[pretend](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pretend)  - both essentially (as in it's essential) require intent to deceive, so you think I was trying to deceive you about your own words? It's called a difference of views, not a lie/pretension. Subjectively I think you substantiated your statement no more than he did.

I didn't fuse [lost jobs] with [jobs not created] because [jobs not created] is an infinite set. I conflate [lost jobs] with [jobs that would have been created] and I still contend that's valid. No, I can't know the future and neither can you, so this is again subjective. 	7. double-count - I could only have double-counted if there is overlap between the two sets [lost jobs] and [jobs not created] but your contention is exactly that there is no overlap.

{"body":"The point stands: arguing that "more people" are needed to work **AS A FUNCTION OF TECHNOLOGY** is ridiculous, and here's another one for you, nonsensical.		The title is "Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed" and it is absurd. Help me along, where in the article does it distinguish that a job was created explicitly by technology rather than destroyed by it? I'm not exactly following that gross leap of logic that claims technology is the reason there are "more jobs" anywhere? More demand for work? How about the fact that people need to work to eat, and live?		Of course more people have jobs, there are more people in the world and unemployment has not increased more than the population has to the point of flatlining "total workers in the world."		But to assert that more people have jobs DUE TO TECHNOLOGY is completely impossible and absurd. I don't know what to tell you to grasp the concept that if you have something that increases work efficiency, it doesn't require more workers, it requires less. Less workers in field A doesn't mean they don't work, necessarily, they can (get this) migrate to field B so they feed themselves. Or yes, they could not work. Either scenario I wouldn't say that technology destroying field A leads to a boom in jobs, when the true variable is POPULATION.		And so		>The irony is that not even a few decades ago, it would have taken MANY more people to store, aggregate, research, edit, produce and distribute this article.		This was *NOT* asserted in the article whatsoever. In your sprawling semantic dissection of 2 sentences, you claim it "was." But it "was not." Ridiculous.			> The argument that those jobs were merely displaced into the same infrastructure, or that the infrastructure requires as many if not more humans, is ridiculous.		This is a tangent from the article. It was not explicitly asserted within the article. I'm not "countering" an argument, because it wasn't made. I'm stating that anyone arguing this premise is a fool. It is heavily implied by the article with the logical leaps and the "trust us, if you see all the data it makes sense" hand-waving. But imply all you'd like. You do not gain jobs by adding technologies. I can invent the XYZ machine that disrupts the world of ABC. Have jobs been gained? How could they have been, if older technologies BY DEFINITION are less efficient and require more human interaction? Did I invent a LESS EFFICIENT technology?			Congratulations, you (hopefully) now realize my statement was embellishment directed at the comment I was responded to. No arguments were made. Merely the idea that someone could realize the idea that technology makes more jobs than it costs as utterly, basically, completely, ridiculous.		In fact, I might even extend this to say that the article written is, gasp, CLICK BAIT and that the research and the data shown do not support the premise that TECHNOLOGY is causing it, but perhaps, instead **the aggregate of all workers doesn't decrease due to technology, and that people who lose jobs due to technology then find other jobs.**		Sorry, but file that one under "no shit."		Again, you might think you're clever by stating "Findings by Deloitte such as a fourfold rise in bar staff since the 1950s or a surge in the number of hairdressers this century suggest to the authors that technology has increased spending power, therefore creating new demand and new jobs." 			Guess who's creating more jobs: MORE PEOPLE.		Technology just changes WHAT THE JOBS ARE.

Once they've finished, they just put the scanner back and pay the balance it has rung up. At the moment, you still need humans to check that people aren't shoplifting but what happens when every item in the store has an RFID tag, so it is possible to accurately determine exactly which and how many items have been put in the shopping trolley?		Google is working on the next step for mobile payments after contactless, which is to use your physical presence in a store as the authentication needed for payment. Once that's implemented, shopping trips will consist of you putting things in your trolley and then just walking straight out. That means no checkout staff at all, other than a manager who would have to deal with the same sorts of rare customer complaints and queries that happen today.		Humans will only be needed to stock shelves for as long as a robot can't do it, which won't be long. This is assuming that physical grocery stores are going to continue existing as they do today, which seems less than plausible when delivery services are going to be so much more efficient. The distribution centre can be fully automated, picking products to be delivered by autonomous vehicles.		What people seem to not conceptualise is that if a human's job can be boiled down to following a complicated flow-chart, it will be possible for it to be automated. The only jobs which won't be able to be automated completely are those which involve creative thought, which only make up a tiny minority of the jobs available. That means there's nothing more crucial for the future than education, but it will never be the case that every member of society is going to be equally capable of new creative thought because some people are smarter than others.		The only way for society to continue is for a universal basic income to be implemented. The consequence of this, when all other jobs have been automated, is that people are free to do what they want. If you asked most people whether they actually liked doing their job, they would probably tell you that they didn't, but if someone really enjoyed running their own florist shop then they could just choose to run it as a hobby activity. People would still have money to spend on things like these in the same way that they would have money to spend on any other non-essential activity, so it's not as if people will be bored in future.

I'm guessing you're thinking about this as a static issue; for example: "The plow is invented. demand for labor dries up. Employment falls." But that's really not how this stuff works.		The micro preferences of any individual (which cause the backward bending labor supply curve) indicate that people will always work. Here's what happens:		1. Plow is invented. Labor demand falls, labor supply increases.		2. People are now employed at suboptimal levels, and there are no jobs for them to do.		3. People who want (and need) to work are sitting around doing nothing, but their lives could obviously be improved. 		4. Innovation - human resources that were previously devoted to farming can now be allocated to new markets that they build or are in nascency. In our example, our subsistence farmers may have foraged for honey combs here and there. Now that there are lots of people who aren't farming but want to work, so they will start an apiary (the word for bee farm).

Not everyone can or wants to be a knowledge based worker a time is coming when we'll see regulations on using robotic workers vs. human workers because the displacement is too large. 		Take a fast food restaurant for example. You have various jobs: cashier, cook, drive-thru order taker, janitorial, and management. Cashiers and order taking can easily be displaced by current technology and is going in that direction. Cooks could eventually be displaced by assembly line style cooking robotics designed to cook the food the same way each time and removing biological hazards human cooks can bring. Janitorial jobs could be easily displaced for the majority such as sweeping, mopping, and cleaning kitchen equipment while more sophisticated technology might be needed to clean bathrooms. Management would then also be reduced since you wouldn't need to oversee so many people. If such a restaurant had 4 cashiers / order takers, 5 cooks, 2 janitorial workers, and 3 managers with robotic workers the could be cut down by more than half. to 0 order taker, 1 cook robotic supervisor, 2 janitorial workers, and 1 manager.

College students must either take out more loans or wait longer to find a job flexible around their class schedule, Family supporters must find another low wage job, and low iq workers - the hardest hit - will need to find another place willing to let them sweep floors or scrub bathrooms.

{"body":"I don't care for horses, nor do I do more than basic maintenance for automobiles.  I'll bite on this and try to use it because this seems like the analogy people can relate the best to.  The point is that you get more work out of an automobile for less overhead cost.  I think you may be missing my point a little bit.  We'd never implement a system that would required more manual labor than existing systems.  However, we might implement a system that requires a smaller magnitude but more skilled labor force in order to achieve equal or better work output.		So, imagine you had an automobile that could do the exact type and amount of work as a team of 12 horses.  We might say that automobile had 12 horsepower?  Let's say you'd need 6 men to care for, drive, and work these 12 horses.  These men work all week long, and they make X dollars per week for their work.  Now, say the automobile required less overhead.  You don't have to feed it, clean it's stall, fix the fences that keep in in, maintain the land that it lives on, etc. However, it requires weekly maintenance.  That maintenance can be accomplished by one very skilled man.  He costs X dollars to do your weekly maintenance.  You get the same performance at 1/6th the cost and minus the overhead of having to maintain the land to keep a horse.  How can this man do this maintenance for 1/6th the cost of your horse boys?  Engines are easier to maintain than horses.  It only takes him 8 hours to do the weekly maintenance on your engine.  He can have 5+ customers per week.  He makes more than your horse boys, and you get the same level of work.  		Each robot won't require its own personal technician.  That's crazy.  There will be technicians available for different types of robots in different sectors that can service units in a sufficiently efficient manner.  You can make the argument for robots that maintain other robots, but then you enter a bit of an infinite cycle.  Either AI gets to unrealistic levels where they can operate at the same or better level as a human in terms of critical thinking and ad-hoc problem solving, or there will always be a human somewhere in the loop.

See other edit at bottom if you care for explanation as to why; believe me, you don't)		In the modern (Western) world, we already have more unskilled people than we can put to use given current governmental policy (don't look at unemployment, look at those who have given up on looking for work).  This problem is only going to get worse as technology progresses.  We already have social welfare programs, but they're stigmatized.  We'll likely see that stigma go away as this (hopefully, eventually) becomes the norm.  Following that, we might have a bit of a class conflict between the skilled/employed and the un-skilled/unemployed.  I don't want to assume too much, but it's pretty clear that this is coming. 		Again, my original comment is in response to the views expressed in the video.  I think they're fear-mongering bullshit.  I agree that unskilled work is going away.  I just think that highly-skilled work will stay around for a long time.  Not just in technology, but in the creative arts as well.  The video's examples in this respect are a broad extrapolation on computer science concepts and achievements that, quite frankly, I don't think the author/producer has a good enough understanding of to comment on.  		I reiterate, unskilled jobs are going away. Period.  However, there is still a buttfuckton of work to be done by skilled/talented humans.  That's why I think educating our population should be a priority.  In a short time, those are going to be the only jobs left.  They will still be around, though.  Those in future generations who don't focus on being really fucking good at things robots can't do will miss out and become second class citizens.  That requires education, skill, and talent.  			edit: actually, I didn't post that bit about compensating for the amount of unskilled people in population before in my reply to /u/Osonius.

However, I think we'll see a paradigm shift in the way the vast majority of people use cars. I use my car 90%+ of the time for commuting, what if there was an alternative? I think car ownership will diminish and instead most people will use an automated taxi service for their transportation needs. If you consider that manufacturing a car can be nearly completely automated, if not completely, it would take a smaller team of mechanics to maintain the taxi fleet, and that there would not be any drivers for an automated car, means that there will be less jobs associated with driving, maintaining, and manufacturing these cars. As solar energy, electrical engines, and batteries become more efficient, you will also see a decrease in the amount of jobs for people that produce and sell fuel. 		**TL;DR:** I think the landscape of car manufacturing, ownership, and fuel, will change in the near future, reducing the amount of jobs associated with those industries.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JB1549","name":"t1_cu79zkr","parent_id":"t1_cu78h50","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439949210,"created_utc":1439920410}

The next big step in technological evolution is going to be nano-tech, AI, and bio-tech in my opinion/from what I've seen. The issue especially with AI is it has the possibility to destroy far more jobs then it can create. 		For example: When it eventually takes 1 operator to monitor and watch/dispatch trucks from a work station in Chicago for the entire Illinois region (all autonomous vehicles) with the help of a specialized AI program, only a team of < 100 engineers to design it, market it, and implement it. We are going to see job loss not gain. There is just no way around it, 1000's of truckers, packaging/loading staff, dispatchers, route planners, coordinators. Can potentially be cut out for a computer program.

{"body":"For everyone worried about a "dystopian" future, if you live in Africa, Eastern Europe, parts of Asia, or parts of Latin and South America, *it already IS dystopian.*  		The system of capitalism is already a nightmare for roughly half the world's population.  That's billions of people.  		Automation will maintain the suffering and misery in the third world, and increase it in developed and mature countries.  At any rate, they're already starving, unemployed, murdered, and sick with infectious diseases over there.  		The hope is that by continuing to decrease the quality of living standards in mature countries revolutions will develop.  But there are real, terrifying possibilities of mass control which arise with the increasing technology and automation.  Tech and Engineering advancement essentially makes a task range increase, and capable of being carried out with less human effort.  You don't need 100 policemen to march a street during a protest when 5 robots can match their performance for control and disbursement (or worse), and which are being controlled remotely by 5 humans. Of course it's more complicated that that; you need technicians, developers, maintenance personnel, etc.  		From the perspective of the elite class, their primary concern is their own wealth and power,--not giving people jobs and making people happy.  Happiness for the average citizen has to be Taken back from them.  The problem of technology is that it makes the task of controlling human beings and rendering them useless easier and easier to do,--social control will be on the agenda along with the commercial and private goals for businesses, because it will be necessary to use force against people in a society of increasingly unipolar wealth distribution.  Machines and technology increasingly make a narrow top hierarchy easier to maintain.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"trippingbilly0304","name":"t1_cu7a3h0","parent_id":"t3_3hfe5y","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439949369,"created_utc":1439920569}

{"body":"“Imagine a pair of horses talking about technology in the early 1900's. One worries all these new mechanical muscles will make horses unnecessary. The other reminds him that everything so far has made their lives easier – remember all that farm work? Remember running coast-to-coast delivering mail? Remember riding into battle? All terrible. These new city jobs are pretty cushy, and with all these humans in the cities there will be more jobs for horses than ever. Even if this car thingy takes off, he might say, there will be new jobs for horses we can't imagine.		But you, dear viewer, from beyond the year 2000, know what happened – there are still working horses, but nothing like before. The horse population peeked in 1915, from that point on, it was nothing but down. There isn't a rule of economics that says “better technology makes more, better jobs for horses.” It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud, but swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.		As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of the economy, mechanical minds will do the same to humans. Not immediately, not everywhere, but in large enough numbers and soon enough that it's going ot be a huge problem if we're not prepared. And we're not prepared.		You, like the second horse, may look at the state of technology now and think it can't possibly replace your job, but technology gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate biology cant match. Just as the car was the beginning of the end for the horse, so now does the car show us the shape of things to come.”		Source: Humans Need Not Apply, CGP Grey, http://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=3m32s","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spacefarer","name":"t1_cu7peqc","parent_id":"t3_3hfe5y","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439973302,"created_utc":1439944502}

You want to believe in ever-increasing bubbles, fine by me, not here to waste effort arguing. Our quality of life has increased compared to Neanderthals, and if you have to resort that far back, that's really disingenuous. Quality of life has increased as long as it has been made cheaper to do so, and what was once a luxury of the aristocracy has become accessible to us as a result, as long as there was a population willing to provide that cheap labor, and as long as there was proper redistribution of that wealth and productivity through major reforms.

{"body":"Ya no.  It is no secret that displacing jobs literally means more joblessness.  Just because the high tech industry is going up and down and that the tech high industry is currently in an up-swing, does not mean that everyone is working and making a living.
