{"body":"I’m excited to have finally found the time to put this visualization I’ve had in my mind for a while together! You’re looking at the observed age distribution for the United States from 1933 to 2010 and then projected all the way out to 2100 using data from the Human Fertility Database and the Human Mortality Database. I also put together a collection of key years on [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/HQtNf). A lot gets written about the “greying” of the population, but it’s difficult to be enthusiastic about a process that takes decades. So I sped it up!		Projection years 2011 to 2100 use the median projection from Monte Carlo simulation (n=1000) and show an 80% prediction interval. I used Adobe Premiere and R, specifically “ggplot2” for the images and “demography” for the population projection. I’ll be happy to talk about the methodology behind the projection or to message the script if anyone wants to see it. I’m just finishing up a Master’s degree in Demography, so I’m still relatively new to data visualization and coding, but it’s something I’m passionate about and I have a lot of ideas for how to communicate things better!","depth":0,"score":1123,"ups":1123,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"StephenHolzman","name":"t1_ctwuxzg","parent_id":"t3_3gckpr","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439157088,"created_utc":1439128288}

It makes you wonder about the alternatives - If the west had known in the 1940s and 1950s how much they had actually suffered and the true extent of their manpower shortages, history could have been quite different as they probably were not capable of fighting a protracted war and the US would have pushed them a bit harder, probably with dangerous results. 		And if the Soviets hadn't suffered so badly in the first place, then they would have been really dangerous.		It did have an interesting effect parallel to experiences in western nations where women were pushed into blue collar jobs - in the west this trend reversed somewhat when the soldiers returned home to take up their old jobs, but in the USSR it simply could not, and women outnumbered men in construction work, etc.","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ceeker","name":"t1_ctx3us5","parent_id":"t1_ctwypv6","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1439174825,"created_utc":1439146025}

The total number of US deaths in WWII was 407K, which is a lot, but still nowhere near the ratio of men in that age cohort being killed as in a lot of other combatants in the war.  So 407K men of a certain age being replaced within a decade only requires 40K more men to immigrate per year than women, which, given that there were several hundred thousand people immigrating to the US each year, doesn't require anything close to a 1000:1 ratio (where did you get that figure?).  And I just found a source showing [immigrant gender ratios by decade](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/males-100-females-ratio-among-immigrants-1870-present?width=800&height=650&iframe=true).

Again, did you not actually read my posts? Alright, let's go through this again point-by-point.		First, you *don't* know it will double. It might septuple, or it might halve. 		Second, doubling in twenty years is actually *poor* performance. Why would you think doubling in two decades is a good thing? That's far below average performance.		Third, you don't know which companies will thrive and which will be destroyed by the influx of competition in an increasingly-lucrative field. Just because the sector as a whole does well doesn't mean that the companies you invest in now will do well. It could be quite the opposite.		Fourth, and most importantly, I'll tell you for the third time: the future profitability of companies is already reflected in today's share price for those companies. Let's say you're right that the profits are only expected to double in twenty years. Well, that's already factored into the stock price *right now*. So if the profits only increase by a factor of 1.9 instead of doubling, then your stock price will likely underperform the market average because you bought it at a price with the expectation of 200% profit growth, and it only achieved 190% growth.
