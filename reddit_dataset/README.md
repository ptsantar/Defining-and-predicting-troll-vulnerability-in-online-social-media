# File Format

## Submission

The first line of each file contains information regarding the submission. The information is enclosed in curly brackets and it is tab separated (`\t`).
```
submission: { t3_abcdef	user123	A name for the submission	1436562890.0	1436591690.0	0	6780	6780	0	t5_abcde	subreddit_name	 }
```
For example the information for the above submission is : 
  - id = "_t3_abcdef_"
  - author = "_user123_"
  - title = "_A name for the submission_"
  - created at UTC = _1436562890.0_
  - created at = _1436591690.0_
  - gilded = _0_
  - score = _6780_
  - upvotes = _6780_
  - downvotes = _0_
  - subreddit id = _t5_abcde_
  - subreddit name = _subreddit_name_

  
  ## Comments
Each line in the file (except the first one) contains the information regarding a comment. The format of the comment is the following: 
  - each comment is enclosed in curly brackets
  - fields of the comment are comma separated (`,`)   
  - for each field there is its name on the left side of `:` and the corresponding value on the right side.

``` 
{"body":"some text","depth":1,"score":100,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"user456","name":"t1_abcdef","parent_id":"t3_abcdef","subreddit":"subreddit_name","subreddit_id":"t5_abcde","created":1436592113,"created_utc":1436563313}
``` 
For example the information for the above comment is:
  - body of text = "_some text_"
  - depth = _1_   (the number of edges from the comment to the submission)
  - score = _100_
  - upvotes = _100_
  - downvotes = _0_
  - controversiality = _0.0_
  - gilded = _false_
  - author = "_user456_"
  - id = "_t1_abcdef_"
  - parent id = "_t3_abcdef_"
  - subreddit name = "_subreddit_name_"
  - subreddit id = "_t5_abcde_"
  - created at UTC = _1436562890.0_
  - created at = _1436591690.0_
  
  Note that the API returns downvotes = 0 for both submissions and comments.
