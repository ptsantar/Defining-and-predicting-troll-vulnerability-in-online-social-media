This relates to the repetition of the subreddit, but it's also to do with the idea of infallibility. Criticise a Tarantino film or even the man himself and you get a fair bit of hate.

But there's not much that can be done by the regular users. 		A couple things I've noticed (probably applicable to rest of the website too)		- Once a post gets on the front page or /r/movies, more likely that casual users or casual fans of movies will chime in		- Once a post gets on the front page of redditon /r/all, more likely the circlejerks take over and low-effort content is upvoted.

But it would be good for other users to suggest alternatives as well, rather than explain the faults with Nolan, even if they're quite valid. So when it's appropriate in an MCJ thread I'll unjerk and suggest people to offer more alternatives. 		If they're people who are fairly active with this subreddit, enough to post, they might appreciate more recommendations. 		Every day I and most others are here and usually seeing repititive un-ironic circlejerks (DAE Interstellar literally flawless and should have Oscar!?
