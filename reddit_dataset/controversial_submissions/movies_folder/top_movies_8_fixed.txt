If you had to sit through one of them, you'd pick the Hobbit, because no one just sits down and decides to watch those god awful Star Wars prequels.

I'm not sure if you and I experienced things in "real time" in the same way, but my memory of people's reactions to the SW prequels at the time of their release is very similar to how people are reacting to the Hobbit movies currently.

The RT values for the SW movies are 57/67/80, while the Hobbit's values are 64/74/60. That's an average of 68 and 66, respectively: right now, the Hobbit movies are technically trailing.

Though this may have something to do with the fact that with The Hobbit I knew the original story (from reading the book) but with SW, while I knew how it ended, I still wanted to see how they chose to get there (however painful it started, and ended up, being).

As for the merits of either as movies, meh. The Hobbit may very well be a better movie if you're talking in purely technical terms, but it took such a massive shit all over its source material that I will never have time for it.
