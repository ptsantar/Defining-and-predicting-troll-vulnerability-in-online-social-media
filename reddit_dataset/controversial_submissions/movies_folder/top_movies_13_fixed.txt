{"body":"Its refreshing in this day and age of cynical Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking that there are no Government conspiracy subplots, no pointlessly obstructive human characters to cheapen the world ending stakes, no shaky cam, faux-documentary style bullshit. Everything that modern blockbuster films consistently get wrong; choppy flashback narratives, airless plots, lack of character development... none of that is present here.		Especially when American blockbuster filmmakers seem to revel in such inane absurdities, its the good story well told that brings tears to my eyes. The world building and attention to detail are second to none. The care taken with the story and visuals, the sheer lack of missteps present in the final product are simply mind boggling. The film is everything the fan in me wanted. From big scale (coherent, visceral and innovative) action to a real nuts and bolts understanding of story structure and servicing character. 		The film showcases just how skilled Guillermo Del Toro is as a filmmaker. He brings his own baggage to the table, namely his love of outlandish designs and clockwork/steampunk machinery. It took something on the scale of Pacific Rim to ultimately deliver his passion for monsters and sci-fi to the mainstream.		Aside from its colorful, instantly recognizable robot ensemble, the Kaiju of Pacific Rim each harken back to the classic monsters of Toho lore. If you look closely, there are allusions to Mothra, King Kong, even the angels of Evangelion. All mixed into a seriously impressive cabal of foes that have their own fighting styles, unique powers and weaknesses. 		It goes to show the pervasiveness of the art design, each Jaeger and Kaiju become characters in their own right. Outside of the men and women piloting them, we have Cherno Alpha, the dependable Russian tank. Crimson Typhoon, of the triple buzzsaw arms. Striker Eureka, the Aussie showboat. And the star of the show, Gipsy Danger, the gunslinging American cowboy.		The human story imparts dramatic stakes outside of the SFX action. The main character, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) is well meaning and unselfishly heroic. Judicious use of 'The Drift' a type of mind melding device, allows characters to work together harmoniously. In doing so, unnecessary conflict is kept within reasonable bounds, the eye, as they say, is always on the prize.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MikeArrow","name":"t1_connp48","parent_id":"t3_2w4zzx","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1424136111,"created_utc":1424136111}

That scene is there only as a motivating reason for reactivating Gypsy Danger, a way to get Raleigh back into the story.		There is *one* flashback. And it's pretty damn important to get Mako's backstory introduced in an emotional and gripping way (through the Drift, allowing Raleigh to feel her pain and bond with her - also allowing him to find out some sympathetic qualities in the otherwise hard nosed Stacker).
