And yeah Toy Story 3, while still following Andy and his toys, isn't a direct continuation of Toy Story 2(it was made over 10 years later). Toy Story 2 is also more of a standalone story with the same characters than a showing the effects of the first film.		It says a lot about Pixar's abilities as storytellers when you can watch the 3rd film in a series and never feel lost, and be moved by the story. Thinking back, all the necessary information for that specific story was revealed in the opening through dialogue, which works both for people who've never seen Toy Story but is still relevant to fans who are catching up.

I get where he's coming from, and because of what he does, he's one of a handful of film critics whose name I know by heart.
