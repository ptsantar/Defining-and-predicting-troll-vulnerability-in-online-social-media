{"body":"Yeah, they use CGI backgrounds in all sorts of stuff these days, prime-time comedies and such, where it now costs way less for a mundane close-camera New York street scene to be greenscreen-simulated than for the Los Angeles production company to actually cross the country to do their "location" shots. You don't notice it because they have that technology *nailed*, now, for all the standard two-camera TV-show stuff. And the background has nothing interesting going on, so you're not looking at it anyway.		For blockbuster movies, though, besides the factor of, "It's all fake, so we can and should do anything! Explosions! Dragons! Supernovas!", I think there's also the fact that in many big-budget movies the human actors are trying to act in company with other characters who do not yet exist.		George Lucas had a dude with a rubber Jar-Jar head stuck on top of his actual head to at least keep the actors' eye-lines correct, and in the old Star Wars movies a big Scottish dude was an adequate Vader for filming purposes, but an awful lot of actors still need other actors to properly bounce off, if you want them to perform well. That problem, and 100%-greenscreen fake locations, had to be a factor in the lousiness of the Star Wars prequels; also consider Ian McKellen's famous [problems with greenscreen](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/20/the-hobbit-gandalf-ian-mckellen-almost-quit-acting). See also the dreadful performances often seen in animation and video games, where voice actors don't know what's actually meant to be going on.		In the situation-comedy-street-scene situation, there's not really much that'd change if they were really in Manhattan. In the Giant Epic Space Opera situation, greenscreen with invisible to-be-computer-animated-in-a-month-or-three co-stars, and over-the-top background craziness that'd cause the Saints Row programmers to say "steady on, dude", creates problems as big as the ones that ruined many early talkies.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dansdata","name":"t1_cslby90","parent_id":"t1_cslauif","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435495090,"created_utc":1435491490}

{"body":"I realize you might not agree, but that movie was terrible for many reasons. One it couldn't decide on what it was. It was trying to blend various thematic elements into one and it achieved none of them well, it wasn't quite an action movie, it wasn't quite a drama, despite the attempts to seem like one, it wasn't a crime movie, it wasn't quite SciFi, it wasn't quite a thriller, it wasn't anything done well. The plot was an atrocious mess, the story was nearly indistinguishable from a mishmash of random ramblings over a day by my 5 year old cousin.		Almost none of the characters were even real humans with any depth at all. They spent so long trying to show the machine as a human in contrast to people that were hardly human, but they failed so miserably at making that comparison because the people were never believable. Their personalities changed by the minute ( behaviour may change but the personality you draw that behaviour from is supposed to be more or less a constant).		The disparity between technological advancements created and the competence of the people who created said advancements was too much to justify as simple errors or fear or mistakes... The people doing the supposedly brilliant engineering work were outright morons. 		The depiction of the corporate arm of the military industrial complex and the tech arm of the military industrial complex was way too unrealistic specially in their interdepartmental dealings. The basic dynamics of how the business was run was too much of a leap to believe. 		The CGI work was alright but it wasn't something spectacular either. The atmosphere they created wasn't appealing specially not when coupled with particular aspects of the story being told.		The movie had an uneven pace, parts to which an 8 year old me might have exclaimed 'that's cool' were way too often and stretched out, and parts that had any significance to the story were almost glossed over as unimportant. 		The acting was meh at best, but what can an actor do when the direction is a jumble from scene to scene and the characters have no real motivations. 		For a good movie the premise can be as ridiculous as you like, but when you decide your universe your movie has to follow the laws of that universe you established. A sign of a bad movie is one where they keep inventing the universe to resolve the conflict they themselves created. This movie is very guilty of this 'moving the line' behaviour.

{"body":"Can you explain some of the criticism you're leveling? You said Chappie was not really a drama but I thought it had some fine dramatic moments. The evolution of the relationship between Chappie and his two "parents" was very interesting and pretty well developed and when Ninja felt guilty for tricking Chappie near the end I felt that was actually earned. The drama worked for me, and the acting helped it along. Did you not buy the character growth? What bits did you have a problem with dramatically speaking?		And you said it's not quite action. Do you mean action in terms of something like Transformers or Pacific Rim? I can see how they could have amped up the action even further, but I thought Chappie had a lot of tense and action packed moments. Did some scenes just not work for you or did you just want more?		I also don't understand what you mean when you say "it wasn't quite SciFi". It was absolutely science fiction in both the casual "oh cool, robots!" sense and in the big ideas philosophical sense concerning transhumanism and technology as a tool for a police state. I agree with you that some of the stuff at the company was a little janky in terms of how they ran their business, but this movie is text book science fiction.

{"body":"You swine. You vulgar little maggot. Don't you know that you are pathetic? You worthless bag of filth. As we say in Texas, I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.		You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you. You are a bloody nardless newbie twit protohominid chromosomally aberrant caricature of a coprophagic cloacal parasitic pond scum and I wish you would go away.		You're a putrescence mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.		You are a bleating fool, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.		I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?		If you aren't an idiot, you made a world-class effort at simulating one. Try to edit your writing of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.		You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.		You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.		And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?		You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.		On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.		I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.		The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

{"body":"> The bad guys aren't just out for the count in one punch.		While this is an overused meme, the idea that your fight goes on and on forever and stylistically is even more unrealistic.		I've actually watched a guy get knocked out in one punch in real life. He was some idiot shooting his mouth off, then getting physically aggressive with some guy who actually boxes as a hobby. He tries to go at him - the boxer guys knocks him down with one hit and he's out.		The problem with movie fights, in my opinion, is not that people are out in one punch, that's realistic. It's that they're predictably and safely out in one punch if they're minor characters, then magically it's an extended fight scene if they're major characters. In real life it seems to be pretty unpredictable, one guy dies from getting punched once, another guy gets shot 15 times and keeps on coming.","depth":4,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RedPill115","name":"t1_cslghdu","parent_id":"t1_csldeam","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435509257,"created_utc":1435505657}

I suppose it's not expected for most actors to put in the same amount of time Hayden Christiansen and Ewan McGregor put in their final fight scene in SW ep 3. They practiced much that a lot of the choreography wasn't broken up so often by a camera change, nor was the camera ridiculously close  that you couldn't see what they were doing.

Even if the scene is super choreographed and not believable in real world situations...it is 10x more entertaining to watch the scene from one angle.		It's why I prefer many Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li movies. They are impressive martial artists...but watching their scenes from a typical one angle really shows off their speed and accuracy despite unrealistic choreography.

"THE MATRIX SEQUELS SUCKED BECAUSE LANA WACHOWSKI IS KINKY AND TRANS".		I was trying to highlight that maybe there is so truth to it. Sense8 was... bad. Just as a show, it was bad. It was slow and disjointed and all over the place with the tone it was trying to set, and I believe that in part that was due to the way that the issue of trans/gay rights and sexuality was forced into some of the episodes. That's not to say that a TV show can't or shouldn't address those (they certainly should), and I'm also personally not turned off by on screen displays of sexuality be it straight, gay, trans, whatever. But maybe make it natural and non grandstandey? It kinda detracts from the story you're telling if one episode has characters naturally discussing their lives and progressing their arcs, when the surrounding ones make you feel like you're being preached at. And it just so happens that the out of place feeling so obviously seemed to coincide with the episodes that were billed as being directed by The Wachowskis. Other episodes managed to keep all the bits of the characters in place, discuss their issues, and tell the story of the series.		So maybe there is some merit in the argument that the Matrix sequels were bad in part because of Lana's influence on them, if Sense8 is also bad for a similar reason?

The vision did a U-turn, the technology was fine, the vision was bullshit.		They had the big flaw so many directors/writers get. One success and the follow up absolutely has to be bigger and better.

{"body":"I think it's a great scene. It's fun, and that's what the movie is supposed to be. What really bothers me is that everyone compares The Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings movies, which is understandable, but besides the stories taking place in the same universe, stylistically, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have pretty much nothing in common. 		If you've read The Hobbit, you'll notice that there is almost no detail in the book. It's almost entirely "The dwarves did this, and then they did this, and then they did this, and then they did this, now Bilbo is singing a song, and then the dwarves did this." It's nothing like the Lord of the Rings, where Tolkien spends 50 pages talking about a leaf. 		The Hobbit was meant to be a children's book, and the movie was as well, which is why a lot of the humor is silly, and why I believe they decided to overload it with so much CG, vs using makeup in the Lord of the Rings films. I think it would have been deemed too 'scary' for young children to watch, and it would have gotten a harsher rating. 		I think the Hobbit movies were a lot of fun. They are nothing like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and people need to get over that. There is absolutely nothing Peter Jackson could have done to the Hobbit films that everyone would have been satisfied with. 		Yes, he took creative liberties, adding in a few details such as a love story, but I think that love story is important, as it makes Kili and Fili stand out from the other dwarves. It makes the viewer feel more emotion when they end up the way that they do. It sets them apart from the other dwarves, and if you've noticed, the dwarves that don't really have a "trait", blend in together and are completely forgettable. Again, that's not Peter Jackson's fault, because in the books, it's pretty much the exact same thing. 		I think the Hobbit films are great, and people are overly critical of them because they don't understand the themes in The Hobbit so they were expecting something different,  and that because LotR is held to such a high standard, anything Peter Jackson makes will always be compared to those films, and never be as good.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NotVeryGoodAtStuff","name":"t1_csll6kw","parent_id":"t1_csla24b","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435519214,"created_utc":1435515614}

Edit: given that legolas was supposed to be like super good at what he did, and he was old, you could probably put him at level 10 at the very least. If you roll an 18 for dex (not even point buy, which could get it higher) you get +2 for being an elf, +2 from leveling, and he'd probably wear some enchanted gear that gave him at least +1. If he didn't and he was the son of the king (right?) then he obviously took points out of int in order to pad his stats.  	At 25 you'd have a +6 or +7 modifier (its late) and your AC would be 10+6 or 7+level bonus+whatever his armor gives him (+4 easily).

{"body":"Half OGRE, or Half Orc?  I don't know Half-Ogre off the top of my head, so I looked it up and saw one version that had a level adjustment of +1, which means a level 1 half ogre is effectively level 2.		Let's say you were 22 STR (+6), and that your character is Large (instead of Medium).  A greataxe (3d6 damage, crit 20/x3 in the large version) is a two handed weapon. So the most damage you could deal would be 18 * 3 + 9, or 63 damage.  If your DM screwed up and multiplied the 9 by 3 as well then that gets you to 81 damage.		I guess I neglected your class because you didn't say it; you mentioned rage so I'll assume Barbarian.  Rage gives you +4 STR, so +3 damage with a 2H weapon.  That increases you to 66 damage, or 90 damage with "wrong math"		So there's no way a level 1 character at LA+1 with 26 STR dealt 120 damage in one hit without either DM fuckery, DM fiat, or a blatant misunderstanding of the rules.  It would have had to have involved.  I would imagine it involved you using power attack and they didn't realize that it is capped at BAB, AND they multiplied it in with the crit damage by accident?		Let's say, and again, I'm misinterpreting the rules here and using DM fiat:  That you have a Large Greataxe with 22 STR and Rage (26 STR), So that's +12 damage from STR.  This should be 3d6+12, 20/x3, and that we'll misinterpret Power Attack and allow you to take an absurdly high -10/+10 (which, again, you shouldn't be able to do until level 10), and we'll also misinterpret how to apply damage (i.e. - we'll mistakenly add everything before multiplying), so that brings us to (3d6 + 12 + 10) x 3 = 40 * 3 = 120.		So yeah, getting to 120 damage as a large level 1 with LA+1 and 26 STR required me to misinterpret how a feat works and how damage multipliers work.		**Obligatory disclaimer**: As much as I drone on about "rules" and "math", so long as the group is having a good time, the rules are more like "guidelines" any way.  The fun of playing and the stories and memories you take away from it are what really matter, even if copious amounts of fuckery were involved :)  Any good DM should be willing to bend the rules a bit if it makes for a good story.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChickinSammich","name":"t1_cslgpz9","parent_id":"t1_csla928","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435509808,"created_utc":1435506208}

It's not only the ridiculous technics in this though - the scene covers so many dumb tropes, it's just sickening. 			Orks are warriors but for some reason their training and arrows go the way of the Stormtroopers' laser beams - everywhere but into the bodies of the protagonists who are in a severe case of (trope sin #2) story induced immortality. Jackson shows his lazy side there: having immortal characters and a heap of cannon fodder enemies, he can concentrate on what he believes is "good old action" while not forgetting how innovative he deems himself. 		He can totally cut out suspense and every bit of cinematic dignity without it ruining the protagonists' chance for success - the story already stands; Jackson trades said dignity for a 12 year old boy's idea of action, which turns out to be cheapest slapstick.

That's why people love watching him. 		And part of what makes watching Jackie Chan so cool is that it takes him hundreds of attempts to get the shot right.  CGI is lackluster because it carries with it the idea that it was right the first time because CGI characters cant make mistakes.  Legolas is inhumanly perfect in his fight on the river and makes no mistakes.  Sure he's an elf, but because 90% of his movements are CGI we cant even associate it with him being elf; it's because he's a computer image.

{"body":"That is the good part.		It is not Robocop one. It is a stand alone story. It cant be Robocop one. And that is why it is awesome. Murphy himself said the only difference between then and now is that now we do have the technology.		Old Robocop didn't even have wifi. Now we have google glass, all of the world's information in the tip of our fingers, there are thousands of apps doing really important stuff. People with no legs can run faster than people with legs and people control limbs with the power of their mind.		The Beretta M93R as bad ass as it looks constantly jams.		Anyways.		I refused to watch the new one based on the trailer.		I loved in the first one how a major subplot was Robocop's conflict with his past. He stalked his wife and his wife freaked out and complained to the police department. So Murphy even though he suffered from flash backs, lied to her and told her he is just a homage to her husband and not her husband. OUCH!!!		That whole part was visibly left out, as seen in the trailer from the "You have to to talk to your son" scene. These few seconds got me to stay away from the movie for a long time.		Also I didn't like the fact that Robocop superjumps when in the original he was trying to come in touch with his humanity and wanted to move but was limited.		So then I saw the movie...and I was mind blown.		To start and get it out of the way. The Jesus parallelism is not there to begin with. And thats ok. Its not the 80s anymore. Not every movie has to be a Jesus parallelism.		Motherfucker: "We allow drones to fly above Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan yet we freak out when they fly above our airspace". BAM! This movie just called you out on your values and your hypocrisy.		Then, you got Robocop's back story. I loved how perfectly damn well they explained **WHY ROBOCOP** was created and how Birdman pushed him to become a hero and a symbol to pave the way for drones and his technology to take over. Realistic and good story telling. Instead of just "Mwah...I want to take over the world mwahaaaaa!!!" this actually makes tons of sense.		In the original franchise, one of my favourite parts was the scene where the other prototype robots commited suicide. It is just humour but it was explained that only Muprhy was virtuous enough to cope with the fact that he is a fucking robot. 		The remake, expanded on this. I lost my shit when I saw this. [Literally just brain and lungs](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/front-media/assets/08/b7/86/94/RoboCop_disassembled_472.jpg). Now we all know why a robot man would actually want to kill itself. 		The movie was visually beautiful and the photography poetic. Most scenes show how biology and technology compliment each other. It starts when he looks at his hands. One human one robot. Then he freaks out and he starts running.		[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpj6Yotdxtg) First though a long assembly line were numerous people assemple stuff in rows, then he jumps a fence and runs through numerous people collecting veggies or whatever in rows. Scenes like these tell me that it deserves a second viewing to see what I may have missed on.		Then...they download a database into his brain. And he freaks out. So they pump him full of drugs and his humanity sleeps. And that is the cool part. His voice becomes so robotic and calm.		But then when he gives orders or shouts...oh man it is amazing. Robocop's angry voice is amazing. Robotic, calm but firm. One of the best voices in cinema. 		This movie paid so much attention to detail. Explained everything perfectly, and it is a true Robocop movie. [Watch how his humanity takes over in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRm5lpY9wK4).		Both the old one and the remake are awesome. And that is coming from someone who really wanted to hate the remake.

{"body":"I think hes talking more about believably when he compares those shots of both hulk films. While allot of cgi heavy modern films tend to do things in dark environments where you can't really familiarize yourself with the location. The San Francisco (not sure if it even is) shot in the first hulk movie makes it more believable, you see something you can relate to, a world which you're kind of familiar with. You get what you film. But in Modern CGI movies studios go out of their way to beautify every shot as much as possible that by the end of the movie, or a few more that do the same stuff, you'll lose your interest in it allot more faster. Like... Like there isn't much originality in cinematography/on screen effects today because you've already seen it all, you've already seen the opening shot that zooms out and reveals a mans face, you've already seen the invasion shot with hundreds of buildings on smoke and on fire. 		Back with 90's cgi, it felt new and fresh because it would be that bit of the movie you'd look forward to, that epic moment where this unreal thing is going to happen, and you'd let it slide because its just such a badass moment in the movie. But if you fill your entire movie with perfect chaos, perfect photogenic destruction, flawless action, flawless movement, and so on, it's just going to grow very stale fast. Some people may put up with it longer than others, but i assume to allot of people who are fans of old cinematography, vfx, and cgi use, it just looks like you're getting constant overdoses of perfection that just makes it ridiculously unbelievable because nothing is this perfect, nothing flows this fantastic, they make it too unrealistic, impossible to relate to, and that's what i think is what made pre cgi overdosed  movies so great.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ZappaBappa","name":"t1_cslbjq0","parent_id":"t1_csl6gk1","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435493125,"created_utc":1435489525}

As to the orcs and barrels thing, we have years and years of fantasy films that existed before CGI and a lot of them still have more impact, even when the effects are now pretty dated, like say the original Conan film.","depth":3,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HowAboutShutUp","name":"t1_csla51p","parent_id":"t1_csl9xtf","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435485913,"created_utc":1435482313}

You know what did draw me out?

Are you just saying that off the top of your head without actually revisiting past blockbusters? If so you should revisit them. You're just not remembering how fake a lot of them looked. (And you should look at the budgets adjusted for inflation.)		These films didn't have budget constraints and they still had a lot of bad effects. Hook - decent movie, huge budget, TONS of fake looking shots. Brosnan-era James Bond - decent movies, huge budgets, TONS of fake looking shots. Howard the Duck - not so great movie, huge budget, TONS and tons and tons of really bad effects. Twister - okay movie, massive budget, TONS of fake looking shots. Lost in Space - huge budget, totally fake-looking from beginning to end. Air Force One - good movie, huge budget, TONS of really bad early CG shots. Mortal Combat - oh man the CG is godawful. Independence day - decent movie, massive budget and some of the fakest-looking CG action sequences ever put to film. Congo - terrible movie, huge budget, oh man it looked bad.

{"body":"I think the guy was stressing believability over realism. He was saying that emotional connection is severed by things being polished so much that it breaks suspension of disbelief. I would consider Avatar to be outside of that criticism for the simple fact that it was made to be visually stunning. I didn't really go into Avatar expecting to find a ton of familiar environments, and this verdant, lush world of Pandora was entirely new to me, so believability wasn't severed due to the film not lining up with my familiar reality. 		The guy's point doesn't hold to every film, particularly in regards to science fiction. When an entirely alien setting is introduced to people, they have to accept the new rules, stated or unstated, of that setting, and it's a pretty easy transition for well-produced films. Avatar stuck with its rules and everything about the film hold up much better for it.		Compare that to the new Hobbit films. To begin with, they're entirely tonally inconsistent with the grittier Lord of the Rings trilogy, which can be argued for due to the fact that the Hobbit is a children's book, but Peter Jackson specifically structured the Hobbit films as prequels to LotR, which means that, even if the tone is lighter, the rules of the setting had to be the same, and they weren't. If the Fellowship had escaped the mines of Moria the way that the dwarves escaped Goblin Town, they would have been killed by the rules established by Lord of the Rings whereby you can't survive someone as big as the Great Goblin falling on you from several stories. Immersion broken.		On top of that, the dwarves are stated in the first film to be "not thirteen of the best, nor brightest," yet they fight harmoniously like they're a well-oiled machine. Immersion broken again.

Wether it's good or bad does not matter, as long as we know it is not real. Then we say in our brains : ok it's not real, but i want to read the story.		3 - emotions are triggered by the content, not by the suspension of disbelief itself ...		4 - that the street is darker with new CGI is not only because they can, but also because it fits to the universe created by the director. He could also have filmed a shot in daylight with smokes and flames. Another irrelevant point...		5 - wether Hulk looks super detailed or not so detailed has no effect on how we perceive it as real or not, it's still a big green thing which we see in a movie. Unless one has a severe disorder where he cannot separate reality from fiction, this is exactly the type of things which will trigger the suspension of disbelief, and let us delve into the fiction, whatever the quality of the CGI is.		6 - the only effect this new CGI can actually have is make us dislike old movies because they look less realistic, making it harder to suspend our disbelief, because it's "OBVIOUSLY fake", rather than "almost real" in  most modern movies, which tricks us even more easily to delve into it.		o7	my 2 cents ...","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"luckyjoe83","name":"t1_cslabxt","parent_id":"t1_csl6h5w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435486871,"created_utc":1435483271}

There are some shots in Empire (the cut away of Yoda on the log as Luke goes into the cave,) that look damn near real.		There's a lot of hate for this video, and while he's dead wrong on some reasons the core idea is true. Real things don't trigger our sense of the uncanny Valley. When you layer fake things on top of real things, your brain does not fully disconnect. It's easier to fake an element of a scene rather than the entire scene. That's why in Empire you can accept that Luke is in a swamp and get over the puppet, while the Yoda scenes in the prequels look like hot turds in spite of the technical wizardry going on. 		Let's face it, artists and cgi are still not at a level that bridges the uncanny valley. It's all about knowing what can work at the moment. Right now, cgi still struggles with rendering soft surfaces perfectly: that's why movies like District 9 hold up so well, the aliens are hard and scaly, while things like Tron: Legacy's Clu look off even in a still frame.  		Artists just need to rein it in a bit. Special effects in the past were all about pushing the limits as much as they could -- but there were still limits to shots. Those boundaries pushed people to be creative and clever with solutions. Now, with rendering suites advanced enough, you have kitchen sink solutions like the opening shot of Revenge of the Sith, where they go senselessly overboard and unfortunately end up a bit out of their depth in terms of convincing realism.		I love me some good fucking cgi when it's done right! Just too many movies do not use it in convincing ways.

{"body":"The gist of what the video is saying is correct. I work in VFX and have done so for more than a dozen years now. As VFX artists we strive to make the best possible shots. Often, we make them as perfect as possible. That means if we put a CG character into a scene, we want that character to look as good as possible. If it's a real world scene, then the *starting point* for the lighting on that character is going to be to match the lighting of the scene. Then from there it will often start to stray from what would look totally real. Why? Because the CG character is art, and we want people to see that art. We want people to see the little details in the face, so we add a little extra light here and there and everywhere to add just the right amount of rim light and fill light so that all the details we want people to see . That way the audience knows how much work went into making this art. Except now you have this character that is lit by maybe 20 extra little virtual lights in the scene that didn???t exist in the footage as it was shot. So it just doesn't quite fit in. It just doesn't quite add up and your lizard brain knows it. When you have an all-CG shot, this multiplies tremendously. Now we need to see the details over here and the details over there. A little kick here on this tree or light post or whatever, another rim light over there. Let???s see more detail in those trees. Let???s bring up the shadows, etc. etc. Now creatively this all has purpose. This can make for gorgeous images. It's just that when you or I walk down the street we don't have 50 invisible lights around us lighting everything so perfectly. And like the video OP posted suggests, your brain knows the difference, and it makes it a bit less believable. Instead of looking at the big picture and the overall sense of how real everything looks and how it serves the story, we often just make the most beautiful images we can on a per shot basis with the end result being that all the extra pieces we???ve thrown in to make it perfect actually add up to a lesser sum as a whole.","depth":0,"score":30,"ups":30,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"echoesLA","name":"t1_csl9toe","parent_id":"t3_3bdi7w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435484412,"created_utc":1435480812}

{"body":"3am, here goes nothing.		I've been having this argument with my friends over the new Jurrasic Park movie. No spoilers to follow, I promise. While I was entertained as hell, the dinosaurs and environments never sparked my imagination or really delivered like the old films.		My argument is this: Older movies, while they are backed by the power of nostalgia, also utilized models and as the video states, simpler computer animation. In the real world, contrast, saturation (in both color and value) are nothing like we see in movies today. With the use of models (which had actual light reflecting off of them), there's a layer of reality that is simply missed in many of today's effects. While I think the Hulk comparison is by far the most jarring example in this debate, I must say that old puppet yoda feels vastly more real than cgi yoda. In addition, I have to say that the dinosaurs in JP 1+2 feel incredibly more real than in the JP3. That being said, the movements and screen captures were far less advanced than today. Movement is a huge part of conveying reality and in real life, our movements are much more quirky and less fluid than what is shown on the big screen.		In all it's a double edged sword. I also want to say that I am in no way condemning CGI. The fact that most superhero movies now utilize a custom built cityscape for nearly every shot is simply astounding and is so well done.

I think the point you are trying to make might have more to do with home media which is relatively low resolution. For instance, in the scene in Jurassic Park when the characters see their first live dinosaur, the  Brachiosaurus. On VHS and DVD the Brachiosaurus' detail blends very well with it's actual surroundings but when shown in theaters it has a stark lack of detail compared to the surroundings. However, like the video asserts, I was still able to suspend my disbelief because of the real foreground and background elements which match shots without any computer elements in it. Shots that are entirely CGI, which happened a lot in Avatar and Star Wars Ep. II and III don't look like they belong in the same movie as shots with actual elements in the frame.

That's why something like Mad Max worked so well, I think.

Just throwing more processing power to do more realistic lighting isn't enough. Why do CG scenes seem to clean and glossy? It's not because it's that way on purpose, it's because making things seem gritty and realistic requires more attention to detail, and that's not currently limited by computing power, it's limited by artistic ability. When everything is CG it's entirely on the artists to have the attention to detail to fill in all the gaps to make a believable scene, and that's both very hard to do, and very expensive.

{"body":"I do think there are definite problems with both CGI and animatronics. Many people talk about animatronics like this is the nist realistic thing possible, but most examples give very unrealistic and jagged movement, which in my opinion breaks my suspension of disbelief 		If you take a look at for example robocobs robotic enemy, Enforcement Droid Series 209, you see that his movements are incredibly jagged, even for a robot. A similar situation is movie the Fly, where Jeff Goldblum (the legend) transforms into a fly. This is very impressive technology and I'm by no means calling it bad, but the animatronic movement is present even here.		Similarly CGI can be overused and create a messy and unrealistic scenarios. Like in the The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies, where the invasion looks like a giant mess of cartoon characters hitting each other.		To create a better movie, or at the least more realistic, a combination of the CGI and real sets/animatronics is essential.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThunderCake27","name":"t1_csl8lgb","parent_id":"t3_3bdi7w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435479313,"created_utc":1435475713}

{"body":"there are several flaws in this argumentation :		1 - nothing proves that rating decreases because CGI is worse or too good (lol), many factors occur, and maybe the actual quality of the movie (scenario, acting... ?) could be the main reason ?		2 - suspension of disbelief occurs when we interract with a fictionnal product : a book, a movie, a computer game. Wether it's good or bad does not matter, as long as we know it is not real. Then we say in our brains : ok it's not real, but i want to read the story.		3 - emotions are triggered by the content, not by the suspension of disbelief itself ...		4 - that the street is darker with new CGI is not only because they can, but also because it fits to the universe created by the director. He could also have filmed a shot in daylight with smokes and flames. Another irrelevant point...		5 - wether Hulk looks super detailed or not so detailed has no effect on how we perceive it as real or not, it's still a big green thing which we see in a movie. Unless one has a severe disorder where he cannot separate reality from fiction, this is exactly the type of things which will trigger the suspension of disbelief, and let us delve into the fiction, whatever the quality of the CGI is.		6 - the only effect this new CGI can actually have is make us dislike old movies because they look less realistic, making it harder to suspend our disbelief, because it's "OBVIOUSLY fake", rather than "almost real" in most modern movies, which tricks us even more easily to delve into it.		o7 	my 2 cents ...","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"luckyjoe83","name":"t1_cslafjn","parent_id":"t3_3bdi7w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435487376,"created_utc":1435483776}

This isn't necessarily a CGI thing - bad directing, poor editing, off dialogue, can all do this.

{"body":"Tying in movie review scores and cherry picking only specific shots that support his point didnt really help sell the video to me, however his point is still very valid. I came to the same conclusion.		In the 90s CGI was extremely difficult and they were desperate just to get it to look like it fit in the scene. Most failed badly but those that succeeded still look good today. The difference is that back then their main priority was to get the scene to match, while today the priority is to make it look pretty/cool. 		Ends up making every scene look like some piece of art rather than something that is real. The technology has improved significantly, its the usage that needs some work now.		A recent good example is Jurassic Park and World. Clearly the CGI of World is technologically superior. The textures are infinitely better, the way light shines and reacts on skin, the animation, the overall subtlety, everything. But World still ends up looking more fake because instead of just worrying about getting the lighting to match what was filmed, modern CGI houses are worrying about:		Making sure the key light is at the exact perfect angle to highlight the muscles just right, at the perfect intensity so that you can see every scale without them getting too overblown, the fill light is also at the perfect angle to show the silhouette of the back leg, the back light is at the exact angle to make sure the arm stands out from the body, and the extra lights are in the perfect location to make sure you can see the shine in the eyes without hiding the pupils. Now let's up the contrast to make it really pop and give it complementary colored lighting to really make it exciting for the eye. 		It ends up looking really beautiful, and fake as hell. Like an art project. They have *too much* control.		Combined with modern popular cinematography that has largely abandoned more natural looking light and colors for higher contrast and oversaturation, even the real assets captured in camera end up looking fake.

{"body":"A large reason of why CGI has a tendency to look weird compared to how things used to be is largely technology driven but... not for the reason you would expect. 		Movies are a massive industry -- much more massive than they were even 15 years ago. Hollywood films have budgets that is more than the GDP of some small countries. No one wants to lose that money and so everything must be approved.		Digital imaging technology has come such a long way. We can tweak the way the pores on the skin are laid out, change the color of a car in a scene easily, digital enhance someone's performance. We have the ability to change and make anything we want to. That level of creative power is unprecedented.  		So what happens when you combine the ultra-decision consciousness and micromanagement of the Hollywood film system with the power and flexibility of modern digital imaging technology? 		A clustefuck.		In between the guys who do the VFX and the directer you can have 10 separate people (or more) who feel the need to give input and approve even the smallest detail. 		Lets say you are doing a scene where a car gets blown up and shot off screen. In order for your shot to be approved and used it needs to go compositer -> team director -> VFX studio head -> assistant production designer -> production designer -> directer -> producer -> producers teenage son. Each person will want their input and the further you get in the chain the less knoweldge of VFX they have.  A simple shot that could be done well in 3 weeks ends up taking half a year and is overworked and completely weightless. 		SFX used to be so expensive and difficult that they were often one-shot deals that required months (if not years) of planning. What you got is what you got because the directer just had to trust that the SFX team knew what they were doing -- and they often did. 		They still do.

There are of course uses of cgi for the very fact you can't make these shots physically (or only at great expense - such as space or high altitude city/scenery shots).		But I think the fact cgi is pushed beyond what we as an audience can believe is physically possible with a camera, is a large part of the paradox of the underwhelming quality of modern cgi that is undeniably better than anything we had in the past.		On the extras of Wall-E there is a very interesting mini documentary, where the animators took lessons from 'real world' lighting technicians and talked with directors of photography about the physicality of lenses.

{"body":"Really, there is a MAJOR secondary effect to CGI that has ruined movies: it enables lazy writing and crappy stories.		It used to be the case that if someone was at the top of a building that was being attacked, the writers would have to write the characters down or off the building, they would need something in the story that made sense in the face of the attack, and flowed in with the rest of the course of the movie.		Now, with CGI, they can just do anything. So instead of being creative, they can just say, "Well, the building falls down around them, and they surf the rubble down and just walk away from it." That actually happens in a Transformers movie.		It happens all the time in films now. A bomb goes off near someone? They just dodge all the shrapnel, but we "believe" that they do because we see a slow motion shot of all of the shrapnel barely missing them as they duck and roll. And, of course, one piece of shrapnel flies right into the camera to sell 3D TV's.		Much of the Avengers movie was scattered unintelligible crap flying by for this very reason. Whole subplots like Iron Man restarting the engine don't even have to make sense or be consistent ... they just have to show him bouncing around, and then being stuck, and then straining, and then some near-impossible sequence that resolves it, and whoosh the scene is done.		The other place this happens is in the James Bond movies, where they try to show hyper-impressive glass screen touch computer interfaces. They pack *so much* stuff into it, with every little bit of the UI moving or flashing, swiping, sliding, reacting, with details packed in to every corner, pages of text flying by, **way** overdone effects of digital glitching in videos, or pictures progressive-scanning in, it is just a visual assault. No UI would every be like that. I can look at it for 2 seconds and see that is nonsense, and it clearly done out of forcing detail in.		There's that joke: "If 1 bouillon cube makes it good, then 12 must make it GREAT! 12 times as great!". That's what has been done with special effects.		I'd say that Pan's Labryinth is an excellent counter to this. Not too overdone on the effects, mixed with lots of real prop effects, and it all works super well.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"apullin","name":"t1_csljwtj","parent_id":"t3_3bdi7w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435516624,"created_utc":1435513024}

{"body":"There are factors mostly apart from CGI also which cause as much, or more problems.		Directorial choices are ruining movies for me more than the believability if CG effects.		The video touched on "the uncanny valley" but for environments; where previously we had mostly talked about it relative to characters.  He's not wrong.  I don't think it's entirely responsible for a drop in quality of movies.  Budget allocation may be more responsible.		Directors are racing to make their movie more dynamic and more action packed than the last big hit.  They've abandoned some old videography concepts like Line of Action.  It used to be a rule that you never broke unless you wanted to really jarr the audience.  It was used to create confusion and disorientation.  These days the audience blinks around the scene like night crawler on cocaine.		Couple this with middling quality CG.  Directors can cut shits quickly to try and disguise CG effects which you will identify as "off".		Now add in a pinch of computer generated camera effects, or even real camera effects which are unique to cameras and not the human eye.  Motion blur, and depth of field are not effects that occur in the human eye.  The simulate attention switching that your brain does because the detailed area in your field of view is actually only about as big as your fist at arms length.  And then consider that these effects also help disguise CG graphics shortcomings.		And having said all of that the biggest problem of all is, CG extravaganza movies are made to be the culinary equivalent of sitting down and eating a pound of chocolate.  Everyone likes chocolate, but after a little bit it's less exotic than the first bite, and soon it's sickening.

When you see, for example, city in flames in The Hobbit, you see fire all over the place. You've probably noticed that if something is really hot, it both distorts the way light travels through air and causes turbulences, so you should have image that isn't sharp, and dances around. Instead, we see that perfectly still sharp image of the scene, in ultra HD resolution.		However, taking something like this into account right now would probably break the rendering computers. The black hole scenes in Interstellar took curved light paths into account, but that was just a couple of scenes, and a non-random curving was involved. And still, it took them way more computer power to get it done properly.		So, the problem is, that we don't see the physics we should and expect to see in the CGI.

{"body":"Interesting argument and I don't disagree. But, let me play devil's advocate for a moment...		I think a lot of it as more to do with the fact that directors and screen writers have become lazy. They've started to depend more on CGI to carry a movie.		Take the latest Transformers movie... Transformers: Age of Extinction. It was awful. The story was completely disjointed and incomprehensible and the characters were two dimensional. The editing was poor and the only thing that the movie seemed to care about was big explosions and CGI.		Of course it's going to feel "less real". When an audience can't empathize or related to the characters on the screen...or the plot is completely lacking in cogency... yes, those things are huge factors to unrealism.		Take another movie that in which the scenes were almost entirely CGI... Gravity. Most of us have never been to space, right? The movie was entirely dependent on CGI and locations in which people had no experience, right? Even the situation where the (spoiler alert) (#s Space Shuttle and Hubble telescope) are destroyed is unrealistic. Yet, the script was brilliant and the characters were relatable. So, the audience was able to suspend their disbelief more easily.		The more and more I think about, the more I think this video is off base. I think it has more to do with a lack of creativity in Hollywood and less to do with the CGI itself.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AccountCre8ed","name":"t1_cslc92h","parent_id":"t3_3bdi7w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435496458,"created_utc":1435492858}
{"body":"Really cool video. But also I think film is art like any other and there isn't any one right way. I think the key thing is that this thing he talks about is just super popular right now and kinda unecessary in a lot of cases.  In some cases it is great because you want to  feel something magical. For instance it is fun to look at Frouds art and not just get all huffy and critical over how unrealistic it actually is and how photography would be better.  But at the same time I don't think everything needs to be super detailed colorful fantasy art either.  		Anyways. Cool video and it makes sense.  I think a lot of film makers are trying really hard to show people something they havent seen before.  A lot of us really want that. Think of the first time you heard wu tang clan, and the last. the first time you loved Spawn, and then when it was cliche.

{"body":"This guy is just realizing what we knew back in 1998, you know before his claims came to being?  The human mind rejects that which it knows is not real, but will accept it if it is presented in such a way that it is not intended to trick the mind.		Shrek a completely CGI animated film discovered this the hard way when they initially tested Fiona's human form as being too realistic, and it stood out like a sore thumb and looked bad, so they made her more cartoon like and the brain snapped back into place.		This is all human psychology and nothing more, and has been known for a lot longer than since 2008, this was being realized as far back as the early days of special effects.  We've just come far enough to where we can now do full effects instead of small area effects.		And no the reason why the earlier Hulk wasn't using massive backgrounds of CGI vs the newer one wasn't because computers couldn't handle it, they could, Star Wars episode 1 proved that, it is because the cost involved in producing such shots has dramatically come down since 2001.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"3dpenguin","name":"t1_cslh91v","parent_id":"t3_3bdi7w","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435510993,"created_utc":1435507393}
