{"body":"> We all have a favorite big, dumb, fun movie that's loud and raucous and less interested in any thematic depth than in giving us a great time. [...] For me, that movie is and always shall be??Back to the Future,		Considering that the author claims BTTF is his favourite film, he apparently completely misunderstands how intelligent, intentional, and intricate it is. It's not "dumb", and it certainly does have depth.		While BTTF being a perfect film is debatable (it's my favourite film but art is subjective), what I believe is not debatable is that it has a perfect screenplay. 		Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Every word either drives the plot, develops a character, or is comic relief. There is no waste, no fluff. It is perfectly written. It took Zemeckis almost a decade to write, and his dedication clearly shows.		The fact that the author calls it dumb in his first sentence shows a massive misunderstanding of just how well-written it is.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hoodie92","name":"t1_cspnpnp","parent_id":"t3_3btvs9","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435827022,"created_utc":1435823422}

Also, I don't think you saw the same movie as everyone else. Marty spends the first act of the movie taking risks. The opening scene of the movie is Marty cranking Doc Brown's amp beyond what he knows to be safe.

I mean that he was thinking about giving up on guitar because he was afraid people wouldn't like him. He learned to leap out on faith and be himself in that regard. To follow his dreams, even if people don't like them. It was by helping his father in 1955 that he came to understand that.			On seeing his parents in a new light: it certainly does count as a character arc.

{"body":"But I don't think that's true, by the end of the movie his parents are essentially strangers to him and the movie depicts them as being hip and cool rich people as opposed to lame-o poor people. I just think the movie sends a negative message about monetary reward if you look closely. But look, I fucking LOVE this movie. This observation doesn't change that. 		His father took the risk because Marty empowered him to throughout the course of the movie. So if you take a risk you'll be rewarded monetarily. In any case, it was George, not Marty who changes the most. And that brings me to my next point which is that Marty McFly doesn't have to have character arc in the traditional sense. What's great about the movie is that it's his parents who have the arc. It's the people around him. Captain America is the same way. Steve Rogers is pretty much the same person at the beginning of the movie as he is at the end, but it's OK because he has a profound affect on the supporting players.
