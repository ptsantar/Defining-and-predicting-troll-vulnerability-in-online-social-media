It also made Katniss the most unbearable protagonist and I almost stopped reading it as a result. Luckily it started getting good in the second half as all hell breaks loose.		I will be interested to see how much from the book actually makes it in to the final movie, since the last half has quite a few moments that they could easily make a 15 or 18, but since it will be a 12a, I hope they just do some clever camera work to avoid anything nasty, but still keep those moments in there, otherwise that last half is going to be dull too.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Dimnos","name":"t1_cswpuc5","parent_id":"t3_3ckdz3","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1436397048,"created_utc":1436393448}
