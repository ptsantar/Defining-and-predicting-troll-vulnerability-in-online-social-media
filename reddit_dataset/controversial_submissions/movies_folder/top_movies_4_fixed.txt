If we're going financially, then every DC film has been a success bar Green Lantern and Watchmen (if we include that) So that's 4/5 (or 4/6 if including Watchmen) successes, with the 3 Batman's grossing over 2.3 billion and Man of Steel (can't remember exact figure, over 500m for sure) plus whatever it made back via product placement. 		They will now have another 1 billion with BvS and Justice League follows which will surely be another billion maybe. The issue is with ther stand alone films but I see no reason why they won't gross around 500m+, at least with Wonder Woman, Flash, Shazam, Aquaman and Green Lantern.

{"body":"Truthfully no. I love Batman and the DC universe but the whole "Dark and Gritty" formula is tired. Not everything needs to be dark. Films need to adapt. I'm ardently looking forward to BVS but they're pinning a TON on that one film with all of the cameos and build ups, not to mention giving Snyder the keys to the kingdom already. Just because a specific interpretation of a character resonated (Dark Knight trilogy) with audiences, doesn't necessarily mean it'll always do that. Same with Marvel. Marvel has been ridiculously lucky that their mostly lighthearted tone has worked thus far but I feel that's going to change now with Civil War, Ragnarok, Dr Strange and Black Panther. Those are all darker stories/characters if you know the comics and Daredevil proves they can do dark if need be. 		If anything I'm more worried about DC. The bottom is going to fall out soon and people will decide rapidly where to spend their money. Next year alone has two Marvel films, two DC films and three Fox films. The following year has even more. The falling out is coming soon-ish. Marvel will float on because of recognition and the general success of the last decade. Fox may be okay-ish but I feel a lot of people are suffering X-Men fatigue.And don't even start on Fantastic Four with me. (For the record I love the cast and will see it on VOD. Plus Deadpool film finally). DC though. Im not sure... Im still puzzled on why Suicide Squad is coming so soon. Get Wonder Woman out there. Get Jason Mamoa's Aquaman out there. Idk. SS just feels like a strange choice to put out and I feel DC is banking on a Guardians style sleeper hit of sorts. Plus it just feels jumbled. Do we need a separate TV and Film universe? Grant Gustin is fantastic as Flash. I really would love to see him show up in the Justice League films and keep him, Green Arrow and others on TV. And with restrictions now on who can go where according to Arrow producers and actors it seems a bit confusing. 		Regardless! I'll see and support DC's films. Yay superheroes!

Seven films in the universe so far, only one of which hasn't focussed on Wolvie, with four more on the way in the next 18 months (which, admittedly, diversify the fuck out of the franchise ala MCU).

I suppose I should have said there was a fatigue for them. I think for many, including myself, there still is. I personally have grown tired of the halfass efforts of the X-Universe and it really feels like Wolverine and Friends to me. Like I said, I loved First Class and that's probably due to no Wolverine honestly and it was so different from what we had gotten before.		I think DOFP and the announcements of Deadpool/Apocalypse have bought Fox some precious time for Post Wolverine plans. DOFP took an incredibly popular storyline from the comics and, despite butchering it totally, still retained pieces of it and made it compelling enough to make you give a shit about the characters and reboot the universe essentially. Apocalypse is an immensely popular comics line that I'm highly skeptical will be done right but Im remaining cautiously optimistic after hearing Oscar Isaac is Apocalypse. 		And deadpool is well, Deadpool. 		Fox has time bought but not a ton.

{"body":"No offense, but I'm not exactly sure you know what an antihero is. Batman is not an antihero. He is every definition of a hero. A true antihero is a protagonist who doesn't have the usual heroic traits. Batman doesn't kill, defends the innocent, fights for justice. The only antiheroic thing about him is his use of fear, because he wants criminals to think he's an antihero.		Superman will certainly not be an antihero in BvS. Superman is the defining hero in all of fiction. To compromise that any more than they already did in Man of Steel would be a slap to the face to fans and the source material. The trailer indicates that there are a lot of people in the world who don't trust Superman, and it looks really interesting, but we aren't getting antiheroic Injustice evil Supes. 		The Suicide Squad will be antiheroes. The Punisher is an antihero. When we first meet Han Solo, he is an antihero. They're fighting for the "good" side, but are still murderous, deceitful, and their motivations for being good aren't based on morality. Suicide Squad are good because they will be killed if they aren't, The Punisher is good because he just really likes killing bad guys, and Han Solo was only in it for the money until he developed into a hero. 		But to answer your question, I'd say I'm equally excited for Marvel and DC's slate. I love Marvel's proven style, and their schedule has pretty much everything I could want. I'm also really excited to see how DC's plan comes together, and I think they have some great talent on board with their projects. I'm just kind of skeptical because the "dark and gritty" style is simply harder to get right consistently.

It's a bit painful to see how people are treating DC right now. But I feel like they are fighting the same uphill battle as Marvel did years ago when they started out.

{"body":"I'm quite worried about BvS honestly. The progression of the movie has been from a Superman sequel to a movie that's gonna introduce a huge chunk of the cast for Justice League. The casting is extremely suspect too. While I think that Batfleck will do fine or even really well as Batman, Ezra Miller being cast as Barry/Wally makes me angry every time I think about it. 		As for the tone, when movies try to force a super serious tone all the time, especially for heroes that don't have that tone in the comics, it can go really badly. I think a great kinda test run is the animated movie Justice League: War, which I think they'll base the movie off of quite a bit and is how they met in the most recent comics. It had humour, action and was basically how most of the people here describe Marvel. The only hero darker in tone in the Justice League is Batman. The Flash and Green Lantern are very funny and quippy. 		Plus, Marvel can definitely be not so family friendly. There have been some seriously dark stuff that happened in the comics over there. In the movies, I feel like the powers in Marvel have been more realistic as well. Seeing a few aliens and basically godlike beings fighting each other in the Justice League would be cool, but probably pretty similar to Zod vs. Superman in MoS. 		Finally, people have had the wrong idea after watching the Nolan Batman series. Batman in the comics is quite different from that. Also, the dark and gritty tone that was taken in that movie only really works in a Batman movie, in a desolate city like Gotham. If you're going to Metropolis and Superman and trying to have a dark, gritty, violent tone, it's not going to work because it doesn't suit the character. This applies to most of the Justice League I think. I'm definitely someone that loves DC comics, but I just think that people have the wrong idea about DC. In the movies, some of the characters have to be lighthearted and funny, or they won't reflect their comic book selves and not fit into the tone of the movie. And the comic book versions of characters from both Marvel and DC have a stigma of being either super dark and violent or funny and more child-oriented, and those are both frankly wrong.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OblivionCv3","name":"t1_csp8s78","parent_id":"t3_3bs1g1","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435794514,"created_utc":1435790914}

{"body":"Well, I did say "seriously dark stuff happened in the COMICS over there". The movies so far have been more lighthearted, with the good guys winning the day etc. But that's how almost all movies are. Most movies don't end with the bad guys winning, or the main characters dying. One-liners and camaraderie within a team or amongst friends is usually very welcome, at least for me. I loved seeing the Avengers working together so well at the beginning of Ultron. You have to remember as well, that DC has some very light comics too. Not everyone has the whole vengeance/justice boner that Batman has and is consumed by.		For your second point, I think you're right about the Batman thing. It's been dark and gritty, but that's just the character, and one reason that I find that Batman comics get old faster than others. He  rarely does anything but fight crime etc. Superman really wasn't that gritty. Him killing Zod was way out of character, but made alright by the fact that it was out of necessity. That isn't going to happen again. Superman can be and has been complex without having to kill people. MoS was a movie that was made to feel like it was set in the same world as Batman and the world that everyone thinks always has to be dark and serious. But during the movie, while it didn't have much humour, it certainly wasn't hugely violent and it didn't have too much in terms of disturbing visuals reminiscent of The Dark Knight. It was definitely a superhero movie, and I feel like Justice League should take that lighter tone as it adds characters that are themselves; people that quip, shoulder punch, shit grin and say atta boy, as you said.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OblivionCv3","name":"t1_csp9rb0","parent_id":"t1_csp8wjr","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435796246,"created_utc":1435792646}

Also, Snyder blows.  Always has, always will.		I say all this as a longtime comic reader who has read both DC and Marvel for 20+ years.  It's not about one company or another.

{"body":"> it was simply intelligent in a way that demands moody reflection and depth of soul		No, no it was not. Believe me, if it HAD been an intelligent, philosophical take on Superman, it WOULD have been interesting. I like those kinds of stories, about Superman as a god among men, rather than a guy who can punch hard and shoot lasers from his eyes. However, Man of Steel didn't do that. There was only one moment in the movie with any kind of philosophical depth - the scene where Superman kills Zod. It's a scene with a heavy emotional conflict, and I liked it. However, everything leading up to that moment relied too heavily on heavy-handed exposition to set up Superman's values. And AFTER that moment? It's like the movie completely forgot what it just did. Metropolis is rebuilt, Superman's a hero, roll credits. It was too dumb to be an intelligent movie, and too bland to be an action movie. It didn't really require any reflection or deep thought, because there's always some character trying to tell the audience how to feel.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nightmare901","name":"t1_csp8ifv","parent_id":"t1_csp7ax1","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1435794035,"created_utc":1435790435}

It was risky, and visionary, and fresh for the cherry red happy Supes of the past, and they also had superman kill a dude. Big moves, big changes, and it had a smart plot.
