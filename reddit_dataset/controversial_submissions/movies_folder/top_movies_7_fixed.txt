{"body":"I prefer it when science-fiction films don't attempt to explain their entire cinematic and character universe to the audience in one sitting. Since movies are limited in the amount of time they need to focus on the actual plot and character development.		Take "A New Hope" for example. Why is Han hanging out with a Wookie? Why is Obi-Wan knows how to use the force and not the other protagonist? Why Vader so evil? Why is a princess helping out Rebels? A New Hope doesn't answer these questions. Rather it hints that the characters have complex backgrounds, but the focus is on the story being told in the moment.		Trying to fill in every gap tends to make sci-fi patronizing to the audience. Like we wouldn't be able to comprehend that Drax, Gamora, and Rocket all have complex back stories unless we are explicitly shown show. Or that we can't understand political machinations that are going in the background.		I do however agree with the problems you have with Ronan. But only because in the comic-books Ronan is one of the most complex anti-heros in the MCU while in the movies he's pretty one-dimensional.","depth":0,"score":45,"ups":45,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yourthirdbestfriend","name":"t1_cm6e1ei","parent_id":"t3_2mov1n","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1416349271,"created_utc":1416349271}

An example of the later is, as mentioned elsewhere, offhandedly displaying the scars on Rocket's back and his outburst of "I didn't ask to be made!"

{"body":"Trust me, people (myself included) were well aware of these flaws when the movie first came out in theaters. But it was such a fun movie that it's easy to ignore the bad and focus on the good. I think the reason the main characters (with the slight exception to Star Lord) were so "underdeveloped" in terms of actually seeing their backstories is because that would simply take up too much time with this kind of a team movie. So they had to focus on the "now" of the characters and developing them that way, while still giving you at least some idea of where these guys came from. However, I would argue that not really seeing each character's past lends itself to the initial uneasy alliance element of the story. The only character we really relate to at first is Star Lord, and just as he has no idea who these other characters are or where they come from, neither do we, until we learn more about them. 		You're absolutely right that the plot is kind of straightforward and isn't really anything crazy, and Ronan was a really weak (figuratively) villain, no getting around it. However, when you're making a movie about characters and worlds that most people have pretty much no knowledge about, it helps to have a straightforward plot because there is so much stuff that you have to establish. When you think about the movie in comparison to the original Star Wars, apart from the space opera aspect the two are very similar in that the plot is really straightforward (rescue a captured princess, blow up a space station), there is a lot of stuff that's simply talked about that involves several characters (Luke's father, the Clone Wars, the Force, the Empire and Rebellion) but we're never actually shown all that much or given a bigger picture. The only difference is the first Star Wars still has great villains, while Guardians of the Galaxy is sort of lacking any solid villains (Thanos doesn't count because his appearance is so brief, it might as well be a cameo). So we're just sort of along for the ride and given an idea of what this world is like and who these characters are. Then in Empire Strikes Back, when it's already been established who these characters are and what this world is like, the plot gets a little more complicated and interesting, while we also get some great new characters to add to the mix. I imagine and hope the Guardians sequel will be the same way.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ReggieLeBeau","name":"t1_cm6am6k","parent_id":"t3_2mov1n","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1416343421,"created_utc":1416343421}

{"body":"It's not that I don't care about the bad enough to completely ignore it and accept the movie as being "meh". It's just that in this particular movie, I knew what my expectations were and for me the pros of the movie outweighed its flaws, therefore I still enjoy it and think it's a decent movie. If I enjoy a movie and think it's good, even if it isn't a masterpiece, I'm going to defend it, but I'll do it without ignoring its flaws and I'll state what I hope they improve in the future, seeing as how this isn't a one-off movie. Did I not clearly do that? 		I never advocated that we shouldn't be striving towards the best movies we can make. It's just that sometimes you get a movie that seems like it's already going to a mess to begin with and when it doesn't completely fall on its face even in spite of its flaws, it's refreshing. I also wanted to give people some perspective so they don't go around unfairly bashing Guardians without taking into account some movies that suffer the same pitfalls but are more highly regarded. Do I wish the flaws had been switched out for excellent parts? Of course. I'm not going to suggest that we just forgive a movie's flaws but I'm not going to just condemn a movie for it either. It's not like making movies is an exact science. Sometimes you fail in one area and knock it out of the park in another. My point is, there's a difference between having constructive criticism and being completely dismissive of a movie just because it isn't perfect. Yeah, Ronan sucked as a villain, but they also managed to make a talking Raccoon and Tree into fascinating characters that I can believe. If we're going to focus on the obvious wrongs, can we not also focus on what the movie is doing really well?

In his **very first scene** he explains how Xandarian culture does not follow ancient Kree law, even though he feels it should and he wants to force that on everyone else. Since they are unwilling to change he wants to wipe them out. Add to that his vendetta against the Xandarians for involving his family in an unnecessary war that got them killed.

I agree that people having backstories that weren't shown onscreen makes the movie ignore "show, don't tell" but at the same time it avoids too many origin stories. The villain was definitely without menace or personality. The plot was thin as well and the final battle did seem to be a random one that none of the guardians had a stake in. 	It makes me think how much I ignored these issues because I enjoyed the characters playing off each other and the sense of play in a lot of scenes but that's  really vague and could easily be applied to alot of blockbusters. I don't like Thor's sense of play because they're all beautiful people, maybe I like this more because they're all misfits.

{"body":"*Let's start with rocket. Now, lots of people had expectations that his character would be some wise-crackin one-liner machine who gloriously blasted his guns around as a general menace. Why did they think this? Because that's what he does in his 12 seconds of trailer time (remember advertising is meaningless, folks!). But what makes the character work in the movie itself is that he has an actual psychology. Through his interactions, we see that rocket is basically damaged goods. A well-worn product of torture and experimentation, someone who not only feels neglected by the universe, but feels his very existence shouldn't be. Thus, he resents people. He takes advantage of them. And he sure as heck doesn't stick his neck out for them.*		*This has direct ramifications on all his choices in the movie. Simple as it may be, you can clearly see his perspective, which is much more effective than simply seeing his behavior. And with rocket, as many times as his perspective leads to insults, we equally see it lead him to expressing that damaged, vulnerable anger. Thus revealing to us that it's all part of the same psychological trigger for him. That's when you see that the one-liner machine isn't actually  one-liner machine at all. Instead, he's character who is expressing himself. And that's precisely what makes him believable, and in turn becomes the very thing that makes his jokes eventually leap off the page.*		Now, I'm not trying to insult you. But that's just a small sample of Hulk writing about Rocket's character.

{"body":"I loved the movie too, but it was pretty obvious that Ronan's weak character was going to be singled out as a big fault in this film once the honeymoon was over. The villains in this film are so flat that they are completely forgettable. That in and of itself kinda sucks, but I feel like the film has enough charm that collectively, as an audience, we can get over boring villains. It's all set up for Thanos anyway, right?		As a fan of Marvel's cosmic comics, though, holy shit am I disappointed and frustrated with this movie because of Ronan's characterisation. Sure, he started off as a Fantastic Four villain (I think), but he sort of became a hero before the end. There is a moment in the excellent event Annihilation where Ronan turns to Nova and says "were you Kree... I would call you brother" that makes you want to stand up and cheer. It says so much about his character - prideful, yet able to fully recognise the contributions and ability of a human being (whom the kree not only look down upon, but sorta fucked with genetically - if I'm not mistaken, sort of creating mutants in the process? I dunno, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details there). Anyway, Ronan goes through some heavy shit in his life, but by the time Annihilation rolls around, his conviction and willingness to hang on to his principles and core sense of honour and duty in the face of becoming an outcast in Kree society and labelled a traitor speak to a depth of character that few of Marvel's more popular heroes match. In short: he's one of my favourites. In the movie we get a guy who is kind of ambiguously evil because he does like a treaty that somebody signed? But also he sort of works for Thanos, but then not. James Gunn's film, which I totally loved, entirely wasted Ronan. And it sucks all the more because he died.		That all said - the new interpretation of Yondu was great, and took a sort of lacklustre character and made him really awesome... so there is that.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jlisle","name":"t1_cm6qel3","parent_id":"t3_2mov1n","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1416374384,"created_utc":1416374384}

He would have cast Robert Downey Jr. in Sandra Bullock's role and he would have been being a badass up there instead of crying! And it would have been HILARIOUS TOO!

Marvel is changing the world. Their movies are the best, and you're just jealous because you're a DC Fanboy!!! Ahahaha lol!!! rotflmao!!! dc sUCKS!!!		And Ultron is going to be the best movie of the decade! It's gooing to beat Avatar & Titanic combined by 12! You're stupid!!!		Ultron is soooooooooo going to set up Black Panther too !!!! Can't wait. I think there could even be a Guardians of the Galaxy crossover!!! Guardians should just be in every Marvel movie now. 		OMG. How bad is Batman v Superman going to suck???? LOL! DC Sux!!!		And since Panther is pretty much for sure in "Civil War" & probably "Infinity War" as a full Avenger (FUCK YEAH! You're stupid for not likeing Marvel. DC sux), then that means they are almost for sure going to adapt "Return To Wakanda!" FUCK YEAH!!! (I wonder if Marvel will show us Black Panther accepting Everett Ross as Washington, D.C.'s envoy? Or if there are going to change the role to female, to be more diverse?)		Whoever they choose is going to be a badass icrushing it with T'Challa!! Dude, the battles when T-Challa is defending all the different threats to Wakanda like 'Xcon', the band of rogue intelligence agents is going to make Batman look like a BIG fat Puss!		ANd with Xcon is backed up by sorcerer Reverend Achebe that's a PERFECT opening to do a DOCTOR STRANGE CROSSOVER! The timing will be perfect for both characters. Imagine...a Black Panther / Dr. Strange movie???? HOLY SHIT! 		LOL, what is DC going to do....a Cyborg/ Constantine crossover? -- To do that they would have to adapt "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #1" (Prelude) -- And I'm sure DCux would love to, because that's when Batman convinces The Phantom Stranger to bring him to the afterlife so he can question Doctor Light. BUT GUESS WHAT, DCux, U can't because CYBORG is stuck back on Earth-3 getting his Apokoliptical mechanical prosthetics torn from his body & absorbed by Grid the robot!!!! ROTFLMAO!! DC, no black Superhero, Sorcery crossover for you!!		OP is a DC fanboy. Jealous that everybody loves Marvel and Man of Steel BOMBED!! 		Black Panther & Dr. Strange! God, I can't wait!!1!!		DAE have any idea if they are going still have T'Challa nationalize foreign companies to save Wakanda's economy? Because if the movie actually features you know what: "King Solomon's Frogs," with their time-shifting powers then T'-Challa wouldn't NEED to nationalize the foreign companies in Wakanda! ((This movie is totally going to end racism)))		But if they (and when I mean "they" I DO mean either James Gunn or Joss Whedon! Got to be! Either of them direct this, and Black Panther will pass even the Avenger Infinity War films as the biggest movie ever!) Because of course "Ultron", "Civil War, "Infinity 1 & 2" are ALL going to pass Titanic AND Avatar, Marvel should have the top 6 all time grossing movies! And after that, Guardians 2, Capt Marvel, Dr. Strange & The Immortals...and boom! The top 10 grossing movies of all time will be Marvel films!	LOL!!! Batman v Superman is going to BOMB! I bet it doesn't even break 100 million! DC sucks! MARVEL RULZ!	But back to Black Panther...if they DO introduce "King Solomon's Frogs" -- how will they do it? As EVERYONE knows in the comics Black Panther gets them after battling the Ku Klux Klan down in South Africa. Well, since the Klan isn't what it used to be, and Apartheid now gone, what do they do?		**What would make the most sense is for T'Challa to make regular visits to the US and take out racist Cops as Black Panther!! They could even do a real life, emotional tie in ala "Winter Soldier" by like having T'Challa visit Trayvon Martin's grave to pay respects, or(!) some cops could be about to spray paint Michael Browns grave and Black Panther just, swoosh, comes outta nowhere and just kicks the racist cops ass! That would be sooo cool.**	You know "Black Panther 2" is going to revolve around Killmonger. But the question is are they going to intro him in the first movie? In an Avengers movie? Or bring him in with a traditional credits scene. 		(((I don't see why they'd change the original storyline line, because it's perfect; Killmonger defeating Black Panther in ritual combat (can't. wait. to. see. that.) before falling into a coma upon eating the Heart-Shaped Herb.)))		And I would bet anything that it's at the end of Black Panther 2 that *"King Soloman's Frogs"* would set up **"Black Panther 3**" when they create the alternate Black Panther tele-path from the future. Later, when T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, then comes the instability and hallucinations.	The great thing about this story line, is since is has some similarities to "Iron Man's "Devil in a Bottle" series, and since by **Black Panther 3 he will be bigger than Thor or Captain America (who by this time will be played by the Winter Soldier anyway),** this could be an AWESOME CROSSOVER between Iron Man & Black Panther!! 		((((what would make it THE BEST is if before then they made an *Iron Man 4*, and actually did the **"Devil in a bottle"** story line!!!!))))		But T-Challas's instability should actually lead to tribal warfare FOR REAL, ^and ^not ^avoid ^it ^like ^in ^the ^comic. (can you imagine if Joss Whedon directed mass African Tribal warfare, with a crazed Black Panther leading the Wakandan forces! **OMFG!**) From there you can have T-Challa finding out that officer Kasper Cole (Will Smith? Please?) is a distant relation, and therefore can eat the special herb and take over as the next Panther. That would be totally awesome!		(((ALL of this is better than OP DC fanboy's Aquaman movie that's going to drown!!! LOL ROTFLMAO!!!!! ~~Wonder Woman~~(?)		But the original ending would also be totes awesome, with Kasper Cole helping T'Challa to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers! The question then, who would the Avengers be at that point, years down the road?	Personally I don't think the Avengers should be reformed with all new members that late in the game! It will be 2025 or something by then. No, after the just announced phase plays out, I know exactly what Marvel needs to do; instead of The Avengers as their centerpiece----- **make it Squadron Supreme and cast Matt Damon as it's leader Nighthawk, and make that first movie of like, phase** 6 or whatever it will be!

{"body":"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. 		In 7th grade, I took an film trivia test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for film school in my area. 		A cinema terminology test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for cinophiles. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. 		My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is a screenwriter who graduated UCLA. At the age of 15, I understand film better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding Mulholland Dr. He's not particularly successful as a screenwriter, but I've met lots of other people in the industry who aren't as good as me at filmmaking, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. 		I'm also pretty good at film reviewing. I don't have a degree, and other than watching cinema I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of filmmaking than any actual director, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented a tracking shot before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing my own dolly solutions (my first idea being to use a shopping trolley to transmit the camera; admittedly not the best plan). 		I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in /r/movies or /r/flicks or /r/philosophy or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. 		I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a screenplay and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have produced. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. 		I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Michael Bay at the end of filming Transformers II, I would be against preventing him from making further films. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him make more. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. 		I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of filmed sexuality whatsoever (short of pornography acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). 		I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Spike Lee is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. 		I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. 		I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "Sophia Coppola was crap in the Godfather 3" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). 		I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit Interstellar community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. 		All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"heiryiheiryi","name":"t1_cm6iwdw","parent_id":"t1_cm6hv9d","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1416358725,"created_utc":1416358725}

{"body":"THANK YOU!		I didn't see GOTG when it came out in the theater, but I read all the posts here on Reddit, and they were nothing short of "*GOTG is the best movie of the year!*"		Well, after watching the movie myself, I found different issues with it than OP. I wasn't disappointed by the lack of exposition. You don't need to spell everything out. I was actually disappointed by how simplistic and watered down the characters were, how predictable the plot was, and how unimaginative the whole concept was. 		Meaning, this movie followed the cookie cutter layout of a 3 act movie to such a high degree that you can feel each high and low of the storyline before it even happens. The characters were very P.C. It's as if they took Han Solo and castrated him, then gave him a cool CG helmet and called him Starlord. Which is kind of a shame because I was hoping for more edge from that character. (But that could just be my fail at wishful thinking and not understanding the true character. *I'm sure those who've read the comics will correct me on that.*) AND PLEASE STOP WITH THE *BRAVEHEART* / *LOTR*'s RALLY TO ARMS SPEECH! It's been done to death and is getting really boring to sit through.		I am left wondering what are the positives of this movie. Well, I'd say it's an entertaining 121 mins for movie night at home. It's got enough eye candy and visual effects to appeal to anyone under 50. The voice acting for Rocket Racoon (by Bradley Cooper) was well done. And it's a pretty good intro movie of an unknown franchise.		I will however say that it's NOT the best movie the year. Not hardly. That honor (IMO) goes to *Edge Of Tomorrow*. Now there is a movie that was refreshing in how the story was told, how impressive the twists and turns were, and how smart the characters were developed and revealed. The movie left you in awe after you watched it, and a feeling of satisfaction that is all too rare after watching a really well put together film. Tom Cruise really out did himself... again.		P.s. The Reddit Hype Train didn't help any either. The expectations were very high by the time I finally got to see it. *Note to self - avoid Reddit posts on movies you plan to watch.*","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"reddit_no_likey","name":"t1_cm6l0tg","parent_id":"t3_2mov1n","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1416362933,"created_utc":1416362933}

Personally, I loved the fact that Marvel and Gunn let us jump in with both feet and go for the ride and pick up all the details as we go along without having to sludge through origin stories first. We pick up characterization on each Guardian through pieces of their dialogue and their actions as we go, and it allows the movie to keep up a NASCAR pace all the way through.

{"body":"Most of the OP's points aren't valid. Let's compare Guardians to Star Wars, another space epic with characters nobody knew. In SW, we are simply thrown into a conflict in which Darth Vader is looking for Princess Leia because she has betrayed them and is working the rebels. We never saw this betrayal, we never see her working with the rebels; no clandestine meetings are seen at all. Oh my God, then how do we know she's working with the rebels? It's conveyed in a short bit of dialogue and it turns out that's all we need. How is this different from Ronan? It's not. Vader didn't even have a personal stake as far as we could tell. He was just doing what the Emperor told him to do and what Tarkin told him to do. And yet he's vaunted as this legendary screen villain. At least Ronan has a personal stake: he is avenging his father's death and trying to restore power and dominance to the Kree empire. Sure, he's on an errand for Thanos, but it happens to be a vital one and one in which he stands to gain. He has plenty of motivation and it is conveyed not only in background dialogue and voice-overs, but in a few scenes with Ronan himself and with others who talk about him. There's plenty of information dispersed about Ronan throughout the film. He isn't simply bad for the sake of being bad, he has purpose and he pursues it with zeal. As far as the rest of the characters go and what we didn't see them doing to establish themselves, you may as well call Han Solo a liar because we never saw him finish the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs and we never saw Chewy rip someone's arms off when he lost a game to them. And Luke! Luke's story is completely without merit because we never saw how great a star pilot and Jedi his Dad was in A New Hope. And speaking of fathers and story threads leading nowhere: just look at Star Wars to Empire Strikes Back! Didn't we have to wait for the second movie to find out what the story was with Luke's Dad? 	As far as the plot goes, if you break down most movies, they all have fairly simple plots. If they don't, they get accused of being convoluted. What's the plot of Star Wars? It all revolves around getting the plans for the Death Star to the rebel forces so they can destroy it, right? Guardians is the same but sort of in reverse: it all revolves around keeping the orb out of Ronan's hands so that he won't destroy Xandar and possibly the whole galaxy. Of course, the stories are about a lot of other things, as well, the characters and how they change, etc, but when you boil it down, Star Wars is as much a MacGuffin chasing movie as Guardians is. Or Maltese Falcon or some of the great Hitchcock films. 	I think the characters had plenty of depth, you just needed to look a little closer. Peter and Ronan are essentially two sides of the same coin: they each have a father figure whose grip they are trying get out of, Yondu's and Thanos's, respectively; and they each have a father whose legacies they are trying to deal with. But they go about it radically different ways which puts them into conflict. In the end, the "dance-off" is what really separates them. Peter's ability to connect with something pure in the face of death is what helps to save everyone. If he'd been like Ronan, he would have fought viciously and lost. Instead, he reaches out to that symbol of what makes him a good person, the kind of person who loved his mother and stood up for the little guy getting picked on by the big bully.	I could go on about all the other characters, but I think I've made my point.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tofu23","name":"t1_cm6erqt","parent_id":"t3_2mov1n","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1416350582,"created_utc":1416350582}

{"body":"OP just described problems that are in the original "Star Wars". The characters' motivation are somewhat undeveloped but are left open-ended to be explored in the sequels. Darth Vader is nothing more than a tall, menacing figure in black in A New Hope. It isn't until Empire that this character is given a proper motivation. Does that make A New Hope a bad film? Hardly. I feel like the same could be said for Guardians. It's more of a set-up for something bigger. It also feels like it's a 70's sci-fi B-movie with a huge budget, which is just as awesome as I imagined it in my head. My only real gripe with the movie is that it lacks a first act, unless you count his mother dying and him getting abducted (I don't). 		P.S.
