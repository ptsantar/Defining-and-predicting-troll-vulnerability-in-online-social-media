{"body":"> It's action without consequence.		This is the main issue I have with almost every comic book movie: the stakes are so low I just don't care what happens because the main character will always survive, and so will any supporting characters who are not entirely central to the story. I was actually pleased when Colson died in the original Avengers because it felt like Marvel was willing to take a risk with one of their recurring characters...and then he came right back to life in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.		So instead of raising the dramatic tension, many of these movies have resorted to raising the sheer scale of the action. We all knew Captain America, Falcon, and Black Widow weren't going to die in Winter Soldier, so instead we got massive flying fortresses and aerial dogfights with lots of explosions. Even in the Battle of New York there was little actual dramatic tension because none of the characters were really facing  the type of odds that would allow the audience to really root for them. Sure there were lots of aliens and explosions, but when we know in advance that nobody is really in any danger because there's sequels and spinoffs at stake, it deflates the entire sequence down to a videogame cutscene.","depth":0,"score":262,"ups":262,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"misterdhm","name":"t1_cqefnte","parent_id":"t3_32t978","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429203957,"created_utc":1429200357}

Whether it's the inevitable sequel to a big blockbuster these days, or cape films like Thor 2, Captain America 2, Iron Man 2... they all try to set up sequels which promise to raise the stakes and threaten the characters we grow attached to, but few follow through on it because they don't actually want to kill a character off.  Some films like Cap 2 manage to find success by escalating the action and spectacle, and finding something else to jeopardize (Like the Shield twist), but even then with both Shield and Coulson the corporate thirst for profit (or even just fan desire) means status quo is typically asserted.		Suppose in Thor 2 if Thor had failed to save Natalie Portman (I refuse to address her paper thin character by name), lost his hand fer realz (but he gets a new one Skywalker style), defeated Malakith, and returned to a damaged Asgard victorious but internally defeated and content to let Not-Odin do as he pleased out of depression and disinterest, rather than the ending we got where Love drunk Thor runs off to cavort with the mortals?  That would be a pretty dark ending all things considered - Loki is dead (but unbeknownst to Thor has escaped from prison and taken over Asgard by replacing Odin), Thor's Mom and Girlfriend are dead, and Thor suffered a grievous injury.  The only things our hero gets in the end is victory over an existential threat, a chance to eventually snuggle with Sif, and an infinity gem for his trouble.		Would that be a better film?

I guess the reason it stands out so much is because of how into social justice Whedon is, and how much he talks about it.

I've always been a little doubtful of whether you can have a great movie with so many characters without it becoming muddled, for sure it makes it much easier to make a horrible movie  (Spider-man 3 anyone)","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jippmokk","name":"t1_cqelnhc","parent_id":"t3_32t978","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429213170,"created_utc":1429209570}

{"body":"Losing my reddit post virginity now! I feel I may be able to offer a unique 'perspective' here as I've seen it 13 times (perks of my job I suppose) 		What's really odd is that after the first watch I felt exactly the same as you did. But each time I watched it again I liked it a bit more, which is pretty rare (for me anyway).		Overall, I agree that it is too generic. The action is well polished (as you would expect), and the dialogue simply gets you from one scene to another. I feel that Joss Whedon wanted to make something a bit quirkier but Marvel forced him to cut a lot of that stuff out to make room for action scenes, which is understandable. The film doesn't have quite the same tone and there isn't such a strong director's voice as in Avengers 1. Oddly, enough, I actually liked Ultron - but more as a character rather than a villain, if that makes sense. I would say that somehow he isn't ever as threatening as Loki was, even though he really should be.		That said, I think it was slick and moved along at a great pace. At 2hrs 10mins (excluding credits) it didn't feel long and there weren't any particularly noticeable lulls. In addition, there were some great one-liners, Ironman vs Hulk was entertaining, and Joss Whedon is very skilled at juggling so many characters. Many of the best scenes are when our various heroes are simply interacting with each other. It must be a fantastic sandbox to play in as a writer and director. The problem is that this sandbox is very expensive and has an immense amount of pressure over it - so a lot of compromises get reached.

They could make every scene meaningful without resorting to action and that's part of the strength of not having to juggle 8+ different heroes in one film.		If AoU is nothing but an action filled romp fest of my favorite heroes beating up robots for 2 hours, I'm 100% okay with that as that's what I completely expected the movie to be.

Riding off the even-more established MCU (now with **7 years total** coherence and **3 years of hype** since Av 1), and the box office success and critical acclaim of Winter Soldier and GOTG, as well as the box office success of Iron Man 3 and Thor 2, for Age of Ultron to underwhelm against Av 1 would be a **let down for the studio.** 		Also, consider how the critical/fan appreciation of Avengers 2 could **make or ~~break~~** less-make *Ant-Man*, which already has mixed excitement on here (which is usually almost entirely pro-Marvel).

{"body":"I have heard of the reverse circle-jerk before, but I don't think that I have ever seen it in action until now. Seriously, what is going on here?		To respond to OP, yes, I am very hyped for this movie, actually more so than usual. However, from your edit, I can see that the criticism was genuine and I thank you for that clarification. (Not that I assumed it was bad criticism, but it did seem a little harsh originally.) It has tempered my expectations a bit, but I am still really looking forward to it. 		There are some other things that I definitely want to respond to as well . No one will probably see this anyway, but whatever, just want to put my two cents in. Also, I know everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am merely offering mine in the form of a rebuttal.		For one, I have seen a lot of criticism of Marvel's films in this thread that I have been surprised to see upvoted. Some of it seems to be complaining for the sake of doing so. For example, those that complain about the lack of stakes in the films may need to look at this in a different way. I do agree with you that you know that no main characters, except the villains, will really die in the films. However, this is not any different from any other franchises. Have you watched a Jason Bourne film or a James Bond film and expected either of them to actually die in it. Yes, the violence is harsher and feels more realistic, but that does not change the fact that they will most likely never kill off the main character of the franchise. This also occurs in the comics and has been an issue with stories for decades. 		I also agree with those that claim that some of the Marvel Studios films have not been the best. I can see that fact and know it is pretty accurate, however, while they may not all be masterpieces, they have continued the overarching story, which is impressive in its own right. Also, their quality seems to be improving over this last year and will hopefully do so in the years to come. 		However, I do not understand some of the other comments surrounding them. In terms of soundtracks, I think that Marvel has some great ones. The first Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy (Soundtrack, not just Awesome Mix), and even parts of Iron Man 3 have great music behind them. Now, I know my views on this seem to differ from many peoples, but I cannot see much legitimate criticism of these. I love a soundtrack that I can listen to anywhere and still feel an emotional connection to the events shown in the film, which I can do with these and others (How To Train Your Dragon 1 and 2, for example). However, saying they are all trash is ridiculous. I they aren't something that are worth listening to, then show me something that is. Many of the soundtracks that I have seen recommended on here have not impressed, probably due to my minimal connection to the movie scenes (Dark Knight and Interstellar included; can explain more in the comments if someone needs clarification). Also, those just putting things down with out reason, like some saying the action in CA:TWS was terrible, no one will take you seriously if you don't give a reason why you feel that way. Otherwise, you are simply trolling. Give me a reasonable explanation or I will consider your opinion sort of irrelevant. 		Also, as a fan of Marvel and DC comics, I have enjoyed many things from both sides. As many people have already mentioned though, many did not like Man of Steel. I, however, enjoyed many parts of it. The scenes on Krypton were awesome, the fights felt like  	Superman comics come to life, and some of the actors were good, especially Cavill. However, there are some major issues that I have with it, including the script and some of the characterization as well as the feeling that the action went too long in places. However, I am still optimistic for BvS, but only cautiously, not because I hate DC, but merely because they have not really proven themselves and others, such as Sony with Spiderman, have failed hard at the universe making game. I want to see DC succeed, but I am still a little worried. 		That turned out to be way longer than expected. Sorry, but I had to let that frustration out.		Ninja Edit: To clarify on the Dark Knight soundtrack, I like it in the film itself and the effects it creates within the scenes, but I cannot really listen to it outside of the film. Same goes for Interstellar(as far as I know, have not seen it yet) and parts of CA:TWS.

Now, I'm not gonna say she is a bad actress or was cast simply because of her looks because I know that wouldn't be true, She's fine as an actress. 		My issue is your statement that she was cast because of this one aspect of persona. Its a pretty shitty thing to say about someone, and an incorrect assumption that she's only about being a sex symbol. Most of all it didn't even fit the content of the point the person was saying. Your response was just a random voicing of your dislike on this person that had nothing to do with his conversation about the Articles issues with the character. You don't like her as an actress, that is fine. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

I'm sure he wouldn't of cast her if he didn't want her in the movie. She is much better than you give her credit for. I don't know what movies you've seen of hers, however you may not have seen enough to properly judge her as an actress, but its your opinion to have.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vivavictor","name":"t1_cqez6we","parent_id":"t1_cqewlsr","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429235690,"created_utc":1429232090}

{"body":"Once again you've missed the point. You don't like her acting, doesn't mean she isn't a good actress. I never said that her sex appeal doesn't factor, but that it is not the main factor as you said originally. She got her role because she is a good actress and Joss Whedon chose to work with her because of this. He's not gonna cast someone he thinks is talentless or is a bad actress. 		You are still making judgements about a person you know nothing about. Great, she stutters in interviews. I know plenty of intelligent people that don't speak well in public, your statement proves nothing and is incredibly judgmental. You are still judging her based off of her looks, what you've seen as highlights from the media in regards to her image and your opinions on what constitutes as having acting talent and things decided that she must not be talented and earned her role without using her acting abilities.		Also, Intelligence has very little to do with acting ability. There are some really great actors who are not intelligent. Acting isn't about how smart you are but about being present and true to the moment.		I like that you throw out Carey Mulligan and Michelle Williams. We aren't comparing who is the best actor out of the bunch. It is beside the point and detracts absolutely nothing from what I am saying. I didn't say Johansson is one of the best actresses out there, like these ladies are. She is just perfectly fine as an actress. Watch her in Lost in Translation, Match Point, Don Jon. Those are all good performances, she goes into the characters beyond the surface level. Also, I notice that you didn't go back to mentioning Cobie Smulders in the same stride? Probably because she's not at the same level as Carey or Michelle Williams? Not every actress is going to be one of the best. Johansson is not on the same level as those two, but she does not mean has a "lack of acting skills" and is a surface level actress. Is it possible that her performances just don't speak to you? Sure. You don't have to like her or her performances! but you are not foremost expert on acting, and you certainly have no idea why she was cast. Go look at the films she has chosen to work on. If she was just a blonde bimbo sex symbol she wouldn't have worked on some of the good movies she has. Woody Allen wouldn't cast someone that is talentless and can't act, yet he deemed her good enough to work with on 2 separate occasions. 		In the end you really keep missing the point. I'm not asking you agree with me. You don't have to like her acting. You can think her acting is surface level. Have your opinion, but don't be an ass and state that someone doesn't have any talent and wins roles based on her mostly on her looks and that she is only about this one thing. Be of sound enough mind to realize that perhaps your opinion is just that. It doesn't make it a fact or the reality of the matter. Don't like her, but don't just make a judgment and then talk about it like its a fact and you know exactly why she was cast. 		I'm sorry for the rant but it pisses me off because your original response had zero to do with the original post. You just dislike this person so much you decided to shit all over them for no reason and no connection to the conversation. 		**EDIT** Woody Allen cast her 3 separate times, not 2.

If there is somewhere specific you feel where I'm doing that, I have no problem apologizing and taking it back or clearing it up. You, however, are putting words in my mouth. I'm not a big fan, I have clearly stated that. I have said that her presence in a movie will not make me avoid it or draw me to it. Everything I'm saying has nothing to do with being a fan.		I've also clearly stated that you don't have to be a fan. I don't care if you don't like her or not. Keep your opinion, its yours, you have every right to it. My issue is your initial statement that she was cast primarily because of her looks and her talent had little to do with it. That she is only a sex symbol, and that is her image. That goes past having an opinion but becomes a judgment of someone and what the casting/directors/writers of this series want her for. You don't have to like her, but its an issue when you boil someone down based of perhaps a very few things you know about her, going so far as to insult her intelligence. For what purpose? What did calling out how smart she might be add to the conversation? Even if she isn't "smart" and just of regular intellect, does that make her less of a person? Perhaps you didn't mean it that way, but that's how it comes across. You are attacking somebody's character that you know very little about and may not have taken much time looking into past what the media capitalizes on to gain views and sell magazines.  		Marvel Marketing department has little to do with casting. And speaking of marketability, Marvel actually takes some pretty big chances on actors that have nothing to do with Marketability. RDJ was cast as Iron Man when nobody wanted to cast him in a lead role or a big movie. No one wanted to take that chance, he was not a box office draw at that time, people even thought he was poison. But they cast him because he fit the role. Obviously Jon Farveau had to convince them, but they obviously respect directors enough to trust their choices in casting past what is marketable. You don't have to like Johansson's acting, but understand that (past your own opinion and judgment) people in the industry see her as more than just a sex symbol and cast her to work with her as an actress not just something pretty to look at.		The reason I called you out in the first place is that your addition had *nothing* to do with the comment that NfiniteNsight left. He as talking about the reviewer's issues with Black Widow's flirtations. That's a writing issue, that's an issue with perception of female characters vs male characters and it has nothing to do with Johansson or her casting. Joss Whedon is not going to write around somebody. He's gonna write what he believes serves the story, and he is going to work with people who he trusts can deliver. Instead, you went in a completely different direction and just talked shit about someone basically stating that this actress is just there to serve one purpose and she has basically nothing else to offer. Perhaps you didn't mean that, but that's how it came across. It went outside the bounds of adding to the conversation and was just an awful thing to say about someone, basically degrading them to one thing. That's my issue. Not your opinion that you don't like her as an actress, but putting that opinion on the industry and the people who cast her.","depth":10,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vivavictor","name":"t1_cqfki86","parent_id":"t1_cqf94rz","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429289608,"created_utc":1429286008}

{"body":"I think the problem is that they're core audience isn't evolving movie-to-movie.		I hate to use this example, but look at Harry Potter. The first and seventh movies are VASTLY different in their core audience. Why? Because J.K. Rowling realized her readers were aging with the books, and were more mature. Still though, there are moments in later movies for kids to enjoy, although hopefully at their parent's discretion (Deathly Hallows is NOT for kids).		However, the MCU has been going since 2006. I saw Iron Man when I was 16, I'm 24 now. Throughout that time, I haven't seen a franchise grow with me, it just looks more generic every year. I get that they want as much money as possible, but every year they aim at the same audience: Pre-teens, kids, and teens.		The franchise has been going for fucking 9 years, how are we still in "character introduction" mode? If you keep adding more people, no one can develop. We were going to interesting mindsets with Iron Man and Cap, and even Thor (to a degree). I love Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch, Dr. Strange and Black Panther....so let them take over. I mean, shit, Hulk was only in the Avengers for like a few issues, and then he became an antagonist.		They're building with each movie, and that style gets tiring. A constant crescendo of "What can we out-do next" bores the audience, as we know we're just going to get something better next time.

I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean, and I don't see how the fact that it's on TV changes anything. It's part of the franchise, it's extremely different from anything that came before it, and it's a completely different type of storytelling.

Those are extremely generic similarities. He's still the same person, the villains are surprising to him in completely different ways, and he fights them at the end. The entire movie is about developing the character of Tony Stark in a way that hadn't happened in the prior entries.		>characters have the exact same arc in every movie.		>Tony goes from the drunken know-it-all to a relatively less drunken know-it-all. Cap goes from an American Nationalist to a Rebellious Freedom Fighter. Thor goes from a proud God-Soldier to a humble God-Soldier. 		IM1 Tony becomes, for lack of a better term, socially conscious. He's not developed much in IM2. IM3 features a very different and much more personal arc. It's not about him becoming aware of his effects on others, it's about his effect on himself.		Cap's character never really changes, in the movie or in the comics. That's part of his appeal. He's a symbol. He represents the best side of American ideals. His stories are about the reactions he has to the world around him. He changes very little. He starts out good and noble and his power doesn't change him.		Thor movies aren't great. I'll give you that.		>I just wish their arcs would change, so that watching all those movies in between Avengers' movies actually fucking mattered. You could have skipped all of phase 1 and watched Avengers, and you would never have been lost.		Phase 1 was almost purely introductory, and doesn't need a ton of explanation going into Avengers. The franchise was and is still young. The cumulative effects are almost certainly going to expand. There wasn't much in Phase 1 that needed to ripple forward. I doubt that will remain the case. That being said, I don't want them to be completely dependent on knowledge of each entry to understand the later ones. It's exactly like the comics. You have The Avengers, and then you have solo titles. You don't generally need to read the solo titles to understand the Avengers, but they enhance your understanding and move the story in smaller ways.		>Um...okay? So you're saying Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Inhumans aren't going to be origin movies?		If you search around, there are multiple people with generally reliable information who have reported that marvel is moving away from origin stories in the future. Black Panther is in AOU as Black Panther, so I think it's safe to say he's already developed by the time his movie comes out. The Inhumans are already known to exist via AOS, so not an origin story. Feige likes Strange's origin, so maybe, but it's very possible it will be along the lines of Daredevil or GOTG and do flashbacks or a very brief origin.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Morris_Night","name":"t1_cqepbp8","parent_id":"t1_cqeoaui","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1429218762,"created_utc":1429215162}

Tony doesn't really fundamentally change as a person. You can see before he gets kidnapped that he does interact with people, but is a solitary man at heart. That hasn't changed in any other movie. Sure, he's become more aware of the dangers his tech produces, but he continues to do so anyways.

IM3 features a very different and much more personal arc. It's not about him becoming aware of his effects on others, it's about his effect on himself.		Sort of, but ironically so. In IM1, he becomes aware that his tech can be harmful to the world. So what's the first thing he does? Creates a suit more powerful than anything he's created...and his enemies use it. So, he didn't really learn anything.		IM3 he does have a much more personal arc, which I like, but he still retains the harmful attitude from the first.

But that's why, for me, the solo movies exist. That's where character development or exploration should primarily occur. The team ups should be more about their interaction, not their development, IMO. There needs to be some, but I don't think it should be the focus of the team ups.		>Just a comic book fan's worries. I'm sure you're right, and I usually enjoy Marvel movies regardless. 		I totally get the concerns, I just think people overstate the similarities between the movies. Many share similar story structures, but that doesn't really bother me. By it's nature the franchise takes a long time to evolve.

{"body":"You are not understanding my points on a fundamental level. You're looking at it specifically and individually which is a useless thing to do when talking about a broad sociological problem like sexism and objectification in the film industry.		For starters, yes. It would still be sexualization if an unattractive character was showing off sexually when there is no purpose behind it.		I don't see a fault in sexualization if it wasn't so rampant and blatant across the board for women. If you watch a rated R movie and it's rated R for nudity, chances are it's not cuz of all the dick you're gonna see.		I think it's a problem in comic book movies because that's all female characters are. Eye candy. Black Widow I'm VERY up and down on. It just stands out more when she's the *only* woman superhero and is being sexualized, if that makes sense. If there were more female characters who weren't always super sexy sexy, it'd be cool. But right now, there's one planned female superhero movie for Marvel. There's one planned female superhero movie for DC. Part of that is due to there being more male superheroes and I get that. Personally, I think the best movie franchise to tackle male/female equality is the X-Men series (and even they have some shake moments). But you can understand the outrage when Rocket Raccoon gets on the big screen before Wonder Woman does. That's not a numbers thing. That's executives not willing to pull the trigger because god forbid we put a woman in a lead action movie.		It's just frustrating. Maybe I've grown tired of just seeing tits all the time. I like tits, just... like... I'd rather see a good character than a good pair of tits and that doesn't seem to be priority for big blockbusters when it comes to female characters.		That's all I gotta say in the matter, really. Hope that made sense. And it was nice to talk and not be kinda pissed off. Phew.

You've got people on the internet who cry for the poor prejudiced against men when WB looks exclusively for women to be director of Wonder Woman.

He regrew his limbs multiple times and his ability to grow/shrink and stretch was flexed over and over. He even generated light. The only thing that alluded he would die was Rocket, presumably that some part of Groot could not grow back. We never understand what groot is, and even the Ancient Collector was fascinated by him. Yet Ronin is distracted by a dancing Starlord, and Starlord holds the infinity stone for several seconds after it is separated from Ronin's hammer, yet we are upset Groot is alive?

And that's not because of Christian Bale as Batman, or even Nolan, that's pretty much solely based around the Joker. I didn't value Maggie Gyllenhall (how could you with what they gave you) or Harvey Dent, I'm not even a huge fan of their Gordon. That was the best portrayal of a villain I've seen, though Kingpin in Daredevil(netflix) is starting to climb there. Also, it was one of the only DC movies where I was really having fun.		Don't get me wrong, as psyched as I am about Age of Ultron, I'm more excited about Mad Max Fury Road. That's because I'm as nervous about AoU as anyone else could be.
