{"body":"If reddit made a movie, it would be directed by Christopher Nolan, and written by Quentin Tarantino.  	  	It would be the story of a movie fan (played by Leo Dicaprio) who is constantly bullied by some art students that only watch old black &amp; white stuff foreign stuff (played by Adam Sandler, Melissa McCarthy and Jaden Smith). They cut his hand often. The hero then finds out that the art students are trying to bring the third Reich back by making a billion dollar movie producing company that only does remakes, reboots and sequels (BUT NOT A DREDD SEQUEL), and uses CGI all the time. It's run by a nazi (played by Michael Bay).  	  	Our hero then teams up with a huge Marvel fan (played by Chris FUCKING Pratt) an goes to seek help in the Underground land of "Rated" by escavating into the mineshafts of cinema, where they meet three sages with infite knowledge about cinema (played by Plinkett, Jay and Mike from RLM) that teaches them two important lessons: THE PHANTOM MENACE IS SHIT AND BOYHOOD IT TOOK 12 YEARS TO MAKE LEWLZ!  	  	Our hero then put on his silver jacket with a scorpio on the back and drives to the church of "~le troo phillm" and starts killing all of the pretentious plebs praying to Nicolas Roeg and watching Godard.  	  	By this time in the film, our hero meets a girl and goes home and have sex with her and stuff because there has to be an actress in the movie because feminazis and you know. By the time he is done, he goes around street and ask a guy "what is the best movie with a dark and gritty ending", to which the guy responds "se7en".  	  	Our hero then finally teams up with a superhero who has the power of turning into anything (played by Gary Oldman) and goes to face the nazi corporation. While in there, he finds out that the main villain is planning on dominating the world by making white comic book characters black.  	  	Our hero and Jerry Youngman finally reach to the nazi, where he explains his plan of remaking every Christopher Nolan film with CGI instead of practical effects. Not only that, but he says that he LIKED LUCY!  	  	Our main hero then spins the token of le underrated film Inception, what fucks the nazi's mind. Once all the problems are dealt with, our main characters escapes the villain's base only to find out that he has been in le Moon all the time, and that the year is actually 1994. Our main characters then kills himself because he'll never get to express his unpopular opinions on class ever again, like "DAE AVATAR IS JUST DANCES WITH SMURFS", nor spread awareness to underrated gems like "In Bruges". The main character then shoots his own mouth.  	  	FADE OUT  	  	Movie title  	  	These were only the first ten minutes. And you're already crying.   	  	Mind. Fucked.

People would be telling their stories, then one person would come up and top them all with the central story. The narrative would go back to the subreddit at certain intervals (likely between acts) with people trying to disprove the main character's story.

On the other, led perhaps by the unwilling introverted hero /r/showerthoughts are the subreddits that have interesting original content or represent a fun hobby etc. etc. Perhaps there would be a third alliance consisting of (blank). How do they fight? There is some virtual world trope that allows the subreddits to take physical form, their size and strength based on the continuous support of subscribers and karma and such. There would also be some romance story, maybe a romeo and juliet thing of two subredits from the wrong teams.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"readytodo","name":"t1_cq9n4hl","parent_id":"t3_32a880","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1428831589,"created_utc":1428827989}

{"body":"It opens with /u/kn0thing posting the first ever post to Reddit. The camera zooms out, and a montage of people slowly but surely joining the site begins. Eventually, one man... /u/unidan joins the site. 		It seems at first, that /u/unidan is the protagonist of the story, but he is eventually ousted as the villain, and begins posting under a new name...someone who is slowly but surely gaining power...but, he fades into obscurity until he can gain back the power.		Meanwhile, a small group of conspirators from /r/conspiracy begin to suspect that a certain user is actually the new /u/unidan, (you never find out his real new username) but have no proof to back it up...and they are disregarded entirely.		As /u/unidan gets power from a group of redditors in a very obscure sub.../r/ooer , which is secretly the meeting ground for the underground conspiracy. Members of /r/atheism, /r/circlejerk and of course, /r/funny slowly begin to support the second coming of /u/unidan because he was able to lead reddit to the mythical "Second Safe" because he knew the species of spider that was inside.		A post in /r/pics shows how the "second safe" actually contained all the riches in the world, and the brainwashed followers of the new /u/unidan give him the money. With this money, /u/unidan is able to buy out the entirety of reddit with an iron fist. 		Reddit is destroyed, but then something astonishing happens...a lone redditor named /u/streetlamplamoose discovers that he can travel back in time to warn of these events before they transpire...through the power of reposts.		Due to the paradoxical nature of his travel, he is able to only relate the events to one individual a sketch artist by the name of /u/awildsketchappeared who posts the picture on /r/pics Reddit and is immediately shadow-banned by a mysterious moderator. 		This sets in motion an entire war among the subreddits, with each sub taking their own side in the events...with /r/movies only wondering how exactly this story would work as a movie.		But, the new /u/unidan merely watches all this on the sidelines...and laughs hysterically...he knows that he will win no matter how fate decides. He is predestined to be the ultimate ruler of all of Reddit. He manages to again open the second safe in this second timeline...and kills /u/streetlamplamoose before he can ruin the past again.		So, in proclamation at the height of the war, when it seems he has won, he posts in /r/atheism: "I am Eurphoric! I am God!" naturally, that doesn't shine well with the atheists and they begin to turn on him, and soon most of reddit turns on him. 		As he about to fall completely, /u/unidan pulls one final trick...he has bought the cumbox from /u/lynfect. He posts that with the money he made, he was able to engineer the box to release the "Swamps of Dagobah" onto the entire world. People stop in their tracks and listen to the man.		At this point, President Barrack Obama does a second AMA...and it crashes Reddit once again. Devs reach a point where they barely want to even bother trying to fix it.		Then...out of nowhere a unanimous post in /r/movies entitled "Has anybody actually WATCHED Rampart?" and suddenly, an idea hatches...they manage to trick the new /u/unidan using the same wacky schemes as in the climax of that movie. The new /u/unidan is taken down, and peace returns to Reddit.		The camera goes back to the front page where the Rampart post is the top post of all time. The camera zooms out of the computer, and shows that it was Woody Harrelson of all people who made the post...and saved Reddit. He looks at the camera and winks.
