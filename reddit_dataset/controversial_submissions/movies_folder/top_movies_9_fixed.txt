{"body":"But even minus that, I just don't think many people voicing their opinion has actually seen the movie yet.		Man, I'm going to sound like a stereotypical youtube/redditor commentor, but I'm very liberal. I'm very against our wars and propaganda that might romanticize about it, especially having a brother that came back from Iraq.		That said (to pathetically try and give me internet credibility), I have to say that the film was not biased. I found it in no way being propaganda for the Bush-era. 		What I found interesting is the difference between the trailer and the film. The trailer made it look like some insanely deep Fincher film about Kyle's darkness. Though instead, it was a blunt portrayal of a soldier in the US military. He was a sniper, a SEAL, did his work. Had some family problems. Then found the importance of being a father and started helping veterans. This was no "Brothers" type film. It just talked about a sniper who did multiple tours, and some consequences in his personal life that come along with it.		Even if it was supposed to be more of a documentary, I see no biaseness to the film. I found almost nothing pushing to either side. It's a bit tough for me to say this, but why I think people are bashing it as propaganda, is because they didn't go more dark. Or rather, didn't talk more about the negative aspects of war, as the trailer somewhat insinuates. Because of this, I find no bias. Though because of this, people will find bias towards the war. 		**TL:Dr  Since nothing bluntly attacked the political aspect of the campaign, it's labeled as propaganda. But, this is not Jarhead.

{"body":"I believe to the best of his ability, Eastwood made this movie as accurate as he was able based on the information at hand.  With supposed threats from the family about keeping the movie true to their son, and with people claiming different accounts from his book are not true...what and who do you believe?  		I think one should walk away from this movie with a better understanding of what the deployed soldier sometimes has to go through. The rest...take with a grain of salt.		That being said, why can people not just see things of this nature, as what they were intended to be?  Entertainment.  After all, if you do the movie theatre thing, you're going to pay through the nose for a ticket.  These production companies don't provide funding to make these movies just so the public can come back in the end and debate about what's true or not.  They could give 0 fucks whether anyone even likes the movie or believes anything they just saw.  And I think that saying any movie is a true story is like saying something is American made.  Because after all, only 70% of the contents of that American made item must be made in The US to claim the product as Made in USA.  Seeing a trailer for a movie with the quotation "based on a true story" just screams 'maybe 70% of it is true.'","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"johayyn","name":"t1_cnvfnan","parent_id":"t3_2t2cnj","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1421795155,"created_utc":1421795155}
