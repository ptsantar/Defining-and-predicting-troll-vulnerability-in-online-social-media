If you're a woman looking for a representation of femininity in the team, you ONLY have Black Widow to look to.

As soon as they open up the role of women on the team, (and they're gradually heading that way), a lot of these issues will go away. If Black Widow isn't the "right" kind of woman for a particular viewer to relate to, maybe Scarlet Witch or Captain Marvel will be.

I'm a consultant for video game studios and work around people discussing this constantly.

Superman is a literal alien for whom the Earth (and the United States specifically) is his adopted home.  The X-Men are an oppressed minority group who are constantly fighting against violent racism.  Spider-Man is a poor (well, not post-Superior, but for most of his existence this was his status quo), down-on-his-luck inner-city kid who was raised by a single parent.		It's also not terribly surprising when you consider that a lot of the biggest creators in the industry--Joe Shuster, Jerry Siegel, Stan Lee (Stanley Lieber), and Jack Kirby (Jacob Kurtzberg)--are all Jewish, and back when they were all getting started antisemitism was a very real an virulent trend in American culture.  The guys experienced racism and prejudice firsthand, and they brought that experience to their work. 		Plus, you've got to remember that comic books started out aping pulp stories.  Superman and Batman used to beat up corrupt politicians and dirty cops all the time back in the 1930's.  It wasn't until the big scare with [Seduction of the Innocent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction_of_the_Innocent) and the subsequent introduction of the [Comics Code Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority) (CCA) that they became squeaky-clean paragons of civic virtue.  That's what brought about things like Adam West's Batman being officially deputized by the Gotham Police Department.  But there are only so many stories that you can tell about a perfect do-goodier fighting clean, inoffensive evil, and eventually writers started to push back against the CCA's restrictions, slowly eroding it and eventually outright defying it.  Throughout the 70's defying the CCA almost became a game, with writers pushing subversive stories to try to wiggle around the censorship, hitting touchy topics with obvious metaphors without overtly stating the subject matter.  By the 90's we got to, well, [the 90's](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks), and as of the 2000s, Marvel and DC have both abandoned it.  That was a bit of ramble, but the long-and-short of it is that comics used to be political, and then politicians told them that they couldn't be anymore, and writers did what writers always do when politicians tell them what they can't write about: they wrote about it anyway, while pretending that they weren't.  Over time they just stopped pretending. 		Anyway, td;dr: Because comics have always been that way, except for a brief period in the 50's and 60's when politics got in the way, and that just made the writers madder anyway.","depth":1,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DreamcastJunkie","name":"t1_crcyumr","parent_id":"t1_crcvoyq","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1431964172,"created_utc":1431960572}
