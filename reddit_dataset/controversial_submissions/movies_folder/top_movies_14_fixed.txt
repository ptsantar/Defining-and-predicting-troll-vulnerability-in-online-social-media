I was just commenting to provide my experience as an art major and my knowledge that many colleges seem to require a figure/life drawing class for art majors. It comes off as pretty assuming, but it is something that I wouldn't feel bad about assuming in this case, though I'm not trying to argue with you for the sake of arguing!		I could get into more of a semantics debate with you (that tends to be how I approach debates - it's so tempting!), but I won't - yes, I would agree that if they didn't have to take figure/life drawing and knew that they hated it, that would be a silly choice.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"barrow_wight","name":"t1_coj4lzj","parent_id":"t1_coj3ojq","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1423738786,"created_utc":1423738786}
{"body":"I'm starting to think about that. I think part of the problem is that I went from 0 to 60 on this whole thing. I had gone to community college and gotten an AFA.... and then took a break to get married. So, I've been out of school for three years as a military wife working at most 15 hours a week while I hang out at home all day on reddit or playing video games. Now I'm taking 2 studios and a lecture and frequently end up staying up until 2am doing work. I honestly just DON'T have the self discipline anymore to actually buckle down and do shit. And there is so very much homework involved. I'm having a hard time balancing my family life with my school life. I sort of want to just go back to lazing about all day.... but that's not really the kind of person I consider myself to be. I will admit that I'm worried I got in over my head or that maybe I picked the wrong program to be in.... but I literally have taken one class in my major. The core classes that everyone has to take are the ones that are harder. Oddly, I'm enjoying my history class the most and got an A on my midterm exam. Next quarter I'll be taking more classes in my major as well as one in my minor, so I feel like that will give me some sort of actual response to whether or not I like this. I think I just found a whole bunch of things that I like and admire and never really thought about the sheer level of work that goes into it.","depth":3,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrystalElyse","name":"t1_coitp3g","parent_id":"t1_coitdih","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1423708047,"created_utc":1423708047}

{"body":"Have you gotten to the point of doing charcoal studies of the human form? If you're better at painting, this could change your whole outlook on depicting people. Charcoal is much easier (at least I find it so) to wrap your mind around the idea of breaking down the human form and thinking of it differently. 		The trick is, DON'T look at the model in front of you like they are a person. While you draw them, they aren't people as your brain has decided they are. They are a landscape. They made of curves... dips... valleys...plains... Shapes. Break them down into basic shapes - circles, ovals, rectangles, squares... then build them up from there. 		When you get those basic forms in, look at the odd shapes of the light and shadows that lay across the valleys and plains and sketch them in - one body part at a time if you have to. SIMPLIFY them. It is not so difficult as your brain is trying to make them. I promise! 		Art is simply a lot of work. It will always be a lot of work. You may hate it at times and become frustrated, but it should be work that you love in the end. There should be a passion there to solve those insane visual puzzles and you should be able to lose yourself in the work to the point you lose track of time. I'm sorry if this comes off as cruel, but if you really think this is not for you and you realize that the passion is not there or you don't want to put the time in to get better. Then art should not be the direction you go for a career. It's a very difficult industry to get your foot in the door, even for people who have that passion. So, think wisely on your decision. Should anyone choose art/design/media as a career choice, there's gonna be a lot of ups and downs and a TON of work required to get you where you want to be (and not very well paid work most of the time).		But I have to add, even if you choose another direction, PLEASE keep creating! Continue taking art classes as electives to further your knowledge and appreciation. Art is a wonderful thing for many people and completely wonderful as a creative outlet, self-discovery or even just for stress relief. I wouldn't be where I am today or met the people I have without my background and love of art.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lana_r","name":"t1_coizwbf","parent_id":"t1_coitp3g","subreddit":"movies","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","created":1423720280,"created_utc":1423720280}
