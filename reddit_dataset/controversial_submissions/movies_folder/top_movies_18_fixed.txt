I feel like Nolan handles gritty realism well, and nothing's more gritty than a man losing most of his body and having his dad rebuild him with robot parts. Not only that but his backstory is really tragic: his scientist parents used him as experiments, both physically and mentally. Eventually he gets fed up, and at this point he's super fit and has a genius IQ, and he goes off with a criminal guy. Then one day a lad experiment goes wrong, and horribly mutilates him, so his dad replaced the mutilated parts with robot parts. So of course everyone in his life rejects him because he's a half-robot half-human freak. So he meets up with the criminal guy again, who wants to use his robot parts to attack the UN. Cyborg wises up, though, and stops him. And then there's a cool allusion to the Titans at the end.
