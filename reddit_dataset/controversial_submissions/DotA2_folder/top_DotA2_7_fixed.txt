{"body":"Of course H4nni immediately forgave Envy.  What other choice did he have?  H4nni's reputation in the pro scene was precarious, and holding a grudge would be ill advised. Nonetheless, EE's motive was revenge.		No, there's nothing wrong with being selfish.  Some of the best systems ever invented are inherently selfish.  Capitalism, for example.  The concept of property ownership.  Renting out apartments rather than letting people live in them for gratis.  All wonderful tools, and all inherently selfish.  When politicians run for office, they must be selfish to win.		The point isn't to flame EE.  It's to put EE's current actions into a broader context.  EE has a long history of saying some strange things. ([This](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2g4a4l/c9eternalenvy_no_mercy_8_slotted_naga_vs_xgame/ckfkpc7) is my all-time favorite, because it's hilarious: "I did this in my shower half a year ago i think, now i do it IRL" about an 8-slotted Naga game.)		So when we see EE publicly saying that there's a problem and that he's scared of Valve, we should consider the possibility that EE's concerns aren't justified.  Unless he's willing to come out and say what's on his mind, the simplest explanation is that EE is just saying yet-another strange thing.","depth":7,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"palish","name":"t1_cnj9ymq","parent_id":"t1_cnj9pi0","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1420816107,"created_utc":1420787307}

In fact there is no team in the West right now that should get invited automatically based on Valve's previous "we are going to invite sets of 5 players who performed the best in the last ~6-12 months" MO. If the new players don't work out, we might even see several of the top teams have to go through the qualifier. (Which, again, wouldn't work, if the previous format is kept.)		You can make the argument that this isn't Valve's problem and that the top teams should just win (or at least place high in) big lan finals. But I can also see where EE is coming from. There are so many tournaments this year that you can't really take off a month for bootcamp and rebuild a team, at least not until you hold your invite to TI5 in your hands.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"skgoa","name":"t1_cnjcp9v","parent_id":"t1_cnj76do","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1420827092,"created_utc":1420798292}

{"body":"Well while we are wondering about what EE is complaining about, I'd like to lay some down on the table.		When I first started playing in the beta, the trading system and market system was almost perfect (with the exception of 10000000 treasure chests dropping and being annoying to clean), now trading is a joke. Gems often make items worth less. Cause that makes sense. I can't trade stuff i have just unboxed. Awesome. I also haven't seen a drop in hundreds of matches. Not a drop for A SINGLE PERSON. It used to be multiple people got a drop every game. Now I've gone 1k games without running into a single item for me. Now I know this sounds like I'm bitching because I'm not getting free stuff. Its not that. I'm bitching because it gave me a little something extra to look forward to. An incentive and reward for playing I like that. It made me spend money on dota and give valve money. I don't do that anymore. 		Another thing, hire more freaking employees to work on the game. Its clear valve doesn't have enough, and yet they are trying to compete with the big dogs. Valve has like 30 people working on the game. Riot, the number 1 competetor, has over a thousand. Yea yea I know not that many are actually working on the game. My point is valve is understaffed and can't meet the demands of their customers.		Last thing I want to complain about it no LAN. If valve wants their game to be taken seriously as a competitve game, MAKE LAN AVAILABLE. I'm sick of watching games where people have flown all the way from around the world to play in person only to have the game connect to some shitty server located in outerspace with 80%  packet loss.

{"body":"Balance is fine, design is fine. But in general, Valve seems to be resting too much on their laurels. DOTA is growing fast, but Valve has been pretty quiet about everything. Communication was never their strong suit. but maybe that can change with a bit more transparency. 		Valve has always said that they want to remain a small company of around 300~ employees. This clearly is not working. For a company that has the lion's share of the PC gaming market you would think they would be better equipped to handle these situations, but servers have been having issues for months now. When are we going to get some transparency as to what is being done about the situation?  		Every employee chooses what they want to work on at Valve, but is there enough resources being dedicated to Dota 2? I think this is the question we must ask. Is the growth of Dota 2's player base outpacing the rate at which the small team can work? 		I could be wrong in my assumptions, but something clearly isn't right about the status quo, and there is little transparency as to what is being done on the teams end.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EndersCraft","name":"t1_cnj4tvp","parent_id":"t3_2rtf3v","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1420804190,"created_utc":1420775390}
