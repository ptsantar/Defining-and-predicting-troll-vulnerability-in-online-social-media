{"body":"So guys you might not believe it but I think I achieved something. Here's the thing. I tried the Cyclone stuff with roshan, in fact the cyclone sound never stopped playing but it wouldn't move at begining. So I spawned a Death Prophet and she appeared here: http://imgur.com/t3nXvfp Immediately after I leveled her up to lvl 25, and used her ulti. The Cyclone sound moved towards her: http://imgur.com/MxMPWJ7		After I gave her a blink, and moved to another place. I spawned a Roshan and killed him with her spirits, after the roshan kill, ultimate finish, this happened:  http://imgur.com/cgZgbLh  1 spirit remained.		Tried it again and 2 spirits remained: http://imgur.com/iR8qcAK		This time I spawned 3 roshans and used her ulti, 3 spirits remained: http://imgur.com/vE4LhLM		One thing I noticed is that after you use DP ulti, Cyclone sound follows her.

If people want to believe, let them. in what way is it affecting you?		OnT: I've been a zelda fanboy since i was a kid, and i see several things related. First of all, the RIP DIRETIDE video has not only the reverted song of healing, but also LD, Purge, and Lumi wearing Blue(quite dark tho), green, and red shirts. Storm, Earth, Fire. (possible Hint that Earthspirit is probably related to the next step with Rock / Clap).			This was leaked some time ago (i dunno how to make hyperlinks on reddit) http://www.cyborgmatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/spirit_secret_enhance.jpg 	Those colors might be hinting at something aswell.		All this seem related to the Spiritual stones  from Ocarina of time. 	(http://zeldawiki.org/Spiritual_Stones)	Might be a coincidence, but counting in that Ember spirit has had material  ready for quite some time, this might hint at Ember and Earth Spirit being released quite soon, similar to the pheonix from 6.69.		The color of the BM spirits, the leaked picture with those stones (oddly similar to the SPIRITual stones) Reversed Song of healing, and the shirts can be hinting at something.

Storm represents the triforce of wisdom because his main attribute is Intelligence, and Kaolin represents the triforce of courage because his [lore](http://www.playdota.com/heroes/earth-spirit) involves him being born out of the courage of the strong villagers of a village courageously scaling a mountain seeking aid from the mountains, which led to Kaolin being created. Xin represents power so perfectly it makes my Diretide-withdrawn mind sound credible: his [lore](http://www.playdota.com/heroes/ember-spirit) involves him forging a sword out of a fire spirit and the fire spirit merging with his body, until he becomes more powerful than the soldiers he is forging weapons for(not to mention it uses the word power like 20 times).		***(btw this is only speculation: while there is an obvious connection don't get your hopes up about an ARG of some sort)***		Citations :	http://zeldawiki.org/Triforce	http://zeldawiki.org/Agahnim","depth":0,"score":18,"ups":18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"derdok","name":"t1_cd5snlj","parent_id":"t3_1pt6v1","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1383525206,"created_utc":1383496406}

If that wasn't enough, people were still anticipating, and still nothing was communicated, so people took it as some kind of message that there really is something going on. And in Matt's analysis post, a Kappa over the enhanced Emerald gem in secret_spirit.jpg. An obvious troll as to say, "Yeah I know something you don't know. Ha!". 		Saying "Happy Now?", is a little much, I think. Not one to harass Matt, but you can't troll the community and not expect some kind of retribution for your actions.

{"body":"Because OP didn't think to actually demonstrate it, I tested this myself to see if the sound followed the creeps and Rax.		It does.  When Roshan is dead the Cyclone loop lingers at the Roshan pit for around half of a minute and then moves to the middle raxes.  The Middle Rax is considered the "Source" and the Cyclone loop follows the next creep wave that spawns.  After about two or three creep waves die in mid, the loop switches back to the Roshan pit as a central point.  After more time the loop then switches to the TOP rax and creeps, for roughly the same amount of wave spawns.		After this the loop flits between the mid creeps and Roshan pit as a central point, and then switches to the BOT rax and creeps.  It switches back to TOP rax when the first creep wave meets the enemy creeps near the bot Tier 2.  Switches back to mid, then to Roshan pit.  So on and so forth.  I also get the feeling the loop is based on time and not creeps themselves at this point.		If anyone knows where to find the Cyclone spells soundfile, I'd like to hear it.  Because it seems like there ARE voice whispers in it that I have not noticed before.  Then again people rarely play Brewmaster so I may not have heard it enough to tell.

{"body":"The Cyclone sound staying in the Rosh pit hardly proves its status as legitimate.  But if your claims of Death Prophet sobbing sometimes?  I mean I heard jack shit that sounds like that in your video, but it still seems like an interesting idea.		Roshan, the seemingly immortal beast.		Death Prophet, a woman who damns her inexplicable immortality.		It's not much to go on, but it certainly sounds related to those Wraith King assets Matt found a month ago.  Chances are he's the Dota 2'd Terrorblade, and I think he's supposed to be a master of death.  Point is that he is a master of perverting immortality.  Undying we know for sure is because of Wraith King, but it would not be impossible to think he's causing DP's immortality as a cruel joke.  "Wraith" literally translates to "A ghost or ghostlike image of someone," which fits DP very well.  And Roshan?  Roshan would be the perfect creature to add to his army, if only the Aegis would keep him from coming back *right* rather than how *Wraith King* wants him to.		This all being caused by the Brewmaster ult pokes a hole is this, though, because he really lacks even tangential relation aside from the "Spirits."  So it's probably just a roundabout Puzzle for the Spirits of X update the team are working on, since BM has his primal spirits and DP *is* a spirit who calls spirits.  It would be started by using Cyclone on Roshan because aren't all of IceFrog's puzzles started/continued in extremely roundabout ways?

However, I disagree with you in one place:		> Valve wouldn't go this far for something so minor		First off, depending on how accurate teasers are, we could be getting a multi hero patch. That is, IMO, anything but minor. In addition, Valve has a history of going all out, and IceFrog has been doing x.x9 secret quests for a while.
