Regarding Soccer/Football:		Occasionally at the higher levels, there comes a time in a soccer match where a player is or may be injured, demonstrated by the player going down and staying on the ground, but the referee allows play to continue. 		Failure to stop play by the referee may be due to either the application of the advantage rule or because he simply does not see the injured player. 		As a result, it may be up to the players themselves to address the situation with an act of sportsmanship. If there is no clear attack or immediate threat on goal, a player of either team may choose to stop play, by kicking the ball out of bounds over the sideline, so that assistance may be rendered to the injured player. 		Once the injured player has been attended to, the referee is obligated to restart the match with a throw-in to be taken by the team that did not kick the ball out. 		The sportsmanship, or “the courtesy,” is then shown by the thrower throwing the ball to a player on the team that had previously kicked it out.

But most leagues won't have that. So team FrankerZ tried to have their dog mascot on the sidelines and refs declined, because it could cause issues with the game; team FrankerZ decide to follow the rules and enter Doge, their mascot, as an official substitute. The referee dismisses his ability to enter as substitute since he's not a human (although he *is* male), and warns the manager that further attempts to get the dog on the sidelines will hold bigger sanctions. Even if the manager tries to argue that there is no rule against dogs, the only thing he can do is appeal to the league and say that the ref is restricting their ability to play the game, and the league might investigate the matter and call the ref to know why he made the call he made. And at the end of the day, they will all laugh at the team who was so bad they tried to make their dog play, and they will keep breaking/bending the rules by disallowing dogs to play; because you know what?

I think the fundamental issue with this decision was that the original decision became irreversible because the bracket moved on.  This means that instead of getting to fix the decision if incorrect, FaceIt had to instead come up with a justification for why the original decision was correct.		I think the initial decision was incorrect, given that the team that was disqualified didn't actually violate a rule by not pausing for the mass disconnect.  At worse Antipro was guilty of bad sportsmanship.  Even worse, there is a known bug where Antipro was unable to pause, which they noted in chat at the time.
