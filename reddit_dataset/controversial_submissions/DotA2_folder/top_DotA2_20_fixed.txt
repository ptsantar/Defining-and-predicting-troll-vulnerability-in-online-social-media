The problem isn't that the act has taken place, its that nobody did anything because it would lose stream and ticket revenue or they were too timid to remove/punish a team with supporters. If a football player engages in a bar brawl, its out of the game itself but sets a poor image for the sport so they are disciplined by the governing bodies. If 7ucking mad says all that shit on twitter he should be disciplined in some way or another by the tournament. The same should be said for casters. Tobi has said some stupid racist thing and he should have at least some small slap on the wrist to remind him the next time he goes to say it again.		**TL;DR** The lack of punishment from the authorities is hindering the maturity of the sport and its image just as much as the players themselves.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CptStanhope","name":"t1_cg622f9","parent_id":"t1_cg540pj","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1395215676,"created_utc":1395186876}

Just try think about the pressure they were under, TI4 is around the corner and they are feeling heavily pressure to make it into a spot there. FATA made a mistake and panicked, I really doubt he was thinking I'll be an asshole because I don't care about RoX.KIS and I want to win.
