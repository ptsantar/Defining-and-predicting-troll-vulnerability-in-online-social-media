I hate when people use the "my mmr is better than yours so you should just get good" argument. I play in 4k bracket and 90% of the 2-stacks i play with straight up dont care about mmr and do extremely game-losing things. Such things include: randoming 2 picks, picking heroes just to have fun and mess around, stealing other people's lanes after they call it which usually results in dual mids/someone griefing, both players flaming a solo queuer together and making the game awful. None of these things are only unique to duo stacks, but i've noticed they are exceedingly more common in duo stacks than in solos. Plus, these issues are far less severe when only one person does it, but are perpetuated by the fact that 2 people are doing it. Also, from personal experience, i know duo stacks care less about their mmr because i myself feel that way when i duo stack. I play and dick around and if i win, cool, if i lose, whatever. Whereas, when im soloing, i tryhard every game.			3. The party stack on other team argument is pretty stupid if you ask me. No one has said that the winning team's 2-stack is any better to play with. You just aren't as tempted to flame the 2-stack when you're on the winning team because there's no point. Both 2-stacks could be toxic to play with, but one of them has to win obviously.

{"body":"agreed, but Like some people already wrote here - it's not only about win/loss		Imbalanced MMR.		 There really were lots of times when duo consists of 3,5 and 4,5 k MMRs. Insta lock safelane, 3,5 picks carry, 4,5 support. The opposite happens in the enemy team. Not saying that you autolose the game, but, agree here, that it DOES affect overall game when your carry is weaker skillwise then the enemy (presuming that MMR is accurate measurement tool of players skill). You could argue here that it's party MMR, since we can not see their solo. But usually in these kind of games you can clearly see if the guys party MMR actually matches his MMR/skill. And if that 3,5k randoms... god.		Communication:		duo stacks do what ever they feel like to do without pining/speaking, so if you do not follow their actions and they go and feed 2 v 5, you (mid, supp, offlaner) are at fault. because you did not follow randomly them and did not help. This, of course, can be avoided by taking on leader roll. But it rarely happens. Not many people want to do that. This brings to my next point:		Satisfaction:		because of duos randomness and no communication, imbalanced cores MMR brings full stomp of one side. Thus, when the  team result by minute 20 is 5-25 - you lose all motivation to play. again, 	"never give up"is a solution. But also takes too much energy to the game that was completely unsatisfactory.			Negative games like these with duos are around 50/50. Other 50 proc of the games are completely positive with duos.

{"body":"Is this a serious question or just a joke?

When a friend you're queuing with messes up though, you just pass it off as something or someone else's fault because you want to spare their feelings or don't want them to resent you. Those stacks are the people that troll and feed. 		There *are* other stacks though, the ones that want to improve. They'll point out flaws in each others play, acknowledge their own faults, and those people will often play together. It's rare you'll see two people with different mindsets ("fuck this game" man and "I fucked this game" man) partying together for more than a few games before they go their separate ways. 		So two stacks will normally fall into those categories, and because there are different player stacks, they will act differently.

Removing players from the queue parties use only makes it MORE difficult to balance those matches. 		I know it's easy to blame partied players, but the fact is that a solo queue won't serve much purpose besides increased queue times for everyone.

{"body":"> All-in-all though Dota is a team sport and it seems more to me that my score when I play with a group should be more important to me then the score when I play by myself.		That's the thing though. You are *always* playing with a group in Dota 2, its never been a game you play by yourself. The difference is either the whole group is on even footing, no one knows each other and favors one individual over the others, and everyone is roughly the same MMR (exceptions for when you reach 5k+ MMR), or the group is already split up due to knowing each other and the skill disparity is greater. The people who want pure solo queue don't think its fair that their matches have to involve people with a pre-existing relationship and more turbulent MMR disparities. Mixing party queues and solo queues leads to more lop-sided and uneven games.		> Solo que is easier for most people I suppose. Finding a group isn't hard though if you try.		I don't think anyone considers solo queue easier. It is always more difficult to coordinate with strangers then people you already know. The thing is that it always puts you on level ground though, so your skill level is more comparable when as many variables as possible are kept static between all players. Party queue leaves too many open-ended variables so skill is more obscured.		For what its worth I am still adamantly opposed to having an exclusive solo queue, just because I still don't think Dota has enough of a playerbase to sustain reasonable queue times for it. It would be ideal, I just don't think its possible right now.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cvcl85b","parent_id":"t1_cvckjj3","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443134888,"created_utc":1443106088}

{"body":"It's not only that they don't care about party MMR, but let's be serious here for a second. Party MMR does not equal Solo MMR (i.e. 2k player with a 4k party mmr rating IS NOT 4K NO MATTER WHAT DELUSIONAL STATEMENT HE MAKES) Most of the time you have a friend way higher than your MMR carry you in party MMR , therefore inflating  the rating.  So we can have a 5k player with a 3.5 k party rating, practically "boosting" his friend up who is 1.5k MMR up to his friends party rating of 3.5k.		I see this so much just at 4k mmr.  I've played with multiple people this week whose SOLO rating was less than 2.5k but their party was 4k mmr and they are the worst games to ever play :(","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eitsss","name":"t1_cvcnts3","parent_id":"t3_3m71nv","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443138844,"created_utc":1443110044}
