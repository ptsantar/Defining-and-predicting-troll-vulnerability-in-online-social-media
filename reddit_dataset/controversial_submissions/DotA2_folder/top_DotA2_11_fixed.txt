I do think the prices are cheaper in Dota 2 in general. You can buy a whole set for a hero for like... 20 cents... and it can be a pretty cool set. A single decent M4 skin might be $15 in CSGO. That being said, there's still crazy shit. I think there's an Ursa cowboy hat worth like a thousand dollars, and that stupid Gold frondillo is worth at least a hundred.

This case is the latter - how one man caused so much damage that fractured the dota community's built up effort (>5yrs) and rehashed into his own personal gain. You don't simply just forget that.		> Even valve made a tournament with 1 million prize money when Dota wasnt even released for marketing reasons		Yes. Valve marketed itself because it is one of the only companies capable of challenging Riot's growing/ massive influence in rising esports. 		You are making the layman see that RIOT are shitting money into esports while at the same time you are making smaller competitors to your game unable to compete even if they have a potential game. 		In an ideal world. companies take competitors as challenges that make them improve their product. But obviously, it's easier to just stay stagnant and demand competitors to fuck off.

{"body":"I think you are missing some points here. People don't say "why is dota better? Because Pendragon is a backstabbing bitch. And the many other points...". People simply do not want to support a game and company that have so blatantly stolen the work of a whole community. And thus do not want to support them in anyway, one of them is by watching the game. The hostility is more or less towards the company and their game.		If you want to get a clear picture go watch the documentary by Moose called 'We the Community". One thing you got to understand is that DOTA; they way it developed, was not a group up 5-6 young aspiring people that created a game. Its was literally thousands of people, sure it had moders like Ice and Euls and Guinsoo before him that did most of the heavy lifting but the community had a huge participation. People poured in with ideas, bug fixing solutions, art work, hosting tournaments, commentating and casting games, and they were given credit by the 'owners' of the game. It was like a huge family, it was a community. I have played DOTA since 2004 and I can tell you, that even if I had the slightest contribution by even playing the game or whining on a forum I count myself as a part of this community since it's inception. There was a culture of sharing and helping  to develop the game for the sake of the game. Now, I am ranting to give you a clear picture that when you come and steal stuff from a community as such, you don't offend 5-6 people. You offend thousands. Even if I had no hand what so ever in creating the Idea that Riot stole to become Teemo, I am offended cause they stole an idea from a fellow DA member. And when you offend thousands of people, it creates a culture of hate. And Riot did not in any way try to compensate or level the plain, their actions were even more aggressive towards DOTA and other games and they even marginalized themselves more. Now you might say, it was 5 years ago, let it go. That might work if you offend a person or 2 but when you go and piss on thousands of people, yea that wont go away that easily.		Now I admit that DOTA community are elitist, they believe DOTA needs a higher skill cap and is more or less more complicated game, with a good reason of course. DOTA is a more complicated, fluid and malleable game. But our attitude towards other games sometimes becomes rash and that isn't right.		I played LoL a bit when it came out. I outright didn't like it. For me it was too simple, too easy, too dumbed down. When I try to watch the games, I get the same feeling. Too methodological, too predictable and out right boring.		When you wonder how come LoL subreddit is nor reacting the way we do to LoL it's because we never hurt your community the way your publishers hurt ours. You have no reason to be aggressive. When a LoL player hears DOTA, he thinks " a LoL like game that other people play and like LoL it's an e-sport". When we hear LoL we think ' Oh that motherfucking company that stole our shit and made a game out of it." Its rather simple really. 		So if you wonder why when you come here from LoL and post " Hey guys ! We have a tourny come watch!" Some people say "fuck Riot and your game..." some old wounds open thats why.		I'm sure it will all go away someday.

The bigger complaint from the community is probably that a lot of them act too SJW-y in their modding and are too restrictive on what content can go on the subreddit.		2 - Because hard counters aren't really a thing in LoL, you don't need to have access to every champion to do well. You probably need to have 1-2 OP champions and 1-2 champions in each role that you're comfortable with. The OP champions change every few patches, and your pool of comfort champions can change, but if you're actually a new player and leveling up normally, you should be able to get a decent number of champions that you're comfortable playing. It's basically, you can pay money in order to not have to deal with leveling and a small champion pool at first. So if you're smurfing, it feels very pay-to-win. If you're playing a new account for real, not so much (at least that's how it felt for me but I started playing in 2011 so it may be more so now). Riot also recently reduced the IP (ingame currency that you get from playing the game a bunch) costs of some of the runes so that helps too.		So there are definitely aspects where you can get an advantage by paying, but it's not an advantage that you couldn't also get by playing the game more, and it feels a lot more punishing to smurfs than to new players.		3 - There's actually a ton of strategy around laning in (competitive) League. Standard is ADC/support bot on both teams, toplaner top. But then teams realized you can swap your lanes and put your toplaner bot, botlaners top, and have a free 2v1 lane for your lategame scaling ADC. Then teams realized you can just not send your toplaner to get denied 1v2 and instead send him top to dive their toplaner along with your jungler 4v1. Then teams stopped sending their toplaner to lane at all, and just 4v0 shoved lane. That was countered by sending 2 or 3 people to defend, so toplane could be defended by jungler and support while the enemy ADC, support, top, and jungler try to dive. So when they try to dive, and take turret aggro, they get engaged on and die. There's a huge emphasis on early vision so that you know where the enemies are positioned and you don't get caught out. Supports often roam mid too, so midlaners are also at risk of having 3-4 people suddenly be in their lane at really early levels.		Right now you will often see an ADC farming 1v0 while the support, toplaner, and jungler all roam early. The ADC tries to push the tower early (like by 5-6 minutes sometimes) and then create a lane freeze with minions pushing in the other direction to have the toplaner have a free lane. But that's far from an absolute. There's also the question of leaving Dragon open early.		4 - Instead of elevation changes, LoL has bushes that you can't remove or add to, so you still get asymmetric vision. The map graphics were also reworked at the end of 2014 and look a lot better now. Personally, I hate that Dota has a turn rate, and that's why I don't play the game at all. At this point it's a matter of opinion.		5 - League is a great game. I fucking love it. I watch it for like 20 hours every week during the regular season, and I follow roster changes during the offseason. I probably spend 8-10 hours a day involved in League of Legends some way, whether editing the wiki or reading articles or watching games or reading my Twitter timeline which is 95% LoL personalities and analysts. Yeah it's not for everyone but just because I would never play Dota doesn't mean I can't have a fucking great time watching The International.","depth":1,"score":70,"ups":70,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RheingoldRiver","name":"t1_cvjti67","parent_id":"t1_cvjs9zb","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443679462,"created_utc":1443650662}

{"body":"Ok well last year Samsung White and Samsung Blue were BY FAR the best two teams in the world, and the next-best team was probably SK Telecom, who wasn't even at Worlds because NaJin White Shield managed to pull off a miracle run in the Korean gauntlet and beat SKT to qualify for Worlds. Then at Worlds they returned to their former inconsistent selves. And SSW and SSB faced each other in the semis. So every (hardcode) League fan knew 100% without a doubt it was going to be not even remotely close. The ONLY question was, would SSW get overconfident and throw a game, or at least a lead in a game. The casters did a really good job of hyping it up for people who didn't already know that going in, but on the other hand they got people's expectations way up and so people were disappointed.		This year there's three strong contenders - SKT (Korean), EDG (Chinese), and LGD (Chinese). We should actually have a really good finals barring any one of those teams suddenly immensely improving relative to the other two in the past month of bootcamping and scrims.		Anyway, there's still a bunch of variation. I think that we have less variation in between roles because there's less hard counters. So the advantage that you have to have Champ A vs Champ B isn't worth it to shut down Champ B unconditionally vs having Champ A in their most desirable role. So I think it's fair to say that games of LoL are decided way less in champ select than games of Dota (don't crucify me if this isn't true pls). But that also means that you have a lot more riding on your tactics of how you play out the game - which again makes it different not worse.		There's also a decent number of champs that are flex picks - Shen top/support, Kennen top/support, Ekko mid/jungle, Yasuo top/mid, etc.		So yeah if your definition of strategy is "good champion select decisionmaking" League is less strategic than Dota. But you can also say well, the way that this team executes lane swaps is way better than the way this other team does - they have a huge strategic edge in the sense that they understand what goes on in lane swaps a lot better and so can consistently make better tactical decisions.","depth":3,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RheingoldRiver","name":"t1_cvjw7y3","parent_id":"t1_cvjvn1t","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443683972,"created_utc":1443655172}
{"body":"What he probably meant is compositions that change the entire gameplan for both teams. In DotA most heroes change how the early game/mid or late game plays out. For instance once you draft something like Chen, pugna and abaddon the enemy team is forced to react accordingly not only by picks but also by changing their game plan to counter the early pushing strat.		Same concept applies to carry picks since you dont want to approach an Anti Mage in the same way you approach a Naix. Picks like Spirit Breaker + Mirana or Nightstalker support/offlane/mid which force you to ward your side of the map and play deffensively with many tp rotations and possibly heroes with hard lockdown come to mind as well.		There are way too many variations in gameplay that depend on the drafts of both teams so i will leave it there, hope this helped a bit.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Animalgreed","name":"t1_cvjz06e","parent_id":"t1_cvjw7y3","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443688658,"created_utc":1443659858}
{"body":"Building on what Animalgreed said: it feels like in LoL, you NEED certain archetypes of heroes, and this limits the types of potential matchups possible. for example, is having no jungler viable in LoL? I would assume not based on my past knowledge. Is it viable to have no ranged ADC? I would also assume not, the most unusual "ADC" I have seen in the past was urgot but that got shut down by Riot.		In Dota, hero roles are a lot more fluid and varied, resulting in varied games. Your mid laner can be Puck, or it can be carry Naga Siren; each case is a huge dynamic shift for both teams. Your safelane 1 position can be AntiMage or it can be Centaur, again a HUGE difference in how the game will play out.		It's hard for me to see such unique cases play out in LoL. Personally, I find the game's foundation to be solid, but it seems like not too much out of the ordinary occurs. I can see how the focus on execution can make watching LoL exciting, but for me, Dota has another level, both the execution requirement and crazy strategy required.

{"body":"Exactly. It was built to not have turn rates. What LoL may lose in creativity of mechanics (like Batrider's Napalm) it gains in responsiveness. This is why so many LoL players complain about turn rates. It feels sluggish compared to LoL. When you get used to it you barely notice, but coming from that game to Dota feels a lot different. 		Then there's the argument that LoL's melee carries can't succeed because there's no turn rate, but we all know that's bullshit. Melee carries (in an ADC/hard carry fashion) don't work in LoL because itemization cannot cover your weaknesses. Almost every single melee carry (or even melee hero) without a gap closer in this game builds some form of mobility, whether it's the racecar build, casual SnY, Blink Dagger and so forth. In LoL, you can't do that. You're stuck with a short range, long cooldown blink and maybe a slight MS increase on an item. There's no Skadi, Abyssal Blade etc either that lets you stick on targets. The champion mobility creep only made the problem worse.

How can you compare the two games' strategical depth if you don't know jack shit? The fact is, there is way more decision-making in DOTA which gives it way more strategic depth. 		-----------------------------------			E.g. Just using Laning as an example more than demonstrates my point. League of Legends is always 1-1-2-jungler. Always and forever. There is no thinking when planning who is going to what lane. That thought does not exist. There is no thinking in the draft in regards to laning. You know who is going where. 			In DOTA, you can run 1-1-3, 1-1-2-jungler, 2-1-2, 3(offlane analogous to top lane)-1-1 , 1-1-2-roamer, and so on and so forth. Not only does HERO COMPOSITION in the overall game matter when drafting against the enemy team (some heroes are good against others) but composition and lane-destination also matter IN THE LANING PHASE. (X hero is weak against Y and Z heroes...SO PUT HIM IN ANOTHER LANE). Wow, enemy safelane has 3 heroes but they are weak laners? Put your three strong laner heroes there and FUCK THEM UP by thinking and planning and STRATEGY.		DOTA is a game about out-thinking your opponents as much as it is about out-mechanically-skilling them.

{"body":"Dude's an asshole, and makes stupid points. Except just the one. Kind of.		To DotA players, the idea that you don't have the full hero roster available to you from day 1 is unfathomable, because DotA heroes are all incredibly unique and massively counter each other. It is incredibly common that there is only 1 hero in the pool that brings what you want to the team.		From what I understand this isn't really true in League. Subbing one ADC for another often doesn't change the flow or counterplay of the game. Not only that, but 1/2-2/3 of the champ pool is just straight up unplayable in pros. Hence the fact that one can have only a few champs to pick and still not lose much strategic depth.		And yet that still grinds my gears as a player... There are differences between champs, however small they may be. Therefore being able to pick between champs is a strategic decision, one that can help you win the game. If I can only choose between 5 and my opponent 25, he has an advantage over me. It may not be big in League, but it sure affects the outcome of the game.		To give you some context, DotA 2 makes money off of selling cosmetics, like League. The kind of shit that we consider "pay-to-win" are things like projectiles being slightly harder to see because of the cosmetic you are using, or having my spell animation look different when I am playing rubick because the other guy has a spell animation cosmetic and I don't, making it so his team is never confused about who is casting the spell.		People get up in arms about this shit. They complain that P2W cosmetics reduce Rubick's ability to mindgame their opponents. Now imagine if Rubick was a "Pay (or grind) to unlock" hero... and the complaint is that some people can't even pick the hero. Huge difference. You go from something piddly to something big. Concrete. Established. That's why I strongly disagree with League's monetization, because the P2W mechanic is already there. It's not really arguable. Counterpicking is a strategic decision that can help you. If you are unable to make that decision or have restrictions on the decision you can make, you are less likely to win. Period. It may not be much less, but it's not zero.		Also, the fact that it's "grind or pay to win" rather than simply "pay to win" does not help your case. Regardless of the means required to gain an advantage, there are still external forces aside from skill at the game that affect the game's outcome.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BWEM","name":"t1_cvjv8gj","parent_id":"t1_cvjuchm","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443682312,"created_utc":1443653512}

Probably missed couple of them, also I am sure veteran player knows how to counter this champs, but for a newcommer this is thought to deal with!		No recall, the fact that I have to run back to base is really unappealing.		Strenght, Intelligence and agility/spells don't scale, in LoL there is AD and AP stats and spells scale off of those stats, to compensate for that scaling Dota gives their heroes ability to one shot (Lina comes to mind)		No one speaks english. Russians, Russians everywhere.		Turn Rates! Kiting seems way too clunky in Dota, I want to do it as fast as possible, not to wait for my character to turn around.		Once you die you lose gold, now this is the only reason I think someone may find Dota harder, and I also find this stupid, because of money starvation, if you get killed two or three early to mid game, you will be still siting on branches even 30 minutes into the game.		And there are more things that come to mind, but smaller things and finneses which I could probably get use to.

Also realize that everyone is playing with turn rate and use it to your advantage. Wait for the enemy to walk towards you before initiating so they can't run. Or attack from behind to prevent immediate counterattack.  Chase down ranged carries. Pick bat rider for that sick turn rate debuff. Burrow strike behind the enemy before channeling epi (guaranteed solo kills).		Gold gain from kills scales with net worth difference. Go trade your life for the enemy carry and your coming out ahead.

{"body":"To reply to your issues in order, and hopefully in a fair way, I will say this.		1. Yes Dota games can take a long time, just the way it is I guess.	2. The issue you have here, as you rightly said, is not know what to do to counteract these heroes. This is mainly because Dota is admittedly less accessible than LoL, as the countermeasures are not always intuitive or readily obvious to newcomers.	3. There is an easily bought and cheap item in dota which allows you to not only teleport home, but teleport to any of your teams buildings.	4. I feel this is a complaint about the general opness of heroes in Dota, which is true but the balance design of the game is if every hero is op then they end up balancing each other out.	5. Turn rates are there as a way to balance the game, but this is ultimately a question of personal taste	6. Losing gold is a thing but it can be played around if you know how, again this is an accessibility problem with Dota. Also you could learn to die less as another work around.	7. "I have spent too much time/money to switch" is a sunken cost fallacy which, unfortunately, a lot of LoL players feel due to the heavy investments of costs/time needed to progress in LoL. Just because LoL is not wholly free to play does not mean that this is sensible reasoning as to why you shouldn't enjoy another game.","depth":4,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Giant_Badonkadonk","name":"t1_cvk0n75","parent_id":"t1_cvjz2js","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443691448,"created_utc":1443662648}

{"body":"the same can be said largely about league for most roles.  Really the only thing that keeps dota champion diversity up is that there exist genuine hard counters in this game like broodmother, bane, huskar, etc.  That stuff doesn't exist in LoL.		either way I've watched a lot of tournaments of both games and the big tournaments in both games end up the same way: a general pool consisting of about 1/4th the total champion pool with some wild fringe picks here and there.		Dota is probably better to watch, but for other reasons.  Games are just more exciting when you know what is going on.  Even though I know everything about league, the games can be pretty boring.  Excitement around plays is generated not from how amazing they are but from how rare they are.  There just isn't enough action in LoL.  There is interesting strategic rotations and minor outplays in lane, but that is just not fun to watch.  League highlights on average do not compare to dota highlights and the legendary league plays over the years can't compare to dota's top legendary plays.  The most legendary league play of all time is more about the player and less about the play (Faker's 1v1 outplay).		What's great about LoL is the personalities and the way pro teams are run and the pro scene.  I am some rabid CLG fan when it comes to lol and I can't explain why.  Dota?  even though I played a lot more and find it more interesting I just can't get behind any team because teams shuffle so often and no identity has been created outside of a select few teams.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Pennoyer_v_Neff","name":"t1_cvjwt4h","parent_id":"t1_cvjw689","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443684947,"created_utc":1443656147}

{"body":"Ahem... I will never support League of Legends. The company was founded on just some awful fucking action taken by Pen, Guinsoo, and many other people involved. This below just sums it up better than I could.		*DotA-Allstars.com Visitor,*		*Some of you may know me; many of you probably wont these days. This website was born on October 14th, 2004. It was a mere 2 months after I turned 18, and it was the first website Id ever made. Guinsoo was the lead developer (before Icefrog), DotA had no competitive scene and maybe 5% of the players that it does today.*		*In the years that followed, the site turned from a small forum with only 30,000 users to a massive community with over a million visitors every month, a million page views every day, and a staff of over 100 volunteers. Its been incredible discovering the generosity of individuals who selflessly donate their time to create a positive experience for others.*		*In the summer of 2008, I met Guinsoo in real life for the first time. He and his boss were in town and they wanted to meet up and go out for a steak, (how could I say no!?). I soon learned that they were working on a game based on DotA, free from all of the limitations of the Warcraft III engine and Battle.net. Several months after meeting them and after several trips to their offices to learn more about the project, I joined the Riot Games team working on League of Legends.*		*When I first joined the team in September of 2008, my original intent was to work on League of Legends full time and continue to build DotA-Allstars.com into an awesome thriving DotA community after Icefrogs departure.*		*While I originally intended to leave this out of this letter, in light of the fact that this information is now out in the open, I think its important to set the record straight. Many believe that Icefrog left because I wanted to commercialize, and he did not. In reality  I had learned that Icefrog had been secretly working for S2Games after conducting a series of meetings where he was attempting to sell a full DotA game concept to a number of companies (including Riot). The differences of opinion that we had were merely that I chose to be transparent and honest about the project that I was working on, and the direction my career was going.*		*After working on and launching LoL, I began to realize that  in addition to having no free time anymore  with LoL available to play I no longer possessed the passion for DotA which once drove me.*		*The traffic on the website slowly began to decline, settling where its at now (about 50% of where it was a year ago), and I recently realized that I had a decision to make. I could either continue to say that I would rebuild the website as a strong DotA community, knowing that my heart wasnt really in it, or I could archive the site, ending an almost 6 year chapter of my life that Ive invested thousands of hours into. Ultimately I believe that the right decision here is to not trick myself into thinking that this site will be rebuilt into what it once was, and to shift my full focus and time to my new project, with an eye towards the future.*		*This website and the DotA community will always hold a special place in my heart. Its been an amazing experience working with so many wonderful people and gaining so much insight about communities, people, and ultimately myself. There are more people deserving of thanks than I could possibly remember  so rather than leaving anyone out, Ill simply thank everyone who has volunteered or contributed to this site over the last few years, and everyone who helped make it one of the premier DotA websites in the world.*		*The website will be offline for the next week or so while the database is moved to its new permanent home where its contents will remain archived and available to the public for the sake of historical preservation.*		*In the meantime, I hope some of you will join me and over 3 million other players for a game of League of Legends (its free!)*		*Sincerely,*		*Pendragon*","depth":0,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SkitzoControl","name":"t1_cvk1080","parent_id":"t3_3n0jy2","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443692073,"created_utc":1443663273}

{"body":"DotA is a RTS at heart. Its philosophy is always to provide the widest and deepest tree of strategical options over anything else. In DotA, heroes are just "tools" that must be used for strategic victory. There isn't supposed to be more attachement between the DotA player and the hero he controls than between the RTS player and catapults. That's why we can have clunky or (seemingly) boring heroes, because all that matters is the strategical options each hero adds.			LoL is more akin to the regular action videogame. Champions there are supposed to be an actual representation of the player on the battlefield, like say Mario or Chun-Li, which explains why they have instant reactiveness on spells and movement, are generally packed with dashes and small spells, cannot be disabled for too long, etc... The whole metagame of DotA mechanics (lanes, creeps, roles, gold, etc) is more of a pretext for a battlefield in what is actually a team-based *fighting game*, where the focus is overwhelmingly at the player level, particularly his mechanical ability. 			In short, despite the apparences, the two games are nothing alike in their fundamental philosophies (which stems from their very different raison d'être, one as a community mod and the other as a Freemium game). 		If a new player is looking for a multiplayer fighting arena where you win mostly through mechanical prowess (like 90% of popular games), then LoL will be the more instinctive experience. If strategic wealth speaks more to him, he will find DotA far more intellectually rewarding. 		There are other factors at play but I think more people falling into the first category explains most of LoL's success.","depth":3,"score":26,"ups":26,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"splaza","name":"t1_cvk3w0f","parent_id":"t1_cvjsf93","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443697133,"created_utc":1443668333}

{"body":"Mechanics is vastly superior in LoL than in Dota2. But strategy is vastly more important in Dota2 than in LoL. There aren't a lot of clean counterpicks, and even if you're counterpicked, there are a lot of workarounds to it. In Dota2, it's much less forgiving. Let's try to break down the ways LoL is superior to Dota2, and vice versa (having played both games and followed both games in major tournaments and meta changes etc).			Why LoL > Dota2:	1.) Keyboard mechanics. While Dota2 may have different cast animations, LoL doesn't have them. This might mean it's easier to cast spells in LoL (which is true), but cooldown is also quicker. This means you tend to cast more spells within a shorter period of time than in Dota2 (where you have to time spells accordingly). This all might point to Dota2 being superior, except there are quite a number of heroes in LoL where to be really effective, you have to cast maybe 6 or more spells (including flash) all within a 1sec duration (see zed/lee sin). There are a LOT of easier champs in LoL, but there are also a lot of champs with really high skill caps.		This is why when the koreans came, they dominated LoL so hard such that it's often Korea > China > Europe > NA (despite NA being the most profitable region). That's why they have jokes that NA's diamond tier is Korea's bronze tier (bronze is like, 1-2k mmr)		2.) Skill Shots. This means positioning, aiming, and timing are all gonna be the difference between a kill or not (or surviving or dying). There's only, maybe a handful of heroes who have skill shots in Dota2 (WR comes to mind), but practically majority spells that "shoot" in LoL are skill shots.		3.) LoL is much more forgiving and more accessible to newbies than Dota2. Because there are less champs in LoL, and because each champ has their own job written down, it's easier for newbies to pick them up. This is why Riot is more profitable (in terms of overall revenue) than Dota2.		4.) Riot actually pays their athletes (only applies to NA I believe) with an actual regular salary. This results in a more stable career path for their players. This means you won't go paycheck to paycheck for tourneys. But of course, this means the slots are more limited.		5.) Riot handles the production of their tournaments very very well. From the direction, wardrobe choices, production, language used, you can see LoL tournaments becoming more and more like an actual sports event. You have instant replays, play-by-play analysis, pre- and post-game analysis. They even have, for a brief time, the one where they can doodle on the screens, make circles etc?  They have at least 2 guys just manning the camera for spectators so the casters don't have their attention divided. They show every action/kill as much as possible. This allows the viewers to see all the action happening at the map, even if there are two or three happening simultaneously (unlike in Dota2 where we sometimes see when two clashes happen, we're only privy to one match, and left to speculate how the other guy died).		Practically everything is handled very efficiently and professionally by Riot. 		6.) Some might flame me for this, but I actually like the limiting factor of hero pool by LoL. This allows me, a totally random noob, to be forced to play a few champs so I'll see how they can excel and be a bit better and have a more informed opinion of those champs. It also takes away the intimidation. And seriously, it's not that hard to unlock every single champ in LoL. You only also need a few runepages that you can use for various roles. 			Why Dota2 > LoL:		1.) Variety and versatility. The hero pool of Dota2 is way more than in LoL (5 bans vs 3 bans). While there are traditional positions (1-5), and while those also exist in LoL, hero roles are more flexible. You can have a core Lina, or a support Lina. You can have a lane KotL, or a jungle KotL. In LoL, the roles are more rigid. You can't have a Leona or Nami carry. (in pubs yes, but not in pro). The only instance I saw a traditionally support hero go midlane is Zilean (time bomb guy, really fun to play). But everything is pretty set in LoL.		2.) Strategy and teamwork is more rewarding. By this I don't mean the warm fuzzy feeling, but better teamwork actually gets more done in Dota2 than in LoL. Because of the complex variety of heroes here, there are way more interactions that produce a more superior effect (i.e. the sum is greater than the parts). 		3.) Replays are a godsend. Also because of this, anyone can cast their own version of the game, and not rely on Valve. (Side note: It's like how Riot is the overprotective parent or the giving tree that just keeps on giving, and Valve is the guy who will teach you how to fish so you won't keep bugging him anymore when he's drowning in whiskey.)		4.) Much more tourneys. Individual groups can host their own tourneys. This means a lot more people can have an income off of dota2. Also more chances for teams to earn more.		5.) Because of the number of tourneys, and because of the internationality of them, we're more exposed to teams from other regions as well. We see more "intermingling" than in LoL. In LoL, Riot owns NA and EU streams. But if you wanna see the korean vids, you either have to donate in twitch (I think?) for MonteCristo to release the vods. Anyways, yea.			I think I've been fair to both games. Both games are similar, but also reward very different things.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"penatbater","name":"t1_cvkjh8f","parent_id":"t1_cvjsf93","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443740699,"created_utc":1443711899}

{"body":"I appreciate the effort, Rheingold. It is indeed exciting that kindred communities can share the love of their content. Awesome to hear of a LoL player enjoying The International.		I don't think I will watch LoL Worlds, though. Because LoL had more players and bigger prize pools, I was curious to see what the game would be like. However, the cartoony graphics are a major turn-off (I imagine Final Fantasy fans love them). I don't really feel I can see what's going on, and everything just seems like a bunch of similar-looking characters blinking around and spamming missiles at each other. I guess that's one reason why LoL players might enjoy watching Dota, even without knowing the game; you can clearly see what's going on and feel there's a story to the action. 		Reading through the comments here, it seems the general consensus that people like LoL either because it's the first MOBA they played and because it's simpler than Dota. I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise for me, coming from Warcraft 3 and later the Starcraft communities. The games were going places, had an exciting scene for years, but Starcraft always seemed limited because people would find it so hard to play, which would mean that the players pool would be limited despite it basically being a national sport of Korea at one time. Despite a boost at the start, SC2 started declining, and the scene started to get stale, which is why I started watching Dota instead 2-3 months ago. Earlier, I was disheartened when I saw that some SC2 pros quit to start playing Dota, which seemed silly, but now I'm excited about it. I didn't credit Dota enough in terms of the skill the game entails, but I guess it all falls into perspective :)","depth":0,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Asjo","name":"t1_cvjxqzf","parent_id":"t3_3n0jy2","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443686548,"created_utc":1443657748}

SKT are doing good. Faker was sloppy, but Marin... My god, he was a BOSS with Fiora and Rene. They are worth following, since I believe Faker will show off his power later.		Origen right now are really fun to watch. No one took them seriously, but my god, xPeke is performing.

{"body":"RIP Samsung :(		Last year there was a huge exodus of players from Korea to China because Chinese teams were paying better...so the vast majority of Korean talent left the country to go to China and play there, including all of the former Samsung players. Samsung got a new team and it's really, really, really terrible.		Fnatic - by far the best team in the west according to nearly everyone (except unrealistic CLG fans (did I say that?)). They have a chance of making the semifinals if they get lucky in bracket draw. But, their group is really competitive, so it's possible but unlikely that they won't even make it out.		C9 - yeahhhhhhhhhhh so basically it turns out they were only good because Hai is a brilliant shotcaller. But Balls has fallen off a TON since S3/S4, and Lemon's subpar mechanics are showing a lot more. Also Hai is just not a very good jungler, though having him back on the team is a good thing because they couldn't play without him ([context to this](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Cloud9#2015_Season)) They are only at Worlds because a, Team Impulse's mid laner XiaoWeiXiao got banned for Elo boosting; and b, Team Liquid just FELL APART in the finals that they were the favorite to win. They will probably not do very well.		LGD and IG - I personally don't watch very much Chinese league, but it's pretty agreed that EDG and LGD > IG, but all three of them are among the strongest teams in the tournament. Probably LGD, EDG, SKT > IG, KT are the 5 strongest teams present, and I wouldn't think that any other team has a chance at actually winning. But IG can be really good if they play well.		One of the most exciting things in this tournament is that the wildcard team from Brazil (paiN Gaming) got placed into a really easy group, so we might get to see a team from an emerging region actually win a few games (last year KaBuM (Brazilian) beat Alliance (European) in 1 game, but most people see that as Alliance being terrible in that game; this year we might get to see paiN win a couple games and think that it's because they're actually really good (given that they come from a Wildcard region).","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RheingoldRiver","name":"t1_cvjwmqf","parent_id":"t1_cvju5fw","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443684648,"created_utc":1443655848}

{"body":"Wildcard works differently in LoL from Dota (and your system is way better) - Instead of Wildcard being the top team from each region not already qualified or something, Wildcard is the top team from each of the /non-represented/ regions. So Brazil, LatAm, Oceania, CIS, Turkey, Japan, Southeast Asia (which is separate from Taiwan, Taiwan gets automatic seeds).		So a true wildcard team may have a chance at doing well (4th best Korean or Chinese), but the best teams from the non-represented regions are usually worse than the worst teams from all of the represented regions by a lot. So for a wildcard team to do better than any other team at Worlds is pretty meaningful.		(It's 2 wildcard slots total, that come from two of those 7 regions listed, not 7 wildcard regions. This year it's Brazil and SEA)		And yeah, China is HUGE right now. But, Korea still has some advantages - you can't just import talent who don't speak the same language and instantly be way better. So a lot of the Chinese teams with Korean players are doing it at least in part for the fame and glory of having the Korean stars on their roster - having 2 languages is really brutal for communication. Also Korea still has [Faker](http://esportspedia.com/wiki/Faker), SK Telecom's midlaner, who is the best player to have ever played League of Legends and it's not even close.

{"body":"Hey, sorry if some of these have been answered already.		Been long time since I watched any LoL so..	Can players swap tower aggro or are they pretty much dead when towers target them?		Have people finally started using TP player power thing as basic tool?		What are prominent strategies (push? split push? team fight? gank?) AND what heroes relate heavily on those strats. This I feel is very important for overall enjoyment for viewer.		What are "off the wall" kind of picks and what could they mean ingame, assuming someone does something different than norm.

{"body":"Sorry didn't see this before (I turned off inbox replies)		Swap tower aggro - no. Click the "expand for advanced info" thing [here](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Introduction/Minions_and_Towers#Towers) and it explains how tower aggro works.		But there's an art to tower diving well in League, and the teams that can do it well, do it REALLY well.		TP is taken pretty much always by every toplaner. Some midlaners are starting to take it also and therefore have 2 TPs per team.		Third question, I wrote a page on that [here](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Meta/Team_Compositions) in the guide.		Hmm that changes with patch. Earlier in the year there were a few teams that picked Poppy toplane and relied on teams overprioritizing shutting her down to snowball everyone else, that was pretty cool. More recently, some of the Korean teams have started running Kennen as a support alongside Kalista (so Kalista ult can throw Kennen into the team and he gets an AoE ult off on everyone for the stuns primarily). Also Trundle support might be a thing. PowerOfEvil, the midlaner of Unicorns of Love, has run smite on a ton of things in midlane - Ezreal (which was meta for a bit), Kayle (which is definitely not meta), and a couple others iirc. Also Sneaky of Cloud9 started playing Draven in the NA gauntlet to quality for Worlds.		Off-meta picks can mean anything really. It depends on what the champion is and how it's being used. Sometimes (like the Poppy) it's just a one-game thing where you see how it works, and sometimes (like the Kennen/Kalista lane) it starts to enter the more general meta.		Currently favored meta still varies between teams and regions. But a lot of teams are putting a lot of emphasis on early pushing towers with AD carries like Jinx and Tristana. Vayne as an AD Carry is also making a resurgence, though she's more lategame. Popular mids are Azir and Viktor - good waveclear and utility teamfighting but somewhat susceptible to assassination. Carry toplaners were recently buffed so expect to see some Gangplank, Fiora, Darius, etc.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RheingoldRiver","name":"t1_cvk3g6w","parent_id":"t1_cvjv4jd","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443696344,"created_utc":1443667544}

I feel like it boils down to the fact that Dota has a huge barrier of entry due to the increased depth of mechanics.  League players dont see the value of Dota b/c its a game that is less successful and therefore seems pointlessly  and stupidly difficult and unfun, while Dota players see League as a game with less depth and therefore as a shallower game that is pandering to more casual players.		Outside of the gameplay, League's developers are much more interactive with their community, while also being much more predatory.

{"body":"I'm just pulling from memory, but I want to give you a good response because people are being stupidly hostile to you.		I know at one point before LoL came out, Riot was running ads implying LoL was DotA2.		Riot pushed various multi-game tourneys to exclude other MOBAs, and eventually tried to make it contractual, which drew public outcry and ended the attempt.		Riot tried to prevent sponsored streamers they highlighted from ever streaming other games, not just competing MOBAs.  It was largely due to streamers playing Hearthstone between long queue times.		Riot's parent company, Tencent is guilty of a ton of shit.  http://dotaland.net/2012/12/09/tencent-posts-an-article-on-qq-com-flaming-dota2-quickly-removes-it-but-not-before-dota-uuu9-com-posts-a-counter-flame/ is one example.  Back in 2013 leaked video showed a MOBA they were developing and the map looked just like DotA2.  They were believed to be the driving force that got DotA2 removed from the WCG in favor of LoL.		Riot tried to trademark DotA to stop DotA2 from happening.  The old engadget article on this appears to be dead.		Tencent tried to lie and tell chinese players DotA2 would cost 100 bucks USD before it came out.		Sadly a lot of the links to support this stuff are dead now.		That all being said, I don't hold this against LoL all that much.  I mean, big Chinese company doing shady shit should surprise no one.  I'm pretty sure most companies would try to do this shit if they had the power to get away with it.  Most of that isn't coming out of Riot's offices.  And Riot is investing into their own community in ways Valve just doesn't, I might not LIKE that they've tried to get exclusivity, but I get it.  And it's paid off, they're the biggest game out there.  LoL isn't a BAD game.  We can say we think it's inferior to DotA2, that's fine.  i don't think it's inferior, I think it's gotten out a lot of the unintuitive complications to make a much more accessible game.  I'd rather play DotA, because fuck simplicity for me, but hating on League for existing is just dumb.  Riot paved the way to expand eSports into the much bigger thing it is now than it ever has been.

Oh one other thing I forgot people got mad about.  When LoL first shipped, a lot of the champions were clearly inspired by DotA heroes, to the point some of them were basically two abilities each from two different heroes, or built around the same signature abilities (think Garen compared to Jugg, Ashe compared to Drow) with modifications in the other spells.

{"body":"Thanks for the effort, really appreciated, but LoL is just insanely boring. I do watch pretty much every bigger Esport final if i have the time for it, CS:GO Quake Starcraft, even Beat 'em Ups, and considering i don't play any of those games they're still fairly enjoyable to watch. 		But LoL is just boring. Not much else to it, really. Although i've to admit Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone are just as boring, but they're on the same casual level so maybe that's why. 		And yes, i've tried to watch LoL several times - at some point, they start to beat each other up, and usually people just split and run away and nothing happens, and that's it. Occasionally there are big fights where people die, but it's insanely hard to tell what the freak is going on because the graphics are bad so it's hard to tell what is happening anyway. 		Even tried to play it. It was awful. There was that guy dancing in front of me, taking lasthits, and i couldn't kill him, harass him effectively, denie him or do anything to him whatsoever apart from watching him farm while i was farming myself. I mean, what the heck, how is that even fun? 		I hope you enjoy your world finals, but there just ain't no going back to a game that hasn't even 1/10 of Dota's depth once you've played Dota long enough.

Stale, generic skills, no "big plays", no comebacks, or even if these things do happen, they do in magnitudes smaller than in Dota.		I understand liking it because you are ignorant to the ways of Dota, and simply have never known anything better. But why would *I* like it?

Anyways...		>Why in gods name would I want to watch from a players perspective from inside a client when I can do that from any streaming site on the planet?		More interactivity with the game. It's called a game for a reason and despite the fact that you're watching (or in your case dribbling on your bib with your riot dildo stuck up your ass) a match it's still a very interactive environment within the client that you just cannot achieve in a live stream. 		>Don't need replays in the client.

You just.. ya know... go do it. ;)		Your drawing a parallel and it doesn't even fit. People going into war are most likely trained to some extend in non-threatening conditions. Compared to dota, league is a much more stagnant game, revolving more on what's optional in a very dry and dull sense of the meaning. Unlike dota where item builds matter on a game to game basis and not a checklist like league. Despite this some people may feel the need to practice mechanical skills, how their hero works with certain builds, ect. and riots refusal to work on something like that angers the community. Mostly because it reminds them that riot don't care about the community and would rather take their money for half assed heros and shitty skins. It also annoys them by keeping them from practice that they themselves deem useful.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"getoutkunkka","name":"t1_cvk8fg0","parent_id":"t1_cvk4r3l","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1443707280,"created_utc":1443678480}
