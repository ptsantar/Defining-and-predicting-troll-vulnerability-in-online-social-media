{"body":"Q: "Why do you play with an asshole like Puppey?"			A: "Puppey isn't an asshole, you must understand that we came here with a lot of freedom, we were told to do whatever we want and that is what we're doing. Puppey and I came here to cast the games so you can't blame him if he doesn't want to sit here and play on some couch and stay here and entertain people. On top of that, a lot of you guys flamed him a lot so. You must understand that when people spam flames, it still hurts your feelings no matter what. Like let's say one of you guys sits here with your girlfriend, and that chat starts spamming bad stuff about your girlfriend, that 99% of you will react badly to that. Because that is emotionally draining no matter what. Puppey is no different than you guys or me, he's just a human, you must understand that. If people came to my girlfriend and talked shit about her, I know it's just troll or people try to be funny or just try to provoke, this is their job, this is what they try to do, I understand that but still when you realize these things, they still happen in your brain and your heart, it will just be taken in no matter what.	It's like if I tell everyday to some guy 10 times a day, "you're an asshole", he knows I'm an idiot. Everytime some guy says you're an asshole, at some point, you know he's a fucking idiot, you know you're smarter than him, whatever but he will say 10 times a day, you're an asshole, at some point snaps fingers you're just gonna snap because it will somewhere there in your brain, it will be put in words into us, we have emotion. So you must understand, furthermore Puppey doesn't want to be much of a puppet person. I'm the same, you guys ask me why I don't stream, I answer that I don't want to draw too much attention to myself and the reason I do this now is to give something back. So this is a good chance for all of us, and maybe I can do this in half a year or something, depending on the situation. Puppey and I don't want to draw too much attention to ourselves, not everyone wants to be a couch celebrity, big brother style. We like to play the game (dota) and we know we're good at the game, this is what we do.","depth":3,"score":54,"ups":54,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dementepingu","name":"t1_chrwe4c","parent_id":"t1_chrvh4r","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1401185104,"created_utc":1401156304}

The point he is trying to make is that those kind of questions that he was being asked are too open ended to really answer.

Perhaps some people might find it a bit distasteful but it's not exactly some super-misogynistic comment - it's the kind of joke I have heard women make about themselves. It's also pretty clear he isn't aiming it at Sheever because he goes on to say "and that guy also understood that, the second he asked that question".		I think the issue comes because it's not particularly eloquently put across - remember he's not a native English speaker - and he delivers it kind of bluntly.

Having played with a lot of pro gamers, I know that all of them are assholes if you look at them from a certain angles. Somes would be even more douchey on camera because they are under the pressure to entertain and appeal the viewers. And the difference between cultures doesnt help either, stuff PPY did might as well be common everyday among the CIS countries, or being passive instead of expressive is a common thing in asia which seen in Korean/Chinese players.		To me, this is just a fucking stupid celebrity culture thing and I still like PPY for his personality and talent. He brings much more positive things to the scene than negative things and im ok with that.","depth":1,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"uw_NB","name":"t1_chrmtu8","parent_id":"t1_chrinv6","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1401161393,"created_utc":1401132593}

"What would be the perfect balance" between scrimming and strategizing. He answers "The perfect balance would be the perfect balance". Lumi laughs and Sheever insists "50-50? 60-40?"

The idea being that he's extending it to the twitter person asking the question - they already know the answer and know how things work but are just wanting someone else to say it for them.

It's not the most politically correct thing I've ever heard but, for example, plenty of people joke about something like "When she asks you if 'her bum looks big in this' the only answer she wants to hear is 'NO'" and it's basically along the same lines.

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw PPY trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
