submission: { t3_2mrdoz	DaenysSeregaryen	Valve, you're treading a dangerous path with this Arcana event.	1416393119.0	1416421919.0	0	116	116	0	t5_2s580	DotA2	 }
{"body":"**People are severely misunderstanding the event so I'll explain what we basically know so far:**		**This Event isn't only for players with the PA arcana.**	The PA arcana triggers the event but that just means there needs to be 1 player out of the 10 people in your game that has it. 		**Items are rewarded to the team that completes their objective.**	This means that if you're on the team with the PA, your objective is to assist the PA in getting a kill on the announced target. If you're on the opposing team, you have to keep your target alive and kill PA.		**Whichever team completes their objective will win items at the end of the match.**		**tl;dr: You don't need the PA Arcana to participate in the event.**		Now as for the other main issue that people are having with this event, being that they don't want it to occur during Ranked games and such, **Day 3 hasn't been announced yet. It could be in a completely separate queue to normals and Ranked.**		The best bet is to voice our opinions and let Valve do their thing but since the update is going live this week there's probably not much they can change, so just wait and see what happens.		This isn't going to heavily change anything in matches; it's still about killing heroes, which leads to winning games. **This event won't be permanent either, the Day 2 update page said it expires on December 7th (when the sale ends) so it's literally only going to be active for at most 2 weeks.**","depth":0,"score":485,"ups":485,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jord627","name":"t1_cm6vb74","parent_id":"t3_2mrdoz","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1416423883,"created_utc":1416395083}

Also, if I pick a squishy support or a carry that needs protection, and I'm the target, my game is instantly ruined, because I can't do anything myself to stop the whole enemy team focusing me down until they kill me, and unless my team help me, I'm just gunna have a shitty game because somebody else bought a funny looking suit for their sword lady.		This isn't call of duty, we don't need anything encouraging players to focus on kills more than they already do.

This is true, but people without the Arcana will only play it every now and then (and with no choice over whether they play it or not, given that it's decided by other people in the game). Meanwhile people who buy the Arcana can play it pretty much on-demand and almost every single game if they choose to.		People who pay for the Arcana are definitely getting something extra in the game which is non-cosmetic, and which people who don't pay money do not get, even if they'll happen to play it occasionally anyway.		> This isn't going to heavily change anything in matches; it's still about killing heroes, which leads to winning games. 		Except it's not. It's about killing a *specific* hero as soon as possible, with no regard to other long-term objectives in the game. To say it doesn't change anything because killing heroes is a game objective anyway is really naive in my opinion.		If you changed Dota so that the first team to take down mid T1 received 10,000 bonus gold each, that would completely change the game and most openings would just be 5v5 mid. Even though taking down mid T1 is pretty much a necessary step to winning the game, you've shifted the priorities so that one thing matters far more than anything else early on.

Just think about this, many people were going to buy the arcana with event or not, myself included, this item drop thing mostly helps other people that aren't going to buy it since as i have said before, if you spend money on dota you're gonna get what you want anyway and drops are just a bit of extra for the heck of it (unless you get an arcana drop which is fucking amazing and btw i have had an arcana drop for me before) and if you are not spending money on dota you are gonna get the benefits of a guaranteed drop because someone else did spend money. So i don't know what all the fuss is about.

{"body":"> how does the Arcana or the event affec the gameplay?		Really, you don't see it? 		Sure people picked PA before, but personally if I had the set and had this mini-game for a limited duration, then for the time that this event exists I'd be picking PA almost every game. I mean why not, if there's a decent chance of getting items? If I'm buying the Arcana then chances are I already like her as a hero, so why not just pick her every game for a month?		And once I've picked PA, then the mini-game completely skews the early game. Sod laning. Sod getting last hits. Sod farming sensibly. The first thing my team is going to do is try and 5-man gank whoever the target hero is, so that we can all get free hats. Which means that every single game with an Arcana PA is going to have a completely retarded opening where the majority of the players aren't trying to play normal dota. And maybe you don't want to bother working towards the mini-game, but regardless of whether you care it's still going to mess up your game if two or three people on your team do. 		It's easy to say that it's just free stuff and people get it anyway from time to time, but it's clear that people do give a crap about getting free cosmetics - just look at how much people kicked up a fuss when Diretide didn't happen even though it was pretty widely accepted that the mode itself wasn't that fun and was just a way to farm free items. 		If the mini-game is actually what people have speculated it is, and it's not a separate mode, then I can see All Pick being a bit of a shitfest until things blow over assuming that enough people actually buy the Arcana to begin with.","depth":1,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rosti_LFC","name":"t1_cm6x7fp","parent_id":"t1_cm6v96d","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1416432213,"created_utc":1416403413}

All those who purchase the Phantom Assassin Arcana will enable themselves to be eligible for this event to initiate in their games.	Both Normal and Ranked Matchmaking are currently adorned with this new mode and the related FAQ. | Preview	How does it work?	When a game is started, a player the Phantom Assassin Arcana will be given a contract to kill another player in the game. The contract will be publicly announced to everyone so every player knows who the target is. The mini-game is defaulted to start around 15 seconds after the game begins.	Once the contract has been accepted, two things can happen - it can be fulfilled or denied. If PA kills her target, then the contract is considered fulfilled but in the turn of events if the target slays PA, then the contract is considered denied. It is required that these two kill each other and not by team mates.	If PA completes her target, she along with her team mates will be rewarded for fulfilling the deed but if the target takes down PA, he and his team mates will be rewarded for denying the contract.	At the end of the game, the rewards are listed out. If no one on the team owns a Manifold Paradox (PA Arcana), the reward will be left unclaimed.	Additionally, gaining more score during the course of the event will let you unlock two new colors for the blades on your PA arcana. | Preview","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bronnen","name":"t1_cm79zpx","parent_id":"t3_2mrdoz","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1416457314,"created_utc":1416428514}
