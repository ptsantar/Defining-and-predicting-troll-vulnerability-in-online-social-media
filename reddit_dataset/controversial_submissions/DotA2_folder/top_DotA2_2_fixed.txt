I think DOTABUFF is just really pissed off that Valve blind sided them with this and basically invalidated all the work they did for the past few weeks/months on DBR.

The way to make this work was to open a dialogue with Valve before releasing the premium part of the site, not encourage haters to spam them after.		If someone made a website that compiled data about TL users and then charged them for parts of it, if even 10% of our userbase complained, we'd shut it down pretty fast. Then after that, they'd complain that we weren't letting them monetize by releasing data from our users? I mean that's kind of ridiculous right? I know it's not a perfect analogy but I totally see why Valve decided to do what they did.		edit: also, with the title, "Valve shuts down Dotabuff" wtf? What kind of sensationalist title is that?

With regards to the issue at hand, it certainly does suck and I agree there are better ways for Valve to handle this, but pushing to use of the WebAPI is something that needs to happen.  I agree Valve shouldn't straight up shut-down the alternate methods until the WebAPI is capable enough to take over your use cases for it, and I agree Valve aren't treating the WebAPI has a huge priority - I have issues with it myself that I'd love to see resolved.		If you guys were using unsupported methods (i.e. not WebAPI) to gather your data then you are somewhat to blame for not having a back-up plan, or not forseeing this coming; though if you guys were in an open dialogue with Valve then Valve too are to blame for not working with you guys to get you on to using supported methods to gather your data.

Second, you can look forward to an upcoming piece featuring EG's Maelk about how stats can be helpful.		Last point, after reviewing the features of DOTABUFF Plus, I am even more convinced that statistics are an incredibly helpful metric, even in the public matchmaking context.

And DotaBuff wasn't collecting data in a sanctioned manner. In their defense, the API was off for a long time, so they found an alternative method. But once it was back on, it was certainly Valve's right to limit data collection to the API. Once it was available and determined the be the only sanctioned source for data, DotaBuff really had no leg to stand on regarding the legitimacy of its collection. In fact, I'd argue further that once the privacy setting was patched in, DotaBuff should have stopped collecting data with respect for the privacy violation it represented. I had a few games scraped despite my privacy setting. Personally, I understand the circumstances, though, the API not yet being active, so I don't take it as a personal affront. It was unethical, though.		I actually traded comments with Tharuler here in the subreddit regarding his willingness to implement the system without the site's own privacy function. Whatever the results or value of the poll in regards to DBR privacy, it definitely indicated that some people don't want to share. I think it was again unethical to launch the system without an opt-out. It's probably even unethical to run the site without an opt-out.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Idomis","name":"t1_c83r39k","parent_id":"t1_c83qwf3","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359198604,"created_utc":1359169804}

However, as Valve have shown (and I really dislike the way people are suddenly ignoring Valves incredible history as a customer/gamer-centric organisation) they very often have a plan, and I think (as Cyborgmatt puts it) that they really need to be pushing for WebAPI improvements instead of drama.		For example, with slight development the WebAPI could be modified to allow full, but anonymous, data dumps, which could then be made public without fear of an negative DBR/MMR system being implemented. Alternatively, DotaBuff could completely scrap their DBR idea, alert Valve of this, and ask Valve for special access which allows them to access matches.

Dota 2 is a game developed and owned by Valve. Technically, the data that Dotabuff was scraping belongs to Valve (if I've read their User Agreement documents correctly). 		When asked what type of communication Dotabuff actually had with Valve, the Dotabuff folks were pretty vague about what had, and had not, been said or agreed to. And when a third party is trying to monetize a service based on another company's IP, the onus is on the third-party to secure the necessary permissions, rights, and whatever else is necessary in order to offer their third-party service without interruption.		We will probably never get an official response from Valve directly related to Dotabuff. The only things they have officially communicated, by their patch and the patch notes of yesterday, is that they want:		1) third-parties to access information using Valve's official WebAPI;		2) Dota 2 players to have the option to control whether or not their match data is accessible to third-parties; and		3) data sharing to be an opt-in (that is, you have to manually give permission), rather than an opt-out (you have to manually remove permission), thing.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goldrogers","name":"t1_c83pgba","parent_id":"t1_c83p766","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359192674,"created_utc":1359163874}

But you are also right that the patch's privacy setting technically did not fully come into play until a few hours ago because of two things:		1) The WebAPI was down (apparently it is buggy and comes and goes, and Valve still needs to put more development into it for it to work completely reliably...) until a few hours ago, and		2) Dotabuff did not use the official WebAPI anyway in its data collection. As such, even after Valve patched their official API/data scraping mechanism to work with the privacy setting, they did not disable the unofficial mechanism that Dotabuff was using to scrape data until a few hours ago.

To be honest, you were already playing with fire when you let people publicly view W/L Ratio when Valve explicitly hides that from the public, and I can see how you making it seem like DBR was going to be a publicly viewable stat (which I fully believe it was intended on being as part of the Plus package) would cause Valve to think twice about what types of data they let people gather and aggregate.		That being said even if they spoke with you and you worked out the terms and conditions, nothing would prevent another 3rd party from trying to do the same thing.  A large part of this community has been very vocal about their concerns about the damage that a publicly visible numerical skill ranking could do on the community, and what DBR proved is that though Valve wanted to stay clear of that threat, they *can't* stop 3rd parties from doing what they want with available data.		I feel your Hail Mary woe-is-me newsletter to get the ship turned around is childish and though you may not like it there are limits and risks to working with data provided freely by another organization and you have to work within that.

The result is a combative environment, where lower rated people are blamed and abused for problems with the match regardless of if it was their fault or not.

Valve have not been open or communicative about this at all either (although I'm sure we all know they don't want us knowing our MMR ratings), but from what Dotabuff have shown us, I don't think they can honestly say they have gone to any great effort to keep Valve informed and allow them a chance to give their official opinion.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Stealth107","name":"t1_c83r903","parent_id":"t3_17aao9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359199187,"created_utc":1359170387}

Maybe this hypothetical site would have public rankings that could easily be posted into the chat by the use of a program combined with the status console command when the game starts. 		Valve didn't implement the privacy settings to shut down Dotabuff directly. Once DBR was announced, it put forth the idea of a 3rd party ranking system that *any* site could implement their own version of, public or private, which is not what Valve wanted. 		The game's still in beta, and maybe Valve is still working on their own system. The teams system was somewhat recently made available to all players, so I wouldn't be surprised if Valve wanted to make a ranked team vs. team MM ladder since that's actually how the game is supposed to be played competitively. Valve's current hidden MMR is only there to give you a decent match. Anything that puts a number next to your name should be 5v5 established team games only.

If DB wants to continue to provide a good service to the community, PLEASE dont do it through harassment and childish actions. Im not sure if DB can pull out of this hole THEY dug for themselves. 		Actually, no. I doubt what valve did was a direct response to DotaBuff. Maybe Valve saw possible flaws in the future through collecting information that could compromise their security. Im not sure the cause or reason, but we can all agree that DB stepped out of line on this one.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GalacticShonen","name":"t1_c83u3g3","parent_id":"t3_17aao9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359210882,"created_utc":1359182082}

I had alot of fun with my friends when DBR came out comparing our numbers, and looking at match history to see where we did well, and where we did badly. It was nice to see that we lost a game which we thought we were surely going to win, because their team had some incredibly skilled players.

Dota 2 works off a very specific free to play business model. That being that no player is disadvantaged by spending less money and the only change is purely cosmetic (doesn't affect gameplay). This is a very different business model to other free to play games of similar nature for example, LoL, where paying yields a significant advantage. 		In the same way people making money off Dota 2 through streaming/youtube provide a free service (making money off a few ads) with an option to pay (subscribe) to remove these ads. This means that there is no advantage in paying.		In contrast to this DB's payable service provides a very clear advantage in the extra stats/more extensive breakdowns. This is diametrically opposed to Valve's approach with Dota 2 and due to the name including the word Dota it can suggest a clear relationship between the 2 and it can even be concluded that valve has some measure of control over the model of DB.		It seems entirely possible to me that this is a contributing factor to the decision to regulate the data received by 3rd party companies.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Duckman_10","name":"t1_c83sd76","parent_id":"t3_17aao9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359203419,"created_utc":1359174619}

In summary: Guys, we don't need statistics and numbers to have fun in Dota. Think about it. Aren't win rate percentages and ELO rating influencing HEAVILY how you play the game? Haven't you found yourself playing Dota not because it's Dota but because you desperately needed to preserve that 55% winrate or get into "Diamond"-Bracket? Did this not make you frustrated as hell and thus more susceptible to rage?  		I think the community is better off with Dotabuff leaving the picture. Dotabuff doesn't say why you're good or why you're bad, it only displays a dead number which isn't really reliable, nor perfectly accurate. And on top of it all, it has the potential to tear our lovely community apart. We don't treat Dota as a fun game anymore, but rather tedious work with disciplining "bad pub scrubs" and max tryhard mode. We should all chill a bit.

I dont know how many man hours they spent on it, but from personal professioanl experience developing websites, I know this wasn't an overnight process. I assume this took weeks to develop and they did it for free. With their success, they are probably getting a ton of traffic (with no advertisments) and they are still footing the bills for hosting (probably several hundred a month for bandwidth and storage).		There are tons of free services that have optional premium content for users that want additional content. Wordpress, one of the biggest open-source CMS platforms, is free and there are hundreds of premium templates that third parties make money on. Third party Twitter feed software has advertisement placement, thus making money of a product they didn't create. 		Hell, this kind of mindset could easily see Valve as trying to make money off someone else's product. DOTA 2 wasn't a game built from the ground up. A huge chunk of the game development process was already done. Re-building it isn't easy, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than concepting / developing / balancing from scratch.

It's bad enough that players can make fun of you and can be a complete dick if you do anything wrong, but to let them have access to ELO ratings just lets them start to make fun of you before the game even starts! 		**TL;DR: Stats are not healthy for this game**","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Portalfreek","name":"t1_c83nvjv","parent_id":"t3_17aao9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359187044,"created_utc":1359158244}

{"body":"The issue is not that Valve was providing Dotabuff data previously and has now decided to deny them that information.

Recently Valve launched a new WebAPI for Dota2 which is their official, supported way to fetch information about Dota2 games. Simultaneously, they patched the security vulnerability which Dotabuff relied on to data mine previously.		Dotabuff's problems are due to (1) their previous method of data mining is no longer available and (2) the Valve WebAPI does not provide the information they need for DBR, due to Valve's privacy policy. 		Whether or not Valve's privacy policy is a good decision is not relevant to the fact that Dotabuff should have never expected to be able to monetize a service based on data that they gained from another company through arguably illegal means.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fiercecow","name":"t1_c83vxo6","parent_id":"t1_c83pt7b","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359224022,"created_utc":1359195222}

I know these "numbers" aren't everything and there are in-game decisions (for example) that are not represented by stats but have their influence on my performance, but still, I felt a bit better when I did more CS/minute in a recent game et cetera.		I acknowledge public stats may give potential trolls the ability to spy on their teammates and harass them (for example *HEY, YOU SUCK, YOUR WIN RATE IS ONLY 49%*) but to be honest, trolls are trolling no matter what resources they have. If they can't blame you for your statistics, they **will** find something else. Side note: I never got trolled because of win rate or stats even though I'm not good.		I can see that some people don't want their stats to be available for public. I'm okay with VALVe's decision to implement a privacy value. I'm also okay with it being defaulted to *private*. For my part, I'm only interested in my own stats.		I do not know how the API works, but if it means that **everyone** has to have their profile set to public to parse the data of the match, then this is a bad decision VALVe made. If the settings of the other participants in the match does not matter, fine. I don't need to see names or profiles when I analyze my statistics.		"*The WebAPI only came up yesterday, which means even if we wanted to switch to it, we had no time to test and implement it.*" - If this is true, that was a (minor) mistake VALVe did. Give the developers some time.		If this *feature* has a negative impact on spectator mode and/or replays, such as replays being unavailable when someone in the match is *private*, I *will* hate it. But again - I do not know how it works.		The thing with DOTABUFFs DBR... only visible for yourself is good, making it visible for those who subscribe is just unacceptable. I know, companies want to make profit, but ignoring someones privacy settings is not the way you should handle it. That was a bad move.		I'd rather pay for the use of the site at all (like ELOBUFF) than ignoring someones privacy.		Also, DOTABUFF should not post icefrogs mail account there. Icefrogs mail account is public, but below such a post, it is quite clear that icefrog will have some mail flooding his account, no matter of what's in the mails. Icefrog should be able to focus on development, 1000+ mails won't help him.		The valve contact form, meh. May help, still better than Icefrogs mail account.		Linking the developer forums to talk is okay in my opinion, though.		**TL;DR:** Valve has good intentions, but the way they did it, was not the best way imaginable. Dotabuff had it's upsides, but the subscription system for private stat access was a huge mistake.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fractura","name":"t1_c83p53r","parent_id":"t3_17aao9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359191533,"created_utc":1359162733}

{"body":"There's a huge amount of comments here, and I've tried to read through all of them because this is kind of a big deal. I didn't succeed, but I certainly stopped to read important points.		To the people of Dotabuff: I hate to see you go. I enjoy seeing my own stats, and sometimes the info in Steam simply isn't enough. Your staff are alright by me, by every standard.		With that said, I must also say that, although I wouldn't Valve to intentionally implement features that essentially forced your site to shut down, it was a terrible idea to think of implementing DBR, despite how many people wanted it. I want to take you back for a moment to the year 2004, when a little game known as Halo 2 launched for the Xbox console with the capability of connecting to Xbox Live to play with your friends and rivals. This game implemented a public ranking system, ranking players from 1-50 and showing them on public leaderboards. This lead to more cheaters (stand-by, anybody?), modders, and flaming than any game I had ever encountered, as now there were bragging points and you could show off to all of your friends. The Halo community hasn't recovered from that, and is still generally considered to be one of the most volatile and intolerable video game communities in existence, thanks in no small part to its size and this feature.

{"body":"I think valve and so icefrog know a thing that a lot o people dont seems to understand.	Though it is useful to have a clear way to see someone efforts, there will be no mmrating in modes others then the CM, for the simple reason that those are not competitive mode.	Even if everybody say so, in the current state dota 2 isn't a competitive game for the average player (although it has a competitive scene).	Valve with the decision of not allowing mmr showing keep the competitive scene and the game "for fun" separate (rightly for me).	Dota 2 itself to be succesfully other than his circlejerks had to be enjoyable to casual gamers, yet keep his core higly competitive. (esport recipe: casual gamer have fun>undestand the game>whatch dota tv>the scene grow )	A gamer who want to have fun in all pick or single draft dosent care of his mmrating (if you dont show him) cause will take the game as it is: a platform to have fun, becouse the matchmaking sistem sole purpose is to made up "good games" whether you are playing alone or with friends or you are a scrubs o a veteran, everybody can go in queue and have a reasonable fun game.	Keep the game clean of misundetanding and the competition a real competition, if you wonna play the dota 2 competitive game you need to: 1 find 4 other persone and make a team; 2 play captain mode with your team, we know the game is tuned compeltely on the captain mode where the pick phase is more then half of the game. (unlike league of legend where the skill of the single has enormus impact on the game and the pick are relatively meaningless, in that regard you will be "cool" on solo/duo queue ranked games)	If you add a mmrating meter to the dota 2 sistem, the mm become a "proving ground to test your skill", anyhow with a relative skill far from the real competitive gamer skill.	And test is the key word, having be tested constantly while trying to have fun with a game made fun is not good for the game enjoyability. Simple like that, not like some shitstorm about flaming bronze scum and people dota-penis.	New people will feel the pressure of being terrible noob at the game and will quit (look at hon) veteran will be stressed to prove they are good, good at what? playng all pick? that's bullshit It will only make the game and the gamers experience worse.	Valve will implement support for a competitive sub-professional scene soon enough, average team support and so on, that will be "our" nonprofessional proving ground.	And if you dont care shit of playing a team game with a team, dont worry valve will support modding for the worst of the bullshit map warcraft 3 will be ever capable of offering.	my 2 cent >_>","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_c83pjna","parent_id":"t3_17aao9","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1359193015,"created_utc":1359164215}
