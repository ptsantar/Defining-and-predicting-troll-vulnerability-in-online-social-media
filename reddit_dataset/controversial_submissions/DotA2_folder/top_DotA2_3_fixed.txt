{"body":"You are misrepresenting a lot of the information in this post in order to make it seem like there are real problems with undying.		First of all, the base damage, and zombies spawning on illusions are posted in the "brainstorming" section. Here is the title for that section. 	>Forum: Mechanics & Gameplay Bug Brainstorming		>This is for discussing things you feel are wrong, or are uncertain about, but aren't sure its a bug or not yet.		Zombies are supposed to linger for a bit before despawning when you go into fog or go invisible, they don't keep vision on you when you go uphill, or into fog, the just continue to run at you. The official bug on the list even says "and die too fast when the target goes invisible" 		Sure, the heal is instant, that is either a bug, or something that was done on purpose. Who's to say if that is actually a bug.		Here is the worst case of misrepresented information. Flesh golem heals too much from "Hero creeps", it gives the "hero" type healing instead of creep healing from warlock golems, primal split spirits, visage familiars, etc. It doesn't heal too much all the time. You make it sound like every heal he gets is larger than it should be.		Here look. I can do the same thing but biased in the opposite way!		http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=101098 Decay doesn't effect invulnerable heroes. Not only is this a bug, but it actually makes undying much weaker. He could use this to stop puck from blinking out of phase shift etc. he also loses that opportunity to steal strength.		http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=63772 Soul rip actually damages allied couriers. If there is a courier in the area while you cast soul rip, it loses 25 hp. It shouldn't lose any health at all, 25 hp could be the difference between losing your courier and not.		http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=130917 Zombies lose vision instantly. In DotA Zombie vision had a 6 second fade time. This is actually huge. As it stands now, the hero who is running from you can turn around kill the zombie, and you lose vision to cast soul rip/whatever.		http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=135561 Flesh Golem heal is actually too low. It doesn't take decay stacks into consideration when calculating the heal when heroes die.

Undying is a snowball hero and pubs are just dumb at realizing when they have to stay away from him(soul rip and decay make able to hide just how much HP he actually has). the gold changes made it so that he can get a really good lead off of a greedy, squishy safelane. especially if they play too aggressive.

Not to say it is or isn't a bug, but the *volunteer* moderators on the dev forums have exactly as much authority to declare things to be bugs as you do, which is to say, exactly zero.  Their job is to maintain order and keep the forums orderly for Valve, nothing more.  They like to act like they're Valve devs sometimes, but that doesn't mean they know what they're talking about.  		All changes are assumed to be bugs until stated otherwise by a dev, but on the flipside, you can't say something that is a simple number difference from WC3 DotA is definitively a bug without word from a dev either, so no, it hasn't been "confirmed as a bug by the moderators in the official forum".  Well, technically, I suppose it could have been, but their "confirmation" carries as much weight as Jenny McCarthy's opinion on vaccines.","depth":4,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SpartanAltair15","name":"t1_cr394z8","parent_id":"t1_cr37t4s","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1431169240,"created_utc":1431140440}

Nothing the volunteer mods say is Valve's official opinion, and they have absolutely nothing but conjecture to provide as to whether a change is a bug or intended.
