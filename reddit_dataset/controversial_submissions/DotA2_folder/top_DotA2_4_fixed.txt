Because there is no limits to the container due to the hole in the cave the carbon dioxide would mainly collect the bottom and push itself outwards which could cause a decrease in the pressure inside the cave compared to the outside of the cave meaning air from the outside would be drawn in due to the pressure gradient and because the air being drawn in is 21% oxygen, technically it is actually possible that new oxygen is pulled into the cave.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"arteezyfanboy","name":"t1_cy0alvl","parent_id":"t1_cy066hi","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1450247406,"created_utc":1450218606}

{"body":"No, Valve can't win on this.  Look at immortals... Valve had said they were polishing them up since they weren't ready to be released yet and Reddit was a shit-show for the next month.  The only thing we know to be certain is that /r/dota2 will continue to complain and shitpost unless Valve gives a very specific timeline.  And what happens then if Valve doesn't meet that deadline?  Jesus, this place would be even worse than it is now (I can't even imagine...).		So Valve has three options.  1) They can stay completely silent and just release stuff when it's ready.  Except then we get the constant stream of shitposts we've had over the last week, getting worse each day.  2) Or they can give a teaser to let us know it's being worked on, but hold back any info on release date (because once again, that'd be worse if they didn't make that deadline).  3) The "business" approach would be for them to set the release date 2 weeks past when they expect to have it ready and release that date no matter what, even if it's ready sooner (you don't want to set higher expectations for future releases).  I think we can all agree this would be a bad move, even though it is the only one that would prevent complaint threads.		So no, Valve shouldn't say anything beyond a teaser.
