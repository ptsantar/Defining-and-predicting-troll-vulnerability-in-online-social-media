{"body":"Well I'm not 100% clued up on how Dotabuff scrapes (If you have any articles on it I'd love to read up), but given Tharuler's friend list I'm fairly sure they're using a bunch of automated clients. Seems odd to me; I'd have wiresharked the traffic from the server to the client and replicated that, so presumably this isn't possible.  That said, most of the squirrels on Tharuler's friend list are offline right now, so perhaps they have multiple methods.		Automating clients is something that is a constant problem for games companies, but it's something that Valve can (and do) work on. The behaviour of a data-scraping client would be pretty obvious if you were looking for it, so it'd be pretty simple to put a stop to it.		As for mimicking the client's requests, you could shift them over to a secure protocol, or simply tag all of the client requests with the steam account that sends them and ban/flag any steam account that makes, say, more than 50 requests within 5 minutes without playing a game.  While you can beat that with many Steam accounts running requests slowly, you can easily create enough hoops to jump through to ensure that it's basically impossible to run a site like Dotabuff and actually profit from it.		Edit: So I went and read up on this on the dev forums, and it's all pretty clever but totally do-able, and, as I suspected, you have to sign in to Steam, so my theory stands: it is easily detectable behaviour.

Another thing I'm not sure if I enjoy or hate about D2's matchmaking is their obsession with trying to get as many groups into a game as possible. An example would be for each team to have 2 pairs of friend's that queued with each other and one pub each, or a group of 3 on each team etc etc. It might sound like a good thing, but more often than not it's just a pain in the ass especially considering how absolutely fucked the matchmaking regions are when it comes to language barriers.

There should not be a public rating for matches with random teammates, however for fixed teams it can be great (i don't know if there is actually a possibility for creating a fixed team in dota, but if there isn't then please ignore everything i say regarding it).		There is absolutely no accurate way of determining skill level for a game where you have two randomly assembled teams of five players each. No matter how you look at it there will be a skill difference between team a and team b (team a may well have the best individual player, but still lose). 		This is however different if you have a fixed team of five (or possibly more if you include substitutes) who play together, and at that point you can rank them as a single entity resulting in a fairly accurate team rating (however this is still not a indication of the skill level of the individual player as that may well be above or below what the team rating is situated at).

If Valve does not want this, all they have to do is tweak the API and the problem is solved.","depth":2,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Legym","name":"t1_c821f94","parent_id":"t1_c821c3y","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1358967159,"created_utc":1358938359}
{"body":"Dotabuff doesn't use the API (some may remember they were around as stats.dota2.be before the API was even implemented). If they did, they wouldn't be able to collect stats, since the API has been down since The International 2012, apparently because multiple people or groups of people were trying to access the stats from every replay ever so they could build up a database. All these information requests were straining Valve's servers to the extent that it was affecting live games in the run-up to The International. That's one of the reasons Dotabuff basically has a monopoly over Dota 2 stats collection - nobody else has a ready way to collect the stats, they'd have to build up a system which does the same as Dotabuff first, and it's much slower building up a database that way than it would be to use the API if it were up.		If I understand it correctly (someone can feel free to correct me), Dotabuff gets stats by simulating requests from a game client to the replay servers and getting the information that way, so if Valve wanted to stop them from getting stats they'd have to block game clients from looking up replays or find a way of distinguishing between actual game client requests and simulated requests.		That said, if Valve didn't want Dotabuff to show some sort of rating, I think they could just ask Dotabuff not to do so and they would obey. I don't think Dotabuff want to get on Valve's bad side.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Trencha","name":"t1_c823zm6","parent_id":"t1_c821f94","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1358982453,"created_utc":1358953653}

{"body":"All I see is more crying.		I understand you're all very bothered that players will now be able to see if you truly are a good Dota 2 player, but like I've said on the Dotabuff forums, all you can do is DEAL WITH IT.		Player flames you for having low DBR rating? Laugh, mute them and report them for being abusive. Very simple! A party won't accept you because you have a low DBR rating? FIND ANOTHER PARTY. Chances are they probably aren't very fun/nice people anyway.		Bad players get flamed in-game for poor performance regardless. This is not new. And why is Dotabuff allowed to do something like this? Very simple: because they can. Valve provided the community with the API and the data needed to develop things like this. Surely they knew that somebody, somewhere would create a system of this nature.		That also leads me to my next point. If the DBR system really is as accurate as they say it is (which it very well may not be, we don't know yet), and your DBR rating is very low, chances are you really are not a good Dota 2 player and you have room for improvement in various areas of your play style. Time to start reading about the game, how the game mechanics work, how certain heroes work, learning about the items in the game, etc. 		The problem is bad players get bothered when someone tells them they're making mistakes, and things like this are their worst fear. My thoughts? Get over it. I'm a bad player, you're a bad player, many of us are bad players or have some room for improvement and that's okay. This will only affect the community if the community lets it, and right now, it seems like a lot of you are letting this get to your heads.		Edit: why downvotes?

{"body":"Okay, there are two separate questions: whether DBR is an accurate estimate of MMR, and whether MMR accurately represents players. Dotabuff says they're confident in DBR's accuracy, and with all the statistics they've gathered, they should certainly have enough information to estimate MMR fairly well. They haven't even released it yet, so let's give them the benefit of the doubt for now. We can get a better idea of how good DBR is once we have actual data to evaluate.		The meaning of MMR is the more philosophical question.		> Does it even rate a player on a hero by hero basis?		No, because the purpose of MMR is to create even matches. It doesn't know what hero you will play until the matchup has already been determined.		> And people looking up stats on Dotabuff mid-game aren't going to be doing it to assess "a person's average matchmaking performance over their match history".		>People will use it as a judge of a person's skill, which it has no relation to. You can see that in this thread, and any other thread you read.		It's true that "average performance over matchmaking history" isn't quite the same thing as skill. But skill is a very subjective concept. Skill can't be quantitatively measured. If you throw every game, your performance will be much lower than your skill. If you don't perform as well as you could, that's your own fault. However, saying there is no relation between skill and average performance is ridiculous. They're not exactly the same thing, but there's clearly a correlation between them.		Does it really matter that much whether people understand the difference between performance and skill when they flame you? It sounds like you want to dismiss judgments based on performance with the excuse "my skill is actually higher than my performance indicates." Or "your rating is only higher because you're a tryhard who picks op heroes."		> Unless it's being used in some sort of matchmaking system, it's an irrelevant statistic.		MMR *is* used for a matchmaking system. DBR is just an estimate of your MMR.		Imagine that dotabuff actually had access to everyone's exact MMR.

{"body":"There is no other metric that can be used to measure, or therefore predict player skill than the player's ability to win, regardless of other factors. A trueskill-style rating cannot, and should not take into account the hero you're playing, your record with that hero, k/d/a or anything like that. It's simply a "this is the average value you add to a team" rating. It's probably gonna underestimate you if you play a hero you do very well with, and overestimate if you play one you're uncomfortable with. That's perfectly fine, as the rating isn't meant to be a game-by-game win-prediction, but rather a general indicator of skill and progress.		Sure, as a guy that can play any position and almost any hero, you might consider you're a better player than the russian guy that goes drow mid every singe fucking game he plays. Whether that's true or not is utterly subjective - the only thing a rating needs to care about is how likely is that player to win. You cannot measure adaptability, synergy, "impact on the game" or anything like that mathematically, due to different people having utterly different playstyles. But all those factors *will* affect a team's capacity to win, and therefore they are indirectly a part of the trueskill rating. Sure, you're just one player among 10, so in the short run factors outside your control will be a big deal, and the rating will only be relevant after a buttload of games. But in the end, *you* are the only constant element in every game, and everything else will eventually cancel out (or more accurately, come very close to).		Now, it's very true that winrate means very very little, as that doesn't take into account the skill level of your opponents / teammates. That's why the win/loss result is weighed by the predicted result. Win against a better team, you get a lot points. Lose against them, you only lose a few. "What if someone plays in a stack?", you might ask. Well, if they always stack, their advantage will be accounted for by the trueskill rating. If they rarely do it... well, it won't, but we already agreed that TS is meant as an average, long-term representation of skill, not a game-by-game indicator.		The only thing you absolutely need for trueskill-style ratings to work, is access to every single player's results. Dotabuff has that.		tl;dr - skill = capacity to win games. Therefore, the only factor you can use for measuring skill is win / loss results. Any other metric will only disrupt the results.		It is very very likely that Valve use the same kind of system for their matchmaking, as it is the most logical way to go about it.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"blimp","name":"t1_c823mc9","parent_id":"t1_c821d3q","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1358981062,"created_utc":1358952262}

{"body":"I must apologise for what I'm about to say but those that are against the DBR are plain idiots.	Nobody will alt-tab at the beginning of the game, check out your DBR then start flaming if you are a low-skill player without the game even starting. They will wait for you to do some shit move and then start swearing, which would have happened anyway.	If you make a mistake and you get flamed at it probably means you should first understand what you did wrong and try to fix it and improve yourself. You are complaining the community sucks as it is. That's not right, having 30% of the community constantly swearing and complaining of you or your action does not make a bad community. Those 30% would swear at your wrong-doing without DBR. DBR just gives them arguments (if they are correct and you are a lower-skill player than they are) so instead of whining about what other people might think or say about you, why don't you just ignore the cursing and focus on improving your game and maybe even listen to what they are complaining about. I think in half of the cases, idiot or not, swearing or not, the flamer that blames you is correct in saying you made a mistake (especially if you are a new player or consider yourself a low-skill player). 		I usually play in the medium-high bracket, I do not think highly of my game and once every 3 games I get in the same team with those kind of people that would argue all game long. I get flamed at, apparently my "whore mother" has something to do with my skill every 1 in 3 games. Sometimes they are correct, I make some kind of mistake and I know I did it right after it happens. Having them swear at me only makes me want to improve more and I usually don't respond them when I aknowledge my mistake. On the other hand when they are wrong and I'm doing just great and they're the problem I just ignore them or at most try to shortly explain them they're not correct. You would think this kind of people do not listen but you would be surprised to know how many times after being flamed at and explaining I was not the one making the mistake, they just drop it and slowly start to play better and the team fight improves. Of course there are exceptions, in my experience that exception means russians that simply don't want to think (not all russians, I've encountered really good russian players) but that doesn't matter.
