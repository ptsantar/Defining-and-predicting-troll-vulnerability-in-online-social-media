{"body":"His main point of discussion was suicide and how the online gaming community, namely Dota 2's community, was encouraging it by telling people to kill themselves.		Following his point about suicide I listed off more prevalent factors towards suicides. Far more people kill themselves due to scholastic related pressure than they do from being told to do so on an online game. If he wants to address the issue of suicide, then the school systems of the world are a much better place, both because of their denizens and their controllers.		You say that you can affect the attitudes of the people playing the game better than international education reform, but that isn't true. I would safely bet that the majority of the people on this forum lives in some first world nation which has a school system. Furthermore, I would venture to say that everyone lives in an area with a local governor, or the like. To send a letter to your local governing body or to start a grassroots petition is a simple task, and in doing so you could easily raise local awareness. Parents, especially those with children of that age, will tend to work with any movement attempting to improve the general life of children.		In contrast, changing the attitude of an online community is far more difficult, and I would say impossible. To do so would require the intervention of the makers of the games, Valve, and Valve has almost always held a policy of keeping out. Alternatively you could convince the entire body of Dota 2 that telling someone to kill themselves is wrong, and I think you've seen by this thread alone that that isn't possible or feasible in the least. The reason for this is because people have widely varying ideas of what is "okay" and what isn't, and many people consider telling others to kill themselves, especially in an online and anonymous environment, is okay.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NyaaFlame","name":"t1_cpgf1hx","parent_id":"t1_cpgewn1","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1426526183,"created_utc":1426497383}

Who do you think is more affected by the insult? The skinny person? Or the fat person, who knows he is fat and probably has suffered from bullying in real life. 	Even if he is a stable personality a tiny part of his brain will likely react to the insult. 		Another example would be a woman / man in a game which you insult both with a remark about women. The woman will be hurt more than the man. 		Insults which are closer to the truth hurt more. That's why people like to use your traits, when they insult you.		And if no information is available, people try to insult the average/ use stereotypes. The large majority of Dota players are male, and thus "faggot" is insulting their sexuality. "Virgin" is another popular stereotype insult. The other option is to use an insult which just tops everything. "Kill yourself" "Get AIDS/cancer and die". Stuff about  family, etc.		Should that whole described scenario be the case? No. But you won't be able to change it, since it's an underlying issue of society. 		And if you are affected by someone telling you to kill yourself, then I would honestly advice you to seek professional help. It's not "normal".

{"body":"Calling trolling meaning you think my comment are atrociously false and is there to incite drama? Do think about it. Why is it that people at 500 mmr can't get better? Is it because they don't have anyone teaching them? Is it because they don't have pretty cosmetic? Is it because their computer isn't as good as others? Is it because they don't have time to practice? You can think of over 100 possible explanations why they can't get better and just oversimplified by saying that they simply have no talent for the game. That's just flawed reasoning. You don't need talent to be good at something. Even artist practices and redraws a lot of times before they can draw a finished art. 		Well how about this,start imagine an average dota player (around 2k mmr). Now imagine how "normal" or "standard" their game is (missing last hit, failing to ward, no rotation, etc). Then you got 50% of other dota players who is worse than this average dota player. How is that possible? It's not like all these players are morons who can't think. No. They're just people like you and me. But how is it that they can't get better at a game despite being bad at it?		As I stated in my post, there're tons of resource that teach people how to play and be good at dota. There was a post earlier today on /r/dota2 teaching people about timbersaw. I read it and I learn a lot about timbersaw: differents way to combo and blink dagger is a good item. In 2009, I start out by being a Bronze player in League of Legends. By 2013, I become a Diamond player in League of Legend. In 2013, I start playing dota and calibrate at 3500. Now, I'm currently at 5500. How is that possible? I start out by being bad but then I got better. Was there magic involved? Possible, but unlikely. All I did was watch youtube guide and video of pro players playing and simply imitate them. I go from 3500 to 4500 by playing only bounty hunter and imitate funn1k.		Overall, like I said in my post, dota players are pretty mentally-impaired. That is not to say that they're inherently retarded or autistic, but meaning that they may have difficult thinking or have a right state of mind. And then you get to another topic which is the impulsive of dota players where players clouded their judgement by the flow of the game. There's a gifs in the front page today about ferrari storm forgot to use bottle that could've potentially save his life (it was the techies bait thingy).

{"body":"Because of the general context in which it's used. That's always the best way to figure out intent. What do they have to gain by having other people die? Why is a forum or *chatting in a video game* suddenly the place to voice such strong opinions about this specific matter, when almost everything else being said is taken with a grain of salt? Compare everything that comes up in chat, and try to figure out for yourself if "kill urself" should hold the weight that you're giving it. "The best evidence we have is their words" is extremely naive, and is the very thing I'm trying to convince you is wrong. 		There is nothing to be gained from reading so much intent into a single comment, one that is not backed up by explanations or reasoning, and which has all the signs of being a way to rile yo up or upset you, rather than being a sign of deep and real hatreds of the mentally ill. If you treat all comments as the same, everything said in a game or a sport or online as if it's a window into the most deeply held opinions of someone, as if exaggeration does not exist for the sake of offense, then of course language will be an impossible maze of hatred and madness.		As for your second point, that doesn't really say much. There certainly are people on edge, like myself, who definitely could commit suicide from such a comment. But that's because the general hostility of the world is tough to bear for people like me. A comment encouraging suicide could lead to a death, as could a bad game, a racist or sexist taunt, a breakup, losing a job, just waking up and feeling shitty, etc. I don't see anything you've said that demonstrates why removing a phrase would be helpful. Remove this phrase, imagine if Valve literally censored the text and it was never seen again, and I do not see a game experience which is any better for me. If someone wants to hurt me, they will, and words are not a limited source of which they will run out of if we keep striking things off a list.		I think it's wasted effort to have threads like this that attempt to police language instead of ones that reach out to those who want help. I find this puts too much attention on those who offend, rather than devoting energy to those who are hurt. Make a thread for people to vent or reach out when they're feeling down. I find it a better use of time to heal wounds rather than pretend we can create an environment without weapons, and to then debate over what the intent of those weapons really is.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpgfqrb","parent_id":"t1_cpgfhyk","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1426529894,"created_utc":1426501094}

{"body":">  If Sumail made racist, homophobic, or sexist remarks and tried to rationalize it by saying it was common in his culture, would you tolerate it? 		That depends on why you oppose it. You can oppose it because you don't like "toxicity" of any kind. Or you can oppose it because you don't like the fact that of all the things he could say, of all the ways he could flame, he had to bring gender/race/orientation into it.		Some of us believe in the right to engage in the flaming without bringing irrelevant discrimination into the mix. Therefore telling someone to kill themselves is acceptable because it's gender-, race-, creed-, religiously-, orientation- neutral. If he said this to someone in the workplace, it would be plain harassment.		Comparatively, people talking about how Sumail is a suicide bomber is necessarily based on his religion and/or nationality; it plays on the stereotypes of his ethnicity and religion. If this was said to him in the workplace, it would be a Title VII violation.		One is plain old "toxicity." The other is discriminatory.		In order for telling someone to kill themselves to qualify as mental disability discrimination you would have to show he said it to someone he specifically knew suffered from depression.		And honestly DotA is the last environment people should be subjecting themselves to if they are in a fragile and vulnerable emotional state. Flaming is part of this game, and any flaming at all has the potential to upset someone. You can wax and wane about changing it for the better, but the fact of the matter is that the culture of this game is simply not a safe space and it's absolutely ridiculous to think it ever could, or should, be.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gredival","name":"t1_cpgeo6h","parent_id":"t3_2z7ist","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1426524230,"created_utc":1426495430}

If anyone happens to be highly suicidal and easily influenced to the point that they would take a faceless piece of text in a video game seriously, then the odds are that they wont be playing dota. 		I have alot of experience talking with suicidal people and having been so myself. The funny thing is, these people who are telling others to kill themselves are the ones who are suffering the most.

For one try using proper spelling and grammar if you want to talk about a serious issue without looking like a retard. Also on your stats, the one stat you provided you have broken down to look advantageous to your cause, your missing the extra 35,000 from transport injuries listed right beside motor injuries in the table you just linked me to. The rest of your stats have no meaning. 		> More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease, COMBINED		This makes you laughable. No shit, young people don't get fatal illnesses out of nowhere. 		Besides none of that stuff even matters. If you wanted to reply to me with a meaning full comment, try addressing the fact that your post addresses a non-existent group of people or the fact that you clearly don understand mental illness or how to deal with it. You want to call me out on generalising depression based on sex? In a earlier comment, one which I already replied to, you said 		>  thanks for your opinion, but unfortunately there have been instances were people have killed themselves after being encouraged online		You just disregarded a persons point with a single incident. Talk about over simplifying problems. You even replied to me with "calm down". 		Here's the reason why this post infuriates me so much. I am on your side when it comes to the fact that suicide and depression is an epidemic, but you clearly have never experienced or understood what its actually like. The people you are talking about are non-existent, you would know that if you understood depression. You are wasting your time by trying to address the dota community. If you actually cared about depression, you would look for far more useful ways to raise awareness or tackle the subject. You look like you just saw an opportunity to be a white knight with the recent "kill yourself" comments in the dota scene so you did 10 - 20 minutes of googeling  and put together this monster. It seems very much like you don't actually care or that YOU are the one who is ignorant of how to actually tackle depression. When you don't even use proper grammar and you defend all your points with one incident or your simplified stats, it gives a stinking strong impression that you are just here to ride the karma white knight train. 		So I am going to say this again, if you actually care about depression, please delete this post, educate yourself about the issue and about what demographics are actually effected (random faceless comments in dota is not a significant reason why people kill themselves) and then look to raise awareness or do what ever makes you feel best in an area that actually matters.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpgex2q","parent_id":"t1_cpgefgq","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1426525535,"created_utc":1426496735}
