{"body":"http://forums.penny-arcade.com/discussion/comment/27572111/#Comment_27572111		Vapok - PAX PC Room Deputy Manager		"Another requirement that we started making a few PAX's ago, for the sake of bandwidth conservation, is that all Freeplay and Tournament games that are played, must have locally install-able servers or sponsored bandwidth. This did cut out a few titles (such as Battlefield 3) that simply didn't offer a local server option. Other companies have in the past opted to sponsor internet. That is why there are a few titles that are popular in the eSports arena that are not being played. It's not that we don't want them, just that we have to ensure that the network experience for both the Freeplayer's and the BYOC users meets expectations."		This is relevant.

This did cut out a few titles (such as Battlefield 3) that simply didn't offer a local server option. Other companies have in the past opted to sponsor internet. That is why there are a few titles that are popular in the eSports arena that are not being played.

It is a highly regulatory system in effect. You must obey property/event rules implemented by private individuals. 		Additionally, you might have to follow laws implemented by government in an anarchist nation. This is because many anarchists are NOT anti-government; they are anti-state.

By the way, the owners of Penny Arcarde are LoL players as well.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"markcocjin","name":"t1_cbzkgjc","parent_id":"t3_1liax8","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1378069138,"created_utc":1378040338}
