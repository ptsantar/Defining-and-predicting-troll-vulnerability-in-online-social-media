CM's taunt fits her lore, she also has that kind of playful personality (which we can also see in her arcana comics), so making snow angels sounds like something she would do.		On the other hand, Zeus has that superiority complex, thats what I get from his lines. I dont think him jumping like Mario really fits his character. Can you imagine Invoker dancing? It doesnt fit his character does it? Skywrath's taunt is also silly, he's a highly respected mage in his country's court, and you get him dancing and juggling his weapon?

Looking back at the previous Compendiums you can see them progress and how it became better each TI. With that said I feel like these taunts lack the quality of the ones made at TI3 taking us a step back.		I love Dota not just for its high competitive battles, but also Valves ability to create a beautiful lore what immerses me into this new world where I feel the rivals between the heroes.
