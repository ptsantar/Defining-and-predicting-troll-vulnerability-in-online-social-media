John goes to the police and tells them that Bob assaulted him. The police arrests Bob. 		Mike, Bob's friend goes to the cops and press and shows them the tape which clearly shows that John stole the wallet and destroyed the bar property. The police goes to the press and releases a statement that they have reviewed the evidence and have decided that Bob was in the wrong and ignores everything that John did.		It might not be the best analogy, but the point is, if you claim to have reviewed the evidence, you can't say that you've disqualified one team for breaking a rule when the other team broke 2 other rules before that.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nyctre","name":"t1_cyohmhc","parent_id":"t1_cyoca2w","subreddit":"DotA2","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","created":1452142860,"created_utc":1452114060}

One team flagrantly violated the rules in at *least* two ways in the logs they claimed to have reviewed: pausing without a legitimate reason and resuming the game without the other team's approval.		The other team never did anything to violate the rules. Their act lacked sportsmanship, yes. However, their claim that the game did not allow them to pause is perfectly believable given that many other players have experienced the same bug and the game in question had **already** experienced a major bug relating to pauses (the game should have automatically paused when one team was disconnected).		One team violated the "spirit" of the rules, possibly through no fault of their own. The other team violated at least two actual rules.

From this situation the admin team has learned to spend more time looking into these sorts of problems before making a decision. 		Sure it was a bad decision. But it was one among thousands the admins made without issue during this massive event. 		Nobody else has the tech to run something of this scale.

I think the initial decision was incorrect, given that the team that was disqualified didn't actually violate a rule by not pausing for the mass disconnect.  At worse Antipro was guilty of bad sportsmanship.  Even worse, there is a known bug where Antipro was unable to pause, which they noted in chat at the time.
