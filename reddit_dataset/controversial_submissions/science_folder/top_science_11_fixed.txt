{"body":"I wrote this response to another highly-voted comment that asked a similar question and (for some reason) got nuked (entire thread disappeared):		My understanding is that women were recruited prospectively: 37.5% of women who were eligible to enroll *before having the abortion procedure* agreed to participate. Retention rate, on the other hand, might be connected to regret, but it was rather high:		>Among the Near-Limit and First-Trimester Abortion groups, 92% completed six-month interviews, and 69% were retained at three years; 93% completed at least one follow-up interview.		Were the 62% of eligible women who chose not to participate *before* having an abortion intense regretters? Were the 31% of participants who dropped out before 3 years intense regretters? In the most extreme case, either is possible, and then the 95% figure would dampen a bit. 		A more likely scenario is that the non-participants and drop-out participants are slightly biased in one way or another relative to the respondents. There are simple and well-known methods to mitigate this problem (e.g., Call up some of the non-participants and drop-outs, offer them a much larger reward to respond, use their data to infer what the bias was, and re-weight all of your results accordingly... This can be applied recursively until you run out of money or time.). The problem is that this study was run on a pre-existing dataset, so the researchers don't have much opportunity to address those problems.

{"body":"**TL;DR:** You have made a few very common errors in your understanding of statistics. I'm going to do my best to elaborate on why they are errors. Such is the inherent danger of confronting interesting topics (like survey statistics) with a superficial knowledge, but IMHO, absolutely worthwhile if you are open to learning.		>Is it more reasonable? More extreme? 		We are *guessing* the % of non-respondents who would report regret. I don't know if 50% (my imaginary figure) is more reasonable than 5% (the rate from the respondent group). I do know that 50% is a more reasonable guess than 100% (the 'most extreme' figure that we entertained, and the source of your "only 25% of patients did not regret their decision" scenario). 100% would be, by definition, the most extreme possible sampling bias - the unsampled data are the opposite (and more unanimous) than the sampled data. That is an interesting boundary condition, but it is not worth a lot of our attention.		>If you thought it was totally random, then yes, 50-50 is fine, 		No, absolutely not. You are misunderstanding the definition of random. Random does not mean 50-50 on a 2-option question. Yes, a fair coin is random with 50-50. A weighted coin is also random, perhaps with 90-10. That is still random. Calling something random gives you zero information about the underlying distribution.		>but if we assume there is a bias, then 50-50 seem very unreasonable.		Again, you are misunderstanding randomness and bias. If the measured sample (the 37.5%) reports a distribution of 95-5 (regret: no-yes), then there is a sampling bias even if the unmeasured sample reports 90-10. Maybe they are 75-25. Maybe they are 50-50. That's also a (very big) sampling bias because 50-50 is very, very different from 95-5. To imagine that the unmeasured sample is the complete opposite direction (e.g., 40-60) from the measured sample is a very, very extreme form of sampling bias. Possible, but, again, not a reasonable assumption right off the bat.		>Why would non-participants be random, but participants not be? Again, assuming there is selection bias, which we assume there is, it becomes even more unlikely.		Please see my comments about the definition of randomness.		>Let's say I have a survey, where I go to college bars and ask young drunk women if they'd flash me for $50. Let's say I get 15% of the women to do it. Does that mean that 15% of women across the board will flash a strange man for $50? 		No. It means the point estimate for the mean of the binomial distribution is 0.15 under the circumstances surveyed (young drunk women in college bars on a Tuesday night in your town).		>You might point out that I have selection bias. But do you say that of those who I did NOT have in my sample that the rate would be 50%? No, that's absurd. You can't just assume it's random just because you didn't sample.		I have no idea what your selection bias would be. Do you tend to pick easier or more difficult targets? There is no way to know that without further information. Therefore, my initial estimate is that the rate of poeple you *didn't* ask is also 0.15. If you tend to pick easy targets, the real rate may be closer to 0.05. If you tend to pick difficult targets, the real rate might be closer to 0.25. It would be unreasonable to assume, however, that the true rate is 0.75 unless you were a very cunning and intentionally biased sampler.","depth":5,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"icamefromamonkey","name":"t1_ct3cy3d","parent_id":"t1_ct3ceba","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436909973,"created_utc":1436906373}

If 95% of the women said it was the right decision for them and did not regret it, does that also mean they did not feel guilt and sadness for having the abortion?		Some of the tables were a little over my head, but I think the conclusion is also interesting:		>In the three years after terminating a pregnancy, women tended to cope well emotionally. Women overwhelmingly felt abortion was the right decision in both the short-term and over three years, and the intensity of emotions and frequency of thinking about the abortion declined over time. Yet high coping and resilience were not observed among all individuals: those with more intended pregnancies and difficulty making the abortion decision experienced poorer emotional outcomes after an abortion. Individualized counseling for women having difficulty with the abortion decision might help improve their emotional welfare over time [41].

{"body":"> but it's not likely that the 95% number is going to shift wildly		Please don't think this way. You are making an extremely misguided and dangerous assumption. Study selection and bias are *extremely* powerful. For the love of God, do not underestimate them. This is one of the biggest mistakes that young and naive scientists will make.		For example, one of the reasons that smoking was initially debated as a cause for lung cancer was because of design and selection issues that took place in certain studies. For example, if you do a case control study of lung cancer patients you will find that smoking has a NEGATIVE association with lung cancer.		Of course, it is now very clear that smoking causes the vast majority of lung cancer and is a major risk factor for the disease. But what was happening is that many lung cancer patients were quitting smoking as they were diagnosed. The number of expected smokers was much less than detected in the case group. Thus, the negative association. 		This is just one example of countless. Bias doesn't just have the power to *modify* the truth. It has the power to *completely destroy* and cover up the truth. And the scariest thing about bias is that it can not be measured. The only thing epidemiologists can do is discuss and debate whether or not they think it was a big deal in a particular study.

The idea of regretting an abortion perplexes me.

And a majority of women who get abortions [ARE mothers](http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/characteristics.html).

{"body":"Usually when an individual finally decides to have an abortion, she has already made up her mind.  A clinical abortion is usually at least a one day process due to the medication they give you and how you will feel, so you already will likely need to take a day (or more) off work or school.  Having to take ANOTHER day (or few hours) off prior to the procedure just to meet with the doctor is a waste of time and might make some women feel that they aren't being taken seriously, or they haven't already thought about it.		Where I'm from, while it's much more streamlined, it isn't rushed and there is still every opportunity to get more information from the doctor/nurses and reconsider.  You call the clinic (once you have made your decision), and they ask you when you would like to come in.  If you would like to have an abortion as soon as possible, you can say so and they will make an appointment for the next available date.  The day of, you go in, usually wait for a bit and fill out some documents. Then you meet with a nurse who asks you a few questions, tells you the risks, and makes sure you want to do it.  If everything is fine, you then meet with the doctor who performs an ultrasound, and sometimes also an STI test.  Usually a bit more waiting if there are other patients, and then you go in for the procedure.  Afterwards you rest in a separate waiting room where some nurses check your vitals and take care of you until you start feeling better and are ready to leave.  They usually check to make sure that you have transportation arranged or someone picking you up as you can't drive afterwards due to the medication.  You then go home and have a follow-up appointment with that doctor or your own family doctor about 1-3 weeks after the procedure to make sure that everything is all good.		So after reading the above, why do you think ANOTHER doctors appointment would even be necessary?  Even on the day of your abortion you are allowed to say "no, I changed my mind" and leave, so why waste a whole other day doing mulling things over and having someone try to convince you otherwise?

{"body":"Do you really think that most women don't weigh their options or think things through before having an abortion?  Even those who might say "I didn't think twice--I just got one", usually say that because they have made that decision (after thinking about it), prior to conceiving.  For example, someone who is still a student with little to no financial income, might decide in their head that they would not want a child at this time, and would prefer to wait until later in life when they will be able to provide for and take care of a child in the way that they see fit.  So if by chance that person became pregnant (how is irrelevant), they might automatically see abortion as the only option.  It might seem like a quick decision to an onlooker, but in reality this person might have different life goals or plans that they have been thinking about for days, months, or years in advance, which do not involve children.  You don't need a physical white board with a list of PROS & CONS scribbled on to "weigh your options".			Edit:  I realize that this is /r/science and making broad statements like "all women" isn't accurate, so for that, I apologize.  However, to think that *most* women don't, or can't make decisions on the fly in their heads, or in advance to becoming pregnant is absurd.

{"body":"> is a logically defensible stance.		I don't really think *most* pro-life stances are logically defensible (for early-term abortions, anyway) once you understand the nuances of the science of pregnancy. When you consider that only 20% of zygotes become implanted at all and nobody cares about that, for example -- for "life begins at conception" folks, that means 80% of people are dying tragically in their early life, so where's the outcry about all those infant deaths? Then when you consider situations like ectopic pregnancy and challenge pro-life people as to whether we should leave an ectopic pregnancy to run its course because killing it isn't an option (possibly killing the mother in the process), they're forced to admit that in the early stages of growth, the mother's life is clearly more important than that of the bundle of cells that represent a potential person. Then it simply becomes a question of how much more important, and what kind of rights a newly-implanted deserves, because it's clearly a spectrum.		Eventually the question becomes "when are we *really* talking about a person, with all the rights to life of a full-grown human," and that's a tricky discussion, but it's pretty clearly not in the very early stages of pregnancy, IMO. And it can get even more complicated -- what about fetuses with ancephaly, where the brain does not function properly, and the fetus has no chance of life? Should a mother be forced to carry that fetus to term, only to watch it die immediately after birth? What physical criteria are needed for the fetus to be exempt from possible abortion?		There's a lot of nuance involved once you get into the nitty gritty, and I'm not expert enough to speak on all of it, but the basic point I'm making here is that most people don't understand the science enough to even have a worthwhile opinion on the subject. Most firm pro-life stances fall apart quickly under scrutiny, or at least need to be dialed back or modified to fit the reality of human development. Probably lots of pro-choice stances fall apart in the same way, of course.

Well, that's kind of a non sequitur. I'd put that under 'accidental death' along with car accidents and earthquakes. I think most people understand that miscarriages and failed implantations are things beyond our control. It's a non-starter for a discussion on abortion.		> they're forced to admit that in the early stages of growth, the mother's life is clearly more important than that of the bundle of cells that represent a potential person		I'm with you on the priority of life discussion, but you can't claim to understand the nuances of the science of pregnancy, and then talk about a bundle of cells or a potential person.		A fertilized egg is human life. There is no rational argument to be made here. Every human that exists began life as an embryo, and every embryo is on its way to becoming an adult human being (it doesn't stop at 'baby'). At no point is the organism replaced. It's is on a continuous development path culminating in a full-grown adult human being.		Biological arguments about abortion (e.g., 'cluster of cells', 'hunk of flesh', etc.) are formed solely to emotionally distance oneself from the natural revulsion from terminating human life. They exist solely to dehumanize the organism, to spare the psychological effects of deliberately ending the life.		> Eventually the question becomes "when are we really talking about a person, with all the rights to life of a full-grown human," and that's a tricky discussion		It's nice when people recognize this. The only rational argument to be had about abortion is regarding legal personhood, priority of life, and the balance of individual rights. Plenty of people are capable of differing opinions on this.		But biological arguments hold no place in the debate. They serve only to display ignorance of the biological realities of the developmental process and to distance oneself from the psychological affects of terminating human life.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"as_they_really_are","name":"t1_ct3h3hz","parent_id":"t1_ct388n6","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436916273,"created_utc":1436912673}

{"body":"> My point is that many, many people believe there is nothing magical about the start of the third trimester that makes abortion very suddenly wrong, and there are dozens of reasonable milestones one could conceivably use to try and guess at when "humanity" begins.		I agree there are a great many milestones we could use, though personally I think the only one that makes any sense is when there has been sufficient brain development for the fetus to be sentient and at least to some degree self-aware. I believe current medical knowledge places that at around 23 weeks of gestation, to the best of our knowledge.		What I think is utterly *unreasonable* is to define the beginning of human life at conception. Especially the early weeks, the embryo is nothing like a person. We may as well consider every sperm and every egg to be a human with full rights since, given the right circumstances, they too could produce a human. I am being a little hyperbolic here, but not very much. For the same reason, I do not think it makes sense to tie the time limit on abortion or the beginning of a human life to our medical ability to keep an embryo or fetus alive and developing outside of the womb. There may come a time when we will be able to grow people in a lab, sustaining the embryo and fetus and providing what it needs to develop into a fully functional human baby; but to say that a zygote is a human is stupid.		TL;DR I think the only logical, consistent milestone that makes sense is the point of sentience/awareness. The fetus is certainly alive before that, just like a lobster or raccoon (substantially less, really, since the early fetus has no cognitive capabilities), but unless you hold the lives of lobsters and raccoons to the same degree of importance as people then it's silly to treat an early fetus as a person with full rights. In the earliest embryonic stage, I'd probably replace lobster or raccoon with carrot or turnip.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sticklebat","name":"t1_ct3fe56","parent_id":"t1_ct38jje","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436913614,"created_utc":1436910014}

Rather, pro-life politicians have focused their energy on making abortions more difficult to acquire by forcing clinics to shutter and creating unnecessary obstacles.

{"body":"In medicine we use a concept called bodily autonomy. What this means is every person is to be given strict control over the decisions that will affect their body. When you are discussing a medical decision with a patient, any medical decision not just on abortion, it is should be presented as clearly as possible. You can tell them what you in your medical opinion would be the best choice in the situation but ultimately they have final say. 		Now we also create specific scenarios where by it is acceptable to remove or circumvent their autonomy. We do this because it's a funny weird sometimes sad world. We create things like age of consent/adulthood because we have to have a set "time" for laws to have an effect rather than a vague "well culturally your an adult now, despite the fact your only 15 years old". People are given control for family members who can't make medical decisions for themselves. If a child is in emergency need of a blood transfusion and parents deny one the medical staff can decide to overrule that decision and do it any way. These are concepts we have created over a long time of looking at what problems we have and coming up with what we feel is the best solution.		Abortion works on this concept and how we have decided it works in our society and laws. Women have bodily autonomy until 20 weeks of conception because up to this point the fetus is not able to survive on its own if born. After 20 weeks there are very specific and set cases where an abortion is still an option, medical problems as an example, but termination of pregnancy by choice is no longer allowed. 		Bodily autonomy is one of the most important concepts in modern medicine to me. I know it will always be a constantly shifting scale. Any time we as a society and culture make the decision to limit it that decision should not be taken lightly. By doing so you are infringing on the right of that person to control of their own body. They are the one in the best position to decide their own path in life.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DoctorTyphus","name":"t1_ct33ljp","parent_id":"t1_ct2wlbb","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436896791,"created_utc":1436893191}

{"body":"Brushing off a pregnancy and childbirth as essentially irrelevant to this decision is a very bad idea. Pregnancy and giving birth are not unproblematic events, otherwise I'm sure a lot of people *would* choose adoption over abortion. But it carries dramatic health risks to the mother that could potentially kill her, and puts a huge strain on her body regardless of whether she does get hurt or not.		You might like to know that what we're discussing here is famously outlined in the Famous Violinist argument made by Judith Jarvis Thomson:		>You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.		In this argument, the idea is that the violinist (or the Society of Music Lovers) cannot reasonably *demand* of you that you support the violinist for nine months until he is well, as this would constitute laying claim to resources that impinges on the bodily autonomy of another person. Likewise, even if a fetus may have a right to life, it does *not* have the right to lay claim to its mother's body for several months until it can survive without her, and so abortion is morally permissible. (There are a lot of surrounding criticisms of this argument, many of which are valid - I don't particularly like it myself, but it's what we're discussing, so oh well.)","depth":6,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"shahgaltaligu","name":"t1_ct2yruh","parent_id":"t1_ct2y9iq","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436889808,"created_utc":1436886208}

{"body":"> Shockingly enough, I literally cannot find anything to suggest that if person A is directly responsible for person B's predicament, and person B needs person A or they will die, that person A is actually obligated to do anything beyond stock standard help.		I think that's partly because we've fallen into the trap of stretching a analogy to the breaking point and found ourselves in the usual problem of argument by analogy; but, let's keep going.  		> In this instance, John is directly responsible for Dana's injury, and we presume here that if John does not offer himself up Dana will die. But is John required by law to do that?		Two points here.  First, legality and morality are not always in exact alignment.  This is one of the primary reasons that "many questions on the subjects are often answered with thought experiments" as we can strip away a lot of the messy details and analyze the underlying moral dilemma.  I don't think I'd have to dig too hard in the History Books to find examples of laws which we would now find to be immoral.  	Second, if we are going to talk about the legality of the situation proposed.  It's worth noting that the criminal liability for John will be vastly different depending on the choice he makes (assuming he's given such a choice).  If he offers up said organ (assuming this isn't fatal. Which I don't think I need to point out breaks the analogy pretty badly; having kids is rarely fatal), at worst he will face charges of malicious wounding, assault and battery or the like.  He will probably end up being civilly liable for the medical costs incurred as well.  If he fails to offer up said organ and Dana dies, he will probably face a charge of manslaughter (possibly murder) and may still be civilly liable for the medical and funeral costs.  While our current legal system may not *force* him to make the choice, it does strongly encourage it in one direction.  	On the moral question, it does seem that he should be required to give up the required organ.  Again, assuming it does not mean his death, it's a choice of some harm against John versus a lot of harm against Dana which is the direct result of John's actions.  		Also, again I want to take direct issue with the analogy you've picked.  		> John and Dana got into a fight. They were very angry with each other, and in the end John shoves Dana to the ground.		You've picked your analogy to assign some of the culpability to Dana.  I fail to see how that is applicable to the situation of pregnancy.  I would think that the analogy would require that John is horsing around and knocks Dana to the ground without provocation, with the rest of the analogy being similar.  Does that change your view on the situation at all?","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LandOfTheLostPass","name":"t1_ct30z4o","parent_id":"t1_ct2zq3z","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436893084,"created_utc":1436889484}

I understand that there is hard evidence that supports societal improvements with legalized abortion, but how can I look a mom in the eye as her baby dies on a ventilator and say that I've tried my best and then go on and support the end of an otherwise healthy fetus in the name of autonomy.

{"body":">If this is true, shouldn't there be some kind of measurable criteria regarding development that would have to not be crossed for an abortion to be permitted?		Yes. There are standards of consciousness, self-interest, and ability to feel pain that indicate moral rights. Research into the neural development of fetuses allows us to know with increasing precision when these characteristics develop. It obviously varies from fetus to fetus, but most abortions happen nowhere near the time these start to come into play. 		>It's not a settled matter that unborn children are not people before the third trimester.		Of course it isn't because this is an ongoing debate. But I have never heard a compelling argument that a fetus with no self-awareness or ability to feel pain has the same moral rights as me. If you want to say that it does, you must come up with an better alternative definition of personhood that an early stage fetus fits in to. 		>How can you measure personhood accurately and with enough confidence to bet someone's life on it?		Research. If we know what qualifications give a fetus moral rights, it isn't that difficult to study their brains and determine when those characteristics arise. Current research indicates that those occur during the late second trimester through the third. If you don't want ambiguity, you could be very conservative and only allow first trimester abortions where no fetus would be developed to that point. After all, the overwhelming majority of abortions happen in the first trimester so it would only eliminate the "questionable" cases. That is not the opinion I hold, but it is far more reasonable than arguing against all abortions.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"craigthecrayfish","name":"t1_ct318s3","parent_id":"t1_ct2yg24","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436893474,"created_utc":1436889874}

I'm not entirely sure what you're asking here, but it sounds like you mean something like, "the former should just be made deal with the consequences of having sex because they were willing to take that risk, and the latter simply has the right to their bodies forever". If that's the case, I honestly think "simply wanting to keep your organs to yourself after you've expired" is just selfish, especially when it can help someone who's still alive, and is really a less convincing argument than "we just want to have sex but not have kids". Plenty of things have consequences, but we don't usually force people to deal with them to their worst extent when they're treatable - like if you go to a skate park you're accepting the possibility of injury, but if you come back with a bloody leg society won't force you to wait for gangrene to set in.		> the corpse did not volunteer for, consent to, or provide a mechanism for this situation.		A woman who wants but can't have an abortion isn't really consenting to childbirth either - I don't feel like explaining why right now, but if you think consenting to sex is consenting to give birth my only response can be "that's completely ridiculous".		> I'm not sure that an embryo would be analogous enough to the person in need of a transplant.		It's debatable but I think it is, at least for the sake of this discussion. Putting "the potential for a great life" (as a pro-life someone in this thread put it) above people who are *already living* is, if anything, insulting (or the, "they already had their chance" mentality).

Both my life situation and personal mental state do not leave room for a child.

I suspect other women who have had abortions (the vast majority of which are not medical) are like me. They don't regret the abortion, but they *do* regret the situation that caused them to get pregnant in the first place. That's been my experience talking with other women in the pro-choice community. It's anecdotal evidence, but mostly everybody is just frustrated/regretful about how they *got pregnant*, not how they ended the pregnancy.

However, many people shouldn't be parents because it makes them much unhappier and stressed on a day to day basis. Many of these people may not have chosen to have kids had they realized these consequences up front, but once they have them they accept their choices in life and make the best of it. You will have a much happier life if you learn to rationalize permanent decisions like this rather than look back with regret on something you can't change.		That being said, I can see how many women would not regret having an abortion because they can much more readily see the positive effects later on...not being financially strapped or having a stressed relationship with their partner or having to make life choices based on their kid. If they had an abortion, then they probably weren't in a great life position to have a kid, so I can't imagine many people looking back and thinking "damn, I really wish I could be changing a diaper right now!" Also, they have no idea how the kid will have turned out--they might have had a little monster.

Especially for men, it's often not until they have their own families and their own children (especially daughters) reach the age they were when they aborted their child. Acute cases right after the choice are only a small portion of cases.

Ignoring that, really, the truth of the act, as you so poetically put it will vary, for starters you could not guarantee any non-aborted foetus would carry to term, or have a decent life. All abortion does it ensure that a child is not born to an unwilling Mother, nothing more or less. The income bracket or marital status of a Mother is irrelevant which I though I made clear ( apologies if I did not)- there is no stigma in being single- why would there be? Being poor can create problems involving the costs involved in raising a child, but  if a child is wanted then ways are found. However- why should any woman be forced to give birth to a child she does not want when there are simple and safe methods to terminate a pregnancy?  There should be no shame in it, indeed I would suggest there should be shame in giving birth to an unwanted child, because children need to be loved and wanted. Pregnancies fail all the time, for unknown reasons, and if that pregnancy was desired then that is a sad loss, but then why should the converse not hold true? If a woman becomes pregnant then the abilty to end that pregnancy quickly and easily should be a source of comfort. By telling women they will regret it, you make it seem somehow wrong. The choice should be completely free, without pressure from either side- if you wish to have the child then all help and support will be given, if you do not then we can end the pregnancy quickly, easily and safely.

{"body":"In your own link, they discuss the debate around that.		>The Unborn Victims of Violence Act was strongly opposed by most pro-choice organizations, on grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision said that the human fetus is not a "person" under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and that if the fetus were a Fourteenth Amendment "person," then they would have a constitutional right to life. However, the laws of 38 states also recognize the human fetus as the legal victim of homicide (and often, other violent crimes) during the entire period of pre-natal development (27 states) or during part of the pre-natal period (nine states). Legal challenges to these laws, arguing that they violate Roe v. Wade or other U.S. Supreme Court precedents, have been uniformly rejected by both the federal and the state courts, including the supreme courts of California, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.	Some prominent legal scholars who strongly support Roe v. Wade, such as Prof. Walter Dellinger of Duke University Law School, Richard Parker of Harvard, and Sherry F. Colb of Rutgers Law School, have written that fetal homicide laws do not conflict with Roe v. Wade.	A principle that allows language in a law to not conflict with Roe, which logically should trigger Roe???s ???collapse??? clause, was explained in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 US 490 (1989). Until such language becomes the basis for laws that specify penalties for abortion, the issue is not even before the court, of whether or not such language conflicts with Roe, and if so, which should be struck down.","depth":1,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"texaspsychosis","name":"t1_ct2xo6u","parent_id":"t1_ct2xlh4","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436888051,"created_utc":1436884451}

The emotions examined were drawn from the literature [6???8, 12, 18]. We used responses to the four negative emotions to create a scale (range 0???16; Cronbach???s ?? = 0.88). Similarly, responses to the two positive emotions were combined into a scale (range 0???8; ?? = 0.69). To ensure that women responded about the abortion and not the pregnancy itself, these items were preceded by emotions questions regarding the pregnancy.
