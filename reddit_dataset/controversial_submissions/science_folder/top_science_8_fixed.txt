Unlike combustion, more air (oxygen) does not make atomizing hotter, that is a concept of combustion.

But otherwise I don't suffer any immediate withdrawal symptoms.		By comparison, going cold turkey on caffeine absolutely wrecks me the very next day.

It's used towards state budgets, in fact most states borrow against the projected value of the future money brought in from tobacco sales, to the point where they are completely dependent on that money to keep their state government from going completely bankrupt, California. 		So when ecigarettes come along and provide an obviously safer alternative for nicotine addicts and a large percentage of tobacco users suddenly stop buying tobacco products at almost the exact same time.

On the flip side, it's pretty good for your brain. It has been shown to slow the onset of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

You can avoid this by searching for, or formulating your own, recipes that remain relatively clear once "steeped".  		Several flavoring companies have also begun sourcing alternatives for the worst offenders like chocolates, creams, and oaks. 		The worst of the worst though are flavorings that use Gum Arabic as a stabilizer (prevalent in citrus offerings).

Any 'study' that purports to have located acrolein in measurable quantities in regular ecig vapor (as against sub-ohm RBA vapor, which is a different issue) did not use a realistic test set-up - we already know that acrolein cannot be detected in ecig vapor from a regular atomiser tested correctly.

{"body":"First, I'm only familiar with 'home-made' time-of-flight and quadrupole mass spectrometers, not commercial ones. Note that the wikipedia page on GC-MS is either badly out of date or commercial GC-MS systems kind of suck compared to state of the art TOF mass specs (either one wouldn't really surprise me).		You are correct that electron bombardment is a common ionization method for mass specs.  But you can do it in other ways, too, like with a tunable laser.  That *can* give you a softer ionization, but it's trickier to use, and it doesn't really work for a commercial product (note that they used an Agilent--Now Keysight! Such wow! Much branding! So shinyness!--brand commercial mass spec) because you can't just give a technician an instruction manual and expect him/her to just push buttons to make it work.  		Most molecules (particularly large organic ones) will be fragmented by whatever process you use to ionize them.  This is simply because the lowest energy bond length for certain bonds within the molecule will be infinity when one electron goes missing.  So it doesn't matter how softly you ionize, it still fragments. 		What shows up in the mass spectrum are the fragments of the original molecule. The intensity ratios of the various fragments give you strong clues as to the identity of the precursor molecule, particularly if you have a relatively pure sample of the precursor you can use as a calibrant.  However, the spectrum becomes congested and more difficult to interpret when your sample contains a bunch of different unknown organics, which is probably (note, I didn't read the paper) why they used several different methods to identify the species in the sample.   		As for the vaporization bit: I'm not really familiar with GC, but mass spectrometers generally only work on gas-phase molecules in something approximating a vacuum.  (The vacuum part is really just a technical limitation of the detector at the end of the mass spec)  The problem (generally) is that many interesting substances (like, say, Iron or cocaine) have low vapor pressures, so the only way to get an appreciable amount of them into the ionization region of the mass spec is to heat them.  For an organic molecule, that might be just a few hundred degrees, but it could be thousands of degrees for an alkali metal (which is a major, major pain in the ass).  		The trick is to avoid decomposing the molecule you want to study in the process of vaporizing it.  There are a bunch of interesting and sensitive ways to do this, but they generally require a many hours of graduate student labor and aren't really amenable to commercialization.		Hope this helps.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"efgyuq","name":"t1_crm9yt5","parent_id":"t1_crlsxoz","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432715105,"created_utc":1432711505}

That's great, but that number is less positive in light of the dismal number of actual smokers that manage to quit that way.		The prognosis for the smoker who wishes to quit is grim.  Electronic cigarettes, which may or may not be of great harm, seem to be a significantly safer - or less unsafe, if you're the glass half empty type - alternative.  It may seem stupid to you, who I presume to be a nonsmoker, to make that switch, but the numbers suggest otherwise.  		Take the alcoholic.  [One study suggested that](Coffee and Cigarette Consumption and Perceived Effects in Recovering Alcoholics Participating in Alcoholics Anonymous in Nashville, TN) recovering alcoholics tend to habitually drink coffee - and more of it - than the average person.  Coffee's potential benefits and hazards are [dubious](http://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/unbalanced-times-report-reflects-coffee-confirmation-bias/), and though studies are run pretty well constantly, reporting both the good and the bad, it still seems that coffee may help alcoholics to quit.  		The point is that quitting smoking is extraordinarily hard, and the attitude that a smoker should just buck up and keep trying to quit without trying e-cigarettes is clearly not helpful.  Now, the jury is still out on them - they're an extremely new product, after all - but in the meantime, the evidence largely implies that they are vastly safer than cigarettes.  I'm fine with hedging my bets that way.  If I find out they're killing me just as quickly, however, I will continue seeking alternative means to quit smoking.  As it stands, however, I feel healthier now than I ever did in the 10 years preceding my first foray into electronic cigarettes.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"blunderchief","name":"t1_crlz973","parent_id":"t1_crlhjx0","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432691597,"created_utc":1432687997}

{"body":"They used an actual e-cigarette to generate the vapors. From the protocols:		>A vacuum trap was created to collect the post-vaporized condensate of e-Cig solutions		The main conclusions drawn from the paper are from treating these cells with the e-Cig solution, and the "surprise" is that the lung damaging measures were still present when they removed the nicotine, indicating that the solution used to deliver the nicotine contains additional lung damaging chemicals. This means that the e-Cig industry could potentially improve the purification or formulation of their product to enhance its safety. However, importantly, when they recondensed the e-Cig vapor produced from this apparatus, they found similar lung damaging effects, but required higher concentrations. I don't know if they concentrations they tested were biologically relevant.		The paper itself is very strong and shows that the topic warrants further study, but if you want to generalize these results to say definitively "e-cigs are harmful," I think you should slow down and look at the methods. Lungs are extremely complex organs, and simplifying them to a single rat lung cell monolayer in a petri dish obviously isn't going to cut it. This is especially true as nobody really knows what the exact biological relevance of these "damaging" phenotypes means for lung cells *in vivo*, or if human cells would behave similarly. For example, does this significantly increase the odds of emphysema? Lung cancer? That's not to say the study is bad. This is just how science works. It's a good starting point to look at what measures need to be taken for more rigorous *in vivo* studies, but not in any way to be taken as a guarantee (or even a suggestion) that cells will behave like this when exposed to the vapors *in vivo*.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vapulate","name":"t1_crlrvje","parent_id":"t1_crlcg4j","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432679066,"created_utc":1432675466}

{"body":"Short answer: air causes damage to EVERYTHING, it's one of our biggest risks.  Ever have someone tell you you need an antioxidant?  It's because air creates what's called "reactive oxygen species" (or "free radicals") which damage things all the time.  After you have a heart attack or a stroke, one of the biggest risks is actually that once you regain blood flow to the area, all the oxygen rushing in will mess things up.  So yes, you could say in a study that exposure to air could cause some damage.  Although your lungs are pretty well-designed for taking in air.  ~~Of~~ Off the top of my head I can't think of anything that is really *great* to inhale besides air.   		I think the basis of your question is maybe better read as "what kinds of harmful inhalants aren't particularly harmful to your lungs?"  In that case, a few things.  CO2 and CO are both very harmful, but they don't really injure your lungs directly.  inhaling small amounts of dust or something illicit like cocaine isn't great, but as long as it doesn't have silica in it, it's relatively harmless to your lower respiratory system (lungs) and gets expelled by the "mucocilliary ladder," which is your respiratory system's defense system for getting crap out of it.  		Might be a good place for me to interject that when people talk about the harm from smoking, there are really two unrelated issues:		1) smoking *anything* causes bronchitis and/or emphysema.  These are collectively referred to as COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- "obstructive" because they obstruct your ability to get air out.  This is because the smoke causes the immune system in your lungs to release a lot of proteases -- enzymes that break down proteins -- to fight what it thinks is a threat, and those proteases break down the elastic tissue in your lungs that helps you exhale.  		2) tobacco, not nicotine, is uniquely carcinogenic.  It is an inconvenient truth that the plant soaks up ground radiation rather well, and it also has other properties that lend itself to causing cancer.  That being said, smoking anything is also hypothetically carcinogenic because of a property called "metaplasia," which means that you're training your cells to morph to deal with the smoke, and sometimes they morph out of control.  		edit: thanks for the gold!  I know it's cliche to edit your post to acknowledge it, but it's my first one, and it made my day, so thank you and I'm glad it was helpful :)		Edit 2: here's some [information](http://m.sciencemag.org/content/153/3738/880.abstract?ijkey=753af8cd206b78b05e6a7201c88acf7015cdc151&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) about tobacco absorbing radiation, because a few have asked about it","depth":1,"score":676,"ups":676,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"FridaG","name":"t1_crlecff","parent_id":"t1_crldac9","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432658090,"created_utc":1432654490}

{"body":"haha, I'm a bit hesitant to dish out medical advice on the internet, so take my opinion with a grain of ... dust?  		I'm reading your question to mean, by drying up your nasal passage way, are you preventing your body from having the immune response that you need it to have to be healthy.  		I reckon it probably isn't a problem to prevent the runny noses, as long as you aren't constantly on the medication, and here's why.  An allergy isn't a normal reaction, it's what's called a "hypersensitivity" reaction (real medical term).  In the case of a dust allergy, your body massively starts turning it up to 11 to get rid of something it thinks is harmful, but really isn't.  		Just think, during the spring time, besides allergies, is there a massive influx of lung infections?  You'd think there would be, if the pollen that everyone is exposed to was intrinsically harmful but only a few people are expelling it with a runny nose.  The truth is that it isn't intrinsically harmful.  		All the sneezing and congestion is caused by a special kind of antibody called IgE that never really learned to ignore pollen and dust when you were a kid, and like most other grown-ups, is now stubborn and it's hard to change.  IgE triggers some immune cells to release a substance called histamine, which signals to the cells in your respiratory tract to release mucous, hence the runny nose.  Claratin works by blocking histamine, but the rest of your immune system that deals with real threats like bacteria is still working.  		However, you do need mucous in your respiratory system, so too much claritin could probably make you more likely to get sick [citation needed].","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FridaG","name":"t1_crlul36","parent_id":"t1_crlkfee","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432683518,"created_utc":1432679918}

There are air sacs, tubes to those air sacs, the cells that make up those sacs and tubes, some lubricant, some elastic material, and some immune cells.  Unlike other organs, there isn't a whole lot of stuff going on, so there isn't really a great way to directly improve lung health by putting good agents into it.  endurance training will strengthen your diaphragm, which is important for filling and emptying your lungs.  If the weather is dry, you need to make sure you have enough lubricant on your air sacs so they can inflate more easily.  So the lungs are an organ where the baseline is about as good as they get.  You can't really grow more air sacs.  You can dilate your airways and the blood vessels in your lungs to make more diffusion of oxygen into the blood easier, and that's basically what caffeine (a xanthine) does.  		lol, ok, thanks for your clarification, I see what you mean now: from a medical standpoint, what's unique about the lungs such that we can't improve them as we can with other organs?  		edit: probably the best answer I can give is, "i'm not exactly sure."  but the rest of my reply is based on what I think I do understand.		A lot of my waxing was because from a medical standpoint, it's a bit misguided to think that agents are inherently "good" for our bodies.  This is rarely true.  for example, is oatmeal really good for your heart?  *maybe*, but not as good as not being obese.

You can eat a ton of garlic and ginger to try and improve lung health by reducing inflammation, but that effect probably isn't nearly as pronounced as reducing sugar intake to reduce inflammation and other metabolic effects that have a downstream effect on lung health.  		One thing that is increasingly being shown to be good for your body, including your lungs, is probiotics to promote good bacteria.  there are 10 times as many bacterial cells in your body than human cells, making up ~5 lbs of your body weight... you can imagine it's pretty important to keep those little dudes happy and healthy.

The long-term damage from smoking related to COPD is mostly irreversible though: in this case, you have destroyed tissue that cannot be restored, or when it is restored, it is fibrous and impairs breathing more.  Think about when you get a cut on your arm and a scar forms.  Ever notice how the scar isn't as pliable as the rest of your skin?

I honestly think that the worst thing that anti-smoking campaigns ever did was convince people that the problem with smoking cigarrettes was getting lung cancer. Less than 5% of lifetime smokers will ever get lung cancer, it's just not that common.

{"body":"There are two formyldyhydye studies, one by Dr. Farsilonous from Greece (ecigresearch.com I beleive) and one out of Japan. Dr. F did the first study and it was promptly misreported by the media and public health officials and Dr. F actually had to contact certain prominent agencies and tell them to STOP misrepresenting his science. He found that using a particular model of tank *could* deliver formyldyhyde, but only if it was heated high enough to cause a dry hit which tastes so bad, no person, vaper of smoker, could tolerate inhaling it. (Its really bad, and we have all done it on the first gen devices) The second study in Japan basicallly replicated Dr. Fs study, but replicated the bad part only and created a media storm of "there is 10x the formyldyhyde in ecigs than there is tobacco!" /end media alert. The results were published in NEJM with a false conclusion (just mentioned) and Dr. F again, called for retraction of the conclusion ( done in December last year) and has been in the editorials of the NEJM two of three times since having a back and forth about the lack of professionalisim. Additionally, there was a editorial about a year ago in which a major journl had to remind there researchers to maintain intergrity when publishing ecig study results. I believe you can probably find this with a search "major tobacco journal has to remind researchers..." I am on a phone so cant googlefu right now.

Furthermore, l contend that your approach for determination of temperature is fundamentally flawed, given the use of absolute scale on a relative statement.

And there have already been [studies](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1413069) claiming terrible outcomes that have been [debunked](http://acsh.org/2015/01/poorly-done-e-cig-vapor-study-gets-big-headlines-means-nothing/).","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WordBoxLLC","name":"t1_crnpdq6","parent_id":"t1_crm0ist","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432829790,"created_utc":1432826190}

If they don't specify I have a bad feeling from the biased language I saw in the bit I read that it's used fluid.  There was another study that showed formaldehyde in the smoke, but quickly debunked as it was found they were vaping the liquid at ungodly high temperatures in plastic, and the formaldehyde was most likely a result from the high heat melting the plastic.		Every negative study on vaping I have seen has been poor science or biased funding, which brings the results into question. I'm not saying vaping is healthy, there are too many unknowns.  Maybe they did find this compound from burning cotton (which is the wick) in fluids, but what brand fluids? What flavor fluids? There are so many variables I have no idea what's good or bad.  All I care is that I feel so much healthier than smoking real cigarettes. I can breathe, I can smell things, I can taste things, and I don't get judgemental looks from strangers when I'm standing outside smoking.

{"body":"To address your comment directly, peer-review simply means that, your peers reviewed your work and determined that quality of it. From there, you use their feedback in order to revise the writing of your paper, or (ultimately) dump your data and restart. At the end of the day, a peer-review cannot change the findings, they can only change the presentation or interpretation of the data. Data is the one of the most absolute things in this case. 		Anyway, one of the issues with studies is that it is VERY hard to keep everything constant. Especially when it comes to individuals (and people), it's near impossible to isolate every variable except for what you want to manipulate. It's why correlation is often mentioned instead of causation. Causation implies you are able to isolate all other variables and determine the direction of influence (X caused Y, rather than Y causing X). Furthermore, what if what you're looking at is part of a multi-variate system, and you've only isolated one variable? To what degree did X cause Y? 		I digress, but the point is that even though that there are confounding factors, the question that you have to ask yourself is "did the researchers hold as many variables constant throughout the trials that may have impacted the outcome"? 		If another researcher comes along and wishes to test your temperature variance hypothesis, or the type of substance it is in, they are more than welcome to. There is a fallacy that researchers have unlimited time and unlimited funds, therefore any factors left out are due to human error. What often occurs is a calculated effort of testing is single hypothesis. Sure, they could have tested what you had suggested, but that would be a multi-part hypothesis and would have taken a lot longer (and more money). 		The results that OP cited come from this side note within the original paper: 		>Unexpectedly, barrier dysfunction was also induced by exposures to similar volumes	     of an e-Cig solution (e-Cig 2) that lacked nicotine (Figure 2A). Of note the nicotine-free e-Cig	    solution 2 was marketed as having the same flavor as nicotine-containing e-Cig solution 2 and	    shared the same manufacturer. Since vaporization of e-Cig solutions may generate different 	12	    metabolites than the original solution due to heating, we investigated if the condensed vapor isolated	    from an e-Cig affected the endothelial barrier. For similar volumes as nicotine solutions, the e-Cig	   vapor condensate was less potent on RLECs barrier function (Figure 2A). 		Basically, the results quoted indicate that the main takeaway occurred accidentally, and the researchers  dug a litter deeper to investigate the issue.  In regards the the temperature issue, there is this note within the paper:		>  This finding suggested heating of e-Cig solutions to produce vapor was not a necessary step to produce acrolein.		This can imply that it was not really necessary to control for heat, since the results indicated the presence of the chemical prior to heating, and after heating.

{"body":"I'm not a scientist but I suspect this study used wrong methodology. Because they mention acrolein as a cause for the lung damage.		A r[ecent study by Dr. Farsalinos](http://www.ecigarette-research.org/research/index.php/research/research-2015/210-ald)* showed that formaldehyde and acrolein is ONLY created when the e-cigarette is overheated. You can see a graphical representation [here](http://i.imgur.com/m9YLTxQ.jpg). This is called "dry puff" when there is not enough eliquid on the heating element. So an easy way to produce high levels of dangerous chemicals is to simply overheat the ecigarette or let it run when the eliquid is already gone. But these dry puffs taste so horrible that vapers try to avoid it at all costs. It's comparable to charring a steak and then saying that steak causes cancer. So this is simply not normal use.		So this calls into question *ALL* the findings of the study regarding e-cigarettes. Furthermore it calls into question the honesty and integrity of these researchers. If they had read up on current science regarding e-cigarettes they would have found the responses towards the recent "formadehyde in e-cigarette" studies and that the cause for this is improper and unrealistic use.		A simple way to avoid these dry puffs is to use "temperature protected" e-cigarettes that automatically limit the power if a certain temperature is reached, thus avoiding any possibility to produce significant levels of acrolein, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or acetone.		* [E-cigarettes generate high levels of aldehydes only in ???dry puff??? conditions (irrespective of the power levels)](http://www.ecigarette-research.org/research/index.php/research/research-2015/210-ald)","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FarkMcBark","name":"t1_crmza0u","parent_id":"t3_37bta1","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432768003,"created_utc":1432764403}

The #1 risk to health from a cigarette is due to the tar in the smoke, which is the main cause of cancer from smoking.

I personally have been vaping for 2 years now, and there is no doubt in my mind I would still be smoking a pack of cigarettes a day if I hadn't switched. I know ideally it would be best for cigarette smokers to simply quit, but that ideal is not realistic for many, which is why smoking is still prevalent despite the risks being known.  	  	While it is good to know the risks of ecigs, I just hope this information does not encourage regular cigarette smokers to not switch, because switching could still save their life if they would not quit cigarettes otherwise.  	  	I do not constantly wheeze and cough now that I have switched. I know inhaling vapor may not be good for me, but I know damn well I feel much better since stopping cigarettes. Cigarettes would make me feel perpetually sick, and I am very thankful I found an alternative, as my quality of life has improved significantly.","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DirtyPedro","name":"t1_crlpjaf","parent_id":"t3_37bta1","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432675529,"created_utc":1432671929}

{"body":"I'm late to the comment section, but someone might find my analysis useful.		I'm an occasional ecig researcher on the chemistry side, but I am not a medical professional.		I have some critiques of this work.		Lung irritation with nicotine free solutions is what I would expect.  The user is inhaling solvent to permeate and possibly inflame the cells, no surprise there.  What I find particularly interesting is that the nicotine concentration actually effects this.  I would not have suspected this to be the case unless there was some direct metabolic pathway for nicotine to be used in the function or dysfunction of the cell.  Does such a known pathway exist?  Bio isn't my strong suit.  		The discussion of the NMR results seen in Fig 3-A (found on page 12) is phrased in a way that bothers me.  Referring to propylene glycol as antifreeze isn't something that should be necessary for a journal article targeted toward the scientific community.  Perhaps this suggests that there may be some bias in the interpretation.		Fig 3-C is discouraging.  Without a domain scale, it is hard to tell what the relative intensities of the GC peaks are.  I would assume that all of the liquids containing nicotine are swamped by the prominent sharp nicotine peak.  What worries me is that they don't address any of the peaks which are no labeled.  I have found that high injection temperatures on a GC can cause some strange fragments to appear like we see here.  It would be interesting to see a test on these lung cells using separate fractions of the liquids (e.g. first 9 minutes of Nic-Free eCig2 vs everything after 9 minutes dissolved in some more glycerol).  This sort of fractionation would probably require a significant change in the equipment being used, but it might shed some light on the toxicity.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"wessubba","name":"t1_crm24gb","parent_id":"t3_37bta1","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432696476,"created_utc":1432692876}

The problem is that people are just switching to smoking e-cigarettes and then not giving up or, even worse, taking up smoking e-cigarettes when previously they didn't smoke at all.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"frillytotes","name":"t1_crlklff","parent_id":"t1_crlgken","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432668008,"created_utc":1432664408}

{"body":"Didn't read the study thoroughly, but typical e-juice is a blend of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (the ratios vary quite drastically, typically somewhere between 80/20 and 20/80), mixed with some food-grade flavorings, and (optionally) some nicotine. So no, it's not 'just water vapor', and that's a bad message to spread around - I vape as a harm-reduction method from smoking, but it's not something I'd recommend any non-smokers ever take up - that said all the main ingredients in e-juice (with the exception of nicotine if you use it) are generally recognized as safe for consumption. 		Given how overboard some of these studies tend to go on either the power settings of the device, or how long each individual puff lasts, my typical guess as to what's causing the most harm is continual vaping on burnt wicks or with burnt e-juice on the wick/coil.

The propylene glycol applies the medication gently to the lungs, like saline helps convey medications in the bloodstream in similarly low concentration. the nebuliser though, vaporizes the glycol and meds at a much lower temperature and mixes more with ambient air than many e-cigs. Again, that's been proven safe enough to administer to children for months at a time. e-cigs also come in many, many voltages, chemical mixes and temperatures, depending on the batteries and different resistive coils a user selects. no studies I have seen have really compared the different flavors and temperatures people vape at, though it has been proven that high voltage, low resistance (super hot, almost enough to burn the mouth and would immediately cause violent coughing or vomiting) vaping of certain flavors will burn rather than vaporize the substances, producing a toxic smoke.

{"body":"Just to provide a TL;DR about what this study is saying and what the effects are, they found evidence that e-cigs damage the part of the lung involved in gas-exchange.  Damage to this area could contribute to what's called a "ventilation-perfusion mismatch," meaning that for every breath you take in, a) less oxygen is actually getting into your blood, and b) because CO2 diffuses much faster than O2 and this damage might lead to hyperventilation to compensate, it could contribute to "respiratory alkalosis," which means that your body because more basic than it is supposed to be, which can affect your muscles, consciousness, bones, etc.  		For everyone who is asking about why this matters, there is a great deal of concern in the tobacco-control community to try and get ahead of the e-cig craze before a potentially dangerous substance becomes widely-used under the auspices of harmlessness.  Tobacco use among the youth has been on the decline for a while, but there is evidence that e-cigs are marketed directly to the youths [citation needed].

Youth cigarette smoking also dropped to historic lows. If we are truly weighing pros and cons, we have to look at both the increase in youth e-cig use and the drop in the use of the most dangerous option.		The only decently-sized RCT studies that exist on ecigs show them to be roughly as good at quitting cigarettes as the patch, it's true. It's also true that no decent-sized study has been done with anything but ill-designed "first generation" devices. There's been massive improvement in the ability of the devices to deliver nicotine, both in per-hit terms and in the general reliability of devices. More important is the fact that when we look at population level effects, we find that at this point something like 10% of the UK smoking population has already quit using e-cigarettes - this is a massive effect unrivaled by anything we've seen from NRT. For me, observable population-level effects trump RCT's, but I know those are gospel for some people.

{"body":"Yea, but like I said, it's all about relative harm. 		Have you looked into many of the long term pot smoking studies that have concluded recently? The results were pretty mind-opening. One major study found that even after 20+ years of long term habitual marijuana use, lung function in those who only smoked pot didn't get anyworse. In fact, lung function got better over time (likely because of the 'deep' breathing that pot smokers do). However, those who smoked tobacco only had terrible damage done to their lungs. And those who smoked pot and tobacco had damage done. But that damage wasn't there for people who only smoked pot. 		This is due to pot containing thc/cbd, which seems to mitigate/fight many of the damaging elements contained in the smoke. Basically, pot contains elements which seem to neutralize the harm which is why tobacco smokers who also smoke pot have far fewer lung problems than people who only smoke tobacco.

{"body":"They probably aren't perfect. There's very little if any debate that they are clearly safer than cigarettes - that's pretty much indisputed. I watched a Harvard panel discussing them a few weeks ago, and none of the participants doubted that they were a much less dangerous alternative to cigarettes. That's not to say they all liked them, because  some of the members of the panel felt that any addiction was wrong, but there's little doubt that it's a better choice as compared to cigarettes.		Studies like this are somewhat limited in that they don't really compare the effects of cigarettes with e-cigarettes, but rather some component part of the harm with another. e-cigarettes are simply lacking a majority of the toxic components completely, so even if the remaining parts were as toxic you'd expect some large safety gains anyway.		I'm reluctant to go into detail on this study and what it means, because they weren't clear on their methodology - I don't know what device they used, what juice they used or what settings they used them on. I don't know what puff topography they used and how well it mimics a realistic user. There's a few studies that have indicated that these things are very important - overpowering a device creates aldehydes and other chemicals where otherwise they would not have been present. 		Without disclosure of these important facts, there's no way to estimate the value or usefulness of their research. There's virtually no way someone who was expert in the field could not know these things, so I'm doubtful about either the expertise or honesty of these researchers. Take your pick. Still, it's possible that this study is legitimate and is indicating a small but real risk that would still be much less than that of what's posed by cigarettes overall, it's just very hard to say.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"benjaminedenny","name":"t1_crlrel6","parent_id":"t1_crlqnt7","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1432678328,"created_utc":1432674728}

{"body":"I can state the following from personal experience:			I was a cigarette smoker for 1.5 years, during which time I tried quitting cigarettes many times, but was unsuccessful. On two occasions, I managed to avoid smoking for exactly 9 days before relapsing.		Then I gave e-cigarettes a try. By using e-cigarettes, I was able to break free of the habit of smoking. I went a whole month without smoking, effortlessly, like a breeze.			Then I had some bad experiences buying e-cigarettes and e-juices online. On one occasion, an e-juice bottle was tampered with (didn't have the full amount of juice as expected). On another occasion, they delivered only the e-cigarette and not the e-juice even though it was a package deal of both that was advertised. I raised the concern with them but they still did not eventually deliver. Add to that, the e-cigarette itself was faulty and didn't function properly. I struggled for a week or more with the faulty e-cigarette until I had enough. I gave up on e-cigarettes then and there.			At this point, I was free of the habit of smoking, and as regards e-cigarettes, the very thought of them brought all the bad experiences and frustration I had faced in buying them, and struggling with the faulty device to mind every time. So I found it pretty easy to be nicotine-free. I went for a month or so without any nicotine intake, without any effort.		Two days back I decided to have cigarettes just to remember how good they felt. I smoked half a pack. After that I smoked half a pack yesterday, and another one today. Interestingly, I am not getting the same level of pleasure I used to get from smoking as I used to earlier. It also does not feel as addictive as it used to earlier.			I think my experience with e-cigarettes has certainly changed the state of my addiction to cigarettes. As of now, I feel it has helped me overcome my addiction to cigarettes.

Smokers who claim that vaping is "risk-free" are merely seeking justfiication because non-smokers get in your face and say it isn't healthy and that's why you should quit. But it is silly for them to essentially argue from ignorance. As someone who smokes weed and uses e-cigs, I don't feel a need to justify it to anyone else. It isn't their "duty" to "correct" me in the first place. My body, my rules. But I DO appreciate the studies, information, etc. without a sociopolitical agenda attached. Just science and ethics (rather than arbirary "morals"). Smokers who argue from ignorance need to work on their self-esteem.		It's really that person's choice, and none of your business. Sure, it's wrong to spread misinformation, but it goes both ways. People go out of their way to deny the medicinal benefits of cannabis (relevance: vaping cannabis oil as an alternative to smoking) because the methods of consumption are "controversial".
