{"body":"That's the point they're trying to make, but the headline isn't very good. It's more like every gallon of gas costs you $2.50 and the world $3.75, which only comes out to something like 1/1,000,000 of a cent per fill-up *for me*. But it also costs everyone else the same amount every fill up, and I'm paying that same 1/1,000,000 of a cent every time every other person in the world fills up too.		If it actually cost us an extra $40-80 dollars in personal costs (like healthcare costs from pollution or higher energy bills from more heating/cooling, etc.) then Global warming would be a solved problem. But it isn't, I get to drive cheaply and everyone else in the world chips in a little to keep the costs down for me (even though they don't want to).		The same logic goes for a lot of things. The AC in my house is "subsidized" by people breathing near coal power plants, and the hamburger I eat for lunch is subsidized by people all over the world who have to deal with less fresh water, farmable land, rainforest, global warming etc.		Virtually everything we do should be more expensive, but we should also be getting paid by everyone else. The net effect would be $0, on average. But the industrialized world would be paying a huge amount to the developing world.

{"body":"In this day and age corporations are people and people are nothing.		If you are a swing voter in an area where there is any chance of your politician being voted out (over 80% are uncontested for lower seats or contested at such a low rate as to be pointless) then your vote will cost the winning party between $5 - $10		I came to this conclusion by doing a detailed analysis for several hundred seats and looking at contests which were heavily funded by outside sources (I.E. Most of the money came from outside of the voting district) And this is ignoring all the people who have built up HUGE war chests from being in office for so long. This means new comers have to compete with someone who has been taking bribes... err I mean donations for 20 years with what little they can scrape up. I have seen far too many battles of Millions on one side and Thousands on the other despite the district voting nearly 50/50. So good to be so well represented.		If you took the hours of time to go vote you may in a very small percentage of elections have cast a vote worth $10. Or you could just donate $100 to the campaign of the side you support and in effect vote 10 times.		Be warned however your donation will be on public record and that means that boss of yours that hates the side you donated to can see that you did donate and they can decide to get rid of an undesirable person like you. Oh sure they wont say that's why you are let go... but you will go anyway. I have seen it happen. Heck my CEO flat tells everyone in the company who they had better vote for with a strongly implied or else!

Once the bill passed, all they did was put the funds into the general fund and what tiny bit did go to schools they simply removed funds from other areas resulting in a net drop in spending on education.		This is why I just smile and nod when someone tells me the government should put a tax on something like this to pay for all the external costs... I am sure they would be happy to put that $3.75 tax per gallon on gas.
