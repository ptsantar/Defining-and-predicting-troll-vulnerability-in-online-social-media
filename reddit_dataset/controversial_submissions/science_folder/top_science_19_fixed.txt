{"body":"Googling the author of the research did bring up some previous history on cannabis induced psychosis research... where as shown below the context of findings is very similar way to what is described in the BBC article.  Ever 2-3 years there is an article on the topic with the same research authors, with the same hypothesis and findings. Not sure how far back it goes though.... 		Somewhat smells of personal bias bleeding in to the research topics and conclusions... not sure, but seems a bit like it. Usually, in US based research there is some note somewhere that the author works as a consultant for the heritage foundation etc. not sure if that or something equivalent is the case here. 		The only study I've seen in regard to cannabis and psychosis involved bipolar and otherwise mentally unstable individuals where by with some the use of those products can make symptoms worse.		Also, here is a study by the same individual from 2009... 	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2801827/	>Results: There was no significant difference between cases and controls in whether they had ever taken cannabis, or age at first use. However, those in the cases group were more likely to be current daily users (OR = 6.4) and to have smoked cannabis for more than 5 years (OR = 2.1). Among those who used cannabis, 78% of the cases group used high-potency cannabis (sinsemilla, ???skunk???) compared with 37% of the control group (OR 6.8).		> Conclusion: The finding that people with a first episode of psychosis had smoked higher-potency cannabis, for longer and with greater frequency, than a healthy control group is consistent with the hypothesis that ??9-THC is the active ingredient increasing risk of psychosis. This has important public health implications, given the increased availability and use of high-potency cannabis.			here is anotherone a reuters article linked to the authors of the study... this ones from 2012	http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/25/us-kids-psychosis-idUSBRE8BO07D20121225	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12050/abstract;jsessionid=D612AC88675A517AB7A843D41B19FB32.f04t02					Edit: here is the paper posted by U/Kerovon elsewhere on the thread. 	http://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/14TLP0454_Di%20Forti.pdf	Also right upfront raises questions about the research authors connections and source of potential bias in the study...		>In the UK, the investigators of the 2012 Schizophrenia Commission4 concluded that cannabis use is the most	preventable risk factor for psychosis, and research that aims to improve estimation of the drug???s contribution to	illness development should be pursued...		link to the foundation prospectus advert whatnot and synopsis of stuff... http://www.rethink.org/media/514093/TSC_main_report_14_nov.pdf		If you cross reference the names in the founding members of the foundation they tend to overlap to a degree with the authors of the research conducted on the other links above...	As for this most recent study they are basically saying "Our foundation declared this... now our findings support our declaration.".    		Maybe I'm slightly crazy.. but something feels more and more off with the study and the connections between various people and organizations involved with it... basically the foundation chair has been going on about and researching potential links between "Skunk" and mental disorders such as schizophrenia/psychosis since at least 2005. This is alongside a few other individuals... not sure but seems like a personal agenda leading to biased research topics and outcomes to me.","depth":1,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Maniacal_Musings","name":"t1_comsmpm","parent_id":"t1_comppaj","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424062215,"created_utc":1424062215}

{"body":"I would be more than happy to elaborate.		First, I happen to live in a state where I can walk down the street to my local dispensary and choose from dozens of different strains of flower, and just as many kinds of concentrates.  All of these products are tested for adulterants as well as terpine and cannabinoid content.  The highest thc content you will ever encounter is around 30% and this is considered extremely (almost unbelievably) high. Typical cannabis tests anywhere from 15% to 20%.  Over 20% is considered top shelf. If a strain existed that had 46% thc, you can bet it would take the weed world by storm overnight.  It simply does not exist.		Second, this study is a perfect example of painfully uninformed individuals trying to make authoritative claims about a subject they obviously don't understand.  The very fact that they are claiming that hash is less potent than flower is a huge red flag, but when you add to that the simplistic way they are talking about cannabis genetics and their cannabinoid content, summarizing all of the inaccuracies in a single reddit comment becomes an impossible task. I'll just point out a couple of the most glaring ones. 		There are at least 85 different cannabinoids in cannabis.  Of those, delta-9-thc and CBD are the most researched, however, we know of at least a few other cannabinoids that modulate the effects of thc, including cannabinol, cannabigerol, cannabiverol, and cannabichromene.  The fact that this study reduces the complexity of these interactions to "thc causes psychosis but cbd reduces it" is inconsistent with the serious research being conducted in this field. Furthermore, "skunk-like cannabis" is an extraordinarily vague term that potentially refers to thousands of different cannabis strains, each with a unique cannabinoid profile.

{"body":"Sorry for the belated reply, just submitting this before I go to bed for now. I will address your comment earlier in the threat here.		This study would appear to build upon the previous one, being a larger sample size and a larger control group. It also attempts to 		>use the data for pattern of cannabis use to develop a cannabis exposure measure that accurately estimates the risk of psychotic disorders; and calculate the proportion of cases of psychosis in our study area attributable to use of cannabis, particularly high-potency cannabis, if we assumed causality.		Before you complain about assumed causality, please read the Statistical Analysis where they mention that this can be done (and also they state that this study is not and cannot be proof of causation).		The study does state sources of funding (near the top at the start) and also has a declaration of interest (at the end of the article, second section). 		I would only partially agree with your information about The Schizophrenia Commission. The members, who are not just Psychologists but also Psychiatrists and also other professions/qualification (from the looks of it maybe social workers, GPs, Psycho-pharmacologist) are not just looking at the role of cannabishave a much wider view. They say they do not think the classification of cannabis is particularly important, and are more concerned with education, particularly "a high profile educational campaign pointing out the risk of heavy cannabis use at an early age, particularly of high potency forms". As far as I am aware that is a fairly non-controversial claim and I believe is backed up with references in their sources. The foundation does not (I believe) claim anything without evidence presented in the sources. Finally, I do not see that they claim anything causative. They are doing correlation studies and adding to/furthering the body of work that already exists. If prior research appears to offer avenues of further exploration I do not see why they should not continue to look into their area of expertise. They appear to have put out several peer reviewed papers on this subject which do not appear to have generated allegations of misconduct or impropriety.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pheonix8388","name":"t1_conpddi","parent_id":"t1_conera4","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424139239,"created_utc":1424139239}
{"body":"Thank you for explaining yourself. Apologies for the late reply, I'm posting this just before I head to bed. I shall try to address your points in the order that you have made them.		Firstly I'm not sure why you have seized upon the maximum THC% found in a sample as indicative of failings. Especially when this is not part of this study, although I can and will give you further sources. Bear in mind this is a maximum, found in very few (or individual) samples, and they tested hundreds. The average is similar to those given by the DEA and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The EMCDDA also give a max/ min for many countries in Europe, some of which are similarly high. It is quite likely that given Cannabis is legalised where you live there is a degree of regulation. As a result the THC% given is almost certainly an average, those numbers are similar to the 16.2% mean that the source from the study gave. Just because one or very few samples tests very strongly does not mean that those levels are found consistently. There are many factors that can conspire to give anomalous results (which is why means/ medians are given).		[DEA source giving average THC of 12.55% in 2013 (Chart 20), PDF warning](http://www.dea.gov/resource-center/dir-ndta-unclass.pdf)		[EMCDDA source tables](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/2014#displayTable:PPP-5-1)		Secondly, I have explained to you (and the study/sources), describe how they classify hash and skunk-like cannabis (sinsemilla). Their definitions are different to yours, but that does not matter. Their source describes categorisation of thousands of samples seized by police and then further testing on hundreds in the UK, I will summarise the information here for you. 		>* 80.8% were herbal cannabis and 15.3% were cannabis resin. The remaining 3.9% were either indeterminate or not cannabis.	* Of the 2,352 samples of herbal cannabis, further examination of around two thirds of the samples showed that over 97% had been grown by intensive methods and were classified as sinsemilla. The remainder were classed as traditional imported herbal cannabis.		So virtually all the cannabis in herb form seized was sinsemilla (and classified here as skunk-like) due to it's high THC levels.		Their conclusions do not state definitively that it is only THC and CBD that are relevant. Their conclusions are basically that skunk-like cannabis smoked everyday confers an increased risk of individuals having a psychotic disorder. Also, that smoking skunk-like cannabis increases the risk over smoking hash, which is itself riskier than not smoking cannabis. They speculate (and use the words might and suggest) to discuss their results and when they do so they reference other papers that have made findings that would be consistent with those suggestions. You may be interested to read the "Limitations and strengths" section they gave when they performed earlier analysis of only part of this sample [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2801827/). Some of those are addressed by this larger study, others will have not been and other research will likely be relevant as well.		Thirdly, I am not sure that it is a post hoc fallacy for the simple fact that they do not state causation "indeed no single study could ever prove causation". If they do not state causation, how are they guilty of a post hoc fallacy?","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pheonix8388","name":"t1_conpd2z","parent_id":"t1_cone11f","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424139222,"created_utc":1424139222}
{"body":"Sinsemilla means "without seeds".  Skunk is a strain of cannabis that can be either grown with our without seeds.  Hash is the trichome crystals from the plant's flowers and sugar leaves.  These words have specific meanings, and if the researchers can't even use these terms appropriately, they cannot hope to publish a relevant or accurate paper.  As for the post hoc fallacy, I think this quote speaks volumes: "This paper suggests that we could prevent almost one quarter of cases of psychosis if no-one smoked high potency cannabis."		I agree that in most cases, people with pre-existing psychosis should not use cannabis, or any other psychoactive compound for that matter.  I also don't believe that teenagers should be smoking weed, or that anybody should be using this, or any other drug, on a daily basis. That said, I find this study to be rooted in misinformation.

{"body":"Please read the source I provide in my first reply. You are repeating exactly what they say about sinsemilla. They identify it through microscopic examination in order to classify it as such.		This study says that is uses the term skunk-like to describe strains that are high in THC (and supporting evidence shows that over 85% of cannabis seized by the Metropolitan Police is in herbal form, and of that over 80% is sinsimilla; which is high in THC, and for this study classified as skunk-like). On a few occasions later in the study they use the shorthand skunk (without the appended -like). They also state that hash is a product of resin, and I believe I read from other sources they provide that it is mostly imported, made from cannabis much lower in THC and thus it is lower in THC than the sinsimilla. I believe it is also frequently adulterated so contains plenty of matter other than trichomes.		Just because it uses a different terminology (one that is widely accepted, on the basis of a google search) and appears to be the standard in the UK based on seizures, classifications by the Government, Police, researchers etc. does not make it incorrect. They are consistent with their classifications and provide explanation and clarifications so as to avoid confusion for those who may not use their terminology.		It says suggest. It does not say causes. There is a correlation after adjusting for other factors, so based on other research they suggest as to why that is the case. They do not state a causal relationship.		I would posit that you are guilty of a logical fallacy if you state the entirety of this research is invalid because you disagree with their (also correct) use of terminology. Geographical differences in language are commonplace.		Thanks for the edit, I did not see your post before that was made. I know it can be difficult not to make ad hominem or aggressive statements when frustrated. To add a bit of information (similar to how you did), I don't really care about cannabis. It should certainly be class C rather than a class B drug in the UK and possibly legalised.

{"body":"Evidence can indeed be unreliable. Every type of evidence in science has a *certain degree* of unreliability to it. There's nothing obvious about reliability being a necessary component of evidence.		Evidence is, quite simply, something that *can be used* to justify a belief, pretty much synonymous with "reason to believe". When presented with anecdotal evidence about bigfoot for example, one can say that "this indeed seems to be evidence for the existence of bigfoot". However, when presented with evidence to the contrary, for example evidence for the elusive nature of subjective experiences, evidence for the possibility of deception from the relayer of the anecdote, evidence for biases in human reasoning, evidence for the general unlikelihood of bigfoot's existence, then you would say "this seems to be very strong evidence *against* the existence of bigfoot" -- indeed, the evidence *against* bigfoot is tremendously stronger than the evidence for it. But still, the arguments for and against the existence of bigfoot are both used for the purpose of justifying a certain belief, which means they are to be called "evidence".		However, what about the doctor being confronted with a patient who claims that "I've been throwing up ever since I started with these pills" -- should the doctor disregard this because it is anecdotal "ergo" not evidence? Of course not! He or she will probably consider that it is likely that this patient has been throwing up, and this belief is justified because the patient has said so.		You could check out this article on [evidence](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/) from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I don't intend to be rude, but the article you quoted doesn't seem very believable.		>To the extent that what one is justified in believing depends upon one's evidence, what is relevant is the bearing of one's total evidence. Even if evidence E is sufficient to justify believing hypothesis H when considered in isolation, it does not follow that one who possesses evidence E is justified in believing H on its basis. For one might possess some additional evidence E???, such that one is not justified in believing H given E and E???. In these circumstances, evidence E??? defeats the justification for believing H that would be afforded by E in its absence. Thus, even if I am initially justified in believing that your name is Fritz on the basis of your testimony to that effect, the subsequent acquisition of evidence which suggests that you are a pathological liar tends to render this same belief unjustified. A given piece of evidence is defeasible evidence just in case it is in principle susceptible to being undermined by further evidence in this way; evidence which is not susceptible to such undermining would be indefeasible evidence. It is controversial whether any evidence is indefeasible in this sense.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kakofoni","name":"t1_cooeh7n","parent_id":"t1_cooc00d","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424201651,"created_utc":1424201651}

{"body":"Hold up. They used ONE strain of cannabis in this medical journalism gem?  Skunk and it's variants, I assume, since they said "Skunk-like" (whatever that means). Was it one strain of Skunk or a hybrid? This is important because different cannabinoid profiles affect people differently.		People who are self-medicating with pot because they are borderline mentally ill and don't realize it may have a few problems when they DON'T have it, but correlation is not causality.		The drug "treatment" industry, the urine testing industry, the private prison industries, Big Pharma, the alcohol manufacturers; all are throwing every rock they can at the facts.

I always wonder those types of things about these studies though, it would be very interesting to have studies that actually work with known strains or at least test out cannabinoid profiles, but we don't have any testing like that in the US for sure (not federally sponsored anyways), not sure about the UK, Israel is doing this with its medical cannabis programs and research though.		ALSO they didn't make people smoke for this study, it's just data, the weed they smoked is the weed that is available for sale illegally in the UK, and generally the hydropontically grown stuff that is much more potent than a plant given little attention, typical daylight, and only adequate nutrition.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jwolf227","name":"t1_con0ooj","parent_id":"t1_comv2vf","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424092217,"created_utc":1424092217}
