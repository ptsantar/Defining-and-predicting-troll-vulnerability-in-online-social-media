{"body":"[The actual study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096314000163) does in fact contain the 99.999% figure.		>The results of our statistical analysis would suggest that it is highly likely (99.999 percent) that the 304 consecutive months of anomalously warm global temperatures to June 2010 is directly attributable to the accumulation of global greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The corollary is that it is extremely unlikely (0.001 percent) that the observed anomalous warming is not associated with anthropogenic GHG emissions. Solar radiation was found to be an insignificant contributor to global warming over the last century, which is consistent with the earlier findings of Allen et al. (2000).

{"body":"If the article contains that statement, and it seems that it does from the abstract, then the authors are guilty of bad statistical analysis. There is no statistical model in existence that should be able to rigorously produce a conclusion like that. 		From what I can tell from reading the paper, what the authors meant to say, in plain words, was "We ran many simulations of our model, and only 0.0001 percent of the time did the simulation yield 304 consecutive months of warm temperatures.' 		This is a really important distinction to make! First of all, they're two very different statements about probability. In statistical terms, they're both conditioning on opposite events: The first, wrong, statement is saying		Probability of no anthropocentric global warming given the data we've seen and our scientific model = 0.000001		The second statement is saying,		The probability of the data we've seen given no anthropocentric global warming and our scientific model = 0.000001.		Those might seem like almost the same statement, but as any statistician will emphasize this is an important [fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability#Common_fallacies) and they are very far from being the same statement!		Second, this is an important distinction because one serious criticism of climate science is that it depends on models of a chaotic system: the atmosphere. A serious skeptic will argue that even small misspecifications of the model can lead to very different result. So a skeptic probably won't be convinced by this statement because it conditions on the model being correctly specified -- which is what the  debate is about in the first place!","depth":1,"score":380,"ups":380,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"pyrrus52","name":"t1_ck8w2lu","parent_id":"t1_ck8quvk","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409839407,"created_utc":1409835807}

I'm not personally arguing that the model is inaccurate, in fact I am quite ignorant of climate models. But I work in a similar field with large statistical models of chaotic systems, and we get a lot of the same flack that climate scientists do. Therefore, I was trying to accurately represent the criticism rather than present it as my own.		That criticism is as follows: Large models of chaotic systems are very sensitive to model misspecification. Very small errors can lead to massive differences. We may not know how the model is misspecfied, but just probabilistically the chances that there is an important misspecification are larger than 0. I admit it is a valid criticism even in the absence of actual possible misspecifications, and an issue that serious climate scientists grapple with.		I don't think I need to edit my original comment to add anything because I believe I correctly characterized the conclusion of the paper in my comment, which is "Our model predicts that we would observed 304 months of warm weather 0.0001% of the time if we shut down anthropocentric greenhouse gas emissions."","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pyrrus52","name":"t1_ck93oe2","parent_id":"t1_ck90wlb","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409855841,"created_utc":1409852241}

Not only is the climate a "chaotic system" but that we only have 1 observation of this system ( in studies like this dealing with longitudinal climate history )			As far as I know,  prior probabilities associated with these models are based on the  results of running many simulations with some variances, but... 		For models based on singular observations of chaotic systems, the variances are basically  completely reliant on human inference. 		In other words, if there is only 1 actual observation, then there is no actual data from which to model variance whatsoever.  Therefore the priors associated seem to be completely inferred.  		This problem would go away if there was just one more actual observation of a similar system, but in the case of longitudinal climate change, this issue doesn't seem to be resolved. 		Please note that I'm aware that there is often a lot of inference involved with prior possibilities, but **my point is that there is fundamental difference between priors w/ *some* inference vs. priors with *complete* inference.**		Lastly, I'm not making this argument to rail against climate change, but simply because I think there are  seemingly insurmountable problems with applying certain types of statistical models to longitudinal climate studies.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"niggytardust2000","name":"t1_ck9htox","parent_id":"t1_ck93oe2","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409883630,"created_utc":1409880030}

No, because the graph is showing you analysed data that has all been proven to be significantly accurate. You can't then choose to see one area as more significant than the other. 		More importantly, the graph is being mapped against latitude. Representing a range of temperatures is only natural in order to be able to consider longitudinal variation, and other variables (I'm guessing, since I haven't read the article). 		Also, look at the different time periods being mapped. The only graph with significant overlap is (B), which is specifically during a relatively short period of 1901-1950.

Its not the *conclusions* per se that are telling. Its the dismissive and literally arrogant attitude of a seemingly large number of people (including those in the scientific community) that seem to believe that they have with them an infallible method of declaring "truths" when in actual fact, all confirmed hypotheses are are sophisticated "best guesses" that for the most part serve us very well. Its this distinction that is so important yet so utterly lost. Any expert has authority only in the eye of the beholder and only dependant on what they say being rational. Rationality being decided on a purely timely and subjective basis. In other words, scientists are human and subject to human traits of psychology, sociology, ideology, etc. The overwhelming pretence that this is not the case is poisonous, palpable and doesn't serve anyone or fool those discerning enough to know the nature of the human mind.

When many, many studies agree on the best theory fitting empirical evidence, that isn't confirmation bias. That is what is called scientific consensus.		If you don't *like* that consensus because it doesn't meet your philosophical, inherently un-scientific presumptions, that doesn't mean that scientists are somehow gaming the system. It means you don't like the results of science. One of the things the scientific method has proven it does *very* well over the centuries is disavowing theories and hypotheses that once seemed likely, but are since shown to not match empirical evidence. 		The existence of [Phlogiston](https://web.lemoyne.edu/giunta/phlogiston.html) is one of the best examples of this I can think of. The theory makes a lot of intuitive sense, in that fire 'consumes' objects, so that something must be liberated during combustion (phlogiston). The proposal that combustion actually involves the acquisition of oxygen made the 'anti-phlogisticians' appear ludicrously insane to many 'right thinking' peoples of the 18th century. Note, in the linked piece, the oh-so-scientific appeal to *not appeal to authority.* Priestly was convinced entirely that phlogiston existed, and thus all the evidence accumulated by French scientists and their allies that combustion required an oxidant must be based on an *appeal to authority.* Priestly was wrong.		The scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change isn't based on an appeal to authority. It is based on accumulating empirical evidence to test [a theory put forward more than 100 years ago](http://www.lenntech.com/greenhouse-effect/global-warming-history.htm) that industrial production of greenhouse gases would cause warming of the atmosphere.

I personally don't like or dislike anything to do with climate change or evolution or anything else for that matter. In have no vested interest in a specific "outcome". What you don't seem to be aware of is that there are plenty of scientifically credible sources that have evidence refuting both climate change and evolution for that matter. The curious thing is that this fact is seemingly unknown to a *lot* of people. Many outright refuse to believe it. Especially if someone (like me) does not come up with links to said sources which can be found with a quick online search. Remember I'm not here to " prove" anything either way. I'm just pointing out inconsistencies that seem to be perpetually brushed under the carpet like an embarrassing uncle at Christmas dinner. The general opinion seems to be that these matters are an " open and shut" case when there is quite a substantial amount of material that cannot be dismissed out of hand.		Now which group of experts do you believe? Which group of scientists do you trust? Are they outright lying? Of course not? But there's much more nuance to it than that. The myth of "science" as a clinical (sterile) I.e. emotionless pursuit is powerful. When there are conflicting conclusions from credible investigation, who do we believe? It then becomes a matter of choice.		I do wonder what would happen if scientists from the "in-group" one day discovered a fact so glaring that even they could not ignore it which pointed to the fact that life could not have evolved on Earth as previously thought. What then? Back to square one? Back to asking how life is so fantastically complex with no apparent "originator"? I doubt it. I'll be honest, and I think anyone being honest would conclude - that this would simply not be allowed to happen. The implications after so many decades of forceful pushing of the " truth" of the source of life on earth would be devastating. Do I think its a deliberate conspiracy ? Its possible, but no.

Rhetorically, it is quite clever for deniers to appropriate the use of the word 'skeptic.' It really gives an air of scientific steadiness to their objections, as if to say "hey, we're just being *careful* about our science, because that's what *scientists* do." Skepticism is absolutely fundamental to the practice of science, but it shouldn't be misrepresented to suggest that denying mountains of evidence is somehow 'skepticism,' if it doesn't lead to experiments to show that hypotheses and theories are wrong. When experiments are conducted, and the evidence collected overwhelmingly supports the hypotheses and theories (as it has with climate change science for more than 100 years), to deny their validity isn't skepticism, it's stubbornness at best, and willful misrepresentation to support a political agenda at worst.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WRCousCous","name":"t1_ck938az","parent_id":"t1_ck91rs4","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409854996,"created_utc":1409851396}

Measuring the duration of the hiatus has implications for determining if the underlying trend has changed, and for evaluating climate models. Here, I propose a method for estimating the duration of the hiatus that is robust to unknown forms of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC) in the temperature series and to cherry-picking of endpoints.	    	>For the specific case of global average temperatures I also add the requirement of spatial consistency between hemispheres. The method makes use of the Vogelsang-Franses (2005) HAC-robust trend variance estimator which is valid as long as the underlying series is trend stationary, which is the case for the data used herein. Application of the method shows that there is now a trendless interval of 19 years duration at the end of the HadCRUT4 surface temperature series, and of 16 ??? 26 years in the lower troposphere. Use of a simple AR1 trend model suggests a shorter hiatus of 14 ??? 20 years but is likely unreliable.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jeyhawker","name":"t1_ck8tdb6","parent_id":"t1_ck8saz1","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409827827,"created_utc":1409824227}

{"body":"The top-end credible estimate for fossil fuel subsidies in the US is around $50 billion per year. I'm a bit skeptical of that because people have a tendency to overstate their case and count things that aren't really subsidies, but let's run with that. This is roughly equal to what the federal and state governments collect in excise taxes on gasoline alone, so subsidies are less than or equal to special taxes levied on fossil fuels.		Renewables, on the other hand, are hugely subsidized on a per-Joule basis.		I think taxes on fossil fuels should be much higher. Environmental issues aside, it just makes economic sense to tax consumption more and income less. But as things are now, it simply isn't true that fossil fuels have higher per-Joule subsidies than renewables, and it's not even clear that the subsidy is positive net of excise taxes.

{"body":"Here's what I can gather from the paper.  The model includes 3 fairly non-correlated covariates of global temperature and also carbon dioxide, which is fairly correlated with global temperature (See Figure 3).  CO2 being correlated with global temperature is not new; that's been well established for a long time.  But as we all know, correlation is not causation: http://xkcd.com/552/		They fit one model using all 4 covariates and one model using the three weakly-correlated covariates.  The model with three weakly-correlated covariates predicts global temperature much worse than the one with all four covariates; hence, much of the variability in the three-variable model is attributed to error.  Unsurprisingly, since this model is such a poor fit for the data, there is too much variability to produce a string of 304 consecutive weeks with above-average temperatures.  The four-variable model is a vast improvement over the three-variable model, and so, a string of 304 consecutive above-average temperatures is much more likely to occur.  A p-value of .00001 rejects the three-variable model in favor of the four-variable model.		Hence, humans caused global warming.  Wait, what?		Now, I'm sure that there is a human component to global warming, but what is presented in this paper is a fancy way of saying: "Global warming is correlated with CO2 emissions.  Thus, CO2 emissions caused global warming."  In fact, I'm almost positive that the same conclusion would be obtained by replicating this study but replacing CO2 emissions with Dow Jones Industrial Average data:		http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/historical/djia1900.html		http://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/zFacts-global-temperature-1860-2005.gif		However, if you used this same procedure to conclude that DJIA prices cause global warming, people would think you were insane.		The moral of the story: This paper does not provide additional evidence that CO2 emissions cause global warming.  If you already believed that they do, then this confirms your beliefs.  If you did not believe that they do, then this paper contains no further evidence that would change your mind.		tl;dr: Correlation is not causation, rejecting the null model does not mean that the alternative model is true, stock prices caused global warming.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mathguymike","name":"t1_ck8xiz5","parent_id":"t3_2ff60m","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409843309,"created_utc":1409839709}

So your comment is blatantly untrue: 	> CSIRO did however, invent a signal processing tech on top of wireless LAN and an 802.11 variant format that did not suck that everyone used.		**CSIRO is a patent troll.**  The companies that they have been suing have been settling... that does NOT mean that there was a decision that CSIRO is the original inventor of the technology.  'Nuff said.		> you either didn't fully read that link or do not completely understand the situation.		**You OBVIOUSLY did not read the entire article nor comprehend it:**		> For the Australian inventors, perhaps it's just as well that a jury never ruled on the matter. Without ever having sold a WiFi device and without having finally proven their case in court, CSIRO has reaped a $430 million windfall. The five CSIRO scientists who claim to have invented WiFi are treated as national heroes in Australia. CSIRO's sheer ability to get settlement cash has been translated to the Australian public: WiFi is simply "made in Australia." **This outsized claim has never been proven. It hasn't been acknowledged by any of the dozens of tech companies that have created actual WiFi products. It hasn't been recognized by anyone who isn't on CSIRO's payroll or rooting for them from a nationalist perspective.** Paying a settlement???even one that costs many millions of dollars???is often the most sensible and conservative course, even for companies that believe in their case. Those companies still face the possibility of a suffering a high jury verdict in an unfamiliar court; sometimes, it seems more practical simply to settle for a known amount.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"schmoman","name":"t1_ck8wfqf","parent_id":"t1_ck8vjvx","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409840469,"created_utc":1409836869}
{"body":"Again, OFDM was NOT invented by the CSIRO. It is (for want of a better description) a mathematical construct (like the Pythagorean theorem) for encoding data.		Neither was FEC invented by the CSIRO. It is also a mathematical construct, but for constructing redundant signals with a specific algorithm.		It was the specific combination of these along with timing patterns and other mathematical VARIABLES that used both these pre-existing constructs to define their own original, patented and highly specific algorithm to allow multiple wireless WiFi signals paths/echos/delay times to sync in a high output carrier frequency signal.		**For an analogy:**		It is like using algebra and calculus to define your own differential equations to create a winning F1 car. Cars, algebra and calculus may already exist but the combination used to make a winning car is not. The specific process you discover to make a winning car is your invention.		So, yes. Other algorithms were around (like other F1 companies making cars), but the CSIRO one was the optimal one. Many of the companies listed used this technology under the assumption that, because most of the other tech surrounding this was US design and invented, this was part of it and was fine to use. 		But, as Australian and US patents show, it was patented in 1996/97. And when US companies started selling wireless stuff that used this algorithm/signal setup, they were using a patented technology illegally. 		This is not some kind of Apple vs Samsung "We invented round corners" thing, WiFi would have been confined to very short distances with far more dropouts, tiny data rates, and an array of other signal based problems. It would have stayed shit. I'm talking about dial up on a 28.8kb siberian modem vs Google Fibre style significance here.		Some companies on the list made lots of money off this patented tech over the last 17 years, so yeah I would sue them too. 		Especially considering Sullivans co-authored *"Image sharpness, Fourier optics, and redundant-spacing interferometry"* from 1977 in the Journal of the Optical Society of America shows that this could easily be a culmination and goal of his lifes work. Not to mention the rest of the team.		WiFi, like I said before, is a bundle of technologies/protocols/signals/electronics all rolled into one. And, yes, saying a signal design (AUS patented) does not own WiFi is correct. But, in that respect, neither does the circuit design (US patented) own WiFi, or the 802.11 combination of both (IEEE/US patented). No one group owns WiFi. But, as the original success was brought about by the multicarrier modulation designed by the CSIRO - It is easy to see why they are heralded as the creator. They created the part of it which converted uselss tech into useful tech.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Iceborg9","name":"t1_ck92wl0","parent_id":"t1_ck8wfqf","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409854379,"created_utc":1409850779}
{"body":"On 25 November 2009, a debate was held in the Australian Senate concerning the alleged involvement of the CSIRO and the Labor government in censorship. The debate was called for by opposition parties after evidence came to light that a paper critical of carbon emissions trading was being suppressed.[56] At the time, the Labor government was trying to get such a scheme through the Senate. After the debate, the Science Minister, Kim Carr, was forced to release the paper, but when doing so in the Senate he also delivered a letter from the CEO of the CSIRO, Megan Clark, which attacked the report's author and threatened him with unspecified punishment.[57] The author of the paper, Clive Spash, was cited in the press as having been bullied and harassed,[58] and later gave a radio interview about this.[59] In the midst of the affair, CSIRO management had considered releasing the paper with edits that Nature reported would be "tiny".[60] Spash claimed the changes actually demanded amounted to censorship and resigned. He later posted on his website a document detailing the text that CSIRO management demanded be deleted;[61] by itself, this document forms a coherent set of statements criticising emissions trading without any additional wording needed. In subsequent Senate Estimates hearings during 2010, Senator Carr and Clark went on record claiming the paper was originally stopped from publication solely due to its low quality not meeting CSIRO standards.[62] At the time of its attempted suppression, the paper had been accepted for publication in an academic journal, New Political Economy, which in 2010 had been ranked by the Australian Research Council as an 'A class' publication.[63] In an ABC radio interview, Spash called for a Senate enquiry into the affair and the role played by senior management and the Science Minister.[64] Since these events, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported that "Questions are being raised about the closeness of BHP Billiton and the CSIRO under its chief executive, Megan Clark".[65] After his resignation, an unedited version of the paper was released by Spash as a discussion paper,[66] and later published as an academic journal article.[67]		Also, sure seems like a lot of censorship of comments here.","depth":1,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ArchieBunkerWasRight","name":"t1_ck8ull7","parent_id":"t1_ck8thdt","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409834126,"created_utc":1409830526}

They have created a model to estimate the change in temperature if CO2 levels hadn't risen, and compared that with the actual temperatures we see today.

This is akin to seeing the results of a die being rolled 300 times, and asking if the die is fair or not.  The researchers created a statistical model for a fair die, did 100,000 tests of 300 rolls, and discovered that it is exceedingly rare to roll a die 300 times and have it be a 4, 5, or 6 every time.

{"body":"It's not that suddenly there was some flashy new gem of information. As /u/Jespar said, it's a whole massive collection of data for instance ice cores from places like Antarctica. Ice cores show a historical record of climate change due to various changes frozen in ice collected from hundreds of feet under the ice.		In the study, they started with the assumption that man has not caused any climate change. As the article stated, they did a "covariate" study, which means you isolate multiple variables chosen from the data, and observe how a change in a variable affects another variable.		If I understood the article correctly, the model developed was based around climate data, natural effects like El Nino, and others, from the *present day*. Then, they used the model to make a prediction about the past climate and compared the prediction to historical data such as the ice cores from time periods in which humans were not able to affect the climate. The prediction turned out to be accurate, therefore they can be confident that the model is not biased towards showing false information about man-made effects or the present day and is a generally accurate climate model.		When the model was applied towards the 304 days of specific data (data unrelated to that used to build the model), it was found to fail to predict what's called the "null hypothesis" - in this case, it was their initial assumption that man-made effects have *NOT* affected the climate. The 99.99999% chance represents that there is a 0.00001% chance that "man-made effects have not affected the climate" is still true despite that the model showed it to be false. That number stems from statistical methods. Hence, the scientists are claiming to show beyond all reasonable doubt that humans affect the climate.		Even if you don't have the background to understand the statistical methods, believe me, these guys are professionals who are paid because they are experts. It boggles my mind that so many people trust their emotions and arbitrary guesses over experts who have actually gone out in the world and literally seen and measured the evidence with their own eyes.

{"body":"> Branding. This is where I have a huge issue. One moment it's Global Climate Change, the next moment it's Man-Made Climate Change, and occasionally people use the problematic phrase (such as this article) Global Warming. My understanding is that global warming as a term was dropped because it kept getting colder, and increasingly people wanted to be able to blame natural disasters unrelated to thermal temperature on humanity. Now, one week I read an article saying the polar ice caps increased by an extra Antarctica this year, and increased last year as well. The next week I'm reading yet another article saying ''everyone agrees with global warming. Everyone. Cept that one dude we don't talk about''.		You sound like one of these "Still no bikini-weather in Minnesota in February. Where is your global warming now?"-people. It's a climate change, induced by rising temperatures. However that doesn't mean that every region of the globe becomes warmer and that all ice crusts melt away. Earth is getting warmer, but the local effects can vary from region to region. The Arctic ice melts, the cold water mixes with the Gulf Stream, which becomes weaker and suddenly parts of Europe become colder (at least apparently; in reality only the cold extremes become colder, while the annual mean temperature rises) because they are hit more often by Siberian weather. And of course on a very cold winter day the people in these regions will tell you "Look how cold it is! Global warming my ass!"		Or take the sea level! Again Arctic ices melts, the Caucasian tectonic plate rises since it released of pressure and he locally the sea level actually drops. Of course with the same reaction from the people living in these regions: "The sea level drops? Global warming my ass!" Meanwhile however on the other side of the world millions of people are loosing their farm lands (or their tourism attractions)  because of the rising sea levels. But we don't care. We are sitting in our gardens somewhere on the continental mainlands in the Western World, where the super markets are still well stocked and our weather apps tell us, that it will be another rainy day. Where we don't see glaciers and ice crusts melting away and the rise sea level rising with catastrophic consequences for some third and second World people on the other side of the globe. And on our walk through the cold rain to the well-stocked super-market, we come to the conclusion that the climate change must be hype caused by thousands of incompetent scientists because the "Minnesotian Bikini Girl Indicator" still shows no bikini girls in Minnesota in February.		Climate change is not a doomsday scenario, that might hit us in 50 years. It is already happening and millions of people around the world are already affected by it. Many people just don't see it because our senses and our perception of our environment are not sensible enough to imminently notice the changes around us - and because many people are mistaking current weather with global climate and are completely ignorant for the global picture.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rarehero","name":"t1_ck90flk","parent_id":"t1_ck8y08h","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409849536,"created_utc":1409845936}

If we dropped 1000 sticks in the river then a few will get stuck, but it would be foolish and a mischaracterization of the system to say that "sticks do not go downriver."

{"body":"I highly doubt that you're asking this for any reason but to try to sap the point of this finding???because we do have very good, science-based explanations of many of these events and you're trying to make the claim that we don't rather than saying that you don't know them and are curious???but I'll indulge you anyway.		The Permian-Triassic Extinction (252 million years ago) was the world's most significant extinction event. 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate became extinct. 57% of all families and 83% of all genera became extinct.		The most likely cause: methane. (It's the only cause that explains the known loss of calcium-vertebrate life, the acidification of the ocean, etc., and the reduction in the 13C/12C ratio.) 		Under the ocean floor as well as in places formerly under the ocean floor like Siberia lie methane clathrates (or hydrates), and once warm enough, they transform from solid to liquid (around 0??C), then to gas (around 22??C is the tipping point, which is to say it is more likely to be gas at that temperature than liquid). If this release occurs slowly, the ocean becomes saturated with methane until it can hold no more and the methane enters the atmosphere. If this release occurs quickly, then the ocean won't absorb the methane quick enough and both the atmosphere and ocean will be exposed simultaneously.		We aren't exactly sure what drove the temperature up initially to the point where methane clathrates would release their methane, but once they began to release, it was a domino effect. You see, methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas, meaning it has a much larger impact on increasing temperatures than carbon dioxide. Once methane clathrates begin releasing methane, the corresponding increase in global temperature causes even more methane clathrates to release methane.		This domino increase in temperature increase ultimately caused a 6??C increase in temperature at the equator, and did so quickly in terms of geological time. We're talking less than a handful of decades, most likely. That was enough to change weather patterns and destroy the equatorial habitat vertebrate life was dependant on at the time.		But it wasn't just temperature that killed everything. Methane saturated the oceans, suffocating (anoxia) oxygen-dependant ocean life by both direct action (binding to hemoglobin) and indirect action (causing species that performed better in the environment to further damage the environment for those that didn't).		So what is the point of all of this? We don't know exactly what triggered the methane clathrates during the last great extinction???it was most likely a volcano from the Siberian Traps that heated up and/or exposed methane clathrates in the nearby shallow seawater (remember, the geography was different back then)???but we do know the cause of it now: us.		In short, humans are increasing greenhouse gas levels to a point where methane clathrates are beginning to release methane at unprecedented levels. Historically, before the Industrial Era, the atmosphere has fluctuated between 275 and 285 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere. We humans have brought that number up to over 399 ppm, a 27.3% increase. The corresponding temperature change has led to increases in arctic and oceanic temperatures sufficient significantly increase the release of methane from methane clathrates. Siberia is now releasing more methane than ever before every summer. Scientists discovered more than 4,000 new methane plumes in the ocean this past year, most, but not all of which are being dissolved into the water before reaching the surface.		You know that saying guns don't kill people, people kill people? Well, methane is just the gun here, and we're pulling the trigger by driving up temperatures to a point where it is released.","depth":1,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jedouard","name":"t1_ck8wfna","parent_id":"t1_ck8wb5l","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409840462,"created_utc":1409836862}

That being said, as it stands now, wind power is almost at par with coal, and in places where the grid is weak (such as Ecuador and Indonesia), building large centralized power plants and the necessary grid infrastructure is usually much more expensive than putting rooftop solar and a small trig em system for the peaks.

The extreme weather we're experiencing now globally is due to 0.85??C of warming. Due to political inaction and intransigence, it's unlikely we'll avoid exceeding 2.0??C of warming.		We actually have the means and knowledge to mitigate and reduce the rate of warming, and weather climate change. Applying those means would mean major social and economic changes, and most people,so far, would rather have their grandchildren perish than make those necessary changes. The younger redditors here will actually be among those who don't survive.		I wonder if someone could remind me how the demonstrably false notion that human beings are an intelligent species came about.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sdbest","name":"t1_ck94fop","parent_id":"t1_ck92jp6","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409857298,"created_utc":1409853698}

{"body":">If we can't first figure out what percentage is caused by man, and from what exactly, then we can never answer your question. 		The question doesn't need answering in order for us to respond. Regardless of the percentage attributable to human activity, we still have a serious, civilization and maybe even species destroying problem to address. CO2 emissions caused by human activity we can, in theory, curtail. Natural fluctuations we can't prevent, but we can mitigate their effects on us, in part, by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. 		We know how to not only survive climate change, but also how to thrive as it becomes more extreme. None of this beyond either the state of our scientific knowledge, our technologies, or our resources. It may be beyond, however, our social and cultural organization.		It seems to me that assigning percentages to human activity or natural fluctuations misses the point. We are facing the greatest threat to human existence in our species' history. It could end our time on earth. We have both the knowledge and means to avoid climate change ending civilization as we now know it, and perhaps even our own existence.		The inescapable before us is whether or not our species has the intelligence to respond to save our own existence. It seems, sadly but likely, that we don't. 		Some years ago a long time friend of mine, a conservation biologist, remarked to me that it is not clear that human intelligence is, in fact, a survival factor. It may be that the nature and limitations of our particular type of intelligence may make it impossible for us to avoid our own diminution or even demise as a species.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sdbest","name":"t1_ck9882n","parent_id":"t1_ck94w44","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409864327,"created_utc":1409860727}

Now granted, we're almost certainly living beyond our means as far as using fossil fuels goes, but just because we'll probably run out at some point doesn't mean they're finite, it just means we'll have outstripped the rate at which they're produced.		Nonetheless I'm inclined to agree. The man-made vs natural argument is irrelevant. It doesn't matter; we'll become reliant on nuclear power for our energy eventually anyway so the only real question is how long we spend burning fossil fuels (faster than they're being made) in the interim.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SMURGwastaken","name":"t1_ck8toys","parent_id":"t1_ck8tbgh","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1409829678,"created_utc":1409826078}
