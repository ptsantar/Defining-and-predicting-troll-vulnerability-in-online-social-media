{"body":"Very hyperbolic... It's like the thing with aspartame, you have to drink the equivalent of 3+ liters per day (edit: of sugar free sodas) to potentially get *one* cancer cell, or what was equivalent to the one the mice in the lab got.  	You get a title like this one almost every day, I've heard once that "tomatoes cause cancer", also because of one chemical present in a very tiny amount... 		Edit2: Because people keep asking. That was [just one study done on mice.](http://www.cracked.com/article_17578_5-things-they-say-give-you-cancer-and-why-theyre-wrong.html) They gave them ridiculous doses of aspartame. The absolute lowest dose that made *ONE* cancer cell appear was equivalent to about 3 litres of sugar free soda every day. So you will be fine, aspartame has been shown repeatedly to be safe - it's used in very tiny amounts in sodas because it's very sweet so it's practically impossible to get harmful doses.		Edit 3: No, pedantic repliers, you don't get one cancer cell for every 3 litres of coke. The study was done on mice, the absolute minimum dose of aspartame to detect any cancerous cells in the mouse was the equivalent of 3 litres of coke in a human per day.","depth":1,"score":1057,"ups":1057,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"magicsebi","name":"t1_cosq61o","parent_id":"t1_cosn2oy","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424547952,"created_utc":1424547952}

{"body":"Dude. You should really try to cut back. If you continue with that, you're not going to reach an age where cancer becomes a problem.		Edit: Since everybody is being super whiny about my claims, I did a little research. Since, there are way too many replies, I am just going to post my findings in an edit. I will start by saying that most of my info on the artificial sweeteners used, came from the wikipedia pages for those sweeteners. 		According to those, it seems that I have been overstating the dangers of them. Drinking 3 liters of Coke Zero a day will still keep you below the ADI (acceptable daily intake) standards (as long as you are about an adult male of about average weight).		Besides sweeteners, Coke Zero has a shit load of caffeine. There are 96mg of caffeine per liter. There is no official ADI for caffeine, but it's generally considered to only go up to about around 3mg/kg of body weight ([Source 1](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/generalissues/Pages/Caffeine.aspx) and [Source 2](http://www.nestle.com.au/nhw/nutritionfactsheets/caffeine)) So for a 70kg person, you're getting a 4.11mg/kg, which is a bit high. I'm like 99% sure this isn't associated with a shorter life span, but can be associated with anxiety.		I was not able to substantiate my claim that drinking Coke Zero would lead to a shorter life span with the brief research I did.		To support my original claim, though, here's some stuff to think about: I do think, though, that if you are drinking 3 liters of Coke Zero a day, you are probably not leading a very healthy lifestyle. Of course this is just anecdotal evidence, but the people I have met who drink 3 liters of diet soda, do not eat healthily. I would be very surprised if that amount of diet soda intake isn't correlated with unhealthy lifestyles/obesity. Also, I'm a college kid that isn't going to put a super amount of effort into research for a fucking Reddit comment and just did this to procrastinate some, so I pretty much only used Wikipedia for my sources. It's foolish to think that huge corporations like Coca-Cola, or other food manufacturers that utilize artificial sweeteners aren't, at the very least, going to be monitoring controversial Wikipedia articles that are linked to from their product pages, and edit them to try to downplay any dangers associated with those sweeteners. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if we find out down the road some other dangers about these sweeteners. If there was something bad associated with these sweeteners, you could bet your ass, these companies would be dropping millions on funding research showing no link or trying to disprove negative claims.","depth":5,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MyOtherNameWasBetter","name":"t1_cosv2a1","parent_id":"t1_cosugg8","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424557727,"created_utc":1424557727}

{"body":"A response to the article located in the comments (the article itself is behind a paywall, but I read as much info as I could in the parts that were available):		The data in this study do not support the general statement that "artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance and thus cause obesity by altering the gut microbiome".		The extensive research conducted on aspartame and sucralose has clearly demonstrated that these compounds do not affect the gut microbiota (1,2). Aspartame is completely digested into amino acids and methanol, which are absorbed in the small intestine. Neither aspartame nor its digestion products ever reach the colon; thus aspartame itself cannot affect gut microbiota. Sucralose is not digested, and passes unchanged to the large intestine; however numerous studies show pure sucralose cannot be metabolized by microflora.		So how is it possible that these 2 sweeteners reportedly altered the gut microbiota in this study? The answer ? inappropriate statistics and huge changes in overall diet composition.		Firstly, to achieve statistical significance, the authors combined all 3 different sweetener groups (n=20/group) together into one group (n=60) and compared against the combined control groups to obtain 1 statistically significant p value! So 6 groups of 20 became 2 groups of 60, making it impossible to determine which, if any, individual sweetener had a significant effect.		Secondly, the notable impact on intake of mouse chow, by adding extremely high doses of sweetener to drinking water, was ignored. Doses and food intake can only be estimated as data were reported for just 4 of the 20 mice per group and for only 3 days of the 11-week study. Doses of the sweeteners were up to 1000 times the acceptable daily intake (ADI), and consumption of mouse chow dropped by 50% in some groups in just 72 hr. Mouse chow contains fiber, protein, fat, fermentable carbohydrates and a host of other components that have repeatedly been shown to affect both gut microbiota and glycemic indices. Clearly, these dramatic changes in diet would result in changes in microbiota, and glycemic responses. Other dietary factors were similarly not considered in the human studies.		Lastly, these conclusions do not agree with the results of the extensive testing of these sweeteners required for approval, including human clinical studies conducted in healthy and diabetic participants for periods of several weeks to months, on parameters including glycemic indices and insulin (1,2). These studies must include control groups, baseline measurements, blinding, crossover designs, and appropriate statistics to ensure no effects on these parameters with continual exposure of sweeteners, at maximum expected uses.		Thus this study provides no evidence that aspartame or sucralose alters gut microbiota or glycemic response. In contrast, the observation that saccharin at high doses alters gut microbiota was known in the 80s, and contributed to the establishment of the ADI for saccharin (3). Therefore, extrapolation of findings of effects of saccharin on the gut microbiome to all artificial sweeteners has no scientific basis and overlooks well-established differences in chemistry and metabolism.		Also not mentioned are the numerous studies demonstrating that use of low calorie sweeteners, including aspartame and sucralose, are beneficial in weight loss and weight loss maintenance programs (4,5).		The allegations that artificial sweeteners contribute to glucose intolerance and obesity based on studies in this report, are unfounded and should be withdrawn.		References		1.

In this context, we could think of a plethora of reasons why correlations between drinking diet soda and overweight BMI might exist. For example, if someone is overweight they would have motivation to replace sugary drinks with diet ones. It follows that some portion of that correlation (probably not an insignificant amount) could be attributed to the fact that people started drinking diet sodas after they developed a weight problem; the diet sodas themselves did not play any role in making them overweight.

The article mentions that 46-53% of Americans drink at least 1 can of soda per day. For an 80 year old who started drinking Coke at age 6 that's 27010 cans of Coke in their lifetime. The average can of soda contains anywhere from 26-29mcg of 4-mel (the caramel chemical in question). That's about 68 kilograms of a *possible* carcinogen passing through your body over your lifetime.

{"body":"A few principles from toxicology:		1. You need to dose above the a threshold to have toxic effects, below that the body has ample capacity to metabolise and/or remove the toxin. (Note: Does not apply to ionizing radiation) For example, all baked and roasted goods contain acrylamide which is a very potent neurotoxin and possible human carcinogen, dark roast coffee have so much of it that they are subject to certain labelling laws in Carlifornia (This product contains substances that are known to cause cancer in the state of CA blah blah). Yet nobody seems to have an issue with a daily breakfast of charred toast and strong coffee. 		2. Some toxins do accumulate such as lead and mercury, hence long term exposure may cause a problem. However it is a small fraction of everything. 		3. Certain substances interact inside a body and it could be good and bad, and indeed the current theory of cancer formation requires both an initiator and a promoter for malignant tumors to occur. It is possible that caramel may well be a carcinogen (we don't really know which type) at the doses tested, but again, lab rats have a high basal rate of cancer occurrence and results must be interpreted with caution.

Lab studies are done with very high doses because they are limited on the amount of time they have to perform the tests. They give their test subjects high doses, see the results and extrapolate from there. This is how all tests are done. 		So if ONE cancer cell was found in a mouse after being exposed to high amounts of aspartame, that doesn't mean that you NEED that high amount in order for cancer cells to form. Frequency plays just as big of a factor as the subject's health or exposure to other carcinogens. 		Your comparison is equivalent to saying "smoking one cigarette is not harmful to your health" and forgetting that people who smoke habitually can eventually end up with large health problems including cancer.

{"body":"Not really. A 12oz can of coke 39 grams of sugar in it, mostly fructose. This comes from corn syrup, but it's the same sugar you'd find in any sort of naturally sweet plant. It's a simple sugar, and one of the sweetest- 1.7x sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). This does make it somewhat beneficial in that you need less of it to make a drink as sweet- so homemade lemonade using sucrose (more likely, being that it's more common) would require more grams per liter than one using fructose. 		And they would be unhealthy for the same reasons, if drunk in large quantities. Soda isn't evil. It's a source of easy calories. If you drink a single two liter in a day, that's 220 grams of sugar, or about 880 calories. But of course, soda's a drink, and doesn't fill you up like a meal does- so people are perfectly content to eat three meals in a day, plus snacks, plus 2 liters on coke on top of that. That'll make you fat, because you have a huge excess of calories. 		So if people are drinking a can a day, it's really nothing to worry about. It might not be a huge problem if they drink a few cans a day, either, assuming they take care of themselves in other ways (maintaining a balance diet, being active, etc).

{"body":"> Serious question, and sources would be appreciated. 		Sugar is part fructose, part glucose. Glucose is needed for energy, but fructose is not. High fructose is pretty much those molecules floating around in nearly the same quantities.		Fructose is also pretty sweet tasting, and you'll find some sodas with even extra fructose added, to sweeten drinks. They also add salt to make you thirstier, so you'll drink even more... but that's a social thing, and you're asking for the science of why it's bad.		Fructose is digested by the liver (and you can look up Fructolysis), in a manner very similar to alcohol. It produces triglycerides and can build up fat in your liver, and this is bad. There's a doctor (Lustig) that talks about the methods, although not everyone agrees with his conclusion that fructose is as bad as alcohol. He literally pulls out a can of beer and tells the audience that when they hand their kid a soda, this is what they're giving them. His claims have been disputed, but this isn't some quack vaccine-autism theory. He has a point, and his methods appear solid.		Fructose can cause issues with insulin production. Easy enough to google that.		It can suppress leptin causing you to remain hungry, but this doesn't seem to happen with sugar. Also easy to google.

{"body":"There's a lot of conflicting articles, possibly due to misinformation campaigns by industries that have boomed due to riding on HCFS or maybe FDA conspiracy SJW shitposts. To be honest, I'm not sure who to believe so I'm inclined to trust sources from scientific journals as they at least past through *some* form of scrutiny to give you a scientific, physiological perspective on the matter.		Important points are that since HCFS contains free [Glucose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose) and [Fructose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose) instead of the combined form of [Sucrose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose) found in cane sugar, its [glycemic index](http://www.glycemicindex.com/about.php) is [73](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2695593) (normal is below 70 while sucrose's is [around 60](http://www.sugar.org/sugar-your-diet/family-health/glycemic-index/)) meaning that it is much more readily absorbed into the blood stream and makes blood sugar and insulin levels spike. Too much of this over time will cause insulin resistance leading into [type 2 Diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2). I am also told that [free fructose is readily absorbed into the liver and induces a lipogenesis spike](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/79/4/537.full.pdf+html) which leads to [liver damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316260).		What's important to note, however is that while Glucose containing carbohydrates induce regulatory responses within your body, [Fructose does so in a much more reduced manner](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/76/5/911.full). This means that Fructose has a much smaller "hangover" effect than either Glucose or Sucrose leading to more consumption. 		Also, [sugars have been shown to cause addiction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/) by stimulating reward pathways much in the same way that alcohol and other drugs do. Amusingly, in the article I linked above, sugar is shown to out-compete Cocaine in rat tests. So it's about as fair to say sugar addiction is a problem of personal habit as it is saying that cocaine or alcohol addiction is.		Note that I have not scrutinized any of the methods used by any of the articles I referenced, this is because I simply cannot be bothered to do so.		**tl;dr HFCS will give you diabeetus faster, break your liver with fat, and is like taking alcohol without the hangover.**		Edit: Classic reddit, I give a bunch of independently sourced from scientific journals that together point to the negative aspects of HFCS might play and the response is to downvote. If you wanted someone to just reaffirm your viewpoints that HCFS aren't bad for you then go visit the [corn industry shill sites](http://sweetsurprise.com/) instead of asking a challenge posed as a legitimate question.","depth":2,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mogura","name":"t1_cotc5rt","parent_id":"t1_coszfco","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424602846,"created_utc":1424602846}

Sugar molecules start to end up in places where they shouldn't, like on our proteins or on our DNA which then leads to all sorts of other problems.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OurLordScience","name":"t1_cosv3i4","parent_id":"t1_costqht","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424557795,"created_utc":1424557795}

{"body":"> The trick is knowing your genetic limit. The future of medicine is in the genome, not in drugs, supplements, or nutrition. 		Personalized genomics is something I've actually done quite a lot of work in, and I think you're really overstating the situation. Genomic variation (SNVs) actually have a relatively small effect in disease incidence outside of really obvious factors (like BRCA1/2, and TP53). 		Most SNVs have really small relative risk factors for complex disease - I was at a translational medicine conference where Russ Altman gave a keynote abut the variation seen in the GWAS studies. He referred to consumer genomics as "recreational genomics" because the effect sizes are so small and your physician is unlikely to make real substantive changes to your lifestyle (they'll probably still tell you to eat healthy and exercise) - my takeaway was when he noted a SNV as having the largest effect on cardiovascular health was less significant than (I'm paraphrasing here) "you walking out of this conference room and having a slice of cake off the table in the lobby". 		All that said - I think a lot of people also misunderstand the science behind the genome. The DNA is only a fraction of singificant factors that affect your health - the epigenome (which is quite a bit more difficult to study, as anyone who has done bisufite or Methyl-seq can tell you) also shapes your health.

Dr. Joseph Perrone, Chief Science Officer for the Center for Accountability in Science explains:		This new study simply found that the soft drinks researchers examined contained various levels of 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a coloring agent in soda, and that between 44 and 58 percent of Americans drink at least one can of soda per day. The authors??? assertion that exposure to 4-MEI by drinking soda is an ???avoidable and unnecessary??? cancer risk, dramatically overstates the research linking 4-MEI to cancer.		Researchers in this study did not examine whether 4-MEI is a human carcinogen. The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) does not list 4-MEI as a human carcinogen, though a single NTP study did show that high exposure to 4-MEI could cause cancer in rats. Similarly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Food Safety Authority, and Health Canada have examined available research and concluded that 4-MEI in food does not pose a health risk. In fact, California, under its Proposition 65 law, is the only major jurisdiction to consider low levels of 4-MEI potentially harmful.
