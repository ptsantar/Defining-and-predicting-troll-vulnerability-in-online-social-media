{"body":"I'm completely baffled by the constant conflation of the two concepts here - the 'holographic universe' (a quantum theory) and the 'Simulation Argument' ( a more-or-less philosophical concept ). The two are completely unrelated.","depth":0,"score":52,"ups":52,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jstevewhite","name":"t1_csq15o9","parent_id":"t3_3bvr37","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435860107,"created_utc":1435856507}
{"body":"The author of the article seems to play with both ideas interchangeably.  He implies that if the holographic principle holds, then we are living in a simulation.  To his credit, he does not mention who might be running that simulation.","depth":1,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Trenin","name":"t1_csq1q8x","parent_id":"t1_csq15o9","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435861008,"created_utc":1435857408}
{"body":"Conflating both of them does each idea a disservice. 		The holographic principle is just a macroscopic application of Stokes' theorem, which is very very interesting.

{"body":"The writer of the article indeed confuses hologram and simulation in the last part of the article, but that doesn't depreciate the fact that our 3D (physical) Universe could in fact be an illusion.		Based on nothing more than a hunch, I believe this may turn out to be no more than a convenient mathematical view of the Universe that may lead to some interesting discoveries, much like string theory (ooh, I said it).		Interesting article nonetheless.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PorcupineTreeClimber","name":"t1_csqs7y8","parent_id":"t1_csq15o9","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435909637,"created_utc":1435906037}
{"body":"I think you tread into semantic and philosophical territory there. If the universe is in fact holographic in this sense, does that necessarily mean that it is an "ilusion"? I don't think it does, any more than the fact that we are clouds of particles moving through primarily empty space means we are illusory. 		Dame argument applies to the simulation argument. It begins to strain the meaning of "real" and "illusory" beyond the breaking point.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jstevewhite","name":"t1_csr2ukm","parent_id":"t1_csqs7y8","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435942169,"created_utc":1435938569}

{"body":"Science is a philosophy, certainly. But not every philosophy is scientific, and not everything that's scientific is 'philosophical' in the fundamental sense. 		Not the theoretical and concrete at all. Epistemology, more appropriately. Science is the exploration of reality. This question is more similar to "What *is* reality?" 		/u/PorcupineTreeClimber said:		>that doesn't depreciate the fact that our 3D (physical) Universe could in fact be an illusion.		My remark was based on this statement. Since they weren't specific about whether the comment was referring to the 'holographic universe' or the 'simulation argument', there are two ways to interpret it.		If the Simulation Argument is accurate, and the universe is simulated, the concept of 'real' and 'illusory' become muddled; is the Universe running *our* simulation "real" in any fundamental sense? We have the word "real"; does it have an actual referent - in which case our world is illusory - or is it conditional - in which case the Simulation argument is not relevant to what's real/illusory. 		In the case the comment referred to the 'holographic universe', I was remarking that, if true, calling reality 'illusory' is stretching the definition to the breaking point. Is our experience of touching a stone illusory, because we're actually feeling field relationships, and both we and the stone are mostly empty space?","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jstevewhite","name":"t1_cstsqbx","parent_id":"t1_cstkgec","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1436194929,"created_utc":1436191329}

{"body":"Well, there are a couple of problems here. First, the word "hologram" is a *metaphor* here. There are no cosmic lasers projecting us into the void. It's a confluence of string theory and quantum theory that leads to the *idea* that a 2 dimensional 'informational reality' can be projected into three dimensions. A *characteristic* of the universe.		The simulation argument - Nick Bostrom's brainchild that informs these sorts of discussions - is unrelated to any physical reality other than a potentially demonstrable ability to simulate consciousness and reality to a level indistinguishable from "real" reality.		The two concepts are orthogonal. If the universe *were not* a hologram, it could still be a simulation. In fact, the likelihood of the universe being a simulation is unrelated to any physical characteristic at all other than the ones described.

Yes... "hologram" is just a way to remember it. Kind of like how we call a supermassive collapsed star that bends light around it a "black hole". It's not really a hologram, I get it, but you have to call it something.  I don't see how that invalidates the whole article.		>The simulation argument - Nick Bostrom's brainchild that informs these sorts of discussions - is unrelated to any physical reality other than a potentially demonstrable ability to simulate consciousness and reality to a level indistinguishable from "real" reality.

{"body":">I don't see how that invalidates the whole article.		I don't think it *invalidates* the article; it still contains interesting information from a scientist. I think it does bring question to the author's understanding of the two concepts.		You clearly 'get' the hologram thing... So let me ask you why, if you know it's not a lasers-and-film hologram, but a possible characteristic of reality, that it would make you *more likely* to believe we lived in a simulation? To me that's like saying "We discovered that the Big Bang was real; it stands to reason that we might be living in a simulation!"... a non-sequitur, if you will.		The Simulation Argument says that if a few conditions are true, it's very likely that we are in fact living in a simulation. Bostrom phrased it negatively, but basically, if it turns out that we *can* simulate reality and consciousness in such a fashion that the simulation is indistinguishable from the real thing (think 'The Matrix'), and if we actually *do* it commonly, then we can draw a couple of meaningful conclusions. First, that the majority of human consciousnesses that will ever exist are simulated. Second, since that is the case, the probability is that *we* are in fact, simulated.  		Furthermore, there's absolutely no reason to believe that a simulation would use a 'hologram' at all. You can simulate a game with the monitor turned off; all the 'images' are still generated, but never projected. So the two are completely unrelated, both factually *and* probabilistically. That is, the holographic-ness of the universe doesn't influence at all the probability that we're being simulated. :D		Sorry, man, you asked :D","depth":4,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jstevewhite","name":"t1_csq3jxh","parent_id":"t1_csq2z3k","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435863815,"created_utc":1435860215}
