{"body":"While I don't disagree with you, let's be careful how much we critique the article based on whom it comes from - that would be the [genetic fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/genetic). Instead, let's try to critique the study ([full text here](http://huolab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Danbold-Huo-2014.pdf)) and its interpretation based on its own merits.		For one, 98 participants is a perfectly fine number for an experiment. Sure, larger is always better, but the results are significant, with several p values less than .01, and the majority falling under .05. For those of you not knowledgeable about statistics, a result is generally considered statistically significant if a p value is less than .05, and the lower the p value is, the better.		The real problem with OP's article is the interpretation. There is no citation of sources indicating support for diversity in the past. The claim "whites express declining support for diversity" is completely baseless. It may be true that whites show less support for diversity after being told they're soon to be a minority, but I'd bet they still support diversity more now than they did in, say, the '50s.		All that the study shows is that whites support diversity less when reminded that whites will not be a majority in the relatively near future - it's important to note that they still show some support for diversity even when reminded like this.		This is directly from OP's article:		>Those who felt that all ethnic groups represent America equally well supported diversity even when thinking about their group's declining share of the U.S. population.		This indicates that those whites who held the least prejudiced opinions were not bothered by the revelation that whites will be a minority soon. There is likely to be a correlation between the strength of one's prejudices and how strongly they're affected by this information.","depth":1,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tyrren","name":"t1_cl19kpo","parent_id":"t1_cl12376","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1412544005,"created_utc":1412540405}
