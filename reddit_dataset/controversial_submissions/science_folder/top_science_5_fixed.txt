{"body":"They used to be pure ground tobacco leaves, no additives. Unfortunately, they've added firesafe paper material like the rest of the industry.		I would personally think that a low or no-additive tobacco would be healthier, but that's pure conjecture and not scientifically based. One of the things that makes tobacco harmful is that the ash just sits in your lungs due to the amount of smoke you take in. Any radiation (from the potassium used in the fertilizer of the plant), any carcinogenic chemicals, any mutagenic chemicals; all of it just sits there. The sheer volume and frequency of smoke are the problem. Give yourself a few days of not smoking (switch to an ecig or something in the mean time) and working up a sweat, and you'll realize just how much crap is sitting in your lungs from moderate to heavy smoking.

{"body":"Yes, "whole different ball game" is a commonly used idiom in the UK.		Europe is 50 or so completely distinct countries with (mostly) their own languages and cultures, which again are often even split between regions.		I mean, consider that there are probably about 10 completely different major accents in the mainland of UK... Northern and Southern Scottish, North (Cardiff) and South Wales, West Country, East Midlands, Birmingham, Liverpool, Yorkshire, London. Each of those areas has its own slang, its own variances in culture, food, and political attitudes. It's all British to an extent, but it varies a lot.

For marijauna, it would post the obvious things like can help chemo patients and can help people with MS. Also a great way to relax and relieve stress. They said a person who goes home to smoke and get high on a daily basis is healthier than a person who binge drinks one day of the week or even one day of the month.		They say stuff like binge drinking is extremely dangerous whereas moderate drinking can actually be healthy for you (as I mentioed it can help ward off stroke with the blood thinning effect).		And 4 drinks but the article didn't specify whether it was beer/wine/hard liquor.

Suffocation = brain cells dead but they never said the actual measure of how much ganja was in it.		I think all articles should include and specify how much amount. Saying 1 joint does not help at all. One person's joint can get 5 people high while another person's joint can only get one person high.

{"body":"Expanding on the other reply to this comment (addressing the idea that weed and alcohol are in the same "class") - alcohol is a good example. Taking shots, it is VERY easy to get alcohol poisoning when you don't know what you're doing. People die from it every year. Not drunk driving or doing something else stupid, but from the alcohol itself. 		I point this out because alcohol is definitely a way more dangerous drug overall than marijuana. Let's take Everclear as an example. It's a popular alcohol for college/young people's parties - it's cheap and gets you drunk. About 300g of alcohol is enough to kill a 132 lb person. Standard U.S. shot glass size is around 1.5oz. At 95% alcohol, that's 40.3g per shot. So 7 1/2 shots (which can easily be consumed before you realize how strong it is, and is the same amount of shots one might consume for other drinks) will kill an average 132 lb person.		This is all based on averages, and not accounting for the differences in male/female/high or low tolerance, genetics, and so forth. But considering that lightweights like me can get hammered from about 5 Mike's Hard Lemonades, it's fair to say that 8 shots will kill most average people.		Sorry for the spiel, but to me that's a terrifying thought. People can consume shots VERY quickly, especially while playing drinking games. Someone might have drank a lethal dose in half an hour and not realize it until they are on the way to the ER. Part of this is, of course, due to being ignorant of alcohol and it's effects - but party atmospheres do not promote good decision making, at best. And at worst, others can lead new drinkers into danger without realizing it.		On the other hand, scraping some Google pages puts the ballpark of a lethal dose of marijuana between 20,000 and 40,000 times what is in the average joint/marijuana cigarette. Which is about 1,500 POUNDS of weed. Even if we say those figures are ludicrously inaccurate and go as low as 100 pounds - that amount isn't physically possible. Someone would pass out FAR before they even came within binocular distance of seeing an OD. It's not possible to eat that much - hell, maybe not even inject that much directly into your bloodstream, if that was possible. To make oil, you get about a 10% return in weight - so that wildly inaccurate 100 lbs would make 10 lbs of oil, physically impossible to take.		The difference is astonishing. Considering the original figure of 1,500 lbs of weed, the most concentrated (I think) form of oil would be a lethal dose of 150 pounds of oil. Consuming a man-sized amount of the most concentrated form.		I don't mean to offend, or assume ignorance on your part. This is just something I'm passionate about. I haven't personally smoked in over three months, and the only time I've smoked daily was a short period of about two months in my life. I am not a habitual user, or even really casual.

Starting page 7:	>; Among participants who reported smoking marijuana 0, 1 - 5, 6 - 20 or &gt; 20 days out of the past 30 days, there were trends towards increase in reported symptoms of bronchitis and respiratory illness. 		Interesting statistic on page 10:	>; The study first shows that this is an important topic as marijuana use is common among U.S. adults with 59.1% reporting using marijuana in their lifetime and 12.2% reporting current use of marijuana in the past 30 days.		Also page 10:	> The study then demonstrates that current smokers are more likely to report recent symptoms of respiratory illness but have little clinically significant associated changes in spirometry. 		([Spirometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry) measures lung volume and air flow.)		Page 10-11:	>; Our findings regarding the respiratory symptoms of habitual marijuana smokers corroborate the existing evidence. Many studies have demonstrated that habitual marijuana smoke increases symptoms of bronchitis and our data similarly show an increase in recent self-reported respiratory illness with trends towards increases in selfreported respiratory infections and symptoms of wheezing (5). Supporting these clinical findings, several studies of the respiratory epithelium of conducting airways and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of habitual marijuana smokers have shown an increase macro- and microscopic signs of inflammation (16-21). Furthermore, studies have shown that marijuana smoke is associated with a decrease in airway conductance, consistent with large airway edema seen endoscopically (22-24). Despite this characterization of marijuana smoke as a large airway irritant, our data did not show an association between increasing exposure in the prior month and deleterious change in spirometric values of small airways disease. Rather, for each additional day of marijuana smoked in the past month, there was an associated change in FEV1 with a 0.13% increase in predicted FVC. 		**tl;dr:** Marijuana use increases self-reported bronchitis, coughing and wheezing but doesn't appear to significantly reduce lung function.","depth":1,"score":89,"ups":89,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BuddhistSagan","name":"t1_cnswc66","parent_id":"t1_cnsw4r1","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1421600851,"created_utc":1421600851}

Also page 10:	> The study then demonstrates that current smokers are more likely to report recent symptoms of respiratory illness but have little clinically significant associated changes in spirometry. 		([Spirometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry) measures lung volume and air flow.)		Page 10-11:	> Our findings regarding the respiratory symptoms of habitual marijuana smokers corroborate the existing evidence. Many studies have demonstrated that habitual marijuana smoke increases symptoms of bronchitis and our data similarly show an increase in recent self-reported respiratory illness with trends towards increases in selfreported respiratory infections and symptoms of wheezing (5). Supporting these clinical findings, several studies of the respiratory epithelium of conducting airways and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of habitual marijuana smokers have shown an increase macro- and microscopic signs of inflammation (16-21). Furthermore, studies have shown that marijuana smoke is associated with a decrease in airway conductance, consistent with large airway edema seen endoscopically (22-24). Despite this characterization of marijuana smoke as a large airway irritant, our data did not show an association between increasing exposure in the prior month and deleterious change in spirometric values of small airways disease. Rather, for each additional day of marijuana smoked in the past month, there was an associated change in FEV1 with a 0.13% increase in predicted FVC. 		**tl;dr:** Marijuana use increases self-reported bronchitis, coughing and wheezing but doesn't appear to significantly reduce lung function.","depth":2,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Echrome","name":"t1_cnswz08","parent_id":"t1_cnswc66","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1421602167,"created_utc":1421602167}

Starting page 7:	>; Among participants who reported smoking marijuana 0, 1 - 5, 6 - 20 or &gt; 20 days out of the past 30 days, there were trends towards increase in reported symptoms of bronchitis and respiratory illness. 		Interesting statistic on page 10:	>; The study first shows that this is an important topic as marijuana use is common among U.S. adults with 59.1% reporting using marijuana in their lifetime and 12.2% reporting current use of marijuana in the past 30 days.		Also page 10:	> The study then demonstrates that current smokers are more likely to report recent symptoms of respiratory illness but have little clinically significant associated changes in spirometry. 		([Spirometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry) measures lung volume and air flow.)		Page 10-11:	>; Our findings regarding the respiratory symptoms of habitual marijuana smokers corroborate the existing evidence. Many studies have demonstrated that habitual marijuana smoke increases symptoms of bronchitis and our data similarly show an increase in recent self-reported respiratory illness with trends towards increases in selfreported respiratory infections and symptoms of wheezing (5). Supporting these clinical findings, several studies of the respiratory epithelium of conducting airways and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of habitual marijuana smokers have shown an increase macro- and microscopic signs of inflammation (16-21). Furthermore, studies have shown that marijuana smoke is associated with a decrease in airway conductance, consistent with large airway edema seen endoscopically (22-24). Despite this characterization of marijuana smoke as a large airway irritant, our data did not show an association between increasing exposure in the prior month and deleterious change in spirometric values of small airways disease. Rather, for each additional day of marijuana smoked in the past month, there was an associated change in FEV1 with a 0.13% increase in predicted FVC. 		**tl;dr:** Marijuana use increases self-reported bronchitis, coughing and wheezing but doesn't appear to significantly reduce lung function.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BuddhistSagan","name":"t1_cnsww3x","parent_id":"t1_cnsuccs","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1421601999,"created_utc":1421601999}

{"body":"This article seems like a crock of shit on the surface. This is for two reasons;		1) The measurement of FEV1 to FVC ratios can be misleading in itself. Here is why;		>FEV1/FVC (FEV1%) is the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. In healthy adults this should be approximately 75???80%. In obstructive diseases (asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema) FEV1 is diminished because of increased airway resistance to expiratory flow; the FVC may be decreased as well, due to the premature closure of airway in expiration, just not in the same proportion as FEV1 (for instance, both FEV1 and FVC are reduced, but the former is more affected because of the increased airway resistance). This generates a reduced value (<80%, often ~45%). In restrictive diseases (such as pulmonary fibrosis) the FEV1 and FVC are both reduced proportionally and the value may be normal or even increased as a result of decreased lung compliance.		Now firstly, the study finds the ratio drops to sub 70% with 20+ years of smoking. Such a drop is not good. 		2) Using the ratio of FEV1/FVC in the years 1-5 and 5-20 are also misleading. It can tell you whether or not the lungs developed certain conditions where expiration decreases relative to full volume capacity. But it does not tell you whether or not total function has decreased. 		Most of the study itself is honest and mentions these things. The article linked however does not. Don't let the quality of this sub drop just because a poorly written article tells you what you want to hear. 		TL'DR : **The study did find there were adverse changes >20 years. <20 years, it can only be said that certain expiratory conditions were not induced, not that there are no adverse changes**.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Emperor_Mao","name":"t1_cnt5rqx","parent_id":"t3_2su4uu","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1421618022,"created_utc":1421618022}

However... I stopped smoking weed because it does had detrimental social side effects, namely not being in tune with your surrounding. I stopped caring about people's feelings and how my actions affected them and that's ultimately the reason I stopped.

{"body":"There are way too many variables for this study to conclude pot = less harmful than cigarettes to lungs. Taking a drag from a cig and a rip from a joint, usually, are different in the sense that pot smoke is held in the lungs for 3ish seconds to increase THC intake. This in turn increases the contact time of the carbon and other byproducts of combustion with the lung's components. As for vaporizing, there have been reports of people developing pneumonia from e-cogarettes. I don't know if vaporizing ground-up pot would hold the same risks, oil made from pot for the purpose of vaporizing would be more physically similar to e-cigs. Edibles, on the other hand, pose zero risk to your lungs for the obvious reason that it's eaten rather than smoked. I am 100% for the decriminalization of possession/consumption of small (under 1oz) ammounts of marijuana. Too many people's live get destroyed by something that is relatively less harmful than cigarettes/alcohol. When was the last time anyone heard of a family being torn apart by a abusive pot-head? How about alcoholic? The latter I have witnessed personally in the families of friends and my own. Should pot be legal for recreational use to all at/over the age of 18/21? I don't know. In a perfect world I would say absolutely. But I don't understand enough of economics, sociology, or psychology to make a solid prediction of how full-blown legalization on a federal lever of the US would impact society. I can say, since Colorado and Washington state legalized pot for recreational use, I have not heard of anything significantly negative as consequence.

{"body":"Inhaling smoke is unhealthy, period.  Marijuana might cure cancer, for all we know, but there's nothing about smoking that's good for your respiratory system.		That said, the only people I've heard of who smoke entire joints to themselves are cancer patients coping with chemo sickness.  The sheer amount of nausea means treating with large dosage, thus increasing tolerance.  Many medical programs offer pre-rolled cigarattes that are convenient given the frequency of usage involved. Most importantly, they already have cancer, so the threat of further harm could be considered moot by some patients.		All this to say, modern marijuana is of such a quality that smoking a fat spliff of proper buds on your own will induce a psychedelically intense high.  Joints are more of a group thing in this day and age.  One toke is quite often more than enough.

{"body":"Yeah that's a crock of shit. 		I was smoking marijuana numerous times a day for the better part of a year. I felt my blood pressure rising, my oxygen intake was reduced, it was more difficult to breathe and exercise, and I was always coughing. Its been 1 month and 1 day since I quit and I'm still coughing up bits of dark brown phlegm.  However, my blood pressure is WAY down, my lungs feel very clear, I notice a massive positive difference in the sound of my voice, I can run and exercise much easier without feeling as much internal strain. On top of that, my skin looks clearer and healthier. I can breathe deep and never get head rushes anymore.		If you put ANYTHING into your lungs it will have an effect on you, big or small. I smoked exclusively e-cigarettes and the same thing happened.  My blood pressure rose, and I still coughed up brown shit. Inhalation of anything but oxygen is not good for your lungs. Yes there is such a thing as moderation, but you'll still moderately effect your lungs. 		Side note- Not everyone coughs stuff up from smoking. I have roommates who smoke a pack of cigarettes every day or two and smoke weed every day and they never cough anything up. Be assured that there is still gunk in your lungs if you put it there.		E- Holy shit you guys pounce fast. Yes, I recognize that the study said once per day. I think you are falling victim to dodgy wording ???[I]n a large representative sample of US adults, ongoing use of marijuana is associated with increased respiratory symptoms of bronchitis without a significant functional abnormality in spirometry, and cumulative marijuana use under 20 joint-years is not associated [with] **significant** effects on lung function.???		Yes the body has its own filtration system, but you're straight up negligent if you don't think that system is worn down over a 20 year course while receiving burning smoke on a daily basis. My "experiment" was also under a year and I noticed the effects it had on me. This study introduces these effects on a smaller scale over a longer period of time.
