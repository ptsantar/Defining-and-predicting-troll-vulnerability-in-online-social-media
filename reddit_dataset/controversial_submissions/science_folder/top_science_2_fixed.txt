{"body":"It's tough. Message acceptance is influenced by a number of factors.?? Firstly, whether or not the message resonates with an existing belief system or view of the world. So, if one believes totally in 'free market economics' and that 'business will always do good and will self-correct when it doesn't, then any message that threatens business autonomy is likely to be rejected.??	Messages are also more likely to be accepted- and to lead to action- if one feels, in accepting, that one is 'with the majority'. In one study, the only message that led to reduced domestic energy use was 'you are the only one who hasn't reduced their use'. So normalising the framing is important.??	So too is emotional buy-in. Few people respond to logical argument alone: they are much more likely to respond if the message creates an emotional resonance. 'You have an increased risk of bronchogeneic carcinoma' may be less effective in driving smoking cessation that a daughter saying, 'Daddy, please don't smoke: i don't want you to die and leave me without a Daddy'.	Trusted vectors matter. If you hear a message from someone you trust and admire, you are more likely to believe it. Medical professionals have such a role: doctors and nurses and pharmacists, for instance, are much more trusted than many other professions.	Thus, shape the message, and chose the messenger, depending on the target audience.		On a broader issue, the point is well made: companies with huge budgets, and access to professionals who are expert in steering the beliefs and responses of individuals (these experts are 'advertisers'), have a huge advantage. Mass media also have a role in 'normalising' beliefs.??		In terms of solutions, there ARE some good media organisations and businesses who 'get it'. They could unite and start mainstreaming the message about the reality and immediacy of the threat posed by anthropogenic climate change. Individuals and smaller organisations can start to aggregate- offering greater comfort and security to those who join. All can communicate clearly with those who would listen to their views- thus mainstreaming the 'alternative' view. They can do this with friend/ family- but also by large numbers writing to MPs/ politicians/ business people- thus making clear that such views are not 'minority'.

When the initial warming is caused by a release of carbon, such as the current situation or the suspected release of massive quantities of methane that may have caused the PETM, the carbon itself acts as a forcing and causes the warming, but also acts as a feedback when other sources of carbon respond to the warming by releasing more.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ClimateMom","name":"t1_csr749f","parent_id":"t1_csr28l8","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435950233,"created_utc":1435946633}

The World Banks has estimated that meat consumption will continue to rise globally. Members of the commission have been part of research looking at the potential health benefits of climate change mitigation by reducing the consumption of meat and dairy and the impact on cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers.  		Some research looking at introducing regulatory instruments (e.g. taxes) across different countries that target GHGs in the agricultural sector (focusing on meat and dairy) have shown that the benefits are not universal.  In richer countries, such as the UK and US, there are likely to be benefits to health and lessened welfare losses because of the currently high consumption of meats and dairy and the smaller role that form of agriculture has in the economy (though there would be localised impacts). 		In low and middle income countries, where calorie intake is lower and more work in the agricultural sector, the welfare impacts from interventions will be greater and the health benefits lessened.  		What is important is that through more sustainable agricultural industrial practices on land use, reducing the fossil-fuel based fertilizers, and changing high income meat and dairy consumption, globally there can be an improvement in health while meeting the GHG challenge posed by agriculture and its future growth.

{"body":"Both technologies are set to have a strong impact in a decarbonising world, based on the scientific modelling results, although the role of each is contingent on national or regional circumstances. Solar is a particularly exciting technology, which has seen massive cost reductions in the last 5 years, making it increasingly cost-effective compared to alternative fossil generation. These cost reductions have been driven by a strong manufacturing base, particularly in China, due to growing demand driven by ambitious renewables programmes in countries such as China and India but also in developed countries such as Germany and the USA.  However, the role of solar in a country such as the UK is limited, due to the very low capacity factor that can be achieved due to lower levels of solar radiation, and because high electricity demand periods and sunny periods of the day do not line up. This of course could be solved in the future by electricity storage solutions.		 	Nuclear also has a potentially strong role to play, and is considered to be one of the most cost-effective low carbon sources of electricity. It is therefore often an important part of the future energy mix on economic grounds. However, there are considerable challenges, still around the waste issue. getting these complex plant built to budget and time and raising the initial capital to get the projects funded. For example, the nuclear plants currently being built by AREVA in Europe are subject to lengthy delays due to a range of technical and regulatory reasons.		 	Finally, the question implied one or the other of these technologies. However, there is room for both, as each plays a different role in the provision of electricity. For example, nuclear plants provide the base load level of electricity that is always required, something that solar cannot provide of course during the dark hours.

{"body":"To answer your questions one by one:		1. Immediate effects mainly stem from reduced air pollution i.e. less respiratory illness as less particulate matter from coal burning is in the air. Evidence from cities such as Beijing shows this.		2. Considerable benefits from reduced air pollution from burning coal can be expected immediately (see above). There will be multiple long-term benefits if the reduced coal burning is sufficient enough to avert serious or catastrophic climate change over the coming decades and centuries. Switching to low carbon energy also allows decentralization of power e.g. solar panels on health centre roofs in rural Africa which can have other immediate benefits in terms of energy availability and security. Also increased energy efficiency measures will result in less coal burning and save money e.g. if the NHS in the UK implemented energy efficiency measures it could save ??150million a year (in addition to the health benefits from curbing climate change resulting in a lower burden of patients)		3. Reduced coal burning by any amount should lead to commensurately reduced air pollution and therefore commensurately reduced respiratory illness and sequelae including death. To avert serious or catastrophic climate change and it???s consequent health effects significant population-wide reductions in emissions are needed, as outlined in the IPCC fifth assessment report.		4.

{"body":"I'm not on the Lancet team, but have an advanced degree in environmental policy along with an engineering degree, and work full time on policy issues. 		As a general response to your questions, the short answer is that there are a lot of co-benefits to switching to renewable sources of energy from fossil fuels. That means it's not necessarily important that less carbon dioxide is emitted by these sources, but that there are other pollutants that are also emitted by coal combustion that would be lowered as well - and these other pollutants are important to improved health outcomes. 		By most cost-benefit calculations, the most harmful energy sources in terms of local and regional health impacts are biomass burning (in the developing world, a lot of people still use wood and animal dung for cooking purposes) and coal (both for cooking and for electricity generation). By switching electricity generation from coal to a renewable source (or even to natural gas), you're reducing the amount of fine particulates that are emitted into the air (along with other pollutants), which results in better local and regional air quality, and lower cardiovascular and respiratory disease.		Health effects would be immediate (or at least in the near term). But it's most important, from a health perspective, to see these fuel switches in developing countries, as opposed to developed. Not to say that fuel-switching wouldn't be important in developed countries as well.		For example, a [recent IMF white paper](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/) estimated that the majority of external costs associated with fossil fuels are actually due to local air pollution and health effects. In this estimate, almost $2.3 trillion (of the total $5.3 trillion in costs) is borne by China - mainly due to the poor air quality and health impacts caused by coal use.

No. But in the end we found that the rain had come at the wrong time of year, had ruined normal patterns of cropping, and serious epidemics of malnutrition and disease followed. Hundreds of extra people died in the local area as a result. That was the first time I began to realise that this was a serious issue.		??

The 2015 Commission was formed when we realised that everything that had been predicted and described in 2009 had already happened??? What was needed next was to explore the pathways forward and a report to look at how responding to climate change can be good for public health.		The analogy that was talked about at some of our preliminary meetings was that a health professional concerned about the health impacts of tobacco consumption would no longer be content with only looking at the biomedical links between tobacco and ill health??? the responsible physician would start to look at public health interventions that can be put in place to reduce consumption and minimise the harm to individuals.

That is 20-25 GtCO2 per year we can afford to emit, while current levels are around 35 Gt CO2. This means strong reductions starting now, and ramping up through the 2020s & 2030s to stay within budget.		??

{"body":"Just in case they don't get to your questions (and since this has more to do with climate change in general than public health impacts): 		1. YES! There is a lot that we can do, and preparing for climate change is better for the economy and technology, not worse. Think about it this way: we have already and will continue to see bigger storms, rising sea levels, and power outages. So if we reduce our impact on the environment and prepare for climate change by making stronger roads, building houses farther from the ocean, etc. we can save a LOT of money in damages, as well as boost the economy in making these changes. Taking environmental steps is definitely good for the economy and technology. We cannot reverse the damage (some species will stay extinct), but we can make a difference. If you are looking for three things you can easily do on a personal basis: eat less meat, make an effort to buy local, and vote in favor of the environment. You will cut your carbon footprint in half with just that. 		2. In terms of a carrying capacity, world leaders and scientists have decided on a 2 degree change as the goal. We use the term "carbon budget" to describe what we can do before we pass that threshold ([the IPCC has a great infographic on this](http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI13-IPCCinfographic-FINAL_web.png)), and we are about 55% there. However, we are expected to pass that threshold by 2040. So action needs to be taken, but we can do it. 		3. We already are looking at adapting, but you should not give up one for the other. Generally there is climate "mitigation," where you reduce your impact on the environment, and climate "adaptation," where you prepare for the effects of what we have done. These effects are already being felt world-wide. The Earth has a high number of climate refugees - people who were displaced due to events that were made worse by climate change, such as severe floods or enormous heat waves - and that number will only continue to grow. Like I said before, lots of professionals are already looking at and implementing preparation, in part due to the President's imperative. But you can help by voting for more on a national or state level. 		I hope this answered your questions. Let me know if you have more.		edit: formatting","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ginsbergs-girlfriend","name":"t1_csqzgo4","parent_id":"t1_csqxxl2","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435934936,"created_utc":1435931336}

Policies such as ???carbon pricing???, which makes fossil fuel power plants pay for at least some of these damages, would change the economics so that the incentives of the investor and society as a whole are more aligned, and low-carbon energy becomes a more attractive investment.

For example, with an energy mix of increase CCS, nuclear and renewables, China could see a reduction of 542 years of life lost (YLL) per million population and reduction of 40 premature deaths per million. ??Under this scenario, the net cost to China would be approximately US $61.2/tCO2 not emitted. ??Despite the cost for China, there would be other longer term benefits from the avoided impact of the change in climate and the cost of adaptation along with improved worker productivity and quality of life (e.g. mental wellbeing). ??

For example, with an energy mix of increase CCS, nuclear and renewables, China could see a reduction of 542 years of life lost (YLL) per million population and reduction of 40 premature deaths per million. ??Under this scenario, the net cost to China would be approximately US $61.2/tCO2 not emitted. ??Despite the cost for China, there would be other longer term benefits from the avoided impact of the change in climate and the cost of adaptation along with improved worker productivity and quality of life (e.g. mental wellbeing). ??There are clearly geo-political and costs reasons for why Nuclear is not being seen as a major contributor to low-carbon energy globally. ??However, as a fuel source, various forms (e.g. fast-breed reactors and other advanced nuclear power) could play a very important role in decarbonizing countries who are able to safely handle and regulate the industry (and its fuel extraction).		*See: Markandya et al (2009) under the ???Full Trade??? scenario, here:??http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61715-3/abstract				Nick Watts and Ian Hamilton","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lancet_Commission","name":"t1_csr6tyj","parent_id":"t1_csqyv8g","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1435949697,"created_utc":1435946097}
