{"body":"#Tl;dr: Not surgeons, cardiologists.		We don't know who was not at the hospital during the meetings. But these are generally referring to meetings of cardiologists. **These doctors are NOT heart surgeons**, those are cardiothoracic surgeons. These are tightly linked but totally different jobs.		Surgeons crack open your chest, do bypass, replace valves, prescribe meds for a really rough recovery period. Cardiologists check your EKGs and echocardiograms and give you meds and everything, but aren't surgeons; many of them do catheterization (snake a catheter up into your chest to see your coronary arteries, place stents, place filters, or decide you need to see a surgeon and where the surgery needs to be done). These are called interventional cardiologists. They're who you go to when you have a heart attack before anything else. Surgeons wouldn't know where to bypass without the cath being done anyway.		[This is a good, quick explanation.](http://youtu.be/tVvONUMeYIc)		Maybe lower-acuity patients aren't getting the caths that would lead to high-risk surgeries that week. Maybe only the best cardiologists stay at work. Maybe something else weird is going on.		But specifically, surgeons aren't primarily relevant here and the article and post title are misleading.","depth":0,"score":1241,"ups":1241,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"connormxy","name":"t1_cnztrpx","parent_id":"t3_2tkcgc","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1422148121,"created_utc":1422148121}
{"body":"The real revelation here is that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with better short term survival but higher rates of re-procedure with all the attendant risks of procedures. Thus, when cardiologists are away, less PCI, fewer overall procedures, fewer complications. Deaths from emergent coronary conditions are likely to rise, of course, but the short period of time during which the PCI guys are away at conference is unlikely to affect the numbers long term.","depth":1,"score":89,"ups":89,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"illaqueable","name":"t1_cnzupuh","parent_id":"t1_cnztrpx","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1422150190,"created_utc":1422150190}

{"body":"It's not just that OP posted click-bate, it's that the article itself looks like junk science, at least as presented in the synopsis. The conclusion is that heart surgery increases the risk of death from a heart attack: "[the findings] should be seen more as a warning signal that very ill people sometimes receive too many interventions." (the article itself is behind a paywall). Was there a difference in the treatment the patients received while the "top" "cardiologists" "were away"? Were the people admitted to the hospital "with a heart attack, heart failure or cardiac arrest" just not seen by a cardiologist (or CT surgeon) at all? Or were they just treated by a CT surgeon too junior to go to the conference - like two residents, a first year medical student, and George Clooney? Even assuming that the data is presented accurately (which I doubt), without an understanding of a difference in treatment during the different periods, the simplest conclusion is NOT that there is a problem with the treatment, but that the surgeons who go to the conference aren't as good as the ones who just stay home and work. 		My guess is that the underlying study is paid for by insurance companies trying to create bad science to get out of paying for life saving, but costly, treatments. If they can create an echo chamber of studies casting doubt on the efficacy of treatments, then when a doctor tries to get paid from the insurance company for that treatment, the insurance company can deny coverage (that is, refuse to pay for it) and point to the studies and say that the treatments are ineffective. Just like all the nonsense and misdirection about mammograms not reducing the chances of dying from breast cancer.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"talentless_hack1","name":"t1_cnzy49y","parent_id":"t1_cnzv0l9","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1422157621,"created_utc":1422157621}

That being said, your point still stands.

During these conferences, the amount of PCIs performed is less (as noted in the article), likely because there are less cardiologists to perform them  and because those who are remaining will more likely opt for conservative management. 		The article is flawed in only examining 30 day mortality and not examining morbidity. PCI obviously carries a greater immediate risk than conservative management, but actually has the ability to revascularize the heart muscle and prevent permanent damage. So even though these patients didn't die, they may have been hospitalized for an extended period of time, be left in chronic heart failure requiring life-long management or may have died 2, 3 months down the road.

This is possible, but the fact is that the kind of clots that cause acute coronary events do not typically resolve by themselves (the only case would be if the ACS was mistaken for stable angina) as you seem to believe. Furthermore, PCI has its greatest advantages if done within 6 hours after the coronary event. Any longer and the heart muscle begins to undergo necrosis, which is irreversible (There's a saying in cardiology: "Time is muscle"). It's much more likely that by the time the top *cardiologists* (we're not talking about surgery in this study) who would have immediately done PCI return, the benefits of performing revascularization are no longer there because that region of the heart is dead, and the patient must now be put on permanent medical management and be left with lifelong morbidities.

Adjusted mortality for high-risk AMI in teaching hospitals was similar between meeting and nonmeeting dates (39.2% [95% CI, 31.8%-46.6%] vs 38.5% [95% CI, 35.0%-42.0%]; P???=???.86), although adjusted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rates were lower during meetings (20.8% vs 28.2%; P???=???.02). No mortality or utilization differences existed for low-risk patients in teaching hospitals or high- or low-risk patients in nonteaching hospitals. In sensitivity analyses, cardiac mortality was not affected by hospitalization during oncology, gastroenterology, and orthopedics meetings, nor was gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hip fracture mortality affected by hospitalization during cardiology meetings.		They used other meetings to control for systemic error in their analysis, and overall the p values are quite good.

{"body":"So, there will be a few reasons for this (and I've only read the summary not the whole piece)		1) Fewer elective cases - they'll bring fewer high risk people with the described conditions in for surgery. All surgery carries a risk of death. Fewer high risk surgeries = fewer deaths. 		2) There maybe fewer patients surviving the initial presentation when the cardiologists are away - come in with crashing CCF - may die in the ED as no cardiology consultant available to help acutely. This will lower the number of high risk cases getting to acute surgery. 		3) Juniors left behind are less likely to operate on the trickiest cases saving them for when the boss gets back - fewer high risk surgeries = lower mortality statistics. 		4) REALLY sick cases may be transferred prior to being operated on - hospitals knowing that the conferences are on my divert those in need of acute stents/LVADS etc to another hospital due to staffing levels thereby lowering the mortality statistics. 		These are the main confounders that I can think of off the top of my head. There are bound to be more. I'd be interested in knowing how they adjusted for them (if they did at all). If it's just a direct comparison of %death rates it's a pretty meaningless study to be honest. You'd need to adjust for at least case mix and seniority of operating surgeon and probably  take into account seasonal variations. 		What would be more interesting than death is quality of life. Do patients admitted during conference season have a better quality of life on discharge than those patients operated on when a conference isn't going ahead. Survival is fine, but I expect most people wouldn't be happy surviving only to have a fluid intake restricted at 400ml per day, get out of breath walking to the kitchen and not being able to lie flat for fear of drowning.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FentPropTrac","name":"t1_cnztb8h","parent_id":"t3_2tkcgc","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1422147161,"created_utc":1422147161}

Maybe part of the problem is that the AMA needs to stop pretending all doctors are created equal and that we need to make doctor review/evaluations in this country more transparent. If all this information is public, doctors might be more willing to look at and improve themselves when their numbers aren't looking so good.

{"body":"Right. I had to explain those kinds of numbers several times when I was doing a transit study. Part of it involved comparing transit agencies, which is difficult to do because no two are alike. We used a number of triple metrics, such as dollars per passenger-mile, and that confused some people; but really, there's no better way to do it, and once people get it, there's an a-ha moment where they lock in and it all clicks for them. Up to that point, though, it confuses and frustrates more than a few of them.		When I was a kid, there was a PSA that ran on TV saying that most car accidents happen within a quarter mile of home. I tried to make rational sense of that. What's special about that quarter mile, compared to all other places and distances? Are people less careful when they're near home? Do people tend to live in areas with higher accident risk factors? Does it have something to do with the density of residential neighbourhoods? It wasn't until I started driving myself that it hit me: Most car trips are short local errands. It's kind of like saying that most people who die in car accidents were wearing shoes at the time. (The point of the PSA, though, was to remind people to wear their belt *all the time,* and not treat the short local trips they take most often as less risky.)		The same confusion commonly comes up in threads about driving safety, because people raise points such as the fact that there are more cars and drivers now than at earlier points in time, and then someone always has to explain that accident rates are based on driver miles or accidents per capita, not on absolute numbers, so that they can be compared over time to periods with different absolute numbers of cars and drivers.","depth":2,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sylban","name":"t1_cnzywhj","parent_id":"t1_cnzwkof","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1422159446,"created_utc":1422159446}
