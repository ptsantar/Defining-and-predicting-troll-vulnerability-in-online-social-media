The report cites rigorous evidence that excess dietary sodium causes hypertension and provokes cardiovascular disease. Sodium loading suppresses the reninangiotensin-	aldosterone system by inhibiting renin release and ???increases oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and promotes . . . fibrosis in the	heart, kidneys, and arteries . . . resulting in cardiac and vascular remodeling.??? Sodium reduction has a direct and progressive influence on blood pressure, especially below intakes of 2,300 mg/day, and dampens the age-related rise in blood pressure that leads to hypertension in 90% of U.S. adults.

If there's is a problem with the manner in which this study "bucks the conventional wisdom", you first need to confirm that that problem wasn't also present in establishing the conventional wisdom.		So where is the scientific study that finds a **causal** relationship (not correlation) between increased salt intake and CVD and HF that is not based on self-reporting but instead is based on objectively verifiable evidence of salt intake?  Is there such a study?","depth":2,"score":25,"ups":25,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zbufferz","name":"t1_cnuw9wo","parent_id":"t1_cnutmtb","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1421761747,"created_utc":1421761747}

{"body":"I agree.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2013.  On top of all the superscary stuff that entails, in the thick of my gloom on first learning about the subject, I thought I had my last taste of bacon.  Of course, I now know I can have a "taste" of just about anything safely, but my cardiologist has me on a 2,000mg sodium limit, so one Baconater would have me on fruit, yogurt, and ice cream for the entire rest of the day.  When I saw this headline, I had a glimmer of hope that we might revisit this restriction that has me almost always keeping to a diet some might consider downright unAmerican.		Because my condition was dire, requiring a thoracotomy just to give me any shot a a future, I did not knowingly (labels and restaurant info are guides and estimates, with individual meals rarely being subject to precise scientific quantification) break the restriction once for the first year of my recovery.  In consulting with a dietician, I learned that 80% compliance is clinically considered strong.  Nowdays I allow myself 2-4 "cheat days" in a month, though even then I only go a gram or two past my limit and I never string together two in a row.  		I'm pretty sure this is important, since I'm seeing a couple of the most esteemed specialists in this part of the state, and they have both indicated I would need to show major improvement in cardiac health and a consistently normal blood pressure (among other things, I'm in treatment for a condition thought to be causing my drug resistant hypertension) before it would make any sense to lift the restriction.  I'm right at the front of the line in terms of wanting good science to justify going off this restriction, but I've read so much on the other side of the issue, every M.D. I've discussed this with agrees that a sodium-restricted diet is crucial for avoiding future cardiac crises, and I no longer have the bouts of edema I was prone to before adopting this diet and taking diuretics regularly.  I would -so- dig being able to dig in with pizza, subs, Mexican dishes, and pasta alfredo the way I used to; but intellectually I see this data as a blip that defies a hugely pervasive trend rather than a winning argument for the claim in the headline.		*edited to correct the date.

I'm still early in this treatment, but I was told my androgen levels were so high they could actually be bad for muscular development, and they may also account for a paunch I've been walking around with all century.

Obesity is also the most likely reason you developed heart disease at such a young age.  		How do you feel about studies showing a strong correlation between obesity and heart disease and high blood pressure? I think it's interesting that you are so careful to limit salt and you have studied the science behind it, but your comments don't mention your weight as a factor even though weight loss has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure, more so than reduced sodium diets.		Obesity also affects hormone regulation, so it would be worth losing weight to see if it helps with that. 		Have your doctors recommended weight loss at all? If you've been obese for many years, I wouldn't be surprised if they think it's a waste of time to put you on a diet. Patient compliance is so low when it comes to losing weight that many doctors don't try very hard to encourage it.		Would you be willing to lose 60 lbs if you knew that it would reduce your blood pressure, slow the progression of your heart disease, and let you live a few more years? If you are willing and able to track your sodium consumption so accurately, you could be just as successful at tracking your caloric intake. Exercise isn't even required to lose weight, it's just counting numbers and you already know you're good at that. 		If I were in your position, I would probably try one of those wacky plant-based diets that have been shown to reverse signs of heart disease, like the one created by Dean Ornish. It wouldn't hurt, and it would just be like doing an experiment on yourself, which is strangely appealing to me. I would be willing to try anything and everything that could help, as long as it wasn't harmful.

{"body":"While I agree eyewitness testimony is unreliable, doing this with food frequency questionnaire is not, for two reasons. Firstly, people's diets rarely change, and so the food and amount they eat tend to remain consistent over longer periods of time. This means you'll be getting the same response whether you ask them weekly how much salt they consumed, or yearly (see [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8463852) for instance). Moreover, if you ask them to keep daily journals this will be cumbersome enough to severely affect the number of participants you could get for the study.		Secondly, the FFQ used in this study is not some random 3 line questionnaire that the authors devised themselves, and as such may have been untested. It is a 108-item test "*based on reported intakes of non-Hispanic white and black residents of the Northeast and South 65 years or older in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey*" administered by a trained interviewer. This family of FFQs has previously been validated many many times, and even specifically with regards to reported sodium and caloric intake.		Therefore while I understand your comparison to eyewitness testimony, it is not the same because eyewitness testimony has shown to be consistently unreliable, whereas this has shown to be much the opposite.

Of course, measurement of a biomarker of salt intake would be more accurate, but this would be incredibly expensive to implement and would likely make the study unfeasible.		2) The key to this study appears to be the age range: only individuals ages 71-80 were included.  This is important to note because a) Individuals who survive to be 71+ years old are likely to be somewhat healthier than average (individuals with a very high risk for CVD may not have survived to be 71+ and would thus be excluded from this study, individuals who do survive may have better salt tolerances/other advantageous traits), b) This age group faces several competing causes of death, and death due to competing causes may have obscured findings related to CVD. c) Salt intake when you are 71-80 years may not be as etiologically revelant as salt intake when you are younger.

{"body":"Hold the Hold on Salt - 2011		For most of my adult life I???ve been harassed for my ???salt-intake???. Having never taken a liking to sweets, my eating enjoyment has always been the salty-snack. Potato chips, crackers, French fries; all the things that we???ve been led to believe will result in triple bypass heart surgery later in life. I find myself relishing solo trips into town because I know I???ll have a warranted opportunity to get some fast-food and eat it in my car, free of judgment. I experience guilt; however it is nothing more than an additional surcharge which I happily pay along with the tab for my indulgence. 		Recently I was logging out of my email and noticed a Huffington Post headline that read ???Salt? Not So Bad for You After All???, to which I immediately thought ???too good to be true???. The article goes on to claim that lower-sodium diets actually increase one???s risk for heart-failure as opposed to normal or even high-salt eaters. Their claim is based on a 1996 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) study that measured the salt-intake and heart-disease trends of 3700 people over 8-years. As I read this I could feel my hopes rising and I knew that at any moment the rug would be pulled out from under me. Of course I could have accepted this news as fact (and do so quite happily I might add), but I opted for further investigation. 		The original Journal of the American Medical Association study referenced by the Huffington Post was actually somewhat hard to track down, as all I kept getting in search engines were articles citing it. When I found it I was relieved to discover that while there are a couple asterisks(*) that need to be addressed, the study itself and the conclusions drawn from it are indeed accurate. JAMA is a highly reputable entity and its studies are conducted with the utmost adherence to traditional scientific expectations. The study concluded that while hypertensive individuals may perhaps be candidates for sodium reduction, the pervasive believe in society the lower sodium diets are less likely to result in heart conditions is incorrect. One important detail was that this study was conducted on white individuals in between the ages of 40 and 60 who were otherwise healthy. 		For my own purposes these finding don???t change my diet at all. They do however allow me to abandon the guilt and worry associated with how I eat. My personal habit is to freely enjoy the foods I truly love while skipping on the ones that are just ok, like ice-cream and cake or condiments like mayo and mustard. I discovered this revelation about a month ago, and when I read the parameters for this assignment I immediately thought of these articles because this was something I experience in my life; reading an article and investigating a health-claim to validate it. While I think these findings could easily be misinterpreted or misconstrued, clearly the standard ideology of ???low-sodium is healthy??? needs to be reevaluated.

The trick is these articles can pick and choose what out of the study they want to cite and can spin the tone of the message entirely.

Always track down the source. 		I think it's high time the global population embraces the scientific method of study in order to cut down on all this back and forth bull shit. Don't believe everything you hear...		Is salt bad for you? No, its great. It adds ions to your blood that does wonders for cell health. The particulates of Cl- K+ Na+ etc intracelluarly and extracellulary is what keeps you running at the cellular level. However the more ions in solution the higher the pressure. Blood pressure goes up with excessive ions in your diet (ie sodium NA+). When your body cannot regulate this through excretion, or it happens too slow (you just ate a ridiculous 2000mg sodium meal) your blood pressure will raise.		Chronic high blood pressure will result from years of horrible diet (including high sodium diets). Chronic high blood pressure increases the shearing force on blood vessel walls, inducing more plaque repair mechanisms, leading to hardening of the arteries and heart disease.		In conclusion,  high sodium diets are in fact bad for you in comparison to a balanced diet. No article worth it's salt, excuse the pun, would say otherwise.
