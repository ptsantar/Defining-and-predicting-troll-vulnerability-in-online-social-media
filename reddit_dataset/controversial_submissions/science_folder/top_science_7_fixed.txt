But I wasn't doubting the Big Five per se in my previous comment, just the utility of these "short measures" of the Big Five, given the types of claims apparently being tested. I can accept, at least for the sake of argument, that a correlative study of this sort could produce valid results, but I think the methodology used here necessitates a much more qualified reading of the results than this article seems to be offering. And of course, I'm sure even the study's authors would agree that the jump to causal reasoning in the Reddit headline / first line of the article is unsupported by the evidence.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"solistus","name":"t1_cs7miw9","parent_id":"t1_cs7cgq6","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1434406543,"created_utc":1434402943}

I suppose you could divorce the stated causal explanation from the personality traits aspect, and develop a study to test the claim that having a busier social life results in less green lifestyle activities, but that would still be rather difficult to prove and you'd probably introduce some degree of bias based on exactly how you go about making subjects' social calendars more or less crowded.","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"solistus","name":"t1_cs6mqws","parent_id":"t1_cs6lo7c","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1434329375,"created_utc":1434325775}

{"body":"This study would is great to parse in an undergraduate research methods class. I used to love to do this, so for old times sake...   		An excerpt from the [abstract of the article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328715000683), which is behind a paywall... 		>The UK government has set an ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% before 2050. An interesting segment that could help to achieve this is older consumers, due to their growing numbers. 		I'm not sure how the growing proportion of older adults in the UK is connected with efforts to reduce greenhouse emission, but this only a summary of the introduction section (which nobody cares about). Moving along with the abstract.		> There seems to be a lack of attention, in the research looking specifically at different age categories of older consumers??? green behaviour, and whether their level of greenness can be explained by their personality. 		Sometimes a gap in the literature make a compelling argument for a study. In this case, why would something immutable as a personality trained be examined for behavior change interventions? And what is "greenness" anyway?		>Using Socioemotional Selectivity Theory and Time Perspective, the research presented here was designed to provide an exploratory analysis of how the green behaviour of older consumers is explained by their personality types. 		Ok, I had to Google the theory. I think it's odd that they don't state hypotheses/research questions. But, it's exploratory, so that gives them license to make post hoc conclusions? 		>Based on the responses of 204 older consumers in the UK, our results find the openness personality trait to be positively linked to green behaviour, whilst the extraversion personality trait is negatively related to green behaviour.		How was green behavior defined? Openness and extraversion are meaningless, too. 		> Although the level of green behaviour increased with older consumers??? age, this did not reach significance.	>  		This non-significant finding has no place in here. However, it's interesting that it unravels the study results. Maybe there's another explanation for the association with aging and green behavior. (I could come up with many hypotheses here like fixed incomes, lack of mobility, peer pressure, more convenient recylcing systems, etc). 		Thank you for putting up with me being didactic. But, I miss the critiques I did with students. They would have had fun with this one.
