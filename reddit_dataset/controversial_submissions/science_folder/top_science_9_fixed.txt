But where are the studies that compare heavy cannabis smokers to heavy cigarrette smokers and non-smokers? Burnt plant matter is still a strong irritant to the lungs and is not healthy.

Most of the time you use blow torches to heat a glass device and you drop some oil on it so it instantly vaporized and then inhale from there.  That seems like a pretty far off process from rolling a joint, in my opinion.  		However, dabs may actually be healthier than smoking the bud of a plant... but that also begs the question of how did they make the dabs? I question the butane method because after they extract the THC with butane they have to get the butane out of the oil.  What is the content of butane that you are vaporizing into your lungs?  It has also led to multiple explosions and people getting severely burned from trying to make butane hash oil in their homes.

He started off the lecture by saying that he's not going to come in and tell us not to do drugs because that would be unrealistic, but he wanted us to know the dangers of the harder drugs, and that there were issues with contaminants in some of the drugs going around our city. He actually told us that he considered occasional marijuana use to be fine, and mentioned how he respected a friend who would smoke weed occasionally, rather then drink.		Hearing this when I was 15 actually made me respect the guy, and trust what he had to say.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"skeletor_999","name":"t1_cov5a3z","parent_id":"t1_couthqe","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424745498,"created_utc":1424745498}

As an 18 year old who has no trouble acquiring alcohol or marijuana, I can tell you that none of those laws have worked.		If there must be an age limit, 18 would be okay. That's the age when I believe people should be able to make those decisions for themselves. If someone's old enough to go to other countries and fight wars, or vote for our president, or things like that, they should be able to sit down and drink a beer or smoke a joint. I would even be okay with 16. People younger than that really should not be smoking or drinking, but again, the law doesn't really do much to solve the problem, and in fact makes it worse in ways.		Of course, that's mostly just what would be ideal. It seems likely to me that the age limit will be 21, as that's what all the other states are doing.

{"body":"I'll try to help. 		As you age, everything is constantly "developing"; your body, your brain, your knowledge. But, during the time between 13-20 (for the sake of this discussion let's pick somewhat random numbers) these developments are much more profound than other times. So when people talk about teenagers developing, they really mean that profound change. Therefore, what happens during this time can have much longer and meaningful impacts than something after that period. 		For mental development we know that mental state of mind has a significant impact on application. If you are in a stressed out or drug-influenced state of mind, your application of various abilities will be altered from being in a relaxed or sober state. Some of those alterations are small others are big, some are obvious to yourself and/or others and some are not. We also know that general knowledge can be influenced in the same manner. Because of this, development of various abilities like coping happen under two different states of mind, one sober the other under the influence, and those developments don't necessarily overlap and any/all developments that are made under a certain state are repressed until that state is reached again.		This is one of the reasons that people admit to being social before/after drug use, but not necessarily the other way around. They have developed the skill of socializing and a comfort with it under one state, but have little experience with that situation under the other state.		An anecdotal example: one of my cognitive behavior professors had a friend in school who smoked a lot of pot (either in med school or college, can't remember not important). He would smoke and study, smoke and go to class, you get the picture. But, on test day he would show up sober as a bird and he was failing every test. Finally, for the final he decided he didn't care and showed up baked and aced the test. The correlation between mental states can be expounded to many other influences. If you study stressed, you will likely do better if you feel stressed during the test. This is why you have friends that are "good" drunk drivers, they have practiced under a mental state and can apply it under that state again (I used quotes because no one is actually good at driving drunk, but some people are better at managing what they have control over than others).","depth":3,"score":27,"ups":27,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"texansfan","name":"t1_couqsij","parent_id":"t1_coup581","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424720923,"created_utc":1424720923}

Everyone is worse than they would be sober, but a diminishing of skill doesn't necessarily make you bad.		Edit: Also, as an anecdotal experience, I can't agree that what you say about mental states related to studying actually have that much of an influence. Marijuana makes a mathematician, imo, but that doesn't mean you suddenly are unable to understand the ideas you've come up with when you're sober. I'd wager that it's moreso an effect of anxiety as to why something would happen, and the not giving a shit part would relax the person enough to do good on a test.

{"body":"So the issue with studies like this is that it's extremely difficult to prove the marijuana caused the changes in brain development, rather than being correlated with those changes. Here's what I mean ...		Someone who smokes marijuana as a teenager is also probably someone who drinks alcohol or smokes cigarettes, which could have significant effects in brain development. They also might have a more stressful home life, struggle more in school, have fewer supportive friends, etc, stuff which drove them to the marijuana in the first place. Many people self-medicate with marijuana, using it to treat some aspect of their life, like an anxiety disorder, depression, or PTSD, which could easily be responsible for the differences in brain development.		To actually prove that it was the marijuana causing the changes, you would need sets of twins. You'd have to control every detail of their lives, making sure they received equal amounts of love, enjoyment, and mental stimulation, that their diet and exercise levels were identical, that everything about them and their lives was the same, except you'd have one of the twins smoke pot and the other you'd disallow pot.		Unfortunately, that's an unethical study to perform. So researchers try to account for all of the variables in someone's life that may differentiate them from others in the same study, and use the resulting weightings to attempt to determine statistically whether one particular activity the person engaged in is directly responsible for one particular physical change.		That's an almost impossible task as human lives are extremely complicated and brain development and function is not as well understood as some of the body's other systems. 		So we end up with one study saying there's a link while the next study says there's no link.		In all likelihood, everything you do as a child effects brain development in one way or another, whether that's sitting in a classroom diligently learning or making a meal of processed crap and chemicals like snack food and soda. Try to make sure the benefits outweigh the cost to you personally (maybe McDonalds is all you can afford but it's better than going hungry) and don't presume to make that calculation for others.","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"blastnabbit","name":"t1_couu7xv","parent_id":"t1_coupydo","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1424726260,"created_utc":1424726260}

It is called a "Literature Review on Marijuana Use and Health Effects", they make it clear no studies were done.  They are basing their statements on the existing studies that flat out don't in any way show a link between marijuana use as a teen and mental impairment as an adult.		Don't believe me?  Right from the report:  	>An important note for all key findings is that the available research evaluated the association	between marijuana use and potential adverse health outcomes. This association does not	prove that the marijuana use alone caused the effect. **Despite the best efforts of researchers	to account for confounding factors, there may be other important factors related to causality	that were not identified.** In addition, marijuana use was illegal everywhere in the United	States prior to 1996. Research funding, when appropriated, was commonly sought to identify	adverse effects from marijuana use. This legal fact introduces both funding bias and	publication bias into the body of literature related to marijuana use.		They basically say all available data suggests there could be a link, but then admit that the available data is really bad and doesn't really prove anything.		You need a proper controlled study before you can claim there is a link between marijuana and cognitive impairment.  Again, certain people with certain conditions could have a propensity to use marijuana or other drugs.  People who essentially are self medicating with marijuana or anything else will have a high usage of the drug.  Those people will throw off general studies that don't control for them.

Meth will eat you from the inside out, but the odds of ODing on Meth are pretty low. Its the insomnia, lack of nutrition, and impurities being expelled through your skin causing infections that are dangerous with meth, not the fear of an OD. 		While you never hear of actual cases of OD from cigarettes, take 3 boxes of "first step" nicotine patches and apply them all to your skin and you will die.		For MJ, it is reported that there is no such thing as an OD, which leaves me thinking your only risks are getting so effing stoned that you throw up and dont have the awareness to move before you drown, or launching yourself into a panic attack that lasts too long and your heart gives out.		With meth, generally, the more you take, the more aware you get, and the better you feel, so while your heart rate is skyrocketing, it doesnt go to give out levels until you've been doing it for 20 years.		edit: ~~and just my two cents, a study that illustrates the risk of an OD off of tobacco that nearly triples the risk of a heroin OD is obviously skewed as fuck. I wouldn't read too much into this study. It's obviously a fluff piece engineered with the intend of making formerly bad drugs sound good while making currently attacked drugs worse. Seems like they used nicotine patches and tried to call that "tobacco use", or something of the like so that they could skew the data and pitch a false truth.~~		So, I had a bout of graph reading dislexia. They arent saying that tobacco has 3 times the OD risk of Heroin, they are saying the reverse of that. having that realization, ya, if they are functionally saying that Cocaine is where the line is for real potential overdose, then I think id be lead to believe this study is pretty accurate.		While it seems a bit counter intuitive, you do have a higher risk of dying in 6 hours because you ingested too much nicotine than because you ingested too much Ecstasy or Meth.		If you smoke 10 cartons of smokes in the next 8 hours (you have some freakishly powerful lungs) and you will die of nicotine poisoning.

{"body":"No idea honestly.  There are a lot of studies and data out there on smoking tobacco vs smokeless tobacco vs just nicotine but I don't claim to be an expert.  Basically in a nutshell smoking *anything* is generally the worst delivery method in terms of associated risks.  You're not just ingesting an addictive but relatively mild stimulant (nicotine) but hundreds of other chemicals released by the combustion of tobacco, additives, carbon monoxide, and loads of tars and particulates.  Smokeless is a lot less hazardous although from what I recall, dip is worse than something like snus due to how it's processed and what compounds are present.  Then on the least hazardous end would be dermal patches, gum, and vaporizers.  Typically those things deliver mainly nicotine and possibly a few other compounds that could be hazardous but you're talking about a handful rather than hundreds and in concentrations that are a small fraction of what you'd get by smoking and much closer to regular environmental levels.		There's some info at this site but you should still look into the sources and data since the site is biased toward its focus on harm reduction in delivery rather than any greater statement on nicotine use in general:  http://casaa.org/Smokefree_Tobacco.html		Basically it's unfortunate because nicotine is what people want.  On its own it's probably more similar to caffeine than anything.  But until recently there hasn't been much in the way of better delivery methods.  One of the reasons people like smoking tobacco is that delivery is fairly quick and you tailor your "dosage" on a granular level.  Instead of a patch that delivers a certain amount over a long period you get your dose and you stop when you are satisfied.  A patch is more like deciding you're tired in the morning so you make a whole pot of coffee and take a sip every 5-10 minutes throughout the day until it's gone.  A cig is like pouring yourself just the single cup you want and you can always make another if you feel like it.		Vaporized nicotine is interesting because you get a delivery method that has most of the strengths of smoking but without the combustion.

{"body":"First study is regarding adolescent brains, something that is constantly changing regardless. We already know that cannabis has detrimental effects on the developing brain and since a "developing brain" is changing (or as you [I guess he, just saw you're not the person I originally responded to] say, "reshaping") by definition, there isn't really anything about this study that supports your original comment.		Unless you were referring specifically to the developing or adolescent brain. In which case, you should have specified.		Second study, this one starts off by even stating, "previous imaging studies have not detected altered brain structure in marijuana users compared to non-users." Did you see the 'P' values of those statistical comparisons? Are those results *really* statistically significant? Those are very *very* small differences. Their conclusion that their "preliminary results suggest evidence of possible structural differences [...]" is their way of indicating that those differences are not very significant. Keywords of that conclusion are "suggest" and "possible." Based on what I understand of statistics, a P value of <0.002 is not a statistically significant difference. Unless I'm confusing two different types of P values.		Third study says absolutely **nothing** about cannabis "reshaping" the brain, but rather differences in brain activity in heavy smokers who abstain for 25 days. Additionally, since I only have access to the abstract and cannot see their methodology, I can't say for sure if it was sound. A quick google search brings up studies indicating that any cognitive deficiency from heavy marijuana use can last up to 28 days after last use. Which is interesting considering the study you linked only looks at 25 days. Wait a few more days and their results may have been very different.		Last study also has no mention of "reshaping" the brain or anything of that nature. It is talking about a possible change in receptor binding and downregulation. Additionally, this isn't necessarily a good or bad thing. For example, SSRI antidepressants work by altering downregulation of serotonin receptors. So downregulation of cannabinoid receptors may have positive effects on behavior.		So yeah, apart from what we already knew about adolescents consuming cannabis while their brain is still developing, I don't see any significant evidence of marijuana "reshaping" the brain.

This is how I see it: all of these studies are *looking* very hard for something bad caused by cannabis, and even then, the studies are by no means conclusive (particularly in adult brains). 		I would be curious to see the results of similar studies done with other things such as the myriad of over the counter drugs and legal substances like caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, prescription drugs, etc. Not even to mention the drugs that we more than willingly shovel down children's throats such as Adderall or various SSRIs.

And even then, those changes may not even be bad (or good). But what about the changes that occur due to any number of these legal substances? How do they compare? Especially in an adolescent brain. And presuming that these other substances also cause similar changes in the brain, where is the rationale for keeping cannabis illegal?		When it is this difficult to find detrimental effects (assuming that they are detrimental, persist after a long period of abstinence or are even statistically significant) of a drug that is considered by the Food and Drug Administration to be on the most dangerous possible tier without any accepted medical use, it says something.

I know that comparing it to the safety of other drugs is not an argument for or against the safety of cannabis, but it **is** a legit argument for legalization.

If it's TL:DR - You're 1.25x more likely to be in an accident then a sober driver, meaning if you were responsible for a crash .5 out of 1 times before, you're now responsible for .75 out of 1.25 crashes, so you cause 50% more crashes.

Except I have generally experienced the exact opposite.  High drivers generally drive vary in speed greatly often speeding up and slowing down while missing turns and stopping extremely slowly.  Often swerving wherever they look.  BTW when baked I always thought I was awesome at driving.  More zone in and everything.  Until the next morning and I saw the crooked as car parked between spots and comments from passengers.  I saw first hand the same thing from high friends driving.  While high they thought they were driving perfectly.   They were not at all.  The worst was going down the wrong way of a road because he missed a turn oh and he completely spaced using any headlights.  That was the last time I ever rode with high driver  or drove high.		While tipsy and buzzed drivers drive perfectly fine most of the time from experience.  Even drunk drivers 0.2+(usually a good metric of most people) often drive perfectly fine.

{"body":"Suppressed immune system can help people with autoimmunity diseases or inflammatory immune conditions, but be a problem for those dealing with chronically reactivating viral infections and those with overburdened immune systems that are trying to tackle several infections (or one very strong infection) at once. Basically it's exactly what you think. If you need your immune system, which you usually do, suppressing it isn't always a smart thing.  Google marijuana suppresses immune system for more info. 		Suppressing the thyroid is probably one of the most common complaints. Just Google marijuana and hypothyroid forums.  You'll see tons of people whove smoked for many years saying they now are hypothyroid. This makes them feel tired, weak, cold, and often sluggish and overweight.  You need to go on medications for life, to fix this. 		Reducing LH (Leutenizing Hormone) is the reason marijuana is associated with lower testosterone levels (if you've ever heard that).  LH stimulates the testicles to produce testosterone. Suppressing it results in hypogonadism, which is something a ton of guys over age 30 deal with already. Without smoking MJ. It's not a fun position to be in when you have zero sex drive and need to start taking drugs like Clomid to kickstart LH and FSH production again.  Google marijuana suppresses LH. 		How do I know all this nonsense? I just happen to have an overtaxed immune system due to multiple viral infections I have acquired over the years. Due to having gotten mono, CMV, chickenpox, severe allergies, the flu, adrenal fatigue and other various things that put stress on the immune system over time. 		Likewise, I took Propecia for four years and it completely knocked out my endocrine system. So I've been dealing with low LH and FSH, low testosterone, and all the effects you would expect from a disturbed hormone system already. 		As a result, when I smoke marijuana, as great as I feel while on it, for the three or four days afterwords, I feel quite miserable.  Cold, chills, fatigue etc.  So I sat down to try and figure out why. And these three things seem to be the most prominently-known negative effects.

This doesn't show anything about long term damage or mortality rates from mixing marijuana and driving a car. I'm sure the numbers are so disproportionate because if someone drinks for 20 years and their liver fails, we attribute it to alcohol. If they smoke for 20 years and get lung cancer, we attribute it with cigarettes. If they smoke weed for 20 years and get cancer, we blame a third cause (natural, alcohol, cigs).

However, another popular way to smoke it is to buy one of those cheap gas station cigars (usually swisher sweets brand), slice them down the middle, dump out the tobacco and re-roll it with pot instead, making a "blunt".
