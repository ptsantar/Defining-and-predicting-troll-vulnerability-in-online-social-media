{"body":"VERY WRONG THERE!! ADD often comes with the inability to focus on one thing for too long. If you give a child with ADD enough work that will intrigue them for a long period of time, they end up learning more in less time. The reason why it has been a disadvantage (and I experienced this first hand in public school), is because many teachers can't tailor the pace of their lessons to one or a handful of students. Thus, the child gets bored far too easily and losses interest. I only started doing phenomenal in high school in my junior year, when I started taking more advanced subjects and more thinking intensive class (and I ended up being able to handle the extreme workload). It was the same in college. I studied mechanical engineering, and although my grades in the liberal arts classes were like a B+ average, my grades in engineering courses were A's (granted there were one or two classes that I got C's and B in because of the quality of the professor). In fact, in my senior year of college, I was taking 21 credits, 3 design courses, and there was a lot of work. I did extremely well and had a lot of fun being challenged because I didn't think of the ADD as a disadvantage. I used it to maximize my time management and learn faster than most of the people in my classes. It's only a disadvantage if you look at it that way.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aelric22","name":"t1_cpexybe","parent_id":"t1_cpexlgo","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426368596,"created_utc":1426364996}

{"body":"As with the thiomersal controversy and the Danish birth cohorts, here it may again be useful to compare prevalence rates in European countries that apply water fluoridation (for instance Ireland) or used to do so (the Netherlands). 		Water fluoridation was widely applied in the Netherlands between circa 1960 and 1976 - when the practice was abandoned following the 'mass medication is non-ethical' logic. If the association between fluoridation and ADHD prevalence is indeed causal in nature, one would expect higher ADHD prevalence in the Netherlands compared to neighboring countries that never engaged in the practice of water fluoridation (Belgium, Germany). Moreover, a decline in ADHD prevalence would be expected in later age groups not exposed to fluoridated water.  		Luckily, there is some great data available on ADHD prevalence in the Netherlands from the Nemesis-2 study. Data was collected among 3309 respondents and included an instrument to retrospectively assess ADHD symptoms in childhood (before age 16, i.e. although prospective assessment would theoretically always be better, this does overcome somewhat the typical problem of ADHD diagnosis rates increasing in the past decades). 		Self-reported childhood ADHD prevalence data is available per age group, with the sample being broken down into three categories: 18-24 (n = 715), 25-34 (n = 1143), and 35-44 (n = 1451). Crucially, as the data was collected between 2007 and 2009, respondents in this third age category were born between 1963 and 1974. Given that the practice of water fluoridation in the Netherlands was stopped in 1976, respondents in this category were exposed to fluoridated water for the first 2 to 13 years of their lives.  		The retrospectively assessed prevalence of childhood ADHD among the 35-44 years old was 1.7%, among the 25-34 yrs old it was 2,1%, and among the 18-24 yrs old it was 3.7%. These are numbers I calculated from the table, the researchers themselves give odds ratios with the oldest age group as the reference category, OR???s of 1,3 and 2.3 were reported for the middle and youngest groups respectively. The associated p value is p=.04 . 		Thus/ tl;dr : The researchers may wish to look at ADHD prevalence in other populations that are (Ireland) or were (the Netherlands) exposed to fluoridated water. A quick check on a (somewhat small) Dutch dataset learns that retrospectively assessed prevalence of childhood ADHD among does not suggest that termination of water fluoridation in the Netherlands in 1976 is associated with a reduction in ADHD prevalence.

{"body":"> Considering that fluoride is available nearly everywhere, are you confident that the average level in someone that lives a basic westernized lifestyle isn't a massive dosage?		Yes, I am confident.		The LD50 of fluoride is 60 mg/kg but what is placed in drinking water is between 0.5 and 1mg/L. It would be an **exceedingly** rare human for whom that would be the "massive dosage" you talk about. Not to mention they'd probably run into water toxicity long before they had ingested enough fluoride.		Also, consider the fact that many naturally fluoridated waters have concentrations up to 3mg/L and your hypothetical massive dosage effect is not seen in them. Even dental flurosis only occurs at concentrations greater than 3mg/L.		If you're up on the anti-fluoridation movement, you've probably herd them mentioning Indian villages that have severe health effects from naturally fluoridation. But those villages in that Harayuna region have natural levels of 6-10mg/L, something which the anti-fluoridationists conveniently leave out of their pamphlets.		> Instead of mass medicating the population should we then consider that fluoride may have underlying effects that aren't so obviously correlated?		Except that's the problem - it's not actually that strong a correlation when you go and read the [actual study](http://www.ehjournal.net/content/pdf/s12940-015-0003-1.pdf). The problems with this are as follows:		 * initial study, no confirmation	 * based on parental reports of diagnosis, not actual diagnoses	 * they didn't actually link the children to water fluoridation levels but instead to state-wide prevalence of "optimally fluoridated" water	 * the correlation breaks down when differentiating between natural versus artificial fluoridation	 * the correlation also breaks down for the earlier years in the study		The breakdown in correlation between natural versus artificial fluoridation so significant that natural fluoridation was significantly negatively correlated with ADHD, rather than the positive correlation so they simply got rid of natural fluoridation in their final analysis.		If fluoridation actually is the problem, then it should not matter whether it was naturally or artificially present. Remember, they are correlating to what the CDC DHHS calls "optimally fluoridated" water of between 0.7 and 1.2 mg/L. Why would natural fluoridation of ~1mg/L correlate with lower ADHD prevalence, but artificial fluoridation of the same level correlate with higher ADHD prevalence?		That makes no sense, and to me it says either there's other confounding variables they did not take into account or that it is a spurious correlation, like pirates and global warming.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CoryCA","name":"t1_cpevfb4","parent_id":"t1_cperkum","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426363420,"created_utc":1426359820}

The studies were largely looking at this exposure. Two studies looked at fluoride exposure from inhaling smoke from coal burning. So the question is ??? how do these levels of exposure relate to the amount of fluoride being added to water in the US (because toxicity is always all about dose)? There was a lot of variability across the studies, but generally the high fluoride groups were in the 2-10 mg/L range, while the reference low fluoride groups were in the 0.5-1.0 mg/L range (not including the coal burning studies, which had much higher fluoride levels).**	> 	> **The recommended fluoride level for fluoridated drinking water is 0.5-1.0 mg/L (similar in most countries ??? Australia, for example, uses 0.6-1.1 mg/L). The EPA set the upper safe limit at 4.0, with a secondary (voluntary) recommendation of 2.0.

It is dated, in the sense that we've been doing it for a while, but it is not useless, nor has it been proven to do more harm than good.  In fact, the paper itself does not come to this conclusion.  	  	  	The question is whether the benefit outweighs the cost.  By claiming it has no benefit you are blowing any credibility in this debate - because it has been proven to have a benefit.   	  	You are correct in that (I assume this is what you meant) if you take care of your teeth fluoridation does not get you much (if anything).  However, at least in the United States, the group of people with the most to lose from the lack of water fluoridation are lower income families who very often do NOT have the time, money, and education to properly take care of their teeth.  The countries on that list that do not fluoridate water also have strong social safety nets, and so lower income citizens in these countries are more likely to still be able to receive dental care.  	    	As it is, since fluoridation is a very 'dated' practice, and the effect of that practice have up until now been mostly good, it is likely that the effect if any is small, and potentially spurious.    	  	As for putting vitamins, Xanax, etc, in the water - again that has to do with the cost-benefit calculus.  My feeling is that the amount of these vitamins/drugs that could be introduced into the water supply where we could guarantee the safety for the majority of the people would be too low to have an effect on those who need it.  Therefore, not worth it.  With fluoride, the dose where we are (current knowledge) pretty sure is safe is also enough to do some good.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Podspi","name":"t1_cpf1r2x","parent_id":"t1_cpexlu1","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426376417,"created_utc":1426372817}

{"body":"Years ago I spent a few days reading endlessly on fluoride and had a lot of back and forth moments since both sides can be quite persuading.  I eventually just started checking my own numbers.   One thing I noticed was no one was really adding up how much fluoride exposure we were getting from *all* typical sources (Which is difficult, I know.)  		There was a lot of "Well, this one thing [drinking water, etc...] is under this threshold"  and "This thing is under the threshold."  -- then I noticed when you added up drinking water, the fluoride from foods, and *especially* when you add in the fact that some people, especially in the south, drink a lot of black teas -- especially the cheap ones, which have a LOT of fluoride in it -- then yes, it appears very likely that not only are people going over the suggested limited for fluoride, but I'd expect that actually *many* are going over this threshold.		It's actually kind of disheartening that previous conspiracy theories have tarnished this topic because I think it's something that we really need to look more into but it's hard to do that when, as you can tell from this thread, many people automatically assume it's a topic that has been beaten to death and to bring it up is ridiculous.  			Edit:   I see everyone in here dismissing the studies claims of causing ADHD, but would anyone that is knowledgeable on this topic address the other issues associated with high fluoridation that we KNOW exist -- such as bone density?		It appears that if you drink a lot of tea, you're pushing it.  How does this not effect heavy tea drinkers, like people in the UK?  It seems extremely easy to go past thresholds when you add in the fluoridated water in the tea, and food sources such as tomatoes and greens high in fluoride.   This is *especially* true in children which have half, or less, of a mans threshold of 4mg/day.		It just seems that we're getting fluoride from basically every source and it's strange that I only ever see sources brought up individually.  If anyone has every looked this up, or has a study which has, I would be extremely grateful to see it!  I was never able to find one and it will take hours to put it all together myself.		Edit2:  Just checked on fluoride levels of local water and it was .9mg/liter.     After drinking my recommended water I really wouldn't have much left on my 4mg limit.   I can drink quite a bit when hiking/biking in Texas heat, how does that fall into consideration?  How much further then will I go over the limit after eating?  Brushing teeth?

{"body":"I agree that daily fluoride consumption can vary greatly from individual to individual. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1253719/) kinda gets into the idea you were discussing of tracking fluoride from a variety of sources. It and several other paywalled studies all seem to conclude that swallowed dentifrice (IE: toothpaste) is a very substantial determinant of fluoride dose, followed by fluoridated water, then food, and then 'beverages' (juice, soda, etc.). This is why, for children, you always hear about using a 'pea sized' amount of toothpaste. 		I'm assuming you're a 60kg male (you can correct me if this is incorrect). The earliest symptom of fluoride overdose is experienced at ~3mg/kg, so you'd need to ingest about 180mg of fluoride in a relatively fast timespan to experience symptoms. Fluoride toxicity is, therefore, most commonly associated with ingestion of products with high amounts of fluoride (ex. toothpaste, insecticides, or some cleaning products). 		What happens if you chronically ingest more than the suggested daily amount? 		That's tougher to answer. If you were a child <8 years old, you could increase your risk for enamel fluorosis, which is a [mottled, whitish discoloration of the teeth](http://img.medscape.com/article/753/193/753193-fig-1.jpg). As an adult, you have no risk of enamel fluorosis, as this only occurs before the teeth have erupted.		The level of fluoride in the blood is regulated by two mechanisms: incorporation into bones and enamel, and clearance by the kidneys. I've seen some articles studying risk for chronic kidney disease with fluoride over-consumption, but they've all said that there's no evidence of this. These aren't very rigorous studies, though. 		In terms of beneficial effects, lots of studies have shown that fluoride deficiency increases risk for cavities. Additionally, some studies are going on to determine if fluoride supplementation can help increase bone density for osteoporosis treatment. I'd say these studies, despite early promise, seem to have had mixed to negative results.		Overall, the answer to "what happens if I ingest a little bit too much fluoride?" seems to be:		1) more fluoride gets incorporated into your bones and enamel	2) you pee out more fluoride	3) no other health effects have been identified yet, but this has not been studied rigorously.		My personal thoughts: Worry less about fluoride and don't swallow lots of toothpaste. Worry more about diet, exercise, and car accidents.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrappoSlash","name":"t1_cpf0t9d","parent_id":"t1_cpeuume","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426374417,"created_utc":1426370817}

One might encounter this kind of heavy fluoride content in some well water. Water where fluoride has been added usually has about  1 mg/L, for reference.		The recommended daily intake is usually a conservative value. In other words, it's the lower range of what's thought to yield a targeted health benefit. That's why you can see products on the market with 1000% of the suggested daily intake of vitamin C. It is possible, however, to see adverse health effects with significant overconsumption of vitamins/minerals, such as vitamin D toxicity, which is observed at something like 100 times the recommended daily allowance. Based on this observation, there is also a 'tolerable upper intake level' that's about 15 times the RDA.		To get back to fluoride, the tolerable upper intake (which is still within a margin of safety) is 10mg per day.		I think proper self care (regular moderate cardio, yoga or other range of motion exercise, and a well-balanced diet) is far more likely to impact bone density and musculoskeletal pain than aggressively managing fluoride intake.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrappoSlash","name":"t1_cphgkmh","parent_id":"t1_cpfobwy","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426578876,"created_utc":1426575276}
