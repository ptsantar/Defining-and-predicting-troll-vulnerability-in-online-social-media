You can track this fairly easily with sites like Research Gate, where people are listed by training, employment, and publications. 		In my own PhD coursework, the breakdown was fairly even between biology and applied math, statistics, and computational methods. And personally I'm more comfortable analyzing and visualizing data in R than lecturing on plant ecophysiology! 		* Forgot my original point. Long winded way of getting around to this: most PIs don't pay for statistics work in my field, but it is not unusual to write in a co-PI into a grant who is a statistician.

Therefore it has to be 11% if the sensitivity is 89%.  Anyway, my point is that there are good medical researchers and there are some really bad ones.

We can also jettison some of the traditional but useless rote memorization like most of "gross anatomy", etc. Med schools and residencies do try to screen a bit for that though by relying on exams like the MCAT, and USMLE step 1, 2 (both CK and CS), and 3. The USMLEs are a bit in the psychometric style of questions like Board exams. Very well written, in general.

Especially if there was an equal distribution of men and women being cut from the sample, it might not have any effect whatsoever. Yes, the underlying results of the study could suggest that there are gender differences in how man and women make decisions and perhaps for their overall aptitude in the field. This would corroborate other evidence we have that women, on average, tend to be less confident or are less willing to state that they ARE confident, yet effectively in this study men and women were about equally correct on medical knowledge tests.		My problem with this study IS the fact that these results are so striking, and so "sexy" that it behooves the researchers to have done a rigorous study so that these results are reliable and valid. From these results, can we conclude that we should try to get female doctors to be more confident? Or should we trust female doctors more?

I think you may not actually understand why they do this.  Often there are specific grants earmarked for medical students to do research, trying to get them interested enough to become real researchers and do an MD/PhD.  But if there is any way for a teaching facility attending physician to get a medical student to churn out a paper then they want them to do it.  This is not because of the great scientific contributions which everyone involved knows cannot be had in a 12 week period.  (You know we aren't stupid, right?)  But you CAN often get enough data in 12 weeks to churn out a paper that will get published *somewhere* which makes the university think that the *faculty/attending physician* is doing work and is valuable.  It's just the jacked-up way in which teaching hospitals seem to work.		Additionally, many competitive residencies want to see that you have done research and published in their field in order to rank you more highly.  This is of course idiotic since being a brilliant, skilled researcher and being a brilliant, skilled clinician have very different skillsets.  It's asinine to use this as selection criteria, but there's just not a much better way to separate your commitment to the field I guess.  		I'm in Ophthalmology now, and I can tell you my patients care way more about hearing my post-op patients in the waiting room telling them how their surgery went than they care about my meager contributions to a basic science project involving the complement cascade.","depth":2,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"downloadacar","name":"t1_cpaixdl","parent_id":"t1_cpa8ztp","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426016813,"created_utc":1426013213}

They give no statistical reason for doing so. If they wanted to be more accurate, the researchers would stratify the samples by their "confidence" or "accuracy" and "gender" and randomly sample from those groups to have higher power. I quickly went over the methods, and the difference in "accuracy" was negligible (~1%) with a very high p-value (p=.04) or something like that. 		In fact, what we have here is the opposite. We have no well defined statistical reasons for doing any of the tests these researchers did, and the high p-value makes me suspicious over whether there actually was any difference between genders. These guys have no idea how sampling works. These people have no way of knowing whether this sample accurately reflects their target population. It's quite laughable.		The other thing that makes me suspicious is that there was no difference between the genders regarding the "I'm feeling lucky" and the "not confident" groups but there was an extremely significant (p=.001) difference between the genders in the confident group.

{"body":"I wouldn't be surprised if this also applied to medical residents or even younger attendings...when they're actually right it's nice that they're confident and get to a decision about what to do relatively quickly but when they're wrong it's a massive pain in the butt to try and explain to them why they're totally wrong because they tend to be super confident that they're right.  When they've done their homework and had enough training the male residents I teach end up being very efficient-they know their stuff and they'll pretty quickly come to the right conclusion, but the guys who haven't had enough training or who haven't really done their homework and just don't have enough knowledge basically end up wasting a good amount of time where I have to literally go through the literature with them to show them just how off base they are.  Out of their female counterparts maybe only 1-2 residents a year will be that overconfident.  I tend to find in general (with exceptions!  I have male residents that take their time and overthink things and I have female residents that tunnel vision like crazy) that my female residents take more time to consider other possibilities whereas a lot more males will just zoom in on one diagnosis so for some of them (where they're lacking in knowledge) their entire workup is basically wrong.		That said, I know a colleague who seems to assume the more confident person is the "better" resident just because they *appear* to know what they're doing, while feeling like the less confident residents aren't as good, so if you're a medical student or resident keep in mind that appearing confident can help get you better evaluations.  Back when I was a resident they even picked a couple overly confident people to be chief residents and they're people who ended up failing their boards because their actual medical knowledge was poor but they had better evaluations than quieter folks.		So if you're a medical student or a resident right now my best advice is honestly to actually know your stuff and then be confident about stuff you really do know, but if your attending is telling you that you're wrong you should try and have at least a little bit of self doubt about whether your answer is really right.		TL;DR lots of confidence is good when you actually know what you're doing, less great when you're wrong all the time but still super confident about it.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tekdemon","name":"t1_cpalvhk","parent_id":"t3_2yjjrm","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1426021160,"created_utc":1426017560}
