From what I understand, the issue with Neu5Gc and cancer has nothing to do with whether the food is cooked or eaten raw. The sugar survives normal preparation procedures. It does vary in quantity by the type of food, e.g., meats and certain cheeses have quite a bit while milk, and most other cheeses have relatively small amounts. Animals don't have an issue with eating other animal meat because they all possess the original form of the sugar: Neu5Gc. Humans, or rather, ancestors of ours that branched off as the hominid line, possess a mutated form of the sugar Neu5Ac. When we consume foods with Neu5Gc we have an immune reaction which produces the inflammation mentioned in the article. More and more evidence is being brought to light that links inflammation with most of the common big diseases like heart disease and diabetes, to name just two. [Here's](http://eatingoffthefoodgrid.blogspot.com/2010/12/neu5gc-live-fast-die-young.html) an article that talks more about it and lists the quantities of this sugar found in common foods.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"star_boy2005","name":"t1_cnauhlf","parent_id":"t1_cnatd7y","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420075608,"created_utc":1420075608}

{"body":"It should be made clear that you should read the article before commenting. 		The "robust" results you refer to are from a mouse, genetically modified to have a human-specific inactivation, immunized specifically against Neu5Gc and then dosed with food containing Neu5Gc.		Next, this in no way supports anything related to your vegan, pseudo-evolutionary theory; this is a genetic frameshift mutation (they've identified the human pseudogene and the intervening Alu) that is not in any way related to what an organism eats, unless perhaps you're munching ethidium bromide.		Finally, the authors themselves comment that while this shows potential for pathway investigation, it is too early to consider this relevant for humans.		Quote (because I read the article):	There are limitations in directly comparing this mouse study	and the human situation. Unlike the case in humans, there was	a single dietary source of Neu5Gc that was not varied in intake	and the antibody production was not sustained throughout the	lifetime of the animal. Also, the target organ for the adenomato-carcinoma	sequence was the liver, not the colon. The obvious	question arising from such experimental mouse studies is	whether circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies correlate with cancer	risk in human population studies. We are currently exploring	this possibility, but we are also aware of the numerous complicating	variables in humans, such as the varying amount and unknown	bioavailability of Neu5Gc from dietary red meat, the	amount of Neu5Gc tissue loading in benign and malignant tissues,	the complex and variable polyclonal antibody profiles of	individual humans, the skewed distribution of antibody levels	within populations, the possibility that very high antibody levels	can inhibit tumor progression (18), and the variability of concurrent	inflammatory conditions","depth":3,"score":66,"ups":66,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"babe_blueox","name":"t1_cnaprlc","parent_id":"t1_cnannu7","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420065018,"created_utc":1420065018}

A scientist who may profit from certain findings being true can end up having a bias. Heck, just trying to keep a grant can cause this alone. Sometimes this can lead to PIs losing objectivity. Pressure is sometimes placed on the grad students/post docs doing the work that can lead to cut corners, data manipulation, and falsification. 		I worked for a PI who told a postdoc he would not help them get a job (write a strong letter) unless they identified the target of a drug identified in the lab. Not to mention cases of PIs married to their pet hypotheses. These ones will only accept data from their post docs/grad students that support their claim and make their lives hell.		Also, in some fields, they can be quite incestuous in that the labs are closely tied to each other because they all trained with Professor X or are buddies and sometimes this affects objectivity in the review process.

Complex carbohydrates work in exactly the same way. The only difference is that complex carbohydrates are made of longer chains, and take longer on average to metabolize. However, if one is to eat enough complex carbohydrates in one sitting,  the effect will be very much the same as with simple carbohydrates.		This is true for all forms of complex carbohydrates, including whole wheat bread, white bread, etc. Whole wheat is only healthier because it contains vitamins and minerals, and possibly more fiber, which slows digestion further.

However, there is plenty of evidence to indicate that proper LCHF/Paleo/Keto/Atkins diets have lots of health benefits of their own.		At the end of the day it comes down to ensuring your body can maintain itself (adequate protein), that you have energy to do stuff (either LCHF or adequate carbs), that you don't feel like you're starving (adequate fats), and that you're not spending a sizable portion of your life on the crapper (adequate fiber) 		The body is versatile and adaptable and any number of diets could be considered equally healthy. Also important are all of the nutritional elements and minerals- magnesium, iron, potassium, vitamins, etc- which most people just take for granted that they're getting enough of in a regular diet. 		Exercise is of course also an important part of being healthy; cardiovascular exercises increase heart health and general energy levels, while strength exercises raise your resting metabolic rate and make you physically hardier.","depth":8,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EdenBlade47","name":"t1_cnahulp","parent_id":"t1_cnagidl","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420049724,"created_utc":1420049724}

I think paleo people are trying to change their tune to saying that it's about eating natural foods, not so much about eating a lot of meat.

DASH makes sense because there are not these rules about foods to avoid, other than avoiding heavily processed things (i.e. things with lots of additional sugar and salt added).

Of course, that may not be good enough for you, in which case you will end up spending a lot of money.		I believe paleo (or maybe it's primal?)  has an 80/20 rule or something similar though, the idea being that as long as you're getting it 80% correct, you're getting some of the benefits. I think that's a good idea for encouraging compliance to any diet. Saying that you have to do it this way or else is going to cause people to give up quickly.		I don't think there is any one diet for everyone, though. DASH diet is designed to lower weight, blood pressure and cholesterol. I've been underweight most of my life (didn't get up to a normal BMI until my 40s), have low blood pressure, low fasting blood glucose and low cholesterol.  I also become ill after being on a vegan diet for close to a year (balanced diet with good vegan protein sources and recommeded amount of B12 supplementation.)		Regarding grains, I used to catch colds all the time. This stopped when I stopped eating whole grains. On a number of occasions, I've experimented with replacing my usual breakfast, two eggs scrambled in olive oil (no milk), with oatmeal (from bags of raw oats, so no added sugar, salt, preservatives, artifical colors or flavors). Within 2 to 4 days, I'll always catch a cold. I'm thinking it might be because grains inhibit zinc absorption; whenever I do catch a cold, taking zinc supplements clears it up very quickly - but that's just conjecture.		Of course, that's just me.

The problem with using stem cells for these kinds of applications is that you have to deliver them and get them to take up a role.

His research is usually top notch**.		Secondly, he has some very interesting theories on evolution and the role that sugars might have played in our brain development. Outside of DNA, sialic acids (NeuNAc) have been called the most interesting molecules in all of biology. Near the same exact time millions of years ago when **our ancestors evolutionary diverged from chimpanzees, we developed a mutation in an enzyme known as CMAH**. CMAH catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to sialic acid (NeuNAc) to produce Neu5Gc (NeuNAc w/ added -OH). One of the things that makes you uniquely human compared to almost all other mammals are the patterns of carbohydrates that cover the surface of your cells, and in particular, **what makes you uniquely human is the striking lack of Neu5Gc on your cells compared to almost all other mammals**. Sialic acids are heavily present in the brain, and are quite abundant on the surfaces of neurons; we now know that sialic acids have very profound roles in neuronal plasticity, memory, learning, and brain development after fertilization. The fact that humans were no longer able to synthesize hydroxylated forms of sialic acid (Neu5Gc) could have, in theory, had a radical effect on the way our brains evolved (according to Varki) because of the fundamental role that sialic acids have in modeling our brain during development and for memory/learning.		Sialic acids decorate the surfaces of all cells. As mentioned, **all mammals besides humans have Neu5Gc on their cells**. When you consume meat, Neu5Gc from your foods get stripped from the cells that comprise the meat you consumed and can be metabolically incorporated onto the surface of your cells. Glycobiology and **your immune system has evolved in tandem over millions of years, and the fact that Neu5Gc isn't human means it gets recognized by the immune system which in theory could lead to the results linked by the OP**.","depth":1,"score":489,"ups":489,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"losningen","name":"t1_cnaap2f","parent_id":"t1_cna9ehp","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420033745,"created_utc":1420033745}

It makes sense to me that our gut bacteria and digestive organs would still be able to metabolize Neu5Gc, and cells still have the tendency to utilize it as a building material. The only thing that changed genetically is that we no longer *produce* it, but that says nothing for our ability to use it that we clearly share with nearly all other mammals. For probably almost a hundred million years mammal bodies have been processing Neu5Gc through their digestive systems, and it hasn't been an issue until humans. Along these lines, I think it's safe to posit that those same ancient digestive systems are well adapted to consuming birds and fish without too many problems.		All-in-all, this is a really strange, and not very beneficial adaptation, digestively speaking. I am curious about Neu5Gc's role in brain function, if perhaps its elimination provided some immense cognitive benefit. Perhaps because the negative effects of this mutation usually don't present themselves until well after having had ample opportunity to pass on one's genes. Still, it must have provided some benefit in order for those with the mutation to have had such a reproductive edge that they went on to dominate the population.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AntithesisVI","name":"t1_cnaqybu","parent_id":"t1_cnahmls","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420067595,"created_utc":1420067595}

The immune response is modulated by an idiosyncratic "lock and key" antigen system that may simply not respond as profoundly to antigens found in fish, fowl, etc. We would expect, in fact, that any response would be heavily selected against by evolution. 		The persistence of an immune response against Neu5Gc may be an artifact of the relatively brief time since divergence/mutation as well as the fact that the mutation's negative effects are outweighed by positive effects in terms of a survival advantage. Lastly mutations that preserve the survival advantage while attenuating the immunological response may have already occurred, while elimination of the immunological response may result only from lethal mutation.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"drdvna","name":"t1_cnar8ab","parent_id":"t1_cnahmls","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420068175,"created_utc":1420068175}

Even when the turkey is fully cooked the fat remains as a gelatinous mess between the skin and the breast. That being said, I think the fat still gives you a better product because it helps keep the breast from drying out and probably adds all sorts of flavor to the breast. 		They both get white and dark meat like your store bought birds. The difference is that the dark meat gets really dark and both the white and dark meat will get hints of a pink/red color throughout.

Someone please correct me if I'm interpreting any of this incorrectly. 		>Neu5Ac/Neu5Gc ratio may be relevant because	of likely competition of Neu5Ac with Neu5Gc for incorporation	into cells		So it's not just the absolute Neu5Gc content, but potentially also the amount of it relative to total sialic acids. 			The mice were fed a diet consisting of 250 ??g of Neu5Gc per gram of food. It looks like only the control group was given Neu5Ac, so it doesn't seem like competitive uptake between the two is accounted for in this study.		I'm not entirely sure, but I think the paper is suggesting that all of the food that the mice ate was enriched.		To give some perspective, fried beef steak had the highest value of all red meats, and it contained about 230 ??g per gram of food, but also contains about an equal amount of Neu5Ac, so if competitive absorption is factored in, that might make the 250 ??g in the mouse-chow significantly more absorbed.		>can cause mouse tissue incorporation of Neu5Gc over a period of weeks at levels histologically similar to the levels seen in adult humans who have eaten red meat for many years		However, while this might seem like an excessive dose, the effect size was HUGE. 8 out of 17 mice developed liver carcinomas, compared to 2 out of 36 of the other mice. 		So yeah, it was a huge dose, but it was also a massive effect.		What I found even more interesting was the varieties found in different foods. 		Cheddar cheese contained 22 ??g/g (accounting for merely 2% of total sialic acids), while jack and mozzarella cheese contained 11 ??g/g (about 4% of total).		Could somebody who knows anything about cheese suggest whether this is a result of the breed of the cow or the bacteria/process used to make the cheese?		Ground beef contained a much lower (25 ??g and 32%) concentration compared to raw beef steak (134 ??g and 55%). 		Looks like cooking didn't have a significant effect on the actual Neu5Gc content, but merely reduced water weight, and therefore increased the ??g/g value.		>Three methods of cooking significantly altered neither Neu5Gc content nor the ratio of bound and free forms.		Shockingly, **pork bacon** actually contained the lowest Neu5Gc content of meats, at only 7 ??g/g, followed by pork bratwurst with 11 ??g/g. However pork bacon was 22% of all sialic acids, where as pork bratwurst was only 9%.

{"body":"The terms "physical dependency" and "psychological dependency" have special meaning. The former refers to a situation where significant tangible harm would come to the body if the dependency isn't met, even if the substance being (ab)used is generally harmful anyway. Psychological dependencies are those whereby the immediate cessation of use will not harm you, beyond the psychological trauma of craving the substance.		Pasta doesn't hold any physical dependency on your body. You can eat half a kilo of pasta a day for a year, then stop immediately and switch to other food sources without serious effects. At most you'd get digestive discomfort due to the change in diet. You'd mentally crave some pasta, but your body doesn't physically depend upon it to function.		Alcohol and nicotine, however, can become real physical dependencies during addiction. If you're highly addicted and have been using for very long periods (years) then you cannot immediately stop without becoming seriously ill. Abrupt alcohol discontinuation in serious addiction cases can result in death.		A simple-ish way to look at it is to think about chemical production levels in the body. A normal healthy body will produce hormones and neurotransmitter chemicals in normal levels, varying them as necessary throughout the day to respond to stimuli and requirements. Dopamine is a good example of this - it affects all sorts of systems within your body, and is secreted, absorbed, and metabolised at various rates in order to keep your body and mind functioning properly. Now, imagine that you recreationally consume a substance that reduces the rate at which your body clears out (eliminates) dopamine from areas where it is effective. You would feel the psychological effects of dopamine more strongly, because you'd have more of it, and it'd hang out in your nervous system longer (due to the inhibition of reuptake). If you take this substance daily, for years, your body slowly adapts to the increased artificially increased level of dopamine in your system by reducing the secretion rate, thus keeping it within "normal" levels. Now, imagine you immediately stop. Your body has no time to catch up with the unexpected increase in dopamine elimination rates, so your dopamine levels plummet. This leads to a dopamine deficiency, which makes you feel depressed, gives you headaches, and generally makes you feel shitty. In serious cases, your dopamine levels could get so low that they inhibit normal bodily functions, including memory and motor control. Overcompensation may also cause lethal levels to build up, though this is less likely.","depth":11,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gsuberland","name":"t1_cnaht2a","parent_id":"t1_cnahagd","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420049646,"created_utc":1420049646}
{"body":"All grey, my friend, not the dichotomy you try to create.		Eating and also withdrawing from a carbohydrate-intense diet does indeed cause physiological changes and discomfort.

To paraphrase Pip from Pulp Fiction: ain't the same ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same sport.		A physical dependency is one in which *harm* will occur if discontinuation is not properly managed. Discontinuation of pasta does not cause harm - it is discomfort at most. Discontinuation of nicotine or alcohol causes tangible harm. That is the distinction.		Have you perhaps considered that you have a negative view of smokers which is inhibiting your objectivity here?

Your notion of long-term benefit does not factor in. I presume that you're aware of this, but have chosen to cherry-pick that concept to suit your argument.		To take your example, yes, I guess you could argue that in the strictest definition of physical dependency, massively binging on carbs for decades and immediately stopping is similar (albeit a lesser level of harm) than stopping smoking. I could equally argue that going cold-turkey on consuming massive levels of green vegetables could cause the same effects. The long-term health impacts might be polar opposites, but that is irrelevant when discussing the effects of stopping immediately.		What you seem to be missing is that physical dependencies are called physical dependencies because they fall under a particular medical classification. Just because you feel that something else *should* be considered a physical dependency, doesn't mean that the scientific community classifies it as such.

{"body":"Gravity - there is a consensus on it. It works in all macro level systems on earth.		However, there were problems measuring certain things - which is where Einstein came in and added the theories of special and general relativity. Now there is a consensus that these theories are better suited for prediction and calculations in certain situations (e.g., strong gravitational fields, speeds approaching the speed of light, etc). In this case, Newton wasn't "wrong." Newtonian physics still works really well, but we now know that there is much more to the story about how objects move/fall. And those new theories have been accepted by the scientific community. 		So, I would argue that the human body is "knowable" and therefore a consensus can be met.  But the complexity of it is enormous - basically because there's just so much different stuff in the body, and they all have their different reasons for moving in the way they do. And on top of that we add different stuff to it every day, usually 3 times a day, not to mention what we're absorbing passively (UV, pollution etc). So I think a consensus can be met, because it is possible to know the ins and outs of the human body/mind, it's just hard to. Currently, it's difficult because our tools are not good enough and we can't experiment on humans in any way we like. So we have to continue being clever with our line of questioning and continue making better measurement tools. 		Note: There are "simple" things about the body that we know for a fact, and consensus is met on. For instance, if you possess a certain allele of a certain gene (each gene has 2 alleles), you will get Huntington's disease. So we can look at someone's DNA, and without a doubt say "unless you die before its onset, you will get Huntington's disease in your lifetime."

{"body":"It seems like a good time to remind people about how to think about risk ratios (or odds ratios, since they're essentially the same thing for small probabilities).		>A study published by Harvard University in June suggested that a diet high in red meat raised the risk of breast cancer for women by 22 per cent.	>In 2005 a study found those who regularly ate 5.6oz (160g) of red meat a day had one third higher risk of bowel cancer. 		These are describing either odds ratios or risk ratios. Probably odds ratios since I imagine these were retrospective studies using logistic regression. Go on and look them up on wikipedia, but I'm going to talk about risk ratios because they're more intuitive. The risk ratio is simply the absolute risk (probability of getting cancer) of one group over the absolute risk of the other group.		Without reading the mentioned studies, it's hard to tell what other factors were involved in these group comparisons (for example, age is a factor in cancer risk). I imagine there was control and randomization so that the comparison is representative. Let's arbitrarily say the breast cancer comparison is studying 50-year old women, who according to breastcancer.org have an absolute risk of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years of 2.31%.

{"body":"I apologize for the long story but I think it's kind of a cool bit of amateur science.		After I contracted Still's in the early 2000s I was having severe flairs every month and feeling very stiff and fatigued the whole time between. Some time later I happened to notice that I felt unusually free of stiffness and fatigue immediately after recovering from a bad flu that had lasted more than a week and which had kept me in bed with nothing but fruit juices. Then normal eating habits kicked back in (burgers, pizza, etc.) and before long I went back to feeling bad again. 		This happened again about a year later and it really dawned on me this time that it might be my diet while sick in bed that was making me feel so good when the illness would pass. I started experimenting by not eating certain foods for awhile at a time but nothing really clicked. First I thought maybe bread was the cause, then I suspected cheese, and then other foods. 		I realize now that during this early experiment I was not eliminating all of the right category of foods nor giving my body enough time to get rid of what had accumulated from a diet heavy with mammal products. Anyway, I came across [this](http://health.ucsd.edu/news/2003/09_29_Varki.html) science news article from Varki, published in 2003 that first brought the inflammatory response from Neu5Gc to my attention. It gave me a new point of focus for my diet experiments. Although I now had a suspect food group I was having a hard time committing to the degree necessary to eliminate its effects from my system so I continued to feel bad and have flairs but their frequency dropped to one every two to three months. 		Meanwhile my rheumatologist was encouraging my self treatment while continuing to treat my condition with meds. He hadn't heard of any connection between Still's and Neu5Gc but he was supportive since I seemed to be making progress. His primary goal was to reduce my use of steroids - which I had to take every time I had a flair - to no more than 3 times a year.		I continued to believe there was a dietary connection but I hadn't fully resolved to eliminate mammal products completely from my diet until October of 2010 when I had two bad flairs within three weeks of each other. Two heavy doses of prednisone so close together severely compromised my immune system and I developed a bad cellulitis infection in my leg that hospitalized me for almost a week. I narrowly avoided having my leg slit all the way up the middle to relieve the pressure and it was a terrible experience. When I got out of the hospital I finally had sufficient resolve to permanently cut out all mammal products from my diet. I haven't had a Still's flair since. 		I've since determined I can tolerate a little bit of butter here and there and the occasional piece of pizza (which I load up with lots of anti-oxidant rich ingredients that protect against inflammation). I pay the price of some mild stiffness in my lower back for a few hours afterwards but then it's over and I don't cheat again for a few more weeks. I stopped seeing my rheumatologist with his blessing after he said I had effectively defeated a disease that has no cure.		Neu5Gc is not the secret cause of Still's for everyone who has it though. Stress is usually the major trigger for Still's flairs for most people and all kinds of stress can do it. In my case, which I believe may be atypical, my inflammatory reaction to Neu5Gc was my particular stressor. Eliminating that was all it took to put it into remission.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"star_boy2005","name":"t1_cnbe4m0","parent_id":"t1_cnbc9pm","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420141265,"created_utc":1420141265}

Almost all human proteins and cells (due to surface proteins) are coated with complex carbohydrates, which serve as points where other proteins attach or as some sort of signal about the identity of the cell they are attached to.		Viruses use carbohydrates as attachment points as well. Influenza strains are categorised by the type of hemaglutinin and neuraminidase they come with. Those types correspond to the numbers in the standard naming scheme H#N#. The hemaglutinin is responsible for binding to sialic acids (the molecule family Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac belong to) and determines which cells preferentially are attacked by the virus.		Currently a type of malaria prevalent when our ancestors lived, is assumed to be the causing agent for the selection of humans with no ability to synthesise Neu5Gc.

As we can see from your aggressive post, even people who consider themselves informed overstate claims (e.g. "the similarities between the physiology of mice and rats and the physiology of people has been tested and proven over and over again over the years"). (The word 'proven', btw, has no place in biological science.) Secondly, the trouble with your interpretation wasn't that I may have made some perceived error, but the nature of your attack. Calling someone ignorant is a great way to make yourself feel superior, but does the opposite of what you seem to want to do - fight misinformation and doubt. Next time maybe ask someone for clarification before being so brutish.		tl;dr This article grossly overstates the findings of a scientific study.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sasmon","name":"t1_cnaxbyk","parent_id":"t1_cnas8bk","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420083042,"created_utc":1420083042}

His research is usually top notch.		>Secondly, he has some very interesting theories on evolution and the role that sugars might have played in our brain development. Outside of DNA, sialic acids (NeuNAc) have been called the most interesting molecules in all of biology. Near the same exact time millions of years ago when our ancestors evolutionary diverged from chimpanzees, we developed a mutation in an enzyme known as CMAH. CMAH catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to sialic acid (NeuNAc) to produce Neu5Gc (NeuNAc w/ added -OH). One of the things that makes you uniquely human compared to almost all other mammals are the patterns of carbohydrates that cover the surface of your cells, and in particular, what makes you uniquely human is the striking lack of Neu5Gc on your cells compared to almost all other mammals. Sialic acids are heavily present in the brain, and are quite abundant on the surfaces of neurons; we now know that sialic acids have very profound roles in neuronal plasticity, memory, learning, and brain development after fertilization. The fact that humans were no longer able to synthesize hydroxylated forms of sialic acid (Neu5Gc) could have, in theory, had a radical effect on the way our brains evolved (according to Varki) because of the fundamental role that sialic acids have in modeling our brain during development and for memory/learning.		>Sialic acids decorate the surfaces of all cells. As mentioned, all mammals besides humans have Neu5Gc on their cells. When you consume meat, Neu5Gc from your foods get stripped from the cells that comprise the meat you consumed and can be metabolically incorporated onto the surface of your cells. Glycobiology and your immune system has evolved in tandem over millions of years, and the fact that Neu5Gc isn't human means it gets recognized by the immune system which in theory could lead to the results linked by the OP","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"losningen","name":"t1_cnaajv8","parent_id":"t1_cnaa0k3","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420033233,"created_utc":1420033233}

The modern rates of consumption in the first world for the middle and lower classes are a very recent phenomenon, coinciding with (and enabled by) industrial livestock raising techniques that have made meat cheaper and produced in much higher volumes, while offering less ounce-for-ounce nutrition and more bioaccumulating chemicals introduced to support large yield. That this industrial meat production system coincides also with the rise of processed foods in general makes it hard to tease apart what's what, whether it's the meat, or what's in the meat, or other aspects of the diet (in reality, they're all factors; to what extent each factor is significant I do not know). Whatever it is, I have no doubt that our diet is a very recent phenomenon, far more recent than 8-10 thousand years (try 100, or less) and this recent diet is easily the biggest contributing factor to our exploding rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other such diseases.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"clarkma5","name":"t1_cnakmmb","parent_id":"t1_cnaj7a2","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420054752,"created_utc":1420054752}

To insinuate that consumption of red meat is the largest sole cause of cancer (which the title of the article clearly suggests) is genuinely overstepping the bounds of current research.

The double-edged sword of scientific studies is they boil questions down to single-variable problems that are testable, re-testable, shareable between other researchers, etc. Because science is based on the formulation of hypotheses, the testing of those hypotheses with well-structured and repeatable experiments, and then the repeating of those experiments for confirmation. But real issues in the real world are complex, multi-variable things which require the human intuition to look at many studies, many facets, posit reasonable guesses, check for logical consistencies, and understand the system at work. Evaluating complex multi-variable system honestly leaves the realm of direct "science", but if such hypothesized systems are likely to be correct, then single-variable scientific studies will confirm aspects of that system and/or be consistent with how the system works with itself. Science is a tool far more than it is a creator of answers; the answers are created by the creatures that ask the questions: human beings. So if you were so philosophically inclined, you could dismiss the entirety of science as confirming the reality we built ourselves, but that's not very practical is it?

And other ways		>Besides certain fermented foods,[71][72] there are currently only a few non-animal food sources of biologically active B12 suggested,[citation needed] and none of these have been subjected to human trials.		>Certain makers of kombucha cultured tea list vitamin B12 as naturally present in their product. One brand purports to contain 20% of the daily value of B12 in a single bottle,[73] making kombucha a potential "high" food source of B12. Because kombucha is produced by a symbiosis between yeast and bacteria, the possibility that kombucha contains B12 does not contradict current knowledge. But no scientific studies have yet been published confirming the fact, nor whether the B12 in kombucha is the biologically active B12.		>A Japanese fermented black tea known as Batabata-cha has been found to contain biologically active B12.[74] Unlike kombucha, which is made by fermenting already prepared tea, Batabata-cha is fermented while still in the tea leaf state.		>Chlorella,[25][26][75] a fresh-water single cell green algae, has been suggested as a vitamin B12 source but not proven by any live animal assay. Algae are thought to acquire B12 through a symbiotic relationship with heterotrophic bacteria, in which the bacteria supply B12 in exchange for fixed carbon.[76][77] Spirulina and dried Asakusa-nori (Porphyra tenera) have been found to contain mostly pseudovitamin-B12 (see Terminology) instead of biologically active B12.[8][9] While Asakusa-nori (Porphyra tenera) contains mostly pseudovitamin-B12 in the dry state, it has been reported to contain mostly biologically active B12 in the fresh state,[9] but even its fresh state vitamin activity has not been verified by animal enzyme assay.		>One group of researchers has reported that the purple laver seaweed known as Susabi-nori (Pyropia yezoensis).[27][28] in its fresh state contains B12 activity in the rat model, which implies that source would be active in humans. These results have not been confirmed.		>Foods fortified with B12 are also sources of the vitamin, although they cannot be regarded as true food sources of B12 since the vitamin is added in supplement form, from commercial bacterial production sources, such as cyanocobalamin. Examples of B12-fortified foods include fortified breakfast cereals, fortified soy products, fortified energy bars, and fortified nutritional yeast. The UK Vegan Society, the Vegetarian Resource Group, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, among others, recommend that every vegan who is not consuming B12 foods fortify with supplements.[78][23][24] Not all of these may contain labeled amounts of vitamin activity. Supplemental B12 added to beverages in one study was found to degrade to contain varying levels of pseudovitamin-B12. One report has found B12 analogues present in varying amounts in some multivitamins.[6][7]		>Unconventional natural sources of B12 also exist, but their utility as food sources of B12 are doubtful. For example, plants pulled from the ground and not washed scrupulously may contain remnants of B12 from the bacteria present in the surrounding soil.[79] B12 is also found in lakes if the water has not been sanitized.[80] Certain insects such as termites contain B12 produced by their gut bacteria, in a way analogous to ruminant animals.[81] The human intestinal tract itself may contain B12-producing bacteria in the small intestine,[82] but it is unclear whether sufficient amounts of the vitamin could be produced to meet nutritional needs.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"losningen","name":"t1_cnag87b","parent_id":"t1_cnafpbv","subreddit":"science","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","created":1420046702,"created_utc":1420046702}
