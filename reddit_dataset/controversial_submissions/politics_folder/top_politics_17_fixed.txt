{"body":"> Reporting on the many green-energy firms such as Solyndra that went belly-up after burning through hundreds of millions in Washington handouts, Attkisson ran into increasing difficulty getting her stories on the air. A colleague told her about the following exchange: ???[The stories] are pretty significant,??? said a news exec. ???Maybe we should be airing some of them on the ???Evening News?????????? Replied the program???s chief Pat Shevlin, ???What???s the matter, don???t you support green energy????	Says Attkisson: That???s like saying you???re anti-medicine if you point out pharmaceutical company fraud.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cljx0q8","parent_id":"t3_2kc40l","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1414298047,"created_utc":1414294447}
