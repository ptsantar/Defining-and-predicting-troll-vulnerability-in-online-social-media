{"body":"This is the real kicker and I don't really know.Maybe start at the local level.  The real issue is that for any real change of any sort, the current lawmakers would have to be on board, which they probably never will be.Maybe, term limits all around and some sort of law preventing former politicians from taking jobs by any company or subsidiary of any company that has ever given them money of that they have ever made even a remote regulation.This could help de-incentivise helping corporate interests and help remove the idea of the useless career politician who just cares about saving his job.Also possibly abolishing political parties.  Yeah, there would still be banding together but it would be less obvious and less easy to promote.  Also maybe it would help this whole bull shit power struggle that has gridlocked anything that is remotely progress.We would need to better educate and encourage people to vote.  Maybe give tax breaks for supporting the local crowd funded efforts (since they are effectively a tax where you chose the target).Better real accountability in budgeting for projects, I know how things work at my job at one of the largest corporations in the world.  Everything is inflated to ridiculous levels.  It very much feels like things are run like the government/army and I imagine that the actual government is a hundred times worse.Things could also be helped by having the balls to actually sunset projects.

{"body":"Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has a piece in the Manchester Union Leader this week entitled, "Why I am voting for Barack Obama." Burns is a wonderful director, but the column makes one wonder if he really understands the stories he sees on the screen.		Burns begins:		"One of my favorite movies of all time is Frank Capra's 'It's A Wonderful Life,' starring Jimmy Stewart. In the film, Stewart's character, a despondent and near suicidal George Bailey, who runs a small savings and loan in the town of Bedford Falls, is given a gift: the chance to see what his town would be like if he'd never been born ??? if he'd never extended a helping hand to his neighbors when they needed it most, never helped his community understand how much they depended upon one another.		"In this alternative vision, the town's plutocratic banker, Mr. Potter ??? without the decent George Bailey to counter him ??? rules everything. A bottom-line-is-everything, every-man-for-himself mentality runs unchecked, resulting in Bedford Falls' metamorphosis into 'Pottersville,' an amoral, soulless place.		"The movie has a happy ending, thank goodness, but its themes endure to this day and echo in the current presidential election, which at its core asks the question: What kind of country are we? Are we Bedford Falls or Pottersville? Are we all in this together ??? and stronger and better because of it ??? or are we entirely on our own, with a few 'makers' on the top of a heap of 'takers?'???		Burns eventually concludes: "What can one person do to make their community a Bedford Falls instead of a Pottersville? Well, there are many things. But one of them, I think, is to vote for Barack Obama."		Now, it so happens that "It's a Wonderful Life" is one of my favorite films, too. I have seen it, start to finish, at least 50 times in my life (for one thing, my wife of 31 years has insisted that we watch it at least one each Christmas season since our marriage). Yet somehow I've missed the parts where George Bailey - who is, we note, a businessman, a banker, and the son of a capitalist banker - calls for more government regulation, higher taxes, and greater redistribution of the wealth. Indeed, I missed the part where, because of Mitt Romney's election, George Bailey was never born, and thus wasn't about to make Bedford Falls a better place by supplying customers with good banking practices and affordable housing - for profit.		I missed the part where George Bailey told Violet Bick that if she really needed money, she really ought to apply for food stamps or some other form of government welfare. I suppose it's possible that at some point off-camera George sought a government bailout for his small lending company during economic hard times, but all I recall seeing on-camera was that George used his own creativity and infusion of capital - making a huge personal sacrifice and taking a huge personal financial risk - to keep his business afloat during the depression.		I recall that in the movie George Bailey worked long, long hours at the Bailey Brothers Building & Loan, often arriving home late in the evening, tired and weary; and in the version I've seen those 50 or more times, young George notes that his father, too, put in long hours and years of hard work to build his business. The Baileys in "It's a Wonderful Life" would probably have been shocked to hear a President say, "If you've got a small business, you didn't build that." And in the end, what comes closest to putting George under is not Mr. Potter alone, but Mr. Potter working to manipulate government regulators. And it is the government regulators who arrive to put the Bailey Brothers Building & Loan out of business.		In the movie, we don't know much about Mr. Potter, how he got his wealth or became the man he is. But we do know that Mr. Potter had powerful contacts in government, and we see him call on those contacts to try to drive his competitor - George Bailey - out of business. Violet Bick indicates - and no one suggests she is talking nonsense - that Mr. Potter is deeply involved in local government, and it is probably safe to assume that Potter benefits from powerful friends in government and quite probably from extensive government contracts and favors - what today we might call "shovel ready jobs" funded by government. Does anyone who watches "It's a Wonderful Life" doubt that George Bailey would refuse government subsidies to start a "green energy" business, whereas Mr. Potter would be plotting his next Solyndra and lobbying for more government funding?		Meanwhile, George's virtuous younger brother, Harry Bailey, goes off to make his way not as a community organizer, or working for PBS (Burns specifically criticizes Romney for wanting to cut funding for PBS), but working for his wife's family manufacturing business in Rochester. And George's old friend, Sam Wainwright, leaves Bedford Falls to make his fortune in plastics. Though a bit of a rogue - we see him calling his erstwhile girl friend, Mary Hatch, even while flirting with other women in his New York City office - Sam, like George, uses his talents for good. He makes a great deal of money as a wartime government contractor, but there is no suggestion that he cuts corners, inflates invoices, or fails to provide valuable products. He helps the war effort, and is implicitly praised for his efforts. He is apparently a creative entrepreneur, developing new uses for plastic that improve people's lives. And he is quick to use his wealth to help George in the movie's climactic final scene (note that it is Sam's unconditional offer of assistance that drops the final boom on the Mr. Potter and the bank examiner).		Indeed, Bedford Falls is populated with good people who ask nothing from the government and never seek a handout, and many of them are businessmen - Mr. Gower, the pharmacist; Mr. Martini, the tavern owner; Ernie, the cab driver (does he own or lease his own cab? We're never told, although Mr. Potter does refer to Ernie as driving "his cab," which may suggest that Ernie owns or leases the vehicle); Joe, the cheerful luggage shop proprietor; Dr. Campbell, the Chairman of the Building & Loan after Pa Bailey's death. And can you ever conceive of the family's cheerful and proud maid, Annie, voting for a candidate because he gave her a free phone?		I have no doubt that Mr. Burns has seen, and perhaps even studied, from a filmmaker's perspective, "It's a Wonderful Life." But he has totally missed the lessons that come from the movie.		Most of the column is full of boilerplate accusations that one can find in most any commentary thread at the Daily Kos, including the whopper, which Burns apparently makes with a straight face, that the Republican Party is "the furthest right they have ever been since the party was founded in 1856." (Yes, who doesn't recall the GOP platform of 1856, arguing for need to preserve Medicare, getting federal spending to 21% of GDP (it was well under 5% in those days), and opposing a federal income tax rate of over 40 percent (during the Civil War, the Republican Party enacted a flat rate income tax of 3 percent. I suspect today's GOP would support that).		But that Burns would invoke "It's a Wonderful Life" to support his version of a government subsidized paradise illustrates a tremendous confusion between civil society - those diverse institutions that people voluntarily form and join to create a rich community - and the coercion, one-size fits all approach government, especially the government that takes from Peter to pay Paul. Bedford Falls is what it is precisely because people don't rely on some distant bureaucracy to solve their problems. The join together, voluntarily. They trade, voluntarily and without subsidies, in goods and services. The folks in Bedford Falls, I think would have found Ken Burns' thinking totally alien to their values.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"eternalbloodfeud","name":"t1_cl9cqpj","parent_id":"t1_cl6ngrr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413313909,"created_utc":1413310309}

Exactly right! And well put. Back in the 80's the koch brothers tried to change the system via libertarian third party, one of them even ran for president. But they realized that it didn't matter how many billions you had, it is pointless to change a two party system from a third party, so they realized the best route is to capture and influence one of the major parties, so they directed their attention towards controlling the direction of the republican party.

{"body":"We've got a first-past-the-post system in Canada and have had three major parties for a while now. One major party fell (the Bloc Qu??b??cois, right-wing nationalist) and anpther has arisen in prominence (New Democratic Party, social democratic). In fact, our only major conservative party is going downhill, so our two biggest parties this next election may be the centre-left and left-wing parties.		My point is to not give up. It's disheartening to read all of these hopeless comments. If you can form big lobbying groups (Wolf-PAC, Mayday), what's stopping you from forming a left-wing party? Don't just wait for the baby boomers to die, 'cause you and I both know that the Republican party is too well organised to die off with them. Their propaganda is much more elaborate and effective than that of the Democrats, and it shows. That's in part why both parties have been skewing towards the right since Reagan's presidency. Instead of mocking those "stupid Republicans", go form your own party and set out to counter their bullshit with effective knowledge.		Virtually every other democratic country in the world has new parties forming left and right that rise to prominence in reaction to their nation's perceived crises. Just look at le Front national in France or Golden Dawn in Greece. My point is that the United States is an anomaly in that new parties don't form in reaction to events; the old ones just morph, and they're good at it.

{"body":"> Democrats campaigned on 'universal single payer'[1] and [then cut a deal with Billy Tauzin behind our backs] to (http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/02/12/the-legacy-of-billy-tauzin-the-white-house-phrma-deal/)force[2] us to pay into the Health Care Protection Racket.		To be clear, very few Democrats ran on single payer.  Anyone that's paid attention to the history of Democratic efforts to pass healthcare reform over the past few decades knows that single payer was simply not going to happen.  		4 years later and I can't believe that liberals are still having this fight.  Look, I think most liberals agreed back then and probably still believe that single payer is kind of our holy grail.  But back in 2009 / 2010 single payer simply was not on the table.  The choice was between no reforms or what we wound up with.  Even with an entirely compromised legislation that the ACA is Democrats were just barely able to pass it.  		And in order to make that happen the Administration had to have buy in from the healthcare and pharma industries.  I was not thrilled about it but the fact is either Democrats compromised and included certain things to get them to go along or they were going to engage in a full on assault against reform.  Both industries' lobbying arms had enough clout and financial resources to stop reform before it even had a chance.  		While Obamacare is far from perfect it has done some pretty great things.  Millions of people who were unable to obtain affordable insurance can do so now.  If someone is diagnosed with a serious medical condition they no longer have to fear being dropped by their insurer--or if someone has a pre-existing condition they don't have to fear being unable to get insured.  Insurers are required to spend at least 85% of premiums on actual medical care instead of administrative costs.  And we're starting to see the healthcare cost curve bend downward which is a huge deal.  		Finally, a provision in Obamacare gives states the ability to experiment with how they provide healthcare to their residents and one state--Vermont--is going to use this provision to see if it can introduce single payer in state.  Its an open question whether the proposed program will work or whether it will be popular.  But if it does work and the people of Vermont are happy with it you're going to see a good deal of pressure put on other states (neighboring states initially) to try and implement the same kind of program.   And if that happens you could see a tipping point where the US achieves single payer not by some federal action but instead on a state by state basis that will be a lot harder for Republicans to oppose by painting it as "federal overreach".  If Vermont succeeds it will have Obamacare to thank in large part.		Lets not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.","depth":2,"score":44,"ups":44,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Are_You_Hermano","name":"t1_cl6o4v0","parent_id":"t1_cl6mizv","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413054561,"created_utc":1413050961}

I guess this explains why we independents may or may not be 'libertarians' as most people believe in those principles anyway (even Dems/Reps could be). 	Maybe the Libertarians I know are socially liberal because they're reasonably educated and living in a liberal area, but even in my research online they read as socially liberal anyway. Even if they "personally" have contrary beliefs, they believe in personal choice (with the one exception being abortion, which even I think is a touchy issue although I'm ultimately pro-choice). 	Anyone who wants to force GOP christian-right values at the expense of personal choice and is claiming to be libertarian has no idea what they're talking about. That's a problem wide spread through the major parties anyway.	Personally, I find the idea that voting Libertarian shaves votes off the GOP is false. The same for the Green Party and Democrats. Most independents and third party voters were never going to vote for the two major parties to begin with!","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RdTide","name":"t1_cl6vjx9","parent_id":"t1_cl6sjnu","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413071921,"created_utc":1413068321}

Yeah a CEO should earn more than a construction worker, he's got more responsibilities, probably works harder and if he does a good job he'll earn his salary for his company many times over, which is why he makes that much to begin with. That's the free market side, simple.		Should he earn a thousand times as much? Some fund managers earn a hundred thousand times as much. Just think about that for a moment, to make as much money as one of those guys makes in a year, the construction worker would have to work as long as the human race has existed, cave paintings and all. By the time he got to ancient Egypt he'd be 90% of the way there.   	To you that doesn't matter, it's his to do with as he wishes and envying him his money is wrong, because under the free market rules he earned it.		Problem is that the rich get richer faster than the economy grows, which inevitably means that the poor get poorer, that's just a fact. Is that because the poor are becoming more lazy? You can't believe that, but things are fine for you because every poor kid has the chance to become rich if they're not stupid and apply themselves. We know that they cannot all become rich, we know that on average they become poorer, but that's not how you think.

Gated communities and slums, the rich are scared, the poor are miserable. This is not about Robin Hood or Karl Marx or whatever else you want to throw in my face. It is simple logic, it's fixing capitalism and everyone is better off for it.		Now that you know where I stand you don't need specific policies because you surely agree that the GOP is ideologically opposed to what I want, so what other choice is there but the dems?

The Democratic Party doesn't give two shits about gun control.

I know full well that firearms ownership positively correlates with both levels of firearms crime and violent crime in general across developed nations. I know full well that firearm ownership results in, on average, a *net loss of safety* for the individual and those living with him. I know full well that firearms ownership is a contributory factor to suicide, and that suicide rates (not just suicide-by-gun rates!) drop dramatically when firearms are removed from the equation, especially for males. So no, on the contrary, everything we know about modern, developed nations tell us that nations with lower rates of firearms ownership enjoy safer, less violent existences.		> Especially for the weak, elderly, and those who live in high-crime areas.

I agree, I don't want government subsidizing people's firearm purchases either. People should have to buy their AR-15s with their own money.		>No, not because of its cosmetic features.		No, just because it looks scary, I get it. You certainly don't want it banned because it kills a lot of people.

I never said anything about the urban poor's thoughts on gun control.

It's certainly no shock that the urban poor are fans of gun control, the left has been pushing the "gun control will make you safe" line for nearly 50 years. But yeah, inner-city Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, several cities in California, Washington D.C. etc... all Democratic strongholds with strict gun control, all hotbeds of gun violence.

History tells anyone who bothers to look that we organized our societies according to class.  The rulers are kings, parliaments, dictatorships, or whomever and there is some tacit agreement that they will establish the rules that govern that society.		We all agree to this and to the extent that we believe it's fair we abide by it and live according to these rules.		Now when those rulers begin to destabilize your society for their own financial gain or shift cost and risk on to you and your family for their financial gain or to make you their debt slaves for their financial gain, or funnel resources to themselves that would otherwise have been expended on your behalf for safe roads and bridges or a quality public education system and you have no say in the matter, a class war is being waged on you.		If you go from a country with a strong middle class and many opportunities to one that is suddenly no longer upwardly mobile as we have become and the number of your serfs increase (as it has) or when wide swaths of the population must accept a lower standard of living as is the case here, class war is being waged on you.		The outrage came when I suggested that we climb out of this with the democrats.  It seems ridiculous given they're just as corporate as the GOP, but they're not.		Tax policy is how this class war has been waged on the American people and the GOP own the strategy:  reduce taxes funnelling wealth up to the top, indbebt the nation, crowd out citizen priorities.  The democrats own the social safety net and can be found even as late as 2014 crafting policies that help and protect the people despite their obvious ties with big business.		Clearly the oligarchs have chosen which party *they* want and if polls are to be believed, it's going to be a banner election for the Grand Old Party.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrTreeopolis","name":"t1_cl92b28","parent_id":"t1_cl6vwef","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413289752,"created_utc":1413286152}

Half of your money is gone into rent, and supplies, etc.		So, 500k left.		You pay each person equivalent of 40k in salary + benefits. 		So, 100k left. That is what you keep.		Now, if this bakery were from 50 years ago it would squirrel away half of that 100k and eventually buy another bakery. Yay, you have a small franchise and life is good. You are limited in how many you can feasibly operate because our economy isn't global yet. You may have the capacity to own dozens across the US, each interconnected and each requiring general management. You bring in good money, but you can't afford to buy the world yet.		But, fast forward today.		You buy a machine that eliminates a job. That extra 40k you pocket.		The bakery down the street is hiring kids. You cut benefits. You pocket the difference.		You were grinding stuff in house, but you have a cheap chinese supplier. You pocket the difference. 		You can leverage warehouses in poorer areas in the country, and use high school kids or illegal immigrants. Information management is easier so you need less book keeping. You are wealthy enough to remotely monitor ten or twelve times the amount of businesses. Weak social safety net means you can buy out mom and pop bakeries in ay town you enter and people have to work for you. Dads Good Bakery paid you 20 bucks and hour, but I am only going to pay you 10. There are no other bakeries so you're screwed. 		You pocket the difference.		Americans don't understand that corporations have been increasing how much they can squeeze out of them.

They aren't contracting to pay your bills, put food on your table or pay your rent. It's merely an exchange, just like any other. If it isn't a good deal, don't buy/sell. No one owes you a good price because they have the right to not buy/sell too.		> If an employee is dependent on an employer (which in many cases, is most employees) and a employer chooses to lay them off, then that employer has directly contributed to that former employee's potential poverty and/or homelessness.		If the employee is dependent on the employer, the employer is by default improving the life of the employee. At no point is either party necessarily obligated to continue the exchange of labor/money. Both are free to walk away from the transaction at any point in time. Since they don't *owe* the other party their continued business, they are not  harming the other party by calling it quits.		> The only possibilities you could come up with were situations where one person is "buy"ing something from the other.	A few individuals may be able to exist by foraging or illegal cropping, but can be shut-down if a land-owner brings in the guns of the state on them for trespassing (or the land-owner may attempt to act as the law and execute them on sight).		They can most definitely homestead unowned/abandoned property or exchange goods/services (barter) with others as well. They are also free to start a commune if they disagree with the whole exchange thing. They are not free to infringe on the property rights of those who have earned said property through voluntary, mutual exchange. This is because doing so would violate the self-ownership principle (by stealing the labor of those who exchanged labor for money and then money for property).","depth":16,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ExPwner","name":"t1_cl731g3","parent_id":"t1_cl70zhp","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413089677,"created_utc":1413086077}

In your scenario, they could have had 25% more money and you would have had no problem with it. If you had not known that information you would have paid them $10, now you chose to pay them a lesser amount. You haven't defined exactly what "harm" means, but if it includes financial loss, then there is an argument that you harmed that person by paying less than you would have.			>So? An employer contracts for a certain number of hours and to pay a certain amount of money. 		Yes, and if they don't take into account logistic realities then they are a poverty employer. If they take all of their employee's time (thus preventing the employee from working for another employer or allowing them time to pursue other paths), then they can maintain a pool of employees in a poverty state indefinitely.

There's really only one way to get that tender: Fed -> commercial bank -> everyone else. For most of the "everyone else", it goes: Fed -> commercial bank -> corporate debt -> cash wage.

Nonetheless, no potential employer makes threats if you don't accept their offers.		> Funny thing is, actual businesses make this claim all the time.		That's news to me, but they're wrong too. The business isn't harmed from customers buying at a lower price than they are willing to buy because both parties consent to the exchange at a different price. They wouldn't agree if they weren't better off. I agree that this boils down to the definition of "harm" but I guarantee you that opportunity cost is *not* harm.

Are you familiar with company towns?		If I'm an employer it's none of my business. I certainly wouldn't take all of a hypothetical employee's time. Maybe it's 4 hours per day, maybe it's 8. In any case, it's up to that person to decide whether or not they want to accept my offer. The offer itself does not harm the employee, and I'll demonstrate: I will now offer you a job to work 8 hours per day at $.25 per day. You interested?		Yes, I am familiar with the idea of company towns. Those most certainly were backed up with guns, and iirc they were state guns.		> They actually are.		Lol, no, they really are not. It's one transaction, not their lives. They exchange one thing for another. It's literally the same as selling a product for a living. You wouldn't put the blame of poor TV sales on the customers for not paying enough to cover the rent of the TV salesman, so it makes no sense to blame the labor purchaser for not paying enough to cover the cost of rent for the laborer.		> If the employee is dependent on the employer, the coercion is explicit.

I'm sure you'd say that the threat of being fired is real, but that's true for any employee.		> Until an "owner" comes out and invokes the state's guns.		Ownership can be settled peacefully through a court system. I agree that much property can be traced back to guns, but imo a good-faith purchaser should take said property free of claims (with any rightful owner suing the thief).","depth":18,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ExPwner","name":"t1_cl766su","parent_id":"t1_cl74kcl","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413100283,"created_utc":1413096683}

My argument is that the Dems might be slightly better than the GOP - although I couldn't hand-on-heart say I've seen data to support that given their more recent activity - but that both the Dems and the GOP are different flavours of the same system which is actively bad for the poor, which is a particularly American flavour of neoliberal capitalism.

Voting for genuinely left-leaning third parties might waste your vote in the short run, but is the best way to convince the Dems to shift leftwards.

People who live in cities tend to understand and appreciate services that their government provides like trains, road maintenance, development zones, building regulations, etc. Cities also have a lot of homelessness and poor minorities on housing and food assistance. This minority concentration is partially because of perceived better opportunities in cities, but also because of the fear of racism in rural areas. America's rural areas tend to be much poorer, much more religious, and much more conservative. They know if their house catches on fire that they'll have to put it out themselves, so they don't care much for government or its regulations. And like I mentioned earlier, poor people tend to feel powerless about their financial circumstances. So they, like you, think the two parties are a wash economically so they might as well vote against abortion because their pastor told them to.

I'm saying that's not really quantifiable for lots of reasons. Now you're asking if Dem presidents are better for the economy. That's much easier to answer. Overall, the president rarely has much of an effect on the economy at all. But if you look at the 3 stock market crashes in the past century (1929, 1986, 2008), all 3 were under Republican presidents. And with all 3, the longer conservatives had been in office prior to the crash, the worse the crash. 		So while the American economy is robust and diverse and pretty steadily growing, Republicans have had a much greater negative effect on the economy than Dems. In general, I don't really think it's the president's job to improve the economy. But he should at least not drive it off a cliff.

Controlling the entire legislative and executive arm for a decade isn't necessarily enough to effect change. It's not about power, it's about what else is going on in the world.

It's not quantifiable or identifiable to a single political party on a national scale based on the narrow graph you insist on referring to. We have 50 very large metropolitan areas in this country, many many more than any other country on the planet. Some of those are more conservative and some are more liberal.

So you're still asking the wrong question, which is why you keep getting the wrong answer.		The rest of your reply follows this same flawed logic. I don't know how else to explain to you that the president and Congress don't really have much influence on the economy in general. There have been times where they did have a direct impact (New Deal, Bush tax cuts, etc.), but more often than that, other world issues influence the economy much more (Cold War, oil crisis, Dustbowl, etc.). The Dems passed Obamacare, but the plan that exists isn't the single payer plan that they wanted. They got this plan by compromising with Republicans. So one party wants universal free (at point of purchase) healthcare and one party wants everybody to just save and pay on their own. Which party favors the poor in that case? The fact that the ultimate bill ended up watered down is because there are still too many conservatives in office. Not because the Dems are in bed with corporations. 		I don't really think you understand democracy and how laws are passed in this country. Maybe you have a king where you're from or a parliament that works a lot different than our legislature. Controlling the White House and having a majority in Congress still doesn't give you full reign on lawmaking in this country. You still have to get some conservatives to agree or they'll just filibuster everything. And even if you do pass everything you want, it doesn't always take effect immediately. On top of that, some governors choose not to adopt or enforce federal laws. Like Obamacare passed, but not every state has allowed it. Your narrow way of looking at that says that Obama was in the White House and he didn't get everybody on healthcare. But you're overlooking the fact that a bunch of Republican governors blocked the law, so a lot of people were left out. 		The same was true with civil rights laws. The liberal federal government passed the civil rights bill in 1963 and it took some southern states until the 1980s to fully accept it. 		The minimum wage is another issue. That directly affects the poor like no other single issue can. Democrats want it to be $10.10, Republicans think minimum wage in general is a bad idea and employers should be able to pay people $1 an hour if that's what they want. So the fact that the minimum wage is still $7.25 isn't because that's the Dem agenda. It's because the GOP is holding back the increase. 		So to the extent that we haven't eradicated poverty in this country, it's because the GOP doesn't support social welfare policies whatsoever.

I think there are thousands of factors beyond a president's control that drive economies up and down, and especially the American economy which is the most diverse and dynamic on the planet. 		That said, I do think that Republicans consistently make *bad* presidents, namely because of their economic policy. All of the stock market crashes were under GOP presidents.

I showed you a graph that shows some ups and downs over time. Neither tells the whole story, and neither is proof of much of anything. 		So statistically, nationally, you're ultimately correct that voting D or R doesn't make much of a difference. But it can make *all* the difference depending on your economic situation. If you make minimum wage, one party wants you to get a raise and one doesn't. All of the states that raised their minimum wage have seen economic growth. But the states that don't raise minimum wage drive down the country's average. This is why the diversity of America gets drowned out on the national level.

No. First, things have not gotten worse for the poor. They have gotten drastically better for the poor after the New Deal and marginally better since then. Second, yes neither party has absolute power to do what it wants.

Dem idea all the way, fought all the way by the GOP. Most poor people are on Medicaid because they can't afford to pay directly for healthcare. You seem to be arguing that because Medicaid hasn't lifted everyone out of poverty that it's bad policy or that Dems aren't actually trying to help the poor. That's intellectually dishonest.

No dude. If you add up all the local levels, that is the national level. I'm saying if you elect a Dem in one city and a Repub in the next, they may negate each other.

It depends if those people are poor or not. And I don't see how a soldier is somehow better off with a neocon in office. Oil workers should vote GOP. But the rest of us should vote against oil workers for the same reason we should have voted against blacksmiths when cars were invented.

{"body":"First of all, it is critically important to understand that the word "corporation" hides the truth a bit ... in today's corporate world, each corporation is completely controlled by ONE HUMAN BEING ... the S&P500 constitutes approx 85-90% of corporate wealth - all controlled by a mere 500 individuals. So when you talk about an "industry" (auto industry; insurance industry; etc) you aren't talking about hundreds of thousands of people - you are talking about 3 people (for the auto industry) and maybe 10 people for the insurance industry.		The 500 CEOs of the S&P500 represent the power and wealth of this country. It is a joke to think that the Democrats are saviors because, the truth is, that the 500 CEOs control who is nominated for elections in the first place. They also control what legislation is passed. Study after study shows that legislation is controlled exclusively by corporate america and that the 99% can protest all they want - at the end of the day their voices are just sounds drifting off on the winds of the day. 		Sorry for the rant. But the subject is a dire one. To think we live in a democracy is to totally misunderstand what democracy is all about. This country is controlled completely by a very small number of people and YOU have no say about anything (just the mirage that you do). Nobody gets elected to Congress without the 1% putting in the money to elect them (and by elect, we know that means "control").

Unions can negotiate if they want, but when they try to pass laws interfering with that negotiation, I'm against them. The minimum wage should be $0. If people want to work for any price, it's no third party's place to interfere.

Buy all the contraception you want, but don't make anyone countenance it.		> One party wants immigration reform and the other doesn't.		Both parties want immigration reform. Just in different directions. One wants to reward illegal aliens; the other wants to punish them.

We can also pay down the debt by reducing transfer payments and entitlements. But the other party refuses to do so. Hell, I'd be fine with higher taxes for debt reduction iff we cut spending. Then once the debt's down, we can talk about reversing that.		> One party attempted to keep America from the joining the ranks of every other 1st world nation in having universal healthcare coverage for it's citizens, the other one enacted and defended that.

The opposition is unprincipled when it begins the day after the President is inaugurated as a political strategy to keep the GOP base frothing and it is the basis to reject *every idea* even those that aren't controversial and that you typically espouse.		It's unprincipled when the ACA *is* in fact the republican healthcare plan first concocted by the Heritage Foundation and first implemented by a republican in a democratic state and where many of the chief architects of said republican plan are the same as that ones that did it in Mass.  and the GOP oppose it simply because the democrats did it.		It's unprincipled when the GOP obstruct everything out of power but don't stop the politics when they get in power and begin hurting their own constituents and the country (900 k jobs at least and as many as 3 million, a much stronger recovery than what we're having with *that being the point*).  Their desire to win the white house was clearly more important to them than governing for the country's success and it's obvious.		What I find equally unprincipled is the voter ID early voting restrictions the GOP run states are putting in place to keep folk who oppose them from voting.		> Like, seriously.

When you make money, you spend it circulating it right back into the market place buying the the things you want and need.  Middle classers are not the one's hoarding massive sums of money out of the marketplace in off shore accounts so they don't have to pay taxes or living off of others,  Most everything we get, we spend.  A middle class is the bulwark of a country because we have just a little bit more than we need, we're dependable, we take on debt but can repay, we take vacations, we buy homes, we buy cars, we shop at malls, etc..

"We have two ruling party identities in America (Democrat & Republican), and because they take turns ruling; they seem to have situational identities: the Yea Party and the Nay Party. The Yea Party supporters condone the actions of the government while their party rules, whereas the Nay Party abhors the actions of government; that is, until they take the form of the Yea Party once more. This renders prospective and retrospective analysis and the intent behind progressive and retrogressive voting, almost completely ineffectual; especially when it comes to actually solving problems that we as a nation consider to be objectively present.		For example, the Yea and Nay parties both know that poverty is a problem, but it never gets solved because one always tries to subtract from what the other adds 	Nay Party	, or uses its majority status to bar the other from attempting to take any relevant political action whatsoever (i.e. disregarding externally formed proposals) 	Yea Party	. So, what does this mean for the citizen who would like her/his prospectively formed vote to matter when everything that requires a vote is subject to being ravenously picked apart or arbitrarily ignored? It means that in order to be prudent, citizens will need to find other ways of affecting the decision making process of the body politic, which includes but is not limited to, supporting **3rd party candidates**."		>Do you still think your understanding of how this all works is so vastly superior to mine		I don't think that your understanding is inferior, but I do find it incomplete and inconsistent. If you know that both parties are corrupt/negligent/incompetent, then why in the world would you seek to support one over the other? You are acting like we can just tell one (but apparently not the other) to finally start acting on behalf of the citizenry. It ain't gonna happen like that. There are other ways, like promoting a 3rd party candidate. The fact that Ron Paul (who assumed he'd only get enough exposure/votes by using his status as a member of the GOP, an established party) ever stood a chance when he ran for president indicates that, yes, it is very possible to have our votes count outside of the red/blue binary shit.

The dems should *not* be trusted, largely due to the fact that they are so adept at duping passionate rubes.

Business regulation is to keep the big guys in line and to reasonably protect citizens and should be smart & progressive (like taxes).  This is mostly the case which makes this argument a bit of a canard where once again the little guy ends up advocating for the rights of the big guy.  		For small business whole industries have sprung up to step into the gap to handle complex business regulation.

The CBO stated that its increase would [lift almost a million people out of poverty](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995).  That assessment took into account job losses caused by the increase. Since we're looking less and less like a country that supports unions, we need some way to get wages up in the country for low-skill necessary work.	 	> Plus, it has nothing to do with the ACA...		My post wasn't about the ACA and when I was talking about unprincipled opposition to the democrats, I wasn't only talking about the ACA.  		Opposition is by definition unprincipled when *every* possibility of progress from now on is held hostage to a strategy hatched literally the day after the other party's President is officially sworn into office.		Since 2010 the GOP has stood in the way of everything the President and the democrats wanted to do.  Most of it was non-controversial and helpful legislation to move the nation forward, personnel, paid for jobs bills, federal judges and other govt. personnel.  		Since then it's been unambiguously clear that for the GOP decisions are primarily about winning the next election not governing for the well being of the nation.  This desire for power at all cost is consistent with other trends we're seeing, the gerrymandering, the targeted voter ID, the voter suppression, etc...(the courts see it that way too).		This is not just another democratic talking point, it's the truth.  The fact that people get tired of the truth being true and discount it because they want to hear something new is just another flaw of human psychology.		> And yeah, hate on the GOP all you want, but it doesn't really help drive your point. This isn't an either or debate, so trying to paint them in a bad light (even if it's fitting) doesn't make the other party more attractive.		I drew my conclusions bases upon the analysis, the same way I'd solve a math problem.		However, when I make an evidence backed assertion that GOP obstruction [costs the economy 1 to 3 million jobs](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2hm1xo/in_37_days_the_house_of_representatives_is_up_for/ckun61o) folk who disagree seem incapable of seeing the 1 + 1 = 2 of it all.  		In 2014 the same dynamic/cause and effect is in place:  If we do what we did in 2010, we ("the people") will lose like we did in 2010. It's not even partisan really, it's just repeating the same costly mistake you *just* made.		> They both lead to the same kind of policy, they play the same parts that their opponents do when they have power.		Again that's **false**.  The GOP always want lower taxes AND at the same time are always in favor of policies that reduce worker pay.  This dynamic( low taxes and low wages ) and the subverting of the remaining tax dollars to corporate priorities vs citizen priorities *is* how the class war has been waged against the middle class.		If your wages are going to zero AND the commons you rely on are left under-prioritized/underfunded (education, roads bridges, infrastructure, health care, etc...), it's a massive quality of life squeeze.		**Exhibit A:** Our southern states exemplify the squeeze.  They've been run by the GOP forever and they function as defacto third world countries attracting business to them with their low wages and low tax policies and yet this is where poverty is the worst in our country and where the most takers are and where the worst school systems are.		**Exhibit B:** The nordic countries show a shiny example of just the opposite.  Relatively high wage earning, highly taxed, and highly educated, they are exemplifying best practices in free societies for all to see, but how they're doing it is ideologically unacceptable here in America.  		Unfortunately, ideology beats logic (think rock paper scissors).  I've become convinced that the future of humanity depends on us reversing that.		> The dems would have tried to play the "We the People disagree" card against the GOP if it had proposed the ACA themselves (probably by calling it oppressive, racial/gender biased or unfair to the poor).		No need to conjecture, the democrats hated medicare part D but for specific reasons that had nothing to do with playing a "We the People disagree" card:		* It privatizes a part of the social safety net uneccessarily ( a tried and true tactic of the GOP )		* It doesn't allow the govt as the largest purchaser of drugs to negotiate discounted prices so it's a huge waste of tax payer dollars		* It wasn't at all paid for(ten years of the program would contribute 600 billion dollars to our deficits)		Democrats opposed it, but it did provide some relief to seniors and there was the possibility to make it better through future legislation, so their opposition quickly passed and they got behind it when it became law		Medicare part d has been good for some seniors, but is in fact bad for all the reasons the democrats opposed it (and that damned doughnut hole that the ACA closed).		How does that compare with the way the GOP have behaved.  There is no contest here.		>  It just goes back and forth, each one playing their opposite roles as The Yea and Nay Parties.  I think this describes what i mean quite well.		Cute article, but I don't have a high opinion of ideological arguments.		**The ability of a man to look at factually presented evidence and reject/ignore it because it disagrees with the world he's constructed in his mind *IS* an existential threat to humanity.**		Our world views are selective forcefields seeking validation and repelling facts/truths that don't support them.  **We've got to let facts penetrate and shape our world views.**		> There are other ways, like promoting a 3rd party candidate.		If the libertarians would simply form a third party a lot of problems would be solved(by splitting the GOP), but neither Ron or Rand have the guts to do so. I tend to look for things that actually do or are working and I think the model the tea party has of primarying business as usual folk in their party and getting them elected is the way to go.  Unfortunately the democrats haven't done this and it is a problem. 		> Conversely, dems are still seeing a monochrome political landscape, and your post exemplifies this.

Why?!		What period are you talking about (better part of a decade)  If you're talking about the 6 years with Obama,  You're once again discounting all the obstruction as if it wasn't there (aka the democratic talking point that you're bored of hearing about) and you're *completely* discounting our activist pro-corporate supreme court that has moved the country effortlessly to the right with a few strokes of the pen.  It was their Citizens United ruling in Jan of 2010 that unleashed the floodgates of corporate money into our election just in time to fund the 2010 midterm democrat shellacking.		The legislation that got passed by democrats was done in a sh** storm and 2 years into his Presidency there was no chance that anything he did or didn't do was going to feel like good times.  The recession was too deep and it was too soon.  The impression of what was happening was completely shapeable and that was done with corporate money.		> Honestly, what viable candidates can dem voters support, in 2016 for example? Hillary?		No! the last thing the country needs is yet another corporatist, Warren if she runs, Bernie if he runs (I might consider it whether he runs independently or as a democrat), beyond that I don't know.  I think it's most important that from within that party a pure strain of populism challenges the coziness with corporate america.		> The goal is to fix government via electing the best representatives and watching them like hawks. The goal becomes harder to reach when the color of someone's tie matters more than what they've said and done.		Both parties have flaws.  Democrats do have the full range of views in their party but they're not organized as well as the republicans to weed out their corporatists business as usual folk in the primary process and clearly the kind of half measure we got with President Obama didn't inspire the support of his base or win that of his opposition.		By the same token I just don't see a path forward for the average american that runs through the republican party structurally speaking.  The low tax, low wage, low regulation positions are pretty standard republican fare that cut across all their political subdivisions they just aren't what the country needs right now.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrTreeopolis","name":"t1_clc8jq3","parent_id":"t1_clb9096","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413572351,"created_utc":1413568751}

That's like the A Streetcar named Desire way of governance. "Maybe the wealthy people will be benevolent and everything will turn out okay!"		This is *exactly* why we need regulations. 		Standard Oil did shady as shit things, and it's important to talk about scale and size in comparison to today, so let's do that really quick, because we can say 'Standard Oil was larger and had more of economic impact on daily life than any of today's corporations', but knowing the scale helps to grasp just how much of an impact they had. 		The GDP of the US in 1908 was 30.4 billion dollars. In 2009, the US GDP was 14 trillion dollars. Standard Oil was sued by the US government in 1908 (thanks to regulations put into place by Teddy Roosevelt.) so we have a rough, first hand estimate of their profits. According to that lawsuit, they made $838,783,800 (838 million)		Now, if we take that and divide it into the GDP of the US at the time, we come out to roughly every 2.5 cents of every dollar made in 1908 passed through Standard Oil's hands. Now that doesn't sound like a lot, so let's compare to today.		ExxonMobil made 45.2 billion dollars in 2009. That means they controlled 1/3rd of a penny of every dollar that was produced in the US, which means to compare them correctly, Standard Oil was 7 and a half times larger than our largest company in 2009. Think about that for a second to get a sense of scale. Exxon Mobil is a huge.. barely fathomable oil company. In 2009, it was the largest company in the world. Standard oil was more than 7 times the size of it during it's time as a percentage of the US GDP.		So what, you might say.. so freaking what. You might even be glad that we were capable of producing such a hugely successful company, but that all comes with a huge ass warning sign. 		Standard Oil's history of what it did with that world shaking power was detailed in Ida Tarbell's seminal 'History of the Standard Oil Company', and I encourage you to read it to understand what a corporation, unchecked by the government, is capable of doing. They bought out competitors. They bought out the means of production. They bought out everything, and they used that to set prices. And if you think regulations are regressive enough to stifle competition, imagine a world in which competition couldn't even exist, and that had nothing to do with the government. And I don't mean in a nansy pansy 'well, these laws make it hard for me to operate'. Standard Oil *would not allow* itself to have competition and had the ability, thanks to a lack of regulation, to do so, by strangling competitors before they could even be created.		And the result of this low regulation, early 20th century environment? Shitty as fuck working conditions. Frequent on the job deaths, lower quality of life, and a host of issues that took several decades to begin to get better. 		So when you say.. 'its not bad because he was rich' as if it the scale difference in comparison to today was trivial, I get depressed, because only here.. on the internet... can you so badly be ignorant of history and still think of yourself as informed or even correct on a topic of economic justice or fairness. 		We've lived through a period of time in our history where regulations were virtually nonexistent. They were the time where the gap between the wealthiest and the average person were far larger than they are today. We've been there, done that and got the T-shirt. People fought for and died for a fairer wage, and used the power of the ballot box to ensure it. 		Since the 70s, we've had an unraveling of those rights. The world's been deregulating since the 70s, and the wealth disparity has predictably (if you'd been paying attention to history) grown as a direct result.		The history is very clear, and yet we have ridiculous ideologues like **you** who think, despite the wealth of historical knowledge we have on the subject directly contradicting you, that it 'must be regulations' causing the problem.

So, the question is.. if you believe regulations are the biggest problem, or that they're cause enough to vote against Democrats, and for Republicans, then is it really a straw man for me to parse down and note historical examples of times in our history where we had very little regulation and the wage disparity and working conditions were the worst?		I don't want to be unfair, so I'm going to take a stance, and back it up, especially if I'm asking you to take a stance. 		I believe that the decline of unions or our privatized healthcare system (not sure which one, honestly) is the biggest cause of wage disparity in America. 		Companies choose to incorporate in Canada, or like Burger King, do a tax inversion to effectively incorporate in Canada, in order to gain access to Canadian Healthcare, despite Canadian taxes being rather high. This is a competitive advantage instituted by the nation of Canada, and it encourages businesses to incorporate there. 		Conversely, the decline of Unions in America has led to stagnant wages. Companies like Wal-mart are able to abuse employees unchecked due the systematic dismantling of unions through 'Right to Work' laws.		edit: I'll add another one:		**I trust the government more than I trust corporations because I can directly vote for the government, but a corporation's motivation is purely financial.**","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DoctorDiscourse","name":"t1_cl6w016","parent_id":"t1_cl6swac","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413072964,"created_utc":1413069364}

{"body":"> Let's see, Iraq, Syria, Guns to Mexico, data privacy.		Iraq/Syria - started by Bush/Cheney.  War is a fire.  If you start it there's no telling where it ends.  WWI started with tensions that go back hundreds of years but began technically with the [assasination of one VIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria).  In 2003 Bush/Cheney may have in fact started wwIII, *We don't yet know.*		This is why you don't start wars for no good reason and why Bush/Cheney may be two of the worst leaders in the history of this country.		Guns to Mexico (started by Bush and ended by Obama, case closed).		data privacy (started by Bush and continued by Obama)  this digital age does demand a different approach to information.  Groups of people in big cities do flash mob stuff with cell phones all the time.  It's hardly realistic for us to let a government be completely in the dark regarding plots that could be going on to destroy the country.  Would we not hold our leadership accountable for another coordinated attack because we didn't collect the info?  Get real.		> The budget surplus was due to two things, letting the Bush tax cuts expire, and sequestration. The second of which was a complete bungle on his part.		Yup there are actually four mistakes:		* not letting the tax cuts expire on time(Obama owns the additional debt in the hundreds of billions by leaving these in place)		* not letting them expire completely(it's a political pander, we needed the revenue and it would have cut the deficit much more sharply, at the expense of some slight growth)		* doing the sequester at all (because it's hurt our growth and many of our poorest citizens)		* voting for a GOP House in 2010 after only being two years removed from Bush/Cheney terribleness and with the ample evidence that the GOP weren't going to negotiate in good faith with democrats. (It's not quite the screw up of Bush/Cheney 1 and 2, but it's #3 in my op)		> Outside of the ACA name one major piece of legislation he has gotten passed?		Consumer protection board.  It's a step in keeping the wealthy elite from fleecing the average american at will and speaks directly to why the democrats are in fact with the people and the GOP are not.  The GOP opposed it's creation and then opposed strong leadership of it when it did get passed.		> As of today the President's disapproval rating is 57%. That's not Clinton territory, that's Bush territory.		Corporate media to the rescue!  Every bit of news that folk consume is filtered through our corporate owned media and you have a shaping of the truth and emphasis/de-emphasis that ALL hurt the President and the democrats.		The markets are doing better than ever but you wouldn't know it from how the news is reported.		There is a hysteria about the Ebola virus coming to America when one guy has died from it here and the CDC is all over it.  Meanwhile the ACA is literally improving the lives of millions of people and you don't hear a damned peep from the media.		There's all this ridiculous lies being peddled about sick children and Isl warriors coming over the southern border that are nothing but bs, but that represent the kind of inception of ideas that the right wing media and think tanks use to rile up their base and scare folk.		Gas prices down anybody but since no one talks about it, nobody cares.		Isl's existence is terrible and Obama's bears blame for some of it, but the psychological effects of the be headings of the two Americans (esp journalists) makes them out to be a much greater threat than they are in the eyes of Americans.  The corporate media plays up the threat and might actually be agitating us towards a ground war *because* it was two of their own.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrTreeopolis","name":"t1_cl883cn","parent_id":"t1_cl7eup5","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413214511,"created_utc":1413210911}

That's been going on since the 90s.  All conservatives call the media liberal and in the tank for democrats.  And yet they themselves have an array of hundreds of conservative talk show hosts who are telling it straight and their own "fair and balanced" news station.		> You get to 57% by pissing both sides of the aisle off.		Everything that goes right is because of something that someone else did and everything that goes wrong is Obama's fault.  The medias influence on us is far more powerful than most realize or admit and it's ALL corporate.		> There is hysteria because he should have stopped the flights out of Liberia to the US.		One person has died another is sick and some others are being observed.  The disease is not highly contagious versus millions getting timely effective health care guess who wins.  Sorry that's bs.	EDIT:  Also how is mobilizing 4k troops and 200 million dollars worth of materials to contain the outbreak at the source not leadership?

{"body":"Here's politics explained, in like 5 sentences: Everybody in politics works to serve their own best interests. As a voter, you should do this too. Anybody that is poor should never vote for the Republican Party. You are literally voting to put policies in place that disproportionately benefit a minority of society. Regardless of whether those policies are ideologically correct, it makes no sense for students like us to support them. It baffles me that the Republican Party can ever get an equal amount of votes, let alone a majority.	_______	Being a republican while you're poor is being ignorant. If you listen to a top democrat trying to convince young people to adopt liberal ideas, their reasons are authentic and they will be no better off if you accept them. However, if you listen to a Republican, they have a vested interest in you accepting their ideas. I respect wealthy conservatives, but I will never respect poor conservatives who would be better off voting liberal and then switching over when the policies of conservatism actually benefit them.	____	I really believe that something must be done to separate this debate about abortion from politics. It is incredibly toxic and firmly enforces partisan politics. While someones views may evolve on political or economic issues, someones view on abortion is derived from religion and will likely not change. I've heard many people say that they vote Republican solely because of their strong stance on abortion. That's ridiculous, and our country will not be able to move forward until religious issues like that are handled separately.

They simply don't support the policies the country needs right now even if the democrats haven't been stellar.		Regarding the inequality, it is true that things are more unequal than they were but the market is on a bubble.

This too is Obama's fault for not getting the fed under control, but just realize that the inequality is overstated because of this inflated market value.  I expect that minus this bubble, inequality might actually be down a bit because the top rates have gone back to pre-Bush tax cut levels.

Actually we have a really good idea of how much bang for our buck tax dollars inject into our economy depending on how they're spent.  Things like infrastructure spending and education are quite high on that list as is entitlements (because it gets spent and goes right back out into the economy).		The problem here is that the people don't have representation in Washington and so the folk we put in do other things with our tax dollars than what we want or expect like give them away to corporations and expend them on the military industrial complex and not on that infrastructure or education.		> Republicans want more money to be left in the economy, and the decisions about how to spend it made by individuals who have skin in the game and will suffer the consequences of a bad decision.		That experiment failed.  The tax cuts went mostly to the wealthy increasing their wealth but no benefits accrued to the average consumer.		> ...Not by government bureaucrats who get their big salaries and fat pensions no matter how much they waste, or how many times they screw up. 		We keep making the mistake of putting people in govt who don't really believe in government.  They're the one's who screw it up and then say "see, see! Govt sucks!!"		Look no further than Bush/Cheney who created $500 billion in average deficits essentially because they could.  They *didn't even try* to pay for their wars or cut programs to offset their tax cuts or negotiate with those Medicare part d prescription drug providers.   		Same with the GOP after 2010.

The wealth accumulation thing is a good point.  We aren't going to save our way out of a financial slump.  But deficits aren't necessarily a bad thing.  That's how governments usually operate.  		>One party supports unions, raising the minimum wage, and wage equality for women the other doesn't		After living in NYC for a while, I strongly prefer non-unionized labor in a majority of circumstances.  Unions simply end up getting too much power over workers, replacing the corporation.  ConEd can't even roll wire to your home from the street because of union regulations saying someone else has to.  		Raising the minimum wage will, in the long run, simply increase the cost of living even more.  Should we, for short term benefits?  Yeah.  Is it an end-all solution?  No.  		Wage equality for women has been law since 1963.  Today, a gender gap exists overall, but disappears when experience, career, and hours worked are taken into account.  So women are paid equally for equal work, they simply do not (for whatever reason) work equally.		>One party supports the right for women to family plan and the other doesn't		One party supports the idea that taxpayers should pay for someone else's family planning.  That's wrong.  The other party supports the idea that family planning shouldn't be a thing, which is also wrong.  There's no good answer here.		>One party wants immigration reform and the other doesn't		This was already explained to be wrong in another comment.  I'd very much like a competitive advantage to go toward current citizens.  It's in my self-interest.  It's in all US citizens' self-interest.  It's basic job security.  If an immigrant is really impressive, then sure, let them in, but we should really be picking and choosing.		>One party refuses to raise taxes to pay down our 17 trillion in debt and blocks every attempt to do so		Why would I want more taxes, simply to pay down a debt that will forever be refinanciable?

I've read the book, I've read about specific things the business has done all through the 80s through today.  Americans, esp the poor were sleeping in their beds and the rules were changed on them that they knew nothing about and they were fleeced by those who made the new rules.		After the supreme courts allowed federal banks to [ignore usury laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Nat._Bank_of_Minneapolis_v._First_of_Omaha_Service_Corp.) that capped interest rates within the states in 1978, Providian pioneered the 0% interest model that starts users off with 0% interest and hooks them into credit card debt which ballooned up to as high as 28 or 30% after 6 months or a year.		They targeted the poor with their strategy a group they didn't previously extend credit to because the risk was so bad with them that they couldn't justify offering them credit at the state capped rate.		In an interview, the CEO of this company admitted they didn't want the poor folk they hooked into the cc debt to pay it off as it provided them 75% of their profit.  Banks have fought in congress to make sure nothing is done to fix this and have successfully defended consumer/citizen/society minded types against any measure to do so.  Later when folk started using bankruptcy protection to shield themselves from being enslaved to debtors the banking industry made that harder to via their lobby.		It wasn't until 2009 that banks have had any obligation to even inform users of how long it would take to pay off loans making the minimum rates that are typically done by poor folk way in over their heads.  		Many say "hey that's capitalism" people are free to be stupid... whatever, but the practical impact of this is the impoverishment of the people.

If you look at voting a bit more cynically, you will have more power.	In a standard American election, only two candidates have a chance of winning. In the general election, voting for the least bad mainstream candidate is provably better than voting for a fringy 3rd party candidate that you love. Think of the choice faced by Green Party voters in 2000. Naively, it was a choice between Gore and Nader. In reality, voting for Nader instead of Gore was the equivalent of 1/2 a vote for Bush II.	But what if you hate all the available candidates? Vote in the party primaries. If you hate the candidates, you need to vote in the elections that choose the candidates. Primary elections are where American political parties build coalitions (as opposed to parliamentary systems where coalitions are built in smoke-filled rooms after the election).

I wrote this the way I did because of these observations:		I read the book I've been referencing "Who Stole the American Dream" and it was a kind of tour de force of not just what has happened (Corporate take over of our Govt and an undermining of our middle class) but a blow by blow of how the takeover was executed with specific events, pivotal pieces of legislation passed, court battles won or lost, impact on unions, jobs, distribution of wealth, etc...  and I realized that most Americans don't really get how very orchestrated it has been and how completely over it actually all is.  Corporate America has won decisively through lobbying both parties and focusing on it's objective which is it's own dominance.		Dems over republicans...		I don't see a way back to a Pro-citizen govt through the GOP.

While 3rd parties are nice, they haven't really had much impact except to throw at least one important election for the democrats BUT what has worked recently for the Republicans has been movements within their party that have separated their chaffe from their wheat.  The democrats could use some of that leading up to 2016.		Since split govt has sucked since 2010, going with one party or the other would be preferable and the dems have it(until the other party learns that obstruction will not be tolerated)  They just need a platform within their platform to excite the base and screen for candidates that are pro-citizen 1st.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrTreeopolis","name":"t1_cl8ni8w","parent_id":"t1_cl8i5b6","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413245415,"created_utc":1413241815}

And this stuff happens when a lobbyist for the telecom industry is appointed head of FCC, and you get the green light for "fast lanes" on the Internet.  AT&T, broken up in the 70's is completely back together.  The banks get a free ride, while NY contemplates a "Bit Licence" for Bitcoin that is way more strict than the banks have to deal with.		The most regulated businesses in the world are in socialist states.  Central planning and rules is as bad as an abusive monopoly, only covering the entire economy.		I would settle for scaling back the wars, closing the Fed, stopping the drug war, restoring rights and liberties, and ending corporate welfare.  While the Republicans want to spend and cut taxes, the Libertarian wing is much more interested in serious cuts in war and corporate welfare than tax cuts.

I don't buy this.  The Federal Reserve HANDS free money to banks.  And we are supposed to get benefits from some kind of trickle down effect that simply doesn't exist under any economic model.  Nobody thinks giving banks more money is going to raise wages or give money to the poor.  Yet the Democrats are some of the biggest supporters of this scam.

Secession is now a dead subject since the Civil War, and government is increasingly federal rather than state or city level.

Why should New York residents have to abide by the laws desired by those in Texas, and vice versa? Some cities alone have 2x as many people as existed in the entire 13 colonies in 1776. It's absurd that so many people are constrained by increasingly federal-level decisions.		Governments are created to protect private property, it doesn't create anything. This is the lesson of the USSR. They were pouring money into the space race, while people were starving within a few miles. The USA had a more free market (smaller government) so it had a level of prosperity that could support space exploration that didn't retard the development of the market *as much*. USA won the space race because our government was smaller. Singapore and Hong Kong have thriving economies precisely because they have very limited govt regulations there.

That my friend is the story of the conservative era.  I'm cutting a pasting a specific example of this that happened back in 1978 from another conversation I had (then I gotta go do my thing). 		"After the supreme courts allowed federal banks to [ignore usury laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Nat._Bank_of_Minneapolis_v._First_of_Omaha_Service_Corp.) that capped interest rates within the states in 1978, Providian pioneered the 0% interest model that starts users off with 0% interest and hooks them into credit card debt which ballooned up to as high as 28 or 30% after 6 months or a year.		They targeted the poor with their strategy a group they didn't previously extend credit to because the risk was so bad with them that they couldn't justify offering them credit at the state capped rate.		In an interview, the CEO of this company admitted they didn't want the poor folk they hooked into the cc debt to pay it off as it provided them 75% of their profit.  Banks have fought in congress to make sure nothing is done to fix this and have successfully defended consumer/citizen/society minded types against any measure to do so.  Later when folk started using bankruptcy protection to shield themselves from being enslaved to debtors the banking industry made that harder to via their lobby.		It wasn't until 2009 that banks have had any obligation to even inform users of how long it would take to pay off loans making the minimum rates that are typically done by poor folk way in over their heads.  		Many say "hey that's capitalism" people are free to be stupid... whatever, but the practical impact of this is the impoverishment of the people.  This and a thousand other examples like it are what separate the quality of life here versus in another place where the politicians are pro-citizen **FIRST** and not pro-business first."","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrTreeopolis","name":"t1_cl94pkb","parent_id":"t1_cl948wo","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413297890,"created_utc":1413294290}

Especially when the people voting for politicians are as batshit nuts as the OP. 		We have lower taxes on capital because it doesn't make sense to highly tax it: capital fuels the "real" economy globally and higher taxes would discourage the investments made. Governments like our own, emerging economies and businesses need people to buy bonds and other financial instruments to raise money for spending. Increasing the taxes increases capital mobility as well - those people can choose to leave the US if they want to face a lower tax rate and retain more net income. Sooner or later, that will start to happen just like how it has happened with corporations if we listen to idiots who want to tax everything away. 		But that is a separate issue from corporate taxes which should be low as well as simplified and which should only tax income made in the US. People want jobs so why impose heavy taxes on the corporations which create jobs? People call for the government to subsidize job creation but that's pretty much the exact same thing as cutting the tax rate except resources will be allocated to sectors differently (might be more efficient but probably won't be). 		We have a problem with the tax on labor's share of income, more that we shouldn't be fully taxing both sides of income - consumption and savings. People need savings - savings which they don't have to cover unexpected payments, we shouldn't be taxing that. Banks have to rely on riskier wholesale funding too because they don't get enough deposits consistently to operate.

You only want to vote for someone that you genuinely approve of. Doing this limits the influence you can have over your government. There are approval-based voting systems, but the system used in the USA is not an approval system. Acting as if we did use an approval-based system is a bit foolish. If you look at voting a bit more cynically, you will have more power. In a standard American election, only two candidates have a chance of winning. In the general election, voting for the least bad mainstream candidate is provably better than voting for a fringy 3rd party candidate that you love. Think of the choice faced by Green Party voters in 2000. Naively, it was a choice between Gore and Nader. In reality, voting for Nader instead of Gore was the equivalent of 1/2 a vote for Bush II. But what if you hate all the available candidates? Vote in the party primaries. If you hate the candidates, you need to vote in the elections that choose the candidates. Primary elections are where American political parties build coalitions (as opposed to parliamentary systems where coalitions are built in smoke-filled rooms after the election). If you want an issue to be included in a party platform, choose the party most likely to be receptive to it and push that issue there.

That's true.  But the Democratic Party has been suckered into this idea that the Fed can insure "Full Employment" via inflation.  For example, [Paul Krugman says](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/opinion/holding-china-to-account.html?_r=0): 		> *The United States, given its special global role, can???t and shouldn???t be equally aggressive. But given our economy???s desperate need for more jobs, a weaker dollar is very much in our national interest ??? and we can and should take action against countries that are keeping their currencies undervalued, and thereby standing in the way of a much-needed decline in our trade deficit.*		The dynamic he is looking for with a "weak dollar" (i.e. higher prices) is that this reduces the cost of labor.  Inflation lowers prices through the [Money Illusion](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money_illusion.asp)		> *This term is attributed to noted economist John Maynard Keynes. Money illusion is often cited as a reason why small levels of inflation (1-2% per year) are actually desirable for an economy. Having small levels of inflation allows employers, for example, to modestly raise wages in nominal terms without actually paying more in real terms. As a result, many people who get pay raises believe that their wealth is increasing, regardless of the actual rate of inflation.*		Note that this is all Keynesian Economics.  And lower wages IS the root of the income gap.		> What the fed is doing is affecting the dollars purchasing power everywhere needs to be addressed. The libertarians have a lot of good things going on in my opinion.		They do on the drug war, on the fed, on ending wars, and not starting wars.  I'm not quite on board with killing all government programs.  But it is true that if labor had the same share of GDP in 2014 as we had in 1950, we wouldn't need many government programs.

No, I think you're missing it here, I don't think this was about inflation as much as it was about our trade deficit.

That is the theory, but it isn't true.  Because companies can raise prices and lower costs with technology without a proportional raise in prices.		Without productivity increases, maybe it would be a wash.  But with the enormous corporate profits, lower percentage of GDP for labor, growing share of GDP for banks, it is clear that the rising wages of workers isn't keeping up with the *real* damage to the dollar's value.		Baumol's cost disease is an eye opener...			>> But the Democratic Party has been suckered into this idea that the Fed can insure "Full Employment" via inflation.		>I am with this argument.

Krugman is upset because China sets the exchange rate for the Yuan.  It isn't a market that sets the price.  We, being righteous,  manipulate the market for dollars to set the price.

But that's because Krugman has been hugely wrong on some key things like the internet, Bitcoin, technology, inflation, etc.  Not everything, but quite a bit.		>> The dynamic he is looking for with a "weak dollar" (i.e. higher prices) is that this reduces the cost of labor.		>No, I think you're missing it here, I don't think this was about inflation as much as it was about our trade deficit. Once again *we're in the system.*  We receive and purchase in dollars, so it's a wash,  But it will make our exports more attractive to foreign investors. 		But we import quite a bit.  Those prices go up.  What makes the higher priced goods made at home attractive to the home market is that the formerly cheaper imported goods become more expensive.  We might be paid in dollars, but foreign goods are priced via exchange rates.		So it isn't a wash.  And inflation is the tool used  to adjust down wages that are too high.  Krugman says this directly when discussing Spain's situation with the Euro and not having a central bank.  See his book "End this Depression Now"			>> They do on the drug war, on the fed, on ending wars, and not starting wars.		>You got it on ALL of that.

Well, at this point we have huge regulatory capture... Which is often worse than no regulation...

{"body":"No.		We are in a class war, which means we need to understand "class". Class isn't a group of businesses, or even rich people; class is defined by social relationships to material surroundings. We live in a system divided now into two classes: those who own the machines and institutions that run the economy, producing goods and services, i.e. capital, and those who do not. Ownership is the distinctive social relationship which defines one's class. 		Those who own capital, or "capitalists", use the machines of production and distribution as extensions of themselves through private property ownership and hence receive the surplus that these machines produce after human labour is put in. They may or may not be contributing to putting in this labour themselves, but that's besides the fact.		Those who do not own capital have no means of survival without selling their ability to operate these physical and social machines at a fraction of its value, the surplus being derived as profit for the capitalists. Through this process of "capitalism", the production and distribution systems become intensely socialised as the economy as a whole becomes unified with all products being the result of a greater and greater amount of people working together. 		The contradiction between the interests of capitalists and workers is based on differences in property relationships to the means with which work is done and is the source of all political conflict.

{"body":"Rich people are going to use their money to assist them in bettering themselves.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Self interest is something we all take part in regardless of income.  		Politicians shouldn't be taking that money.  Period.  It ends up putting them in a position where they are forced to push policy that is favorable to those who invested in that politician.  		They have no reason to create or push policies that are favorable to the middle-class or lower class since they don't matter from a political perspective. 		People talk about "get out and vote!", "make sure to vote and get your voice heard!", or "rock the vote!" type nonsense when none of the votes actually matter.		It doesn't matter who gets the vote since none of the candidates are going to do anything that would jeopardize their chances of re-election.  Guess what doesn't jeopardize their chances of getting re-elected?  Pissing off the common folk.		As long as the big spenders are still willing to spend their money when it comes to election time the same people are going to get re-elected.  Name recognition is everything, and actual policy means fuck all.		The issue that gets run into though is how to deal with this.  If a politician decides not to take corporate money then they are much less likely to actually win even though they are being significantly more honest with their personal policy.		I know most people are thinking "why don't they take the corporate money to get elected, but then push policy that is to the benefit of middle and lower classes?"		In that scenario they'd be one voice of reason in  a sea of absurdity.  One person simply can't have the impact necessary to actually force change.  You also have the issue of a soft term limit.  While the politician *can* technically run for re-election, no major backer is going to put their money behind that campaign again since it's clearly not a good investment, and without the huge monetary backing their chances of winning re-election are nearly non-existent.  		This isn't a GOP vs DEM issue.  Neither party wants what's best for the non-wealthy people of America.  		If you think for one second that voting in a democrat majority will change anything about the system you're just as delusional as the people on FOX news who spout off about Obamacare death panels.		The reason social and economic changes haven't taken place isn't because of congressional gridlock as most people like to believe.  "OH NO TEH REPOOBLEECANS IS MEENIES AND SAY NO ALL TEH TIMES!!"		It's because social and economic polices are never spoken about or pushed until election years come up.  Until then everyone is content just fucking ignoring the rest of the people, and focusing solely on how they can best represent those who put truckloads of money into their campaign.		They present policies they know the American people would like, and then cry about the other party not letting those policies through.  Both parties do this.  Not just the GOP.  They all know these policies will never see the light of day, but they do it so they can at least say they tried, and trying makes people more likely to vote them back in even though they didn't actually do anything.		The big reason minimum wage increases are even on the table right now is because the GOP is calling the liberal's bluff.  It's right before an election (hey hey go fucking figure), and liberals are trying to get that good ol' workin people vote.  Increasing the minimum wage is a good way to do that.  The problem is an increase in the minimum wage means a decrease in the super wealthy's wealthiness, which could in turn come back to bite them in the ass when they need to run hundreds of ads per hour on TV to get the word out about how they tried to help the lower class with minimum wage increases but those mean republicans stopped it from going through.		So what do the republicans do.  They're allowing talks to go through.  Discussions are being had, and people are taking notice.  The difference is liberals are doing it under the assumption that it would get shot down, and they could cry about how mean the GOP is, and the GOP is doing it to hurt liberals where it hurts the most.  In the rich peoples pocket books.  		If you think for one second that your vote matters one single bit you're delusional.  Change will happen.  It won't happen how you want it too (see above), but it will happen.  If you want to vote to make yourself feel better go for it, but if you want to send a real message you should be telling everyone to stay the fuck home.  Having nearly no one show up to vote sends a much stronger message then a bunch of people coming out to vote.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gulmari","name":"t1_cl6rzaz","parent_id":"t3_2iy74u","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1413063598,"created_utc":1413059998}
