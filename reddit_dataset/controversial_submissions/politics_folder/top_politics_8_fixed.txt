{"body":"In theory, Kansas *could* tax you, it would just cost them far more to track every single person doing some level of business in their (or any) state than it would make them.		If I remember correctly, the "jock tax" originated in California, when the state taxed the Chicago Bulls players coming to LA to play the Lakers in the 1991 finals.  These days, almost every state has some form of jock tax.  It's very easy for a state to calculate how much a player owes, as their salaries and schedules are public knowledge.  I suppose you could argue that it levels the playing field (heh?) between states that have different levels of income tax (and even teams in Canada).

{"body":"You don't know anything about income taxes		Edit: So I guess none of you liked my short "rebuttal" so I'll go into it because I got some time.		Double taxation occurs when income gets taxed twice whenever the income is received by a new party.		This means the income gets taxed when it is received by the corporate tax entity and then taxed again when it is paid out to some other entity.  Usually what is taxed comes in the form of dividends, salaries, etc. however due to accounting regulations set forth by GAAP and IFRS, double taxation does not occur in these particular examples.  Dividends are only taxable for the entity receiving it -- the paying entity does not pay taxes on dividends but rather deducts it from the owners equity portion of the corporate balance sheet.  Also, salaries are only taxed once by the receiving entity -- the person receiving the money -- minus the payroll taxes owed, in part, by the corporations.		Okay, motherfuckers, do you understand what double taxation is?  Let's now use this concept in practice.		From what I understand, The National Football League office is the one not being taxed.  I wasn't able to find out its exact corporate status (S-corp, 501(c)3, LLC., etc.).  But for the sake of argument lets assume its an LLC, implied by the "flow-through" tax structure they have where the *teams* pay taxes and the league does not.		By doing this, The NFL League office is able to pay "no taxes" and transfer its tax liability to the receiving entity.  This means the money they receive isn't taxed until it is paid out *to someone else* wherein *they* pay the taxes.		If the NFL League Office wants to pay out the teams so the teams pay taxes, this creates a problem.  Why?  Well lets look at our corporate tax structure.  Of course, we all realize its a sliding scale.  What does this mean?  The more money you make, the more money you pay *as a percentage of income*.  When you take that large amount and divvy it up to 32 different teams and expect *them* to pay the taxes on it while you collect income tax-free until it is spent, this creates problems.		The end result is that we, as a country, receive less tax revenue while the NFL is able to hold mass reserves and won't get taxed until it is spent.  And when it is spent, they will not be the ones handling the tax liability.		What I propose, is that we re-instate the NFL as a regular C-corp.  This way, they will still be able to write off the money they send over to the teams as a part of operating expense or however they do it and still get taxed on the money they make that *isn't* spent.  This creates a higher rate of tax revenue for the country and allows the NFL to sell stock.  That way, the teams aren't the only ones publicly owned anymore and the NFL now has to take into account the benefit of the stockholders, rather than just a small group of private owners.		The matter is still far more complex than this when we break down the entire issue and I'm not going to sit here and type out/research the issue over the fact that I'm peeved at 3 downvotes.  But if I can clear up the spew of bullshit everyone here is making up because they think they know stuff about taxation/double taxation, than thats all the better.","depth":6,"score":30,"ups":30,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ILoveMyselfSometimes","name":"t1_ckob5m3","parent_id":"t1_ckoajho","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1411300758,"created_utc":1411297158}

{"body":"Double taxation occurs when the same income is taxed multiple times. The type of double taxation to which we are referring has nothing to do with the notion that the corporation is taxed on the transaction of paying dividends. Double taxation occurs on dividends because (1) those dividends are derived from profits earned by the corporation that are taxed as corporate income and, (2) upon distribution, those dividends are taxed as the dividend income of their recipient. The balance sheet accounting for those dividends is totally irrelevant. To reiterate, no one is arguing that there is some specific tax levied on the corporation for distributing dividends. The point is that the income that constitutes those dividends has been taxed as part of the profits of the corporation.			You're correct that salaries are not the subject of double taxation but you, again, make the mistake of assuming that this is because there is no tax levied on the corporation for paying that salary (which is actually false because of the payroll tax). The reason salaries aren't considered to be the subject of double taxation is because those salaries are an expense which is deducted from revenue in the determination of the taxable income of the corporation -- which isn't the case for dividend distributions. Thus, the income from which those salaries are derived was not taxed at the corporate level. 			EDIT: I would add that your point about the flow-through structure of the league is irrelevant to the non-profit status of the league. Even if the NFL were stripped of its non-profit status, it would still be easily structured such that its revenues were taxed at the team level upon distribution. That is what creates the disparity between the tax that would be paid if the NFL's shared income was taxed at the league level and the income being taxed at the team level. Removing the NFL's non-profit status would open its undistributed profits to taxation. How much is at stake? [About $3M in lost tax receipts](http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/13-1922622/national-football-league.aspx). This is hardly the massive fleecing of the country that it is often presented as.		Your points about converting the NFL into a C corporation and the issuance of publicly owned stock are nonsensical. Let's assume that the government could legally compel such a conversion.

{"body":"GAAP and IFRS doesn't give two shits about double taxation... Don't know why you even mentioned them.  The primary time that double taxation occurs, is when a C-corp pays dividends.  The reason that the dividends are considered "double taxed", is because dividends are not an expense on the corporation's books.  		If a corporation earns $100k, and pays $100k in dividends, then the corp pays taxes on the $100k profits, and the shareholder pays taxes on $100k dividends.  On the other hand, if the corp payed 100k in salaries, then the corp would pay $0 taxes, and the employee would pay taxes on the $100k.  		Let's take a look at the NFL's form 990, which is public information:	http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/131/131922622/131922622_201303_990O.pdf	In 2013, the NFL had income of about $9 million.  However, last year they had a $78 million loss.  They also have more liabilities than assets, giving them negative equity.  If they were a corporation, they would likely pay no income taxes this year due to operating loss carryovers from the prior year.		My opinion, the NFL is fine as as a not-for-profit.  They paid over $100 million in wages, which is fully taxed.  The individual team entities pay plenty in taxes.

I'm a little bit rusty on U.S. tax law, but if my memory serves me correctly, for taxation purposes the IRS views subsidiary companies as being consolidated with the parent company.		What that means is that if a corporation has 80% (or more) ownership of a second corporation and makes a payment to said second corporation, the payment is treated as if it didn't actually happen for taxation purposes (until it exits the company or the country).		>If so, what makes that situation different from a potentially no-longer non-profit NFL, except perhaps, in amount of money transferred?

{"body":"I don't know much about the situation but this seems... off to me.		>taxing the league itself and then taxing the teams would be double taxation.		The argument seems to be that the various teams, players, and other individuals working under the umbrella of the NFL pay taxes, so the NFL shouldn't because that would be double taxation.		But every corporation works that way. Coca Cola, the umbrella corporation, pays taxes. So do the various organizations beneath it. So does every single person working there. (at least in theory, in practice that's another thing.) If Coca Cola was "non profit" and all of the subsidiaries beneath it paid taxes but the major brand did not then that wouldn't be right either.		To go farther: Everyone along the line is taxed. The company that harvests the corn, the company that makes the corn into high fructose corn syrup, the company that ships the ingredients to each factory, the company that actually makes the ingredients, the company that ships the product to stores, and every store that sells the coca cola. 		That isn't to say that the NFL makes money. If it actually doesn't show a profit at the end of the year then that is exactly what the non-profit status is for.

Or to put it another way, in 10 years they would be able to pay for less than an hour of interest accumulation.		I'm not saying it is right to have them be nonprofit, but compared to trillions spent on war/healthcare/defense, this is literally not worth the time it would take to accomplish. Even compared to closing actual corporate tax loopholes (overseas accounts, etc), the NFL is an infinitesimally small problem.		3) If their nonprofit status ended, do you honestly think they'd just start paying the taxes? You don't think that an organization of lawyers and businessmen would find some way to spend/defer/"donate"/"lose" that amount?		tl;dr It is a fine idea but not a matter of practical importance.

{"body":"People are asking what's the difference between having a profit vs not-for-profit designation.	The simple response, already stated, is as follows: 		A not-for-profit organization explicitly implies that all of its net-income (income after expenses) will be put toward covering future expenses, as opposed to for-profit/regular corporations which will return unused gains to the owners. In exchange, the not-for-profit company does not pay any taxes on it net-income.		A hypothetical example might be of some help:		Imagine a company with a single expense, the expense being the salary of a single employee, the CEO.		NPO:		Let's look at some numbers of the not for profit version of this company (all numbers in thousands of dollars unless otherwise stated):		Not-For-Profit co:		Total Income (Revenue) ......................... 10,000		Total Expenses (CEO's Salary) .................. 3,000		Income After Expenses ............................ 7,000		Income Reserved for Ongoing Operations ... 7,000		As we see in the above example, the not-for-profit company makes $10,000,000 in revenue and pays out $3,000,000 to the CEO (the only expense). The CEO then pays income taxes on the $3,000,000. With an income tax rate of 35% and assuming no deductions, the CEO would pay approximately $1,150,000 in taxes.		The not-for-profit version of the company may or may not have owners. In any case, any initial investors cannot and do not expect to receive any return on their initial investment. This "not-for-profit" label means that the difference between total income and expense (now simply called "income above expenses") is NOT taxed.		For Profit:		Unlike the above example, the for-profit version of this company DOES have owners. These are people who have invested money in the company  and expect a return on this investment. The for-profit company pays its CEO on-average less than it makes in revenue (total income). The difference between what it pays its CEO (which equals total expenses in our hypothetical example) is called "net-income" or "profit". 		This profit is taxed at the country's current corporate tax rate. The money left over after taxes is called "after-tax profit" or "after-tax net-income".		With this in mind, here are some numbers (all numbers in thousands of dollars unless otherwise stated):		For-Profit co:		Total Income (Revenue) .................................. 10,000		Total Expenses (CEO Salary) ............................. 3,000		Income After Expenses (Net Income) ................. 7,000		Income Tax Rate (20%) ................................... 1,400		Net Income After Taxes .................................... 5,600		Net Income Reserved for Ongoing Operations ...... 2,600		Income Returned to Owners .............................. 3,000		We see that both versions of the company make the same amount in revenue, and pay the same amount in expenses (CEO salary).		The for-profit version however, also pays taxes on net-income. Furthermore, the investors will pay additional taxes on the income the receive back from the company (listed as Income Returned to Owners). If the company chooses to return the income as dividends, then the investors (or owners/shareholders/whatever you call them) would pay the going dividend tax rate. In the US the current dividend tax rate is around 15% which is equal to $450,000 for our example (15% of $3,000,000).		Summary:		Notice that the not-for-profit company holds on to a significantly larger portion of its revenue. This money must legally be used toward future expenses and nothing more. However, if your future (or dare I say current) expenses consist entirely of a single person's salary, why not just cut to the chase and give all the money to him/her? 		In other words - having a not-for profit structure allows the company to provide a larger compensation to its employee(s)... hint: by employees, I mean the guy making $44 million in the real world.		In the end, the government makes the most tax revenue form... the not-for-profit because all income will eventually be taxed at the income-tax rate (in our hypothetical-one expense example).		When we look at the pros and cons of the profit/not-for-profit structures we can glean the following:		For profit:		Pros: 		1. Investors can invest in, and make money from the company.	2. A needed service is provided with money supplied by investors.	3. Government receives money from three sources (ordinary income tax via CEO salary, corporate income tax on the company's net income and dividend tax paid by investors receiving the dividends).		Not-for-profit:		Pros:		1. The company can hold on to more of its income since it doesn't have to pay taxes.	2. All of the money the company holds on to must be put toward future company use with no profit returned to any investors.	3. The tax revenue indirectly earned from the not-for-profit can often be greater than that earned from a for-profit company.		...		So, there you have it - a brief and overly simplified example. Hope it helps. Corrections and input are welcome.		tldr: Become a non-profit, and then you too can afford to pay yourself a higher salary.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"stevebrowntwon","name":"t1_cko9eu4","parent_id":"t3_2h05rb","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1411290572,"created_utc":1411286972}

{"body":"HOLY SHIT..THE NFL IS A NON-PROFIT IN THE US? This actually baffles my brain to the point of breaking it. Is the NHL considered a not-for-profit in Canada? Honest question because if it is...gross. No one in the United States should be paying money to subsidize any sport really. The US is the most sports-crazed non-Communist country on earth. There are very few (if any) top tier athletes ignored because of their financial standing or mental capacity. People who can barely read or do math participate in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL, no rule changes will ignore this or make it go away. If we want to change the way athletes/celebrities are compensated, we can't keep having a system where athletes and celebrities distract us from social problems. If their whole job is 'bread and circuses' then they do well and nothing more should be asked. Honestly, this thread is pointless. People who choose not to subsidize professional sports leagues like the NFL, NBA.NHL, and MLB, don't give a shit about the negative impacts their leagues and the attitudes the represent have on society. Like any other corporation the NFL will do the minimum to ensure it's athletes actions correspond to corporate policy. Beyond that domestic violence in the NFL does no more than provide an uncomfortable mirror for American culture particularly and western culture  in general.","depth":0,"score":-11,"ups":-11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chronicwisdom","name":"t1_cko8kxy","parent_id":"t3_2h05rb","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1411286573,"created_utc":1411282973}

Some parts of the NFL are the same way, for example, NFL Network isn't part of the NFL itself; it's a separate enterprise that licenses NFL property and is endorsed by the NFL. NFL Network is for-profit and they do make money and they're taxed as such.		But the league office itself that handles rules, schedules, training and injury specialists, officiating personnel, and other clerical stuff,  that organization makes no money. They post $0 in profits. They only take enough money to pay operating costs, including Goodell's redonk salary. The $44mil that Goodell is paid doesnt count as profit for the NFL. It's an expense.		And Goodell presumably pays income tax on his salary.
