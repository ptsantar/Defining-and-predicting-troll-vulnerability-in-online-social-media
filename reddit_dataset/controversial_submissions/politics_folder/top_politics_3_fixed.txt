Mods can use animations on reddit since they enabled CSS3, maybe there could be a sliding scale so that you can click whether you consider MSNBC to be left-wing, then it shifts everything thirty degrees to the right, and if you consider MSNBC to be center-right and neo-liberal then it shifts everything thirty degrees to the left.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RandInMyVagina","name":"t1_ck43m5b","parent_id":"t1_ck0peiw","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1409350153,"created_utc":1409346553}

He is the unofficial leader of the Republican party and the conservative bloc of the US, with his word considered on the same level as God's for a large swath of the country (if not moreso, considering how quick they are to ignore those teachings of God that don't align with their personal view).
