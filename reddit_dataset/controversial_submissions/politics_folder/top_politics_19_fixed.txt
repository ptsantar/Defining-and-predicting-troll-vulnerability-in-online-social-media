{"body":"Right on, pyrespirit.		I am furious with the Democrats for utterly failing to explain policy and to take advantage of the economic improvement which would never have occurred under a Republican austerity regime. One only has to look at the EU to see what that has wrought. But did the Dems capitalize on the difference in economic policy? No. Did they mention that Republican austerity would have put even more people out of work? No.  		There were just so many missteps and failures in communicating the Democratic agenda and how it benefits the middle class. I am thoroughly disgusted with them.		When I first registered to vote, young and naive, I registered as a Socialist. I soon realized that here in PA. that was pretty useless as it excluded me from voting in the Democratic primaries which even my stupid self realized was an important vote, more important than some pie in the sky Socialist agenda.		At this point, I am still a registered Democrat but only because the Republicans offer nothing to the middle class but more misery. It's not like I am proud to be one at this point. It is rather embarrassing to be affiliated with a party that offers better policies but is so inept at communicating them to those who would benefit from those policies.		I have been voting for over 45 years and in all that time had one brief moment of hope and that was when Obama was elected.

The deficit is out of control, even though it has plunged significantly under Obama. Benghazi is a horrible scandal, even though more than a dozen embassies were attacked with loss of life during the Bush administration without a peep. Obamacare is a disaster, even though it has brought affordable healthcare to millions. Obama should be impeached even though he has done nothing that even approaches impeachable behavior, following the Buah administration, whose negligence, incompetence, and corruption led to the avoidable deaths of over 10,000 American citizens. War criminals and profiteers don't get impeached but Obama should be? Yet not a peep out of the Democrats.		In fact, by not countering any of those false claims, by running away from Obama and not running on his relatively successful record as president, and by not using their millions in campaign ads to remind the American people of the treasonous, stonewalling, propagandist, dissembling, divisive, un-Constitutional, and un-American behavior of the Republicans, the Democrats sent the message to the American voter that the Republicans were correct and accurate in their definition and assessment of America at this moment in time. All the Democrats had to do was call on those people who were benefitting by Obamacare to protect their healthcare and get out to vote, and the conclusion to this campaign would have been far different. Instead they hid from Obamacare even though they knew that the Republican definition was dead wrong.		What's worse is that the Republicans embarked on this scheme because they knew damn well that Democrats are insipid little weenie weaklings and would act exactly as they did, and all of their lies and propaganda would work exactly as it did, and they were right. And now that it worked in 2014, expect it to be their standard operating procedure going forward. If Dems don't start standing up themselves, define themselves and their policies, and go on the offensive against Republican propaganda, they will continue to lose races that they should easily win.		The Republicans didn't win this race, the Dems forfeited it. Republicans liars and bullies and Democratic weaklings - that's why I am registered with no party affiliation.

{"body":"I agree that most Democrats, particularly those leading the party, need to grow a spine and fight harder.  Democrats are lucky to have a few fighters in their ranks (i.e., Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, Al Franken, etc.), but they need MANY more.		Having said that, the mealy mouthed behavior comes from the fact that far too many Democrats, particularly Third Way Democrats, feel they need to kow tow to the very same financial interests that Republicans do.  As such they have convinced themselves that championing the Progressive agenda (that used to exist) would offend that constituency, so they resist doing so.  In the process, they become the very same political presence that the Republican party represents and the Democratic base wretches in response.		So, what's the answer?  Replace the Third Way Democrats with genuine reform-minded Progressives (I'm talking about FDR style Progressives here), get in Republican's faces when they attempt to redefine what it stands for and throw everything the country has at them.  Even more important, establish a national media presence to remind the American people what Progressivism actually represents.  This is the biggest key since most people get that message from Conservative media (i.e., Fox News and Conservative talk radio at the moment) on a 24/7/365 media loop.  To those who say it won't work, I would simply point out that an FDR-style agenda won the last 2 elections and could have won this one if Democrats had maintained an aggressive, reform-minded stance since 2009.","depth":2,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Wicked_Truth","name":"t1_clu41jg","parent_id":"t1_cltxm3e","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415226728,"created_utc":1415226728}

However, in addition to that, Obamacare makes sure that someone can't be turned away because of pre-existing conditions, and their insurance can't be cancelled because they have to use it if they get cancer or some other serious illness. Even if Obamacare only offered those improvement, and it offers much more than that, it would be worth it.		And Obama hasn't committed a single impeachable offense. He hasn't killed any American citizens - he has killed traitors who have joined the enemy to go to war against their own country. In most countries, those epope would have been considered to have forfeited their citizenship, but we don't have that law, so technically, yes they are citizens, but I'm not crying over the deaths of terrorist traitors, and neither are you. George Bush was responsible for the needless deaths of thousands of innocent American citizens, and yet nobody made a serious call for an impeachment.		As for the domestic spying, that has been going on since the Cold War started, it has just expanded as the technology has expanded. That doesn't make it right, but Obama is no more responsible for that trend than every single president since FDR. You can't impeach a president for the ongoing policies of spy agencies, many of which he probably doesn't even know the details.		What I wrote wasn't propaganda, it was a marketing study.

However, Obama didn't continue the financial mismanagent that Bush created by cutting taxes during wartime and instituting a huge unfunded prescription health care benefit, and increasing the deficit by 60%. Obama managed to launch a stimulus that worked to a moderate degree, despite the fact that it was watered down with tax credit/cutting appeasments for recalcitrant Republicans who pledged to never vote for it and followed through on that pledge. It worked, but not as well as if he had ignored the Republicans and passed a stimulus package without their input. They didnt vote for it anyway.

As a lifelong non-affiliated independent, I would be willing to vote Republican if there was ever a candidate that wasn't simply advancing an agenda that promises to set the American worker back 100 years, was willing to understand that social safety nets are a neccesity, willing to understand that reasonable regulation is a neccesity,  would stay out of everybody's bedrooms, would honor the separation of church and state, and commit to a first-class religion-free education for all Americans. Those aren't Democratic or Republican stances, they are American stances. Unfortunately, too many people have been conditioned to think like Republicans instead of thinking like Americans, and they no longer see or understand the difference. I am old enough to remember a different America, so I see the difference.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_Original_Gronkie","name":"t1_cluoqr3","parent_id":"t1_cluo5lr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415284020,"created_utc":1415284020}

{"body":"I completely agree with you about the Clinton presidency. On the personality side, I think Clinton wasn't your typical weenie Democrat. Clinton was a tough, no nonsense guy, who demanded loyalty from his people, and got it (and I think his wife was a big part of that, which is why I supported her wholeheartedly over Obama in 2008).  I find Obama to be far more interested in appeasement (at least during his first term), even in the face of the most hostile political opposition I've ever witnessed. Obama started his presidency as a typical weenie Democrat, and the Republicans stomped all over him. 		However, I think there is a big difference between the two presidencies beyond their personalities. During the Clinton presidency, the Republicans were going through a transitional phase on their way to becoming what they are now, but at that point they were still honoring their commitment to their country over their party, and were willing to work with Clinton, and both sides were willing to compromise. I think it fell apart near the end, when they tasted blood in the water over the Lewinsky thing, and the entire Republican party went through a fundamental change that has only worsened since. By the time Obama came along, and the Koch Bros./ Tea Party wing gained full control of the party, there was no compromise allowed under any circumstances, even for the most innocuous things. Clearly Obama was willing to compromise, as evidenced by his unilateral watering down orf the stimulus package and Obamacare, inserting Republican wishes into the bills, even as they swore they wouldn't vote for them, a pledge they held fast to. And yet Obama still tried to appease and compromise with them. I can't blame Obama for not being able to do more, he clearly tried, far more than he ever should have, but it was the Republican stonewalling that kept progress from happening. 		The difference in tone was all on the side of the Republicans. I became politically aware as a kid in the 60s, watching the Vietnam war on TV with a father who had been in the military, and I have have been voting since the late 70s. I watched the coverage of the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK, and watched the first moonwalk. I have seen politics at it's absolute worst, and I have seen what a government can do at its absolute best. Throughout all of that, I have never seen (nor heard of historically) either party openly declare that they would oppose literally everything the president proposed. They openly declared that they hoped the president would fail entirely, *at a time when the country was plunging into the worst depression since the 1930's.* In other words, they were saying that they wanted the American people to suffer even worse economic hardship so that they could use it to regain power. That is downright *treasonous*, and yet NOBODY called them out on it using that word. How any patriotic American could continue to support a party with such an enthusiastically anti-American agenda is beyond my comprehension. The fact that I despise the Republican party for that unforgivably treasonous and un-American stance (a stance which they have yet to renounce, apologize for, or make amends for), does not make me a liberal or a Democrat.

I get the idea of deficit spending during a downturn. What I don't get is how we can indefinitely increase spending when good times return. I understand that growth of the economy effectively cancels out the debt( that's an over simplification) but you have to admit that there's a problem when it takes almost a decade of nearly unprecedented bubble driven growth like we had under Clinton to eke out a small surplus.   To be clear I'm no fan of Republican over spending either, but at least in their case, it's usually on things that have some sort of end to them, as opposed to massive new ongoing (and usually ever growing) obligations.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaz345","name":"t1_clux8d2","parent_id":"t1_clurosn","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415299517,"created_utc":1415299517}

If Republicans got their way on all of their legislation, the middle class economic driver would be destroyed, and we would have dangerous workplaces at slave wages and schools that taught religious Sunday school lessons instead of science. We would have a society of uneducated serfs working for pennies, a society of 5% wealthy and 95% dirt poor, just as it is in 2nd and 3rd world countries.

The very fact that you don't seem to have any problem at all with Dem policies and see nothing at all positive or necessary in Repub ones is puzzling and seems very much to go against your claims of not being partisan. 		If we look at recent history, we see much of the best policy and laws coming from times when a president was working with a Congress controlled by the other party.  The Welfare Reform Act being a prime example of something that was proposed and passed by one party, vetoed once and modified a bit and then passed and enacted. And it's been an undeniable success. 		But I'm just not seeing how one can claim to objectively examine things and come to your conclusion, that mirrors the Dem position perfectly, that Republican policies are everything that's wrong with the country. 		It's easy (and lazy) to claim that they are just completely obstructionist, but the fact of the matter is that the tone of the leadership provided by the Executive branch matters. When the President spends his first term blaming the opposition for every problem we've got, and starts his second with "I won, deal with it." it's no wonder that Congress won't work with him.   To be clear, much of the blame was correct from a factual standpoint. But that doesn't change the fact that there's no point, other than scoring political points, in constantly bringing it up.  Based on his actions in this regard, it sure seems to me that Obama was more interested in political power for his own party than he was in the good of the country.

{"body":"You are incorrect on nearly every point, and your re-writing of history is astounding. Obama never said "I won, deal with it," or anything even close to that. Frankly, I wish he had shown some backbone, instead of acting like the stereotypical Democratic weenie. 		In fact, it was the Republicans who openly declared war on his presidency literally from Day One, pledging to oppose literally everything he proposed. They said they would oppose a healthcare proposition, so Obama gave them the very healthcare proposal that they had floated to oppose Hillarycare in the 90s, and which Romney had instituted in Massachusetts to great fanfare (and success). Yet they voted against it and have been demonizing their own program ever since. America needed a stimulus package in the wake of the Bush economic crash, and instead relying on the same kind of spending bill that has historically worked time and again, not only in America but in other countries, he watered it down with 50% being worthless corporate tax credits/cuts that were known to do nothing positive. And yet the Republicans still didn't vote for it. Knowing that anything he proposed would only be met with the most un-American and vicious hostility, he should have just proposed the very best programs possible, but instead he attempted to unilaterally compromise, squandering his political capital. The fact that Obama showed no spine at all for the first two years of his presidency is what led to the Republican wins in 2010. 		It is absolutely ludicrous to claim that Obama has set the negative tone for this presidency, when he took over amid an outpouring of enthusiasm and optimism from the majority of Americans, who turned out in record numbers to elect him in 2008. Had the Republicans reached across the aisle, they easily could have seen that same enthusiasm and optimism rub off on them, and they would have been able to get much of what they wanted. It has been the Republicans who have set the negative tone of this presidency in an attempt to poison the well so they could offer themselves up as the saviors. It was the Republicans who put their party ahead of the well-being of Americans. It's a terrible shame, because it was the most golden opportunity for this country that I've seen in my 40 years of voting, but it was squandered by petty hostility on the side of the Republicans, and weakness on the side of Obama.

My conclusions and observations are not "filtered through a pretty strong bias." It is a fact that Republicans are sponsoring/ floating/ testing legislation that will roll back things like minimum wage, child labor laws, workplace regulations, etc. Not one Democrat has ever proposed such legislation, it ALL comes from the Republican side.  That is not "filtered," that is FACT, and you know it. If the Republicans are allowed to pass all of those anti-worker/workplace laws that they are proposing (on the part of their industrialist/ corporate masters), then America will be a very sad place to work and live in the future.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"The_Original_Gronkie","name":"t1_clusqoy","parent_id":"t1_clurkxz","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415291916,"created_utc":1415291916}

Calling the ACA and what was done in MA the same is disingenous at best. They are similar but the devil is in the details as they say.

And other than minimum wage, isn't is possible that the regulations in some of those other areas have maybe already gone too far and need to be rolled back a bit? 		>It is absolutely ludicrous to claim that Obama has set the negative tone for this presidency, when he took over amid an outpouring of enthusiasm and optimism from the majority of Americans, who turned out in record numbers to elect him in 2008.

And while I certainly won't give the Republicans a pass on how they acted, I'm not going to give Obama a pass on his tone either.

{"body":"Part of the flaw of the classical liberal tradition, in the arena of politics, is that it is heavily influenced by philosophy and academia, and this influence usually manifests in an insistence on formal rationality; that is to say, an avoidance of logical fallacies where possible, and an insistence on creating concrete frameworks for discussion.		Regarding what you've said, it is pretty easy for someone from a non-liberal philosophical background to say something along the lines of: "immigration is ruining this country, and if you support immigration then you're ruining this country, which makes you unpatriotic and a traitor." If you unpack this statement, you have a host of logical fallacies that include, but are not exhausted by, ad hominem attacks, false equivalencies, and more fundamentally, begging the question. The problem, of course, is that the above statement easily appeals to the baser instincts of distrust and fear of the unknown, and can be absorbed as truth without proper inquiry. In contrast to this single line statement, the rational and formalist thinker has to not only point out the various logical fallacies, but in some ways has to explain them to whatever audience is present. The signal that must be created to combat the noise is skewed heavily in favor of the noise, and makes the work of using and explaining logic exhausting.		Now, this is obviously an example of extremes, but in many ways the seeds of this tendency manifest themselves in the ways that liberals choose to engage in discussions. Whereas one side or many sides will choose to attack in a meandering, non-formal, multifaceted, but usually unsubstantiated way, people following the liberal philosophical tradition actually choose to take each attack individually, attempt to point out its flaws, and craft a retort. The problem with this method of combating attacks in the political arena is that *liberals assume that the use of logic and formal reasoning is a substantive tool in discussion with people who have no understanding of logic or formal reasoning*. The liberal worldview is so thoroughly engrained with this philosophical and academic tradition, that they don't understand that, in much the same way that one can't teach mathematics to someone who can't count, *you can't use logic to persuade people who don't understand what logic is*. And here, of course, is where liberal stubbornness or naivet?? lead to their downfall.		All of this, of course, is to say that in the future, liberals have to learn what tools to use under what circumstances. When one finds oneself in shit-flinging contest with a gang of apes, it makes no sense to confound the poor creatures with language and appeals to reason, as it simply goes over their heads. The only real course of action is to either remove oneself from the situation, or learn to sling shit better than they can.

{"body":"In the early to mid-late 20th century, some of the more radical political thinkers of the time actually blamed democracy itself, and competitive elections in particular, for fostering this kind of race to the bottom antagonism between opposing groups. From a purely game theory perspective, you can see how there is an incentive to engage in irrational discourse:		| Group 1   | Group 2    |      |	|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|	|         |          Rational| Irrational        	| Rational  |    (3,3)|  (1,4)   	| Irrational       |        (4,1)|   (2,2)		In this simulation, which is a classic prisoner's dilemma situation, both groups would be better off if they both chose to be rational; however, because the risk of the other, opposing group defecting and choosing to be irrational, both groups will choose to behave irrationally. We can see this is the case, since group 1, given group 2 chooses to be either rational or irrational, would itself choose to be irrational, and group 2, likewise, would choose to be irrational regardless of what strategy group 1 chooses.		If one were to stop here, one might take oneself on a radical path toward the dissolution of democracy and competitive elections altogether, perhaps becoming a Marxist or Anarchist, since democracy and political competition obviously incentivizes a race to the bottom between opposing groups.		But, hereinlies the logical fallacy that dictates that we must all eventually resort to irrationality in order to maximize our outcomes. *The assumption that a two-group system is the only way to model political competition*. In the above example, the Nash equilibrium of (Irrational,Irrational) is reached only because there are two actors, and there aren't any consequences for both groups acting irrationally, because, presumably, the spectators who will eventually become supporters don't have a choice and will simply become entrenched and accept the irrationality of their side while rejecting the irrationality of the other side(and there is no shortage or real-life examples of this phenomenon). Change the dynamic, however, and introduce a third party that is capable offering an alternative to (Irrational,Irrational), and the incentive structure changes entirely.		Fundamentally, the problem that exacerbates reciprocal irrationality is the system that deprives supporters of choice, namely, the first-past-the-post system that encourages binary electoral choices. So, to answer your question, there are two solutions, one easy and one hard. The first is to engage in outward irrationality, "shit slinging," with the faith that the tactics employed and the supporters gained in the process do not fundamentally change the rational decision making we eventually want to implement; or, alternatively, work to change the electoral system in a way that encourages choice, and is thereby able to break the political prisoners' dilemma that locks us in a Nash equilibrium of less-than-optimal outcomes and irrational discourse.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"liarliarpantsonfire","name":"t1_clu13s6","parent_id":"t1_cltxwmp","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415221825,"created_utc":1415221825}

Republican governor elect (yeah, I know that incumbent Pat Quinn has not conceded yet, but with 99% of the precincts reporting in, it's a foregone conclusion) Bruce Rauner went out and [bought himself a bevy of Black preachers to sway the Black vote in Cook county alone.](http://capitolfax.com/2014/09/22/rauner-endorsed-by-several-black-ministers/) Soon as I heard that, I knew that it was a foregone conclusion. And again; we just let it happen.		Is it abuse when you consent to what is being done to you?

For instance, Sarah Palin will never get 50 percent off the vote for President, but could she get 26 percent if there were 4 or more legitimate parties? Possibly.		The other issue is that there is rarely a 3rd party who draws even close to evenly from both sides. Let's say you have 3 candidates and one is a extreme conservative, one is a centrist Democrat and the 3rd is very liberal. It might sound good in a left leaning state to have a moderate and extreme liberal to choose from, but in reality you could easily end up with the extreme conservative because the other two split the vote. You could have 40 percent for the extreme conservative 35 percent for the moderate Democrat and 25 percent for the extreme liberal. Sure 60 percent was leaving liberal, but the extreme conservative is now in office. 		I'm just pointing out that while 3 or more parties sounds great in theory, it doesn't always work out that way. Having 2 parties helps to keep candidates, especially Presidential ones, in the center. 		There might be ways around these problems like a run off election (difficult enough for people to go vote once) or doing something where people vote for their top 2 or rank candidates.

The rationale is that my choice is still much closer to me than who I'm voting against.		However, in a parliamentary system with proportional voting, voting for the party is no issue whatsoever. You choose D, G, R, L, C, etc. - and then the seats are divided by proportion of votes to those parties and filled by vote ranked primaries from those parties. It would be far more representative than our current system, and yet in this type of government, you choose parties and not people.		In other words, the problem is strategic voting and how to cope with it. The only chance for me to get someone I want in my congressional district is for someone to muster a successful primary challenge. Once it goes to general election, I'm better served keeping the incumbent that I don't like. I think the idea that people will vote for the opposite party for the sake of protest, en masse, is a fantasy.

Anytime the government gets involved (sometimes necessary, sometimes not) it's typically to try to mitigate something that's gone horribly wrong.  The primary driver of our economy is and should be the free market, which is largely independent of whatever legislation is happening.

If America simply did as is done in a lot of European countries, a tried and tested system that can be worked on and improved, things might get better, and undo the two party system. 		Here, political parties can go into coalition governments, where they distribute the responsibilities in the cabinet between each other.

You know that medication, medical treatment, technological innovation, or whatnot that you or your family takes advantage when they're sick or dying or whatnot?  That stems from graduate students and postdocs doing that research to find pieces of those things that are made lucrative by public institutions.  I didn't major in a "dead end" profession; far from it.		And I'm not just talking about me.  I have friends that went into medical school, are going into their Residency with huge debt, and are paid $45,000 to $50,000 for working 80+ hours a week.  We didn't go into "dead end jobs."		We all work in one of the most expensive cities in the United States.  We do so because this is the best place for us to just *hope* to get better jobs in the future, to give us some sort of advantage.  All of which are starting to dry up because, funny enough, tax revenues coming into the country are too low.  Which is *also* funny, because Pharmaceutical companies are now also struggling in large part because of the lack of adequate funding to publicly funded research, meaning even fewer graduates to fill their pipeline.		To give a sort of comparison, people in my profession at my scale in other countries that (funny enough) have higher tax rates for the rich get 1.5x-2x the amount I get paid.  So no, I'm not working a worthless profession.		It's not like we decided to become art history majors here and are struggling to find work.  I have a job related to my field, has an actual use to society, and has some real future benefit.  After so much education, I get paid beans compared to *other countries*, which in itself is embarrassing.  So complaining about how things are "unfair" after "working so hard" is just bullshit.

Why they hate socialized medicine so much, and yet then complain about the cost of their medical bills without considering for a second that the "free market" has failed them.

{"body":"> Ya - You're right... CA tax rates aren't high at all... After all, it's not like companies are fleeing CA left and right for Texas.		Yeah, companies, not people. Companies make up a tiny portion of the total tax pool - because they use every single loophole, legal & illegal, to get out of paying their taxes.		When it comes to personal taxes, which is what we talked about (Remember the earning 100k) the US is lower than all the nations cities I mentioned earlier, except Singapore.		Your link is also neglecting the favorable capital gains taxes from Denmark. For example the carry forward of realized losses, or the fact that dividends are only taxed 28%, not 42%.		We also have a system that deducts your loans from your tax rate. But it looks so much better to just plot numbers into a chart and go for that.		I'm not sure how Californias capital gains tax is constructed, nor the exceptions that are in it. But the personal income tax is *far* lower than that of Scandinavia, Australia, & France. And when speaking of income of 100k a year, then that will, in almost all cases, be personal income, not from capital gains.		>Also, the economies of France, Australia, and yes your own Denmark are in the shitter. You couldn't pay me to live in any of those countries (even tho that's what they effectively do - every things free!). Norway should be fun to live in as oil price continue to slide... Have fun paying for all those programs... Also - gotta love Lillihamers take on Norway ;)		How is that "in the shitter"? It's one of the few developed economies in the EU that actually has a growth. Of course a small country like Denmark is going to be affected by the recession in Germany, France & Holland - they are our biggest trading partners.		You make it sound like this is a serious issue. The US has a shit ass credit rating, the worlds largest deficit, and one of the highest (if not **THE** highest) unemployment rates, in the developed world. I'm aware that the statistical numbers won't show that, but we all know how a lot of the unemployed people don't count as unemployed, because of some bureaucratic way of counting that.		I'm glad that you are staying away. We don't pay anybody to move here, we just take care of the people that actually do. And you seem like somebody who doesn't give a rats ass about the people living around you, so I'm glad that you stay in the land of the greedy - where everybody is on his own, and where homeless people own the streets of your wealthiest state. Good job taking care of those veterans you are so proud of.... It's despicable and inhumane.		Norway has the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund. It can keep itself afloat for a **long** time, even if oil income was at 0. Don't worry about them, they are doing a hell of a lot better than the US.		>With a population of 5.6M Denmark is basically the size of Atlanta. 		Yes, that is true.		>Huge natural resources,		Sorry, what? We have a tiny bit of oil, I believe it makes up less than 5% of our GDP. Denmark is a nation that lives off of services and production.		> and a homogenous population that basically all the same social values, universal health care,		As I mentioned, thank goodness that I had ancestors that thought more than 1 step ahead. Thank goodness that I don't live in a nation where the #1 reason for bankruptcy is because people get sick. Thank goodness I don't live in one of the richest nations of the planet, that has the largest amount of poor people, when comparing to other highly developed nations.		>and strong unions ($20 per hour to flip burgers?? give me a break) - it's pretty easy to say that you (or Oslo or Paris) can live off less. That's not the case in the US.		So you don't think that people who flip your burgers should have a livable wage? You would rather have them on government subsidies, while the owner of the burger joints and Wal Mart has billions in profits?		And your last point makes no sense, at all. We are comparing 100k a year. 100k will get you **much** farther in NYC, LA, Vegas, Chicago, Miami, and every other city in the US, than it will in Denmark, Australia, Oslo, Paris, Singapore, and a shit load of other cities.		>Also, if you throw in medical to make it apples to apples, our effective tax rate spikes even higher. Don't forget you have universal health care included.		That's not true at all. A person making 100k spends a far smaller percentage of their income on health insurance, than the burger flipper making $7.25/hour. Most likely, the guy making 100k actually has it paid for by his company.		And again, we have universal healthcare. I would *gladly* pay 5-10% more taxes, than not be able to afford healthcare for my loved ones, or myself. I would also gladly pay 5-10% extra to not have homeless people roaming the streets, because they got laid off when they got sick - all because they couldn't afford proper healthcare.		Again, you live in the land of the greedy. Where you don't give 2 shits about the insane amount of child, veteran, and general poverty.		>Ya - and those families that live on less than a 100k live pretty sweet lives. 		Oh, so now the 100k has become a family income? I believe that 100k was a one man personal income.		>Also, how many of them graduated high school and college (less than 30% of americans have a college degree). To say "you could live of less than 100k like others" doesn't mean much. I could be homeless, but I don't want to be.		With 100k, you could easily afford a home. When you have an income of over 100k, you are in the top 5% in the US. Don't tell me that you can't do shit with 100k, when 95% of the country is earning less than that.		And again, regarding your college example. You (as in your country) chose a greedy ass model, where everyone pays for themselves. My ancestors had the foresight that allowed everyone a "free" education. They saw that knowledge is the ultimate commodity, and with a highly educated population, you can prosper with ease.		You chose the low tax "I gots mine" model, we chose solidarity.		>Ya, thanks for the guns and being a neutral trading partner...You were there to make a buck and defend your interests like everyone else. Also, don't act like you didn't hate the British as well... come on...		Actually, there was a massive love of everything British during, and after the war.		>And please, if Hitler didn't open a second front, you would definitely be speaking German...		Easy to take the credit when Russia and the UK did 90% of the work, and Europe took 90% of the losses.		But hey, if Germany didn't open the 2nd front, you wouldn't be screaming "USA #1 - USA USA USA!"		The sole reason you became a super power, is because you profited from the destruction of every other developed nations production capabilities.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"upvotesthenrages","name":"t1_clujeai","parent_id":"t1_cluheus","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415261470,"created_utc":1415261470}

{"body":"As individual (unmarried, not household) incomes go-		"Poor" appears to be $55,000 a year for most areas.  Below this level you're qualifying for at the minimum Federal tax incentives, which increase as income goes down.  Of course earning $55k in NYC or SF won't get you much at all whereas someplace more rural you can live quite nicely on so little.  It's situational which is why states and localities charge different levels for the services they provide, and some are subsidized Federally as well.   I'd like to see how most rural businesses would manage without public money building and maintaining roads out to their remote locations.		$23,500 appears to be the nationwide level where individuals are receiving maximum benefits in terms of EBT, Medicaid and subsidized housing in most states.  Beyond this income level safety net benefits are taken away very quickly which puts low income households at an extreme disadvantage.   Without the opportunities provided by college education many of them can't jump up to self-sufficiency, and for every individual that pulls themselves up by their bootstraps there are probably 25 who can't.		So it really doesn't matter what your personal income level is, you're costing "society" $55k a year and if you're below that relative level at any time in your life, then you are being subsidized personally by the state in some manner (and probably a good deal over that if we were smart/informed enough to take into account all externalities)		Oftentimes I hear $250,000 as the cutoff for upper-middle class, but it becomes nebulous since beyond a certain income level you can hire accountants who can reduce your apparent taxable income in favor of other incentives.		Higher taxes - or smarter taxes - absolutely are the answer to poverty.   A historical comparison of taxation and poverty will provide you with an extremely tight correlation between the two in almost every case.  The world progresses by shoveling as much mud at a wall as it possible and seeing what sticks, and limiting opportunities to a few wealthy individuals whilst filling everyone's head with the hundredth idiot theory inevitably results in stagnation and eventually political instability.  We should be giving as many people a leg up as possible, because that's what pushes human society forwards.		Corruption in general is a function of the concentration of wealth and power, it is *not* a function of government, which can deliver services in an exceedingly efficient manner when not hamstrung by special interests.  Lower taxes on high earners serve only as another tool to concentrate wealth upwards by removing essential social services from those least equipped to do anything about it, thus exacerbating the issue.		It's hard to have a sensible discussion about taxation policies because it's a hugely complex issue and is highly situational.  I'm talking mostly about urban issues in high population centers, you might well be talking about someplace completely different with a few farms, mcmansions and a huge meth epidemic.   Until we can decide on a location, and become sufficiently expert at the local issues and taxation policies the debate is pretty much pissing in the wind.","depth":8,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cmdrogogov","name":"t1_cltseu3","parent_id":"t1_cltr19p","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415207204,"created_utc":1415207204}

{"body":"It is the point I was making, whether or not it is the point you would like to accept is irrelevant.  If you think that requiring a voter ID law is violating the constitution you have two options to correct the issue: 	 	* You can fight the law in the courts and get it ruled unconstitutional, thus getting it thrown out.  This is already happening, people are already challenging all these voter ID laws in court.  Whether they will succeed is not guaranteed, because a case can be made that these laws are constitutional.  Best case scenario for your point of view is to have these laws struck down quickly (SCOTUS has already had an opportunity to act and they did not) and you are all good to go by the next primary/election.		* You can elect lawmakers that share your view on Voter ID laws.  These new politicians get rid of these laws through the legislative process.  This is probably your default position anyway, trying to get people elected who share your point of view.  This method is also not guaranteed and is much less likely because you have to get someone elected using a system which you say is skewed and flawed.  		So while you are perusing these two options, what do you do?  What I am suggesting is that those who feel the law is negatively effecting the election should actively do something to mitigate its negative effect.  I guess your other option is to not try and dampen the negative effect.  If this is what you are advocating then good luck with that.  If you have some other action to take, then what is it?

{"body":"I have already laid out one plan to help combat the negative effects for  the Voter ID laws.  So unless you would like me to expand on that I will just stick to redistricting in this post.  Redistricting can be overcome, and it has in the past many times.  It, like everything else, requires a lot of work.  It also has to be treated as a longer term goal, not a quick fix, due to the nature of how the lines are drawn.		* First it happens on the state not national level, so local and state elections are key.  The more State House/Senate seats you can pick up the better off you are going to be.  Also in many states the Governor is a big player when it comes to setting the lines.  This means you have to work hard to try to get as many of the local people as you can with your view points elected.  These people are the feeder system for the State level seats, and will be key in setting the future lines.		* It also happens every 10 years based on the census, the next one will be in 2020.  The good thing about that is due to the transient nature of our society as time passes it becomes less effective.  We are not talking huge swings, a district that is 90% one party is not going to change quick enough over that 10 years to change anything.  But the point of gerrymandering is not to get your party ahead by 80% in one district.  It is to give your party the lead in as many districts as you can by much smaller numbers like 10%, and to place the majority of the other party's voters in small dense districts.  This 10% lead is the one that is most effected by time, and as we get closer to 2020 the less pronounced the advantage of whomever set the lines in 2010.  		* The Republican's were very lucky in 2010, it was a midterm election and there was a lot of resentment nationally about the ACA and the bailouts.  This basically was a perfect storm for a wave election and they got very good pickups across the board, but especially on the local level.  This allowed them to set the district lines.  2020 is a presidential election, this will mean there will be greater Democratic turnout historically.  Also the odds of a perfect storm happening for republicans again is very unlikely. 		Now if you are really lucky and everything falls your way in 2020, what do you want your elected lawmakers to do?  You could advocate to follow the status quo and have your lawmakers draw lines that heighten your party's election prospects for the next few years.  This is what most politicians want to do, because of self preservation.  However the next time things don't fall your way you will be once again screwed.  The next is you could advocate changing the law on how lines are drawn to make them more fair for everyone.  This requires you to elect politicians to possibly willingly act against their self interest.  This makes it more difficult but not impossible.  If it can be pulled off though it should make your representative gov't more representative of the population.  Besides being difficult to pull off the other worry in just making a law to change how districts are drawn can easily be overturned in the future by someone else if in when they come to power.  They then can draw lines that benefit themselves.  The next option is amending your state constitution to make it mandatory for the lines to be drawn in a more fair manor.  Depending on the state there may be many ways to do this, from ballot initiative to relying on elected state officials.  This is possibly even a more difficult proposition, but one that would be harder to undo in the future.","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tacsatduck","name":"t1_clu1ycy","parent_id":"t1_clu0jrq","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415223211,"created_utc":1415223211}

The MSNBC panel would only talk about how this would change the Republicans' power to negotiate and legislate, as if the government were functioning normally.

Obama will veto each and every one of these repeal attempts, of course.  The Republican Party is now structured such that they cannot agree on anything positive as a unit.  They can, however, agree to throw a wrench into the works, over and over again.  They have become the opposition party, the obstruction party, and they will do nothing but obstruct.  I simply cannot see any other future than this one.  This is the rest of the Obama Presidency.

{"body":">I'm not a republican.		>You didn't understand my question. You need to define the items on this "liberal agenda that republicans often cry about." Otherwise, if I prove some, you move the goal post.		OK. Fair enough.		First, let me say that since you are not a Republican we have a pretty fair chance of finding common ground in many areas, I think. The GOP I know & loathe has long been held by the conservative wing of that party. Given that I'm usually challenged from that quarter by conservatives, you'll forgive me for lumping you in with the GOP?		With regard to "the liberal agenda": the reason I use the phrase in debate of this sort is as a trap. It's indefinable. It is a phrase that I have heard thrown about since the 1980's (IIRC, Rush Limbaugh was the first person I heard utter it), and the demonization of liberals and all that they stood for was going in full force.		I don't know if you remember those years or not, but I remember the word "liberal" being hurled about as an epithet. It got so bad that politicians stopped using the word to describe themselves and started using the word "progressive" instead.		The point I make w/ that phrase is that the phrase itself (and much of right wing rhetoric) is a moving target. It's like the phrase "family values". Do you remember people running as family values candidates? Did they really think I would believe the other guy would eat his young if we weren't watching him?		If they throw out legitimate issues - great. Which is the point of the phrase. I'm fishing for a real topic and setting up for the cop out. 		Now then - w/ regard to the "current state of affairs" and dumbfuckery - both GOP & Democratic:		As a liberal, I'm not really happy w/ the Democratic Party either. What liberals get from the Democratic Party is "Where else ya gonna go?" when they bother to lift their heads from the troughs themselves. For proof of that you need look no further than the Clinton Administration. The entire "New Democrat" thing from the 90's was "We're the Democrats eager to suck Wall St's **** as well. Move over GOP, there's room for more than one mouth there...."		NAFTA, GATT, WTO, DMCA, Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Hell, man, Brooksley Born was a Clinton Administration official put in place to run the CFTC (charged w/ oversight of the derivatives market, among other things). She was run off when she warned about derivatives trading and the potential to kill our banking system. She was run off by guys who later worked for the Obama Administration - after the financial crisis of 2008 was in full swing. 		So, yeah, no question that there are plenty of room for charges of dumbfuckery on both sides, but the GOP gets the short bus award IMO for their shitty behavior since 1980.

You are waving your hands at the substantiated fact that Republicans have gerrymandered and disenfranchised voters, but require evidence that this election in particular was affected by it?

Bullshit, most people agree that many policies this party supports are not in their interest, for example Gay marriage, Abortion, Marijuana, etc. but the people voted them in anyway. I firmly believe this has more to do with a desire to change the status quo rather than support of Republican policies.		We flip flop between a douche and a turd sandwich because we are fooled into thinking it's the only option.		As I said, Democrats aren't doing a great job either.

A compromise is exactly what we need on all sides. That's how you get most of what you want and be considerate of the needs of other people. That's how you live and let live.

How do we not remember the ignorance of this party? How do we not remember that Republican control means lower taxes for the wealthy, higher burden on the middle class and not even single ply toilet paper for the poor to wipe their ass?

{"body":"There's actually some evidence that the nature of getting a degree in journalism biases reporters. The perception that the professors are liberal discourages conservatives students from taking the class who then opt for less politically charged degrees or seek politically advantageous professors. The more liberal the reporters on the ground are the stronger the subtext. The more liberal the programming directors the stronger the filter. It's pretty clear that this isn't intentional, but rather a function of cognitive dissonance, or the natural tendency to dislike having to deal with those things we disagree with.		There is little formal research on the matter, but that which does exist does suggest that there is a minor bias that appears to be entirely unintentional as opposed to no bias what so ever or some kind of conspiracy. Fox News and the like are an overt reaction to the perception of the bias of older news sources. It's difficult for people who share the bias to notice it, because it is exactly how they would word it themselves. It's easier for people of other affiliations to notice because the wording, tone of voice, and context carries implications that make them defensive or uncomfortable.		Really, I suspect that the quality of all media has been decreasing as a function of the emptying out of news rooms, increasing reliance on news aggregators, and the need to fill too much time with too little actual news which leads to the decision to rely heavily on content-poor punditry and interviews because they are cheaper than investigative journalism or other forms of news production.

{"body":"All on target, but I think you still miss a fundamental point. The classical definition of "liberal" is to be open to new ideas. The "news" is, by definition, new ideas, new events, new concepts. A reporter therefore has to be somewhat liberal to simply do their job. The very concept of "conservative news" is therefore an oxymoron. That is why Fox News is basically the only example of its kind and had to be overtly constructed with an agenda in mind, because it would not have naturally occurred in an open marketplace.

I don't believe that Fox News is an artificial constructs as clear antecedents exist in both print media and talk radio. It was less that Fox News was artificially constructed to be the mouthpiece of a political party as occurs in some countries, but rather a guy noticed that there was a miss match between the supply of news and demand for news and sought to profit from it.

{"body":"If you look at the tax structure of the US government after the great depression we used to tax the crap out of rich people (federal level) and use that money for education and infrastructure. 		The reason IMO why democrats are mad at rich people is because as productivity gains have risen in companies most of wealth (no pay raises) from profits are going to CEOs and people who run the board not their employees. At the same time they're using the tax code to avoid paying taxes. On the local level companies are telling cities to give them tax breaks to move there or else they won't give a town jobs. Well those tax breaks are paid for by the local citizens so yeah middle and lower income people are pissed at evil rich people.

{"body":"All true, but why on earth would you demonize someone for being successful and trying to take full advantage of the opportunities in their life.  It isn't the CEO's fault that the company is willing to fork over millions in profits, which by the way also go to pay dividends and grow the stock price.  This in turn benefits everyone who has a 401k plan or IRA.  Not to mention the amount of responsibility and difficulty in running the gigantic global businesses has risen along with the incentive.  But this just proves my point, if you want to suck more money out of rich people, rather than raising income taxes on them, which they will use loopholes in the tax code to get around, impose a national sales tax.  That way they pay money directly to the Federal Government for every Bentley, private jet, or house in the Hamptons that they buy. On the flip side, you will also see the effect of middle and lower income families saving more because if they are buying they are being taxed.  This could solve the problem of next generations not having enough money saved for retirement, therefore reducing the amount of benefits necessary to be paid by the govt, therefore lowering the deficit and eventually we can lower taxes on everyone.  And it will also be a wake up call for them to get involved in trying to solve the national fiscal crisis that we are inevitably going to experience.  I know this is an oversimplified answer to the issue, but I feel like it could be made in to a viable option.  One thing is for sure, the current finger pointing and demanding on the left for the rich to carry everyone's burden, and the refusal on the right to give up what they have earned because of other people's bad decisions isn't going to get us anywhere.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"VisceralGamer","name":"t1_clu40dk","parent_id":"t1_clu3ayq","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415226674,"created_utc":1415226674}
{"body":"I agree it's not the CEOs fault. IMO the problem is the "corporate pay culture" that benefits the few disproportionately from the many in the organization that it takes to produce a successful company. I don't believe a CEO deserves to make 300x more than their employees. 		IMO the income inequality in america is driven by both this "corporate pay culture" that benefits the few in a company, access to a high quality education, and the current tax code that allows rich people to hire accountants/lawyers to use creative accounting to avoid paying their fair share. The government cannot address the first problem but it can address the last 2 issues.		Concerning: "This in turn benefits everyone who has a 401k plan or IRA."	How does this help everybody rich, middle class, and poor? When the government set policies, it's supposed to benefit everyone. I've never met a poor person with a 401k who made $9/hr working 40 hours a week. 10% savings for retirement is a hell of a lot easier for a rich/middle class person than for the poor especially if you work in an area with high real estate costs.		Also you're supporting taxing consumption which i disagree with because it discourages people to buy things which generate jobs (Things= coffee, boats, homes, tv, cell phones etc.). We need consumption to create jobs for people. I work in manufacturing and we've never hired a person because of taxes or tax policies. We only hire people when demand increases which usually occurs when consumers buy more stuff.		Lastly i think part of this problem of rich people trying to avoid pay taxes (creative accounting) is that it seems inherently selfish. We are all human beings and Americans. I have no problem paying more in taxes to help my less financially stable neighbor get access to food, housing, or healthcare (not PS4s of course). We're all in the same boat together and i don't view it as "the rich carry(ing) everyone's burden". I don't mind spending my tax dollars on helping people get access to basics (food, housing, healthcare).Especially healthcare where i don't want a poor person coughing on my food because they're sick & can't afford to see a doctor or stay at home sick. That can quickly turn into a public safety problem for everyone.		We all have our own talents and strengths and capitalism is supposed to help us all monetize those talents into jobs. Thank you for your thoughtful response, even though i respectably disagree with most of it.

{"body":"Learn calculus you need to know advanced math. You'd have to know how to use Calculus to be a healthcare economist.	 	The democrats believe that the government should focus on reducing the cost AND access of healthcare to all. Republicans had no problem supporting Mitt Romney even though President Obama admitted to copying his healthcare plan.		I agree that social security and medicare should be reformed. Social Security can be fixed with SS tax increases and/or slight age start date. I think health experts (including healthcare economists) believe you can improve both access and solvency to medicare/medicaid. 	The Affordable Care Act (ACA) "tries" to do both. The ACA also tries to improve patient outcome versus the old system where doctors get paid more if they run more test than for outcome. I think this is still better than the republican "voucher" program which does nothing to try to reduce current healthcare cost. You should be a good citizen and read the ACA like i did.		Democrats "math" tell them that healthcare cost for a person receiving healthcare through a primary physician is CHEAPER than using emergency room visit which was a big problem before the ACA was implemented. Cutting people off of medicare/medicaid does nothing to reduce the healthcare system costs at all for the average consumer alone. Rather than you insulting democrats and saying they don't know how to do math, maybe you should have watched CSPAN when they discussed this when the ACA was being created back in 2009.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tangent83","name":"t1_cluej84","parent_id":"t1_clucgqr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1415247235,"created_utc":1415247235}

Yet, the Democrats didn't campaign on these things, they didn't show how for once there was such a massive disparity in what the two parties were trying to accomplish, and they let the Republicans dictate the messages being conveyed. It's not hard to sway the public away from reality when you have nobody presenting a case in opposition.

Anyway, the Republicans have had no effort at all to appear moderate, besides getting rid of one or two congresspersons who condoned rape.  The Democrats platform is we agree with the republicans but we don't want to be as harsh in our criticism of the President (who is also a conservative).  		It's just nonsense, and as a liberal there's no appeal to me from either party.  They both agree on 99% of things, and on the last 1% it's more cosmetic than anything else.  Even on issues like gay rights, yes the Democrats are more proactive, but more Republicans are coming around too.  I don't believe there would have been any difference in the way the federal and state governments act over the next two years if the Democrats had held the senate.  Immigration reform isn't happening, climate change action is not happening, and repealing the long-term capital gains tax preference is not happening.

{"body":"I got up a little earlier to go out and vote.  Sure, I have it pretty easy.  My polling place is nearby and there isn't a two hour wait to vote.  But I have a kid that needs to get ready in the morning and off to school, so it's kind of an inconvenience to get out and vote.  I still do it because I realize it's important. Even though there are a lot of voters that were turned away for lack of ID or really couldn't get to a polling station, there are a lot that just didn't bother to show. 		I also read news every day (not just Ars and Reddit).  I consider myself an informed voter (not just with ambush facts like a lot of Fox viewers), with substantive information on the issues.  Democracy takes people willing to work.  Everyone talks about how wonderful it is to bleed for democracy, but really you need to read for democracy.  It's an every day thing.  		Being a citizen in a democracy is about active participation, not just in national elections.  That's where a large part of the democratic coalition falls down.  Even on college campuses where students get registered to vote, very few do.  People will argue and scream and get red in the face about "conservative" policies but when it comes down to 'did you vote?' the answer is 'I was busy,' or 'I had a meeting that morning,' or whatever.  		And then there's the fact the Democrats dropped the ball on immigration reform.  They've done nothing substantive for so long, including failing to stop deportations, that I think they're in danger of losing support from what should be a core constituency.  And then you have the dog-catcher and school board elections.  If they happen to fall on off years, it's basically just the blue haired old ladies that show up.  So bitch about the fact the school board decided to replace text books with prayer, but where were you when the school board election was held.		Yes, it's hard and annoying to live in a democracy.

{"body":"You are absolutely uninformed. The crash was caused by banks selling CDOs. Those were based on collateral. That was mortgages. When the good mortgages were used up, the banks instructed mortgage writers to drop standards a bit lower. The banks and ratings agencies were making huge fees on CDos. So mortgage requirements were dropped to allow weaker and weaker buyers to buy them. That happened over and over, until mortgages were very poor.  The banks had no jeopardy since they immediately chopped the mortgages up and sold them to waiting customers. They had no liability, just huge profits.  I could get into SWAps, but that is too much for most righties.

Sure climate change is important but it is not the biggest issue right now. Getting America back to work and decreasing poverty comes first right now and we can only do that with a Republican majority.

{"body":"Bush tried to stop the deregulation and the Dems pushed it and won because they had the majority. Republicans aren't generally in the business of wrecking our economy. The housing market crash is what did it and not the war like most people lean towards blaming. The war actually saved us from Hussein screwing us with the Euro switcharoo. 		ACORN had everything to do with junk mortgages though. Their platform was lending discrimination which led to loaning money to high risk individuals. I'm sure you can guess who was spearheading their pressure tactics and lawsuits in the early 90's. 		Yup, none other than Obama. 			Higher wages and infrastructure spending is inevitable. The GOP is aware that economic recovery can't occur without getting America back to work and back to spending. In my state the GOP will be using oil revenue to pump billions into improved transportation. Alternate energy is also inevitable. Things like Tesla motors aren't going away. The biggest issue with alternate energy was profitability. That seems to be more or less resolved and so the GOP will continue to push that agenda along with the continuation of fossil fuels.			I completely understand the concerns people have about climate change but as long as we maintain a Democratic president and Republican ran Senate and House, things will really be looking up.
