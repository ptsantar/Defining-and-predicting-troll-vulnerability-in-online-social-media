{"body":"I'm surprised you're asking, but maybe you're a brand new mod and missed the storms of protest?		I've been watching this a long time.  Don't be fooled by my account creation age, I switched accounts last year, I've been here longer than that.  I could list a lot of ways you (I'm going to say "you" to talk about all the mods, not you in particular) enforce crazy rules that hurt the sub.  Like:		- You ban blog posts for supposedly being "rehosted content" because they quote from a couple of other articles.  That's what blog posts do, they quote from other articles and relate them to each other and give some context or argument.  It's crazy not to allow that.		- You ban entire domains simply because you don't like some articles that are on those domains.  Plenty of good articles get banned and people don't bother to do anything when their post is banned, they just go away.		- You have a religious devotion to making the post title be exactly the same as the article title even when the article title is imperfect and people try to improve on it.  If the article was written for a newspaper, that's a different kind of headline writing, often not well suited for online posts, but thanks to you, we get these deficient headlines.  And even something as simple as expanding an acronym from a newspaper headline into the full text gets posts banned.  Adding a 1 or 2 words of context next to an ambiguous term to make its meaning clearer, gets a post banned.		- You have a rule that posts that aren't directly about actions of the government or spending taxpayer money aren't politics so they're not allowed here.  Lots of articles that are totally about US politics get banned for that stupid rule.  For example I think I saw an article talking about whether more people owning guns makes a place safer or not, and people's views about the gun ownership question, get banned, because the article didn't talk about whether laws should restrict guns so somehow that made it not about US politics.		- Your "rehosted content" rule is a catch-22 when an article exists in more than one place on the net.  People post it from one source and you ban it because it's on another source, but if people were to post it from that other source you'd ban it because it's on the first source.  Nobody can predict in every case which one you think is the "real" sources, so there are some things that just can't be posted.  Or maybe you think the "real" source happens to be the one with less interesting comment threads and someone wants to post the one with better discussion on it?  Banned.		I could go on, but it's a distraction.  The real problem is the mod team's arrogance and attitude that it's your place to decide what articles you like and don't like, and we shouldn't be allowed to post or vote on the things you don't like.  You hijacked this reddit to turn it into your sandbox, then pretended the huge outburst of anger was just a few whiners who don't matter.		Mods have complained here and in other places on reddit about all the time you spend and how little appreciation you get.  What you are in denial about is that almost all the time you spend here is time spent *making things worse* for everyone else.  We'd all be a lot happier if you did nothing.

{"body":"I am a rather new mod :) though I was a participant for the last ~2 years, but perhaps I just avoided meta drama.		I'm on my phone so sorry if I made any of these out of order!		Domains: For domains that are predominantly rehosted content or have been found to be vote-gaming, it makes more sense to automoderate them than to have mods remove them individually.  It leads to less possible errors, and also allows the person to find the actual original source to the content much faster.  For domains like Salon, we approve the original content articles pretty quickly once modmailed!		Titles: As far as I know (and as far as I have personally done), abbreviations being changed to the spelled-out version are fine. Similarly if the title is like "Agency changes blah blah policy" and the article itself says "CIA" in the text, we would allow "[CIA] changes blah blah policy" for clarity.  We don't allow any editorializing (including mix-and-match quotes from pieces of the article, or adding words that aren't in the article even if relevant), and I can understand that that may be in some cases frustrating, but there is the small bit of allowance for needed clarity.		And for rehosted content removed by a mod: You should definitely be able to post from the original source.  If something is removed for rehosted content and you can't find the original, please modmail us and we'll send you the source link.  That's come up in modmail before and is no big deal.		I understand from reading that there have been some historical problems that some members have had with the moderation team, and I'm genuinely sorry if you've had a bad experience here.  From what I've seen of the current team, we're trying to moderate objectively and according to clear guidelines, and we regularly revisit the nuances of policies to make sure they're working right and make sense.  		I personally don't need any appreciation, but I do want to help -- that was my statement when I volunteered to moderate here, and my reason for continuing to put in time here.

All of these things seem to always lead to deletion.		> For *domains that are predominantly rehosted content* or have been found to be vote-gaming, it makes more sense to automoderate them than to have mods remove them individually.		**NO**.  That's the shitty attitude I'm talking about.  You think it's your job to prevent people from seeing what you don't like.  It's not.  Most people won't send you modmail, they'll either not notice and think they got no votes, or they'll assume their post wasn't allowed and go away.		Consistent vote-gaming from a domain, maybe.  That's a reddit violation.  But your obsession with this idea of "rehosted content" is part of what's ruining the subreddit, and a lot of the domains you ban for it have been domains full of original content.  What makes sense is for you to let all the articles be posted and let people vote on what they want to see.		> For domains that are predominantly rehosted content or have been found to be vote-gaming, it makes more sense to automoderate them than to have mods remove them individually.		That fantasy is not similar to the reality I see here.  You have a team of control freaks who have hijacked a reddit that used to be much better and won't admit that nobody wants them (you) here and would be happier if you didn't do what you're doing.  The policies here haven't worked for a long time, and haven't made any sense at all, and the mods are blind to that fact even though it's obvious to the majority of the community.		> For domains that are predominantly rehosted content or have been found to be vote-gaming, it makes more sense to automoderate them than to have mods remove them individually.

But remember this is the internet, not a Sunday morning talkshow. Political discussion can be very radical at times, and if that isn't allowed on an internet forum who's sole premise is politics, where can you have that discussion? If it is going to be removed from mainstream discussion and tucked away like a small print piece in a local news rag on page five, it takes away that meaningful discussion. This is not what r/politics was in it's original form. Politics are opinionated based discussions, sometimes very radically based discussions that can offend some depending upon that persons opinions. But it is those opinions that shape peoples opinions on any given subject. One persons meaningful discussion is another persons offense. If it's one thing a political discussion on an internet forum should not be is vanilla. Politics is a very hardball, and adult discussion especially these days involving American politics. It was those discussions when r/politics was first started that has shaped the landscape of all political discussion on internet boards. reddit has hurt it's brand by attempting to fix something that wasn't broken. I guess, as with everything else, with a certain amount of success, comes a certain amount of arrogance.

{"body":"Alright, I think this has gone on long enough. I am going to give you a very detailed answer and hopefully you will stop this nonsense.		Your account /u/republinuts was banned for having an inflammatory username. This is explicitly laid out in our rules. [Our civility rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) say:		> Please note that these rules apply everywhere in this subreddit: in text submissions, in usernames, in comments, everywhere.		Our rules specifically address usernames [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_no_trolling) It says:		> We disallow: all usernames that violate our rules of civility, including degrading characterizations of political parties or those holding specific political opinions		After your first account was banned, you created another username that was identical to the first, except that you used numbers in place of some letters. We banned that account too, for the same reasons as the first. 		You have been told exactly why your accounts have been banned. Now you are trying to stir up drama and are creating numerous accounts (I think you are at 8+ now this week alone). We ban inflammatory usernames all the time and you know what? Most of those people understand and simply make a new account with a less politically inflammatory username and continue to participate in /r/politics while also using their original account as per normal on the rest of Reddit.		You have made this into a much bigger drama than it ever needed to be. Furthermore, I note that all of your "evidence" does not show my side of the conversation - where I told you that your name violated our rules and suggested to you that you make a new account with a less inflammatory username so that you could continue to participate here.		Annnd lastly, the user who called you a name was warned and given a usernote. We give multiple warnings for uncivil behavior before moving to a ban. There are things that earn an immediate ban, like death, inciting violence, threats, witch hunting, doxxing, etc, but telling someone that they are "stupid" is not one of them. You know this, since we have warned you before on your original account for incivility. 		So let's recap:		* Your initial account was banned for an inflammatory username.	* You created another account with the same username (different spelling). That account was banned.	* You are **outraged** by this and have now created 8+ accounts and stated that you are ban evading.	* You are causing drama without providing the full story.	* You still have not made a new account with a benign username to participate civilly and productively in this subreddit. 		A rational person would have simply made 1 alt account with a benign username and continued participating in /r/politics.
