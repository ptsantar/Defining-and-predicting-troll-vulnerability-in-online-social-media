{"body":"Perfect, making the comparison between the failed war on drugs and the gun prohibition attempts in this country which are also doomed to be counter productive and fail to make society safer.		This is just anti gun drivel, not worth the time of any rational individuals.		They also have the standard talk about scary "assault rifles" (and as usual misuse the term to refer to ordinary semi automatic rifles), yet they ignore the fact that fewer than 2% of gun deaths are committed with rifles of any type, let alone the scary looking ones which are typically the target of "assault weapon" bans. Such guns aren't a problem, and the DOJ study of the prohibition of then from 1994 to 2004 determined that the prohibition had no statistical impact on gun crime or gun death.","depth":0,"score":25,"ups":25,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"creepyasscracker","name":"t1_couwli0","parent_id":"t3_2wx3wf","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1424730082,"created_utc":1424730082}

If you ignore the substitution effect then you don't know that you have actually made society safer or saved any lives.		The answer is that gun control hasn't been shown to reduce overall violent crime or murder rates anywhere in the world, gun control doesn't make society safer or save lives, and there is no justification for it. People are simply ideologically opposed to guns and want to control them because they think they are evil and have no place in society.

If not, then why are you afraid to look at overall murder, suicide, and violent crime rates? That is how you measure the safety of society, not with 'firearm deaths'. Minimizing firearm deaths without making an impact on the overall murder, suicide, and violent crime rate hasn't really accomplished anything. Not to mention 'firearm deaths' are a combination of justified homicides by law enforcement and civilians, murders, suicides (which make up the majority), and accidents (which make up less than 2%). It is a combination of things with different causes. Guns don't cause any of it, except for perhaps a small number of accidents.

{"body":"Nope, I don't think so, or at least the effect is very small.		There has been some evidence in some US states that adopted shall issue concealed carry laws that violent crime drops as a result, but the evidence is far from universal and causation can't be proven.		Most criminals act out of desperation, mental illness, or some other pressure and aren't operating under rational thought which would lead them to make a risk assessment and modify their behavior based on the perceived risk of harm to themselves.		Guns just allow people to more effectively defend themselves, which is why they are a constitutionally protected right.		Generally speaking I think gun laws have very little, if any, impact on overall violent crime and murder rates. This is especially true because gun laws can't in themselves reduce the number of guns in society, even where there have been buybacks like in the UK and Australia it only reduces the number of guns temporarily. People often rush out to buy the still unrestricted guns to replace the ones which were confiscated. No gun ban has ever been completely universal, they always leave some types of guns still legal for some purposes.		In the US this is even more true, where the constitution prevents wide scale gun bans and confiscation, and where the prevalence of guns makes it so any criminal can get a gun no matter what laws we enact, such as registration or universal background checks.","depth":9,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"creepyasscracker","name":"t1_covtie2","parent_id":"t1_covt0co","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1424805175,"created_utc":1424805175}

I again stress the US is unlike any other nation, we have as many guns as people and guns are everywhere. Any criminal can get a gun regardless of the laws. No future laws can change that in our lifespan, the only people who could be disarmed are the law abiding, and we would resist disarmament with force if necessary.		Additionally, criminals could be carrying other lethal weapons too. Police will always have to be prepared to defend their lives.		The distrust of the police stems from other issues in my opinion, namely their lack of accountibility for their crimes/mistakes, and their lack of a duty to protect the public from a supreme court ruling.  	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia		I don't see what you mean about a culture of fear.
