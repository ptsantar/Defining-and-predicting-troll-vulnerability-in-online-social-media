{"body":"Frankly, there are too many comments about whether or not something is liberal or conservative. As if being liberal or conservative is a fact that alters what is said or discussed.		Or, even as if being conservative or liberal were in fact, facts, and not opinions.","depth":0,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gibbet","name":"t1_cju4i2x","parent_id":"t3_2dw3nz","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1408414130,"created_utc":1408410530}
{"body":"The comments that merely point out the political leanings of a topic or of another user are what we call low effort comments and they should be down-voted as they contribute nothing to the conversation.		It becomes a bit trickier when comments point out those political leanings and then go into further detail about the topic at hand. 		We will only remove comments that violate our rules as laid out in the sidebar and the wiki. It is up to the users to decide which comments are low-effort and then to downvote those as appropriate. 		One of our big priorities over the past few months has been to remind people to **only** downvote comments and submissions that do not contribute or that are off-topic for the sub and not to downvote based on opinion. If the voting system were used appropriately, I imagine these sorts of comments would become less prominent.","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hoosakiwi","name":"t1_cju5a8u","parent_id":"t1_cju4i2x","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1408415746,"created_utc":1408412146}

{"body":"If the comment contributes nothing to the conversation, then yes.		A comment that points out the political leanings of a user or their comments and has no relevance to the topic at hand, really serves no purpose other than to engage someone on a personal level. 		This is up to the discretion of users - some of these comments may indeed be relevant and appropriate for the discussion while in other instances they may railroad the discussion completely.

{"body":"Submitted. Good quiz.  		But you folks still need to do two things:		1. revisit the banned domains.  Some should not be banned.		2.

They are not rehosting, just providing a different avenue for their own content		- commentary refuting another article is the life blood of the internet whether its only adding a little commentary or not.  Maybe create a threshold that as long as there is 25% commentary		- HUFF POST often buys and very often generates a huge audience for rehosted content.  This is the kind of thing the internet is all about these days.  Smaller source rely on huff post and other AGGREGATES (which reddit is) to generate their pay and stay alive.  Just saying that this rehosted content is bad is like saying the traffic reddit creates is bad.

{"body":"Yes, but...		1. If those same domains also aggregate or link to content elsewhere, you add the entire domain to a ban list.  THAT is the big problem.  This completely ignores the way most modern political sources on the Internet work... which is to produce some original content, but also links and quotes and summaries of other news, for discussion and aggregation within *their* *own* community that may not have seen the information otherwise.  If half the content from a domain is "rehosted", that may make it inappropriate to post here, but it doesn't make it a morally flawed domain, and it doesn't mean the other half isn't very appropriate.		2. There's a very over-zealous definition of "rehosted" in use.  Sources that quote other content specifically for the purpose of *refuting* it have been nixed as "rehosting".

{"body":"Alright, so on to the question at hand. I believe TheRedditPope gave you a pretty good run-down already, though that comment had to be removed because it gave too much away with regards to the answers.		Anyways, as I am sure you are aware some of the sites on the ban list are banned by the admins (i.e. Nbcnews.com, edition.cnn.com, Cbsnews.com, etc). You can see a [user-created list here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/28d487/meta_the_reddit_admins_employees_automatically/)		/r/politics filters domains, so that the submitter is informed as to why the submission was removed. For instance, if someone submits an article from Salon.com, it will be automatically removed as "rehosted". At the same time, automoderator will comment and ask the user to contact the mods if they believe the post was removed in error. We will review the submission again and then approve/remove as appropriate. 		The only domains that are banned outright are the admin banned domains and a few sites that have engaged in vote manipulation of /r/politics. 		Now in regards to the rehosted content question, this is an important rule for Reddit. The mods of /r/politics did not come up with the rule, it is actually a [Reddit-wide rule](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), but one that we choose to enforce.		It is particularly important because of the amount of traffic that Reddit can generate for a site. We want the original content creators to receive credit for their work. As long as something as significant, original analysis and content, we will generally allow it.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hoosakiwi","name":"t1_cjtpvv1","parent_id":"t1_cjtnoy0","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1408385720,"created_utc":1408382120}

I also figured you weren't right leaning (maybe fiscally you are, but not socially) due to the fact that most of the time I see you comment on this sub it is a social issue.  This leads me to believe that you are more interested in the social issues of politics and overall equality than the fiscal issues. 		Also, I prefer to find political lean through social views, not fiscal.  It is very common to find someone who identifies as socially liberal but fiscally conservative.  There aren't many people who identify as fiscally liberal but socially conservative.  This is because there is somewhat of a connection between social conservatism and fiscal conservatism (from what I have seen).  		Finally, when it comes to fiscal issues, there is no one right answer.  This makes it practically impossible to judge someone based on their fiscal views.  Reducing the funding for a lot of different things to save money?  Yeah, we need that.  Raising revenue so we can make more money which would allow us to invest in the future?  Yeah, we need that too.  So sure someone might be fiscally conservative or fiscally liberal, but that is worthless when attempting to identify someone politically.

{"body":"An interesting misconception. See, when folks who break the rules here have moderator action taken against them, for example when someone has a post pulled for adding their own, sensationalist title, it's *really convenient* for them to simply blame the mods for "censorship" instead of taking personal responsibility for their actions. 		So, back to our title example... the mature thing to do would be to say "Oh, okay, I didn't see that rule, but I really want people to see this link and talk about it, so I'll resubmit it with the correct title." Very easy, right?		As mods, this is the response that we want to encourage. If a link was pulled because it's a rehosted article, or because it's blogspam, then we encourage folks to submit the original article or to find a stronger source. We'll even go so far as to *find* the original article and provide it so the OP can post it, sometimes.		But no, instead we have a tendency to get people who *fervently believe* that the mods are exerting some sort of bias. Usually claiming that we're somehow *against* their political affiliation. Frankly, this is sort of ridiculous because we don't care what political affiliations anyone on this sub carries, we just want folks to follow the rules, and we also have a system of checks and balances in place within the modteam to prevent that sort of partisan abuse. Nobody moderates on their political leanings.		Also, mod tools don't work that way; it would be quite impossible to exert any sort of slant or bias into the subreddit as moderators. We simply don't have those sorts of abilities and the subreddit's too large to go through and check every single link. We have a hard enough time checking whether the titles are correct and whether an article is rehosted; it would be quite impossible to expect anything to conform to an agenda.		Anyway, it's convenient to blame censorship rather than take personal responsibility, and then folks go on meta subs and complain about it, the meta subs eat that right up, and the cycle continues. We had someone on /r/Libertarian blatantly lie to that subreddit a week or so ago about their interaction with our moderators, but the post still got a ton of upvotes and a bunch of circlejerking about censorship.		We're working on our transparency by posting the rules conveniently in the sidebar, and with this quiz. It's our hope that if more people will *follow* the subreddit rules, that will mean less partisan nonsense, a stronger community overall, and hopefully better interactions between the mods and the community.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CedarWolf","name":"t1_cjzxyk4","parent_id":"t1_cjzq600","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1408978673,"created_utc":1408975073}

{"body":"While I'm sure some mods are pretty liberal (in accordance with reddit's demographic), the top active mod of /r/politics is fairly conservative (pro-gun, pro-death penalty, etc) and is an excellent mod.		People like to blame the mods for the content of the subreddit, but people forget that the mods only have one vote - they don't get to decide what hits the top of the subreddit (they only remove posts that break the objective rules). It's more difficult for people to blame the userbase at large because that's more of a faceless entity, and it's not as satisfying to yell into the void as yelling at particular people. 		There is no way for mods to change the partisan swing of a subreddit. That's up to the userbase if it wants to. Being a minority opinion on reddit can be hard (since majority opinions can be expressed a bit more aggressively without worrying about downvotes), but there isn't a good way to fix that. 		The best thing mods can do is remind users of reddiquette, which this quiz does (and the mods have reminded users of reddiquette in the past as well) - it's just that politics is a particularly divisive and emotional subject, so people are less willing to upvote something they disagree with. 		I have had several productive conversations in /r/politics with a number of conservatives who disagree with my political leanings, and that's slowly becoming easier to find. However, I wish we could work harder as a subscriber base in downvoting low-effort comments that are just posted to appeal to a particular popular opinion. Recently, on a post about a LAPD officer allegedly shooting a black man while he was lying on the ground, one of the top comments referenced [Christopher Dorner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dorner) in a positive light. I would hope we can get behind the notion that "killing people is wrong," no matter how much reddit hates police officers.

I'm not saying the mods here do this, but you absolutely can change the content of a subreddit by removing posts.

Unfortunately, what would need to happen is a complete cultural change of how voting is viewed on reddit, from "I agree/disagree" to "I see the effort put into this/I see little effort put into this".   Also, the userbase needs to grow in competency, which is required to even begin to make that determination, even when it has been culturally identified as the metric to use.

If that wasn't the case, they'd put more effort into forming educated opinions.  		All I can do is offer my perspective, which admittedly isn't very good in this subreddit since we have starkly different philosophies on how to manage people.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Aethe","name":"t1_cjuhqs9","parent_id":"t1_cjuhj41","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1408456357,"created_utc":1408452757}
