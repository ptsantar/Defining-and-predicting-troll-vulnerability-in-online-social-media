People talk about how Wilson was in fear for his life because he was 80 lbs lighter than Brown... but he had the SUV, the gun, mace, a baton, and training. When he was in the car and though Brown was going for his gun... OK. When Brown moves away... No. At that point, Wilson had ample opportunity to de-escalate, and he chose to kill with the gun, instead of other choices.			... Sorry about rambling on this side-topic, but I do feel that we argue the minutia in all of these situations instead of agreeing that there is still systemic racism, there are major power issue, cops in general are people and make mistakes, and we are not addressing any of this appropriately.
