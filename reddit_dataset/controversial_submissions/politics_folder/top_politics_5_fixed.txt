{"body":"Dude, this article is from yesterday.  The Protests before today were mostly fine outside of the Camden Yard Scuffle that was handled pretty damn well (Police officers were identifying agitators and taking them out of the peaceful crowds).  The news was covering it in Baltimore at least.  Today was another mess.  It was violent, not related to the previous protests, against all wishes of the family.  There was suppose to be ZERO protests today at the wish of the family b/c today was for the funeral.  This was not organized by any of the civic leaders of the black community.  This was youth led and youth dominated rioting, destruction of property, looting, and arson.  It was widespread.  They attacked police officers.  One of the youth's goal here was to make everyone else feel what it was like to be poor.  While the frustration is understandable, you do not take it out on the community who are trying to get by in life.  		I'm a Baltimorian, today was scary, humiliating, and downright infuriating that fucking idiots would try to destroy our city.  I don't care if they were motivated by the Freddie Gray death.  It was unacceptable.  		So if you are wondering why the News was covering the Baltimore Riots today instead of peaceful protests, its becasue there were none and not suppose to be any protests.","depth":0,"score":1465,"ups":1465,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"SapCPark","name":"t1_cqr4dkp","parent_id":"t3_343pv3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430198594,"created_utc":1430194994}
{"body":"I think many folks not familiar with Baltimore don't "get" what's going on there.		Baltimore is a majority black city with a black mayor and a black police commissioner. It has well to do, middle class, poor, and very poor black neighborhoods.		Reddit seems obsessed with totalizing concepts, in this case "the black community" which it seems to view alternately view as stoic victims or disturbing the public order		A man was killed in what may have been a miscarriage of justice. People from all walks of life and from across the city gathered in peaceful protest in opposition to what they felt was injustice. Then, the day of his funeral, when leaders of the protest called a halt in respect of the victim's family, members of the city's [bad element](http://www.copinthehood.com/2015/04/group-on-corner-disorderly-no-further.html) boiled out of the [worst parts](https://goo.gl/maps/7ixCN) of the city, fought the police, rioted, and looted in a display of anger, resentment, and aggression. 		The tired old canards of "blacks protesting against systemic white oppression by thuggish white police officers they have no democratic recourse against" or "black thugs target the public at large by disturbing the public order" don't have much of a place here. The protesters were (mostly) black, the rioters were (mostly) black and the areas hardest hit by these rioting/looting/arson are (again, mostly) black.		 I think there ARE lessons to be learned here; and these riots bring to light how desperately undeserved some areas of the inner city are. But, to draw up totalizing conclusions about African Americans from either the actions of the rioters or protesters reeks of a sort of stereotyping.","depth":1,"score":589,"ups":589,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"BrotherGantry","name":"t1_cqr7dbc","parent_id":"t1_cqr4dkp","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430206289,"created_utc":1430202689}

I don't know squat about anything in Missouri and i won't pretend to. But you can see the impoverished black youth have been looking for an excuse to fuck shit up just by looking at the crime we had last summer. There were random assaults  by groups of kids, they were trying to push people into the harbor, there were a few stabbings. All by this same demographic, young, black, and poor. Baltimore also has the "knock out game" where they will go some where and try and punch a random person hard enough to knock them out (then they'll upload videos to youtube).		BTW, I don't personally view this nearly as much of a race thing as a poverty thing. I can pretty much tell you that you're not really going to find too many middle class black kids out there. That's because all these kids are from the same neighborhoods, and make no mistake they're shit neighborhoods. 		I think there's a reason why it's the young that are coming out now as well. Baltimore chooses a model of law enforcement where they heavily investigate crimes in it's high tax base (and mostly white areas) and doesn't do a lot of enforcement in it's low tax base (mostly black and almost exclusively poor). If it's not a murder on north ave than it's not a crime.		But the kids who grow up on the shit side of the city I don't think they really know this. They know there's a divide in the city, but they think they can just get away with crimes (and franky in their neighborhoods they can). So they're angry and they've been coming over to places where they can make more trouble, not realizing the police response they'll get hit with. And I don't really think that highly of the BPD, if they admit so easily to giving Freddy a rough ride than they probably did much worse.

{"body":"Well in Baltimore the poor whites are more spread out, the poor blacks are much more densely packed. Also where the poor blacks and the poor whites live are very different. Poor whites near the city tend to live in Dundalk, Essex and Rosedale, which are all suburbs. They're not as nice as the higher income areas but they still get policed. And they're much less densely populated than the city.		Hispanics have done it as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Washington,_D.C._riot		Asians only make up 4.8% of the population (and statistically asians aren't poor), so they don't really have enough people to riot, nor do they have the density in most areas. And I believe asians are the 4th largest ethnic group, behind whites, blacks, and hispanics/latinos. To put this in perspective in 2000 Baltimore had just under 10k asians, about 11k hispanics, and 417k blacks.		In short only blacks have the proper mix of oppression, poverty, and population density to make a riot really happen. Let's say there are 1000 people rioting tonight (and it's probably less than that), that's 0.23% of the black population of the city. 0.23% of the hispanic population would be a riot of 25 people.","depth":7,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CrisisOfConsonant","name":"t1_cqr9x1i","parent_id":"t1_cqr9r0n","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430216278,"created_utc":1430212678}
{"body":">If this is a poverty thing why is this seen only in one group when all groups experience poverty?		Well, it *is* a race thing in the sense that the cultural history of each race's addition to the "melting pot" is fairly distinct, and that history colors the way a group tends to perceive matters of income equality/economic mobility.		It's definitely *about* perceptions of income equality/economic mobility - but those perceptions are systemically effected by a race's socioeconomic history and their current socioeconomic situation.		For impoverished white people, they look to the people with the money and see mostly white people, so they might see the system as unfair, but they see it in the sense of just being the luck of the draw, and eventually their number will come up. Not all of them, but a huge number of them - this is the "temporarily embarrassed millionaire," delusion at work. The majority of poor people aren't going to look at actual metrics of economic mobility, they are just going to see that the rich people tend to look like them, and draw conclusions from that. They also have the older generations of white people telling them over and over that that's how it is.		[2007 Economic Census](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/pdf/2011_02_08_bobslides.pdf) - Compare sales and receipts, or firm number for employer firms - since those numbers will correlate with perceptions of relative proportion of wealth owned and perceptions of who an employee's bosses/owners are, respectively.		For Hispanics, the explanation for the dearth of Hispanics with money seems to be the fact that the vast majority of Hispanic family lines are relatively new to the US, so outrage is dulled by the idea that, as time goes by and Hispanic lines have been in the US for longer, Hispanic wealth per capita will accumulate in families and begin to pull even with White wealth per capita. This is a sort of generational, longer-term version of the "temporarily embarrassed millionaire," delusion at work.		For Asian Americans, the situation is somewhat similar to Hispanics, but they are even closer to where impoverished white people are at, due to their relative economic success in the US, statistically speaking.		For Native Americans, the situation is closest to what it is for African Americans, because they've both been here in large numbers for a long time, except that the way reservations are set up as sovereign entities provides a sort of containment field or pressure release valve (depending on how you look at it) for the discontent with the plight of the impoverished in a capitalistic social order.		For the vast majority of impoverished African Americans, there are no factors that mitigate their perception of the inherent unfairness of being born into poverty in a capitalistic society, so they are the first group whose impoverished population's level of discontent with the state of economic affairs crosses the threshold where riots/systemic violence becomes a potential reaction.		Eventually, it will become bad enough that most other impoverished individuals start to drop those delusions but, right now, the reaction of the Black population to economic inequality in the US is a sort of canary in the mineshaft, due to the group's socioeconomic history within the US as a whole.","depth":7,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MemeticParadigm","name":"t1_cqrkhfs","parent_id":"t1_cqr9r0n","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430241530,"created_utc":1430237930}

{"body":"I don't have time for a well-thought out response here, but:  I can't read his paper, but quantitative analysis is a really bad way to measure this - that's primarily driven by staffing and budget, which the Executive has limited control over.  The quality and scope of case (which he also criticizes, admittedly) is what the Executive has power over, but that's highly subjective and very hard to measure meaningfully.  		It is, however, very easy to gauge morale.  And given how opaque, complex, and illogical the bureaucracy can be, I think that's a pretty good measure.  I'm also giving significantly more credibility to the people that actually do the job rather than a professor who decided to write a paper and some news articles, yes.  Lawyers generally go work at niches like the DOJ civil rights division because they believe in the job and want to be aggressive on these issues, so if they like or dislike their current leadership, I think that says a lot.		For three quick examples of challenges I would throw back at the author - first, I think he's glossing over the large number of amicus briefs they've been filing, which is a pretty efficient and effective way for them to push issues - the DOJ doesn't need to supply the lawyer for every case, there are plenty of really, really good civil rights attorneys in private practice.  He mentions that in his article, but I doubt it's part of his paper.   Second, I think he's also ignoring investigations - which I would *guess* are up significantly, even if that isn't leading to a comparable rise in litigation.  A lot of civil rights cases are very, very hard to prove up, so investigating a lot more marginal or difficult claims wouldn't necessarily get you that many more good cases.  Third, when the DOJ does step in, their position is much clearer and farther to the left on civil rights issues than they were previously - does anyone really think the Dubya administration would be aggressively challenging voter ID laws?		Edit/TL; DR:  You're absolutely right when you imply I'm just another casual observer shooting my mouth off based on some anecdotal evidence.  But at the very least, yes, there's a reasonable basis to conclude that the Obama DOJ is much more aggressive on civil rights issues even if that isn't panning out in a headcount of cases and payouts.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChickenDelight","name":"t1_cqreydg","parent_id":"t1_cqre6yx","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430232157,"created_utc":1430228557}

Non violence didn't work, our black president is a groomed pawn in the game, and they have no allies (white america) who happen to share the same soil.		I say this a lot and I'm sure you will disagree, but if civil rights never occurred and blacks were still lynched and hung without consequence, white people today would have no problem, stand by and watch, probably partake. The police force is some of the last ties we have to those good old days that many reminisce about such as the parents and grandparents of this generation.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RastaBuddha52","name":"t1_cqrkpdv","parent_id":"t1_cqreskg","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430241873,"created_utc":1430238273}

If you can show me a situation where a cop asked/told someone to do something, and they followed instructions, and then were killed I'll completely recant my point.

I'm not suggesting that it never happens, just that when it does it is prosecuted as it should be)		Also in specific reference to this angel that was Freddie, he has been arrested 22 times as an adult. In 7 years he was arrested 22 times. Let that sink in for a moment. 		22 times he was caught by police breaking the law. Several times I'm sure he went before a judge.

He didn't deserve to die, nobody is suggesting that. But his past actions make it really hard for me to believe that he was completely innocent in the situation. 		And from what I can understand from the story, he fled from police (and given his history I can understand why this would concern the police) and then he was chased and tackled by a cop.

At this point the police should have (as they admit) sought medical assistance. They didn't. But does that make them murderers? 		I'd like to believe that if Ferguson taught us anything it's that eye witness testimony isn't always what it seems. And the idea that they somehow folded him up to break his neck is insane.

{"body":"> From what I remember, Darren Wilson had no record of racist or prejudiced behavior. He was just another average cop.		He wouldn't have a record. Before Chief Jackson took over the Ferguson police department, they did not keep non-fatal force complaints in an officer's personnel file and complaints were not investigated. So an officer not having a disciplinary record doesn't mean much in Ferguson - of course they wouldn't, the paperwork doesn't actually exist in their file. Also, with the Henry Davis incident in 2009 (the man who was arrested because of mistaken identity, beaten in his jail cell, and then charged for bleeding on the cop's uniforms), the department had the officers commit perjury in their depositions of the incident. I don't hold too much stock in the Ferguson police department giving an accurate view of their officers and their behavior/actions.		A black woman who'd had a run-in with Wilson about a month before Mike Brown was shot was interviewed during the protests, and told CNN that while she was trying to wash mace out of her eyes, Wilson cussed her out, repeatedly telling her to "shut the fuck up" and "sit the fuck down." 		Also, Wilson was fired from the Jennings police department before he came to Ferguson, along with the rest of the officers, because the entire department was so filled with racial tension, corruption, and brutality issues that the city decided to clean house and build a new credible department from scratch. They allowed the officers to re-apply for their old jobs; Wilson wasn't hired back. While he didn't have an official police record of any incidents, I'm sure a corrupt department A) wasn't writing officers up very often, so who knows what his complete behavior was while he was with them, and B) wouldn't have been a great place to learn how to be a good police officer.","depth":4,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alittlepunchy","name":"t1_cqrftx5","parent_id":"t1_cqr7js8","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430233820,"created_utc":1430230220}

I'm not claiming they're doing so in this case, but it's something to be aware of.    		More relevantly, there are some logical fallacies at work in your statement.  		1.10,100 mostly unrelated people have a problem.  10,000 bring it to your attention. 100 start a riot.  The peaceful protesters are doing nothing wrong, it's misguided(albeit common) to blame the protesters for the actions of rioters, and the fallacy is known as "guilt by association."		2.If you were part of a peaceful protest would you go up against a bunch of violent, armed thugs covered in leather and gas masks? I know I wouldn't.  This is probably best labeled an "Unwarranted assumption fallacy" - The assumption being that the protesters have both the *ability* and *responsibility* to control armed criminals, and lack only the will.  Full irony gets awarded that the people they're protesting are the very ones whose job it is to keep the streets safe during the protest. Such is life.  		3.You didn't bring this up specifically, but it's worth mentioning.  The statement, "If there hadn't been a protest, there wouldn't be a riot" may be true, but it does not mean "The protest caused the riot." (!A->!B) !-> (A->B)  Those people decided to riot at the same time for their own reasons - most likely because the police would be stretched thin.  	This is a form of the "correlation proves causation" fallacy.

{"body":"White people in North America riot over the silliest things, generally sporting events. This is never widely reported and the police response is far less violent. 		However, when a marginalized group that would have a clearer interest in challenging the ruling order riots as a response to the aforementioned subjugation and domination the media and police response is a different story.		I would also like to bring the attention of anyone reading this to a bit of historical evidence to back up my previous assertion.		In the United States today there are dozens of local "constitutionalist" or Christian right militias -primarily or entirely composed of white folks- that are armed and often trained. However, aside from a few exceptions, these militias are allowed to exist unmolested.		However, paramilitary organizations composed primarily of ethnic minorities with the intent of defending their communities and people from the state -often together with a anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist sentiments- have been ruthlessly targeted and harassed by the state. The Black Panther Party is the most well-known example; they armed themselves in order to protect black communities from police brutality and to struggle for their liberation together with other groups such as the American Indian Movement, the Young Lords (a Puerto Rican liberation movement), and the Young Patriots (an interesting organization composed of poor Appalachian whites who upheld socialism and the fight against racism). All of these groups were targeted by the state as part of COINTELPRO. Granted, COINTELPRO was nominally targeted far-right and white nationalist groups, but this was symbolic at best.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Llanganati","name":"t1_cqr587j","parent_id":"t3_343pv3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430200507,"created_utc":1430196907}

It's not about the current outcome, it's about the potential of what could happen.  Large groups of people will always attract a few bad seeds. It doesn't matter that the vast majority of protestors were peacefully protesting.  It's "White Cops vs. Black Men" which will attract a few agitators who aren't there to change the social culture, rather, to exploit the situation for their own ends.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"behindtimes","name":"t1_cqr20y0","parent_id":"t3_343pv3","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1430194116,"created_utc":1430190516}
