The title IMHO should not just be considered "OK" because - 		1) In the actual event in the article what the candidate actually stated on Fasttrack, as reported in the article itself, was not "evasive" but a negation of Fasttrack. And it certainly was not part of a "contined evasion of questions."		2) The Reddit title completely leaves out the event that actually occurred, the event from which the real article is drawn and instead focuses on an earlier time period brought up in the article.   		3) The title also removes the fact that it (the title) is an opinion mentioned within the article, not representative of what was done in reality, or during the event.		4) It does 3) by removing the front part of the sentence.  			Can we still challenge an unrepresentative title, even if it's a continuous quote?		I liked the Title + : + "quoted-quote" because that was at least clear and much less likely to mislead.
