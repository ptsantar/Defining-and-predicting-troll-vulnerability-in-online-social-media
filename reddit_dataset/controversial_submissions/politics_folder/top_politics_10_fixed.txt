{"body":"Dear Democrats:		I realize that some of you may be less than thrilled with the prospect of Hillary Clinton becoming your nominee.  For that, you have only yourselves to blame.  Since January 21 of 2009, the Republican Party has been running full steam ahead in their quest to get one of their own back in the White House.  Granted, most of the candidates they've put forth shouldn't be allowed to take a tour of the White House let alone live there, but at least they're **trying.**		You all did an admirable job lining up to vote for Obama in 2012, but got complacent in the mid terms just like you did in 2010.  Complacency kills, especially when you're allegedly the "progressive" party, and unlike your compatriots on the right wing, you haven't even been thinking about your next Presidential candidate.  Unless she gets hit by her own campaign bus, Hillary Clinton is going to be your nominee.  Not because she's the best person for the job, but because you couldn't be bothered to look for someone else.		I'm sure reading articles like the above one gives you a sense of comfort, thinking that you won't even have to try all that hard to keep a Republican out of the White House, but if you really want that outcome, you have to remember that this has happened before.			Once upon a time, there was another member of Team Clinton that ran for President.  The Democrat in the White House had survived a rocky second term, but the economy was doing pretty good and everyone thought it would be a cakewalk, so they just said "ah, fuck it...we've got this" and didn't try as hard as they could have.			This attitude (and possibly some shenanigans in Florida) led to the shoe-in Democratic candidate having to concede the White House to the mediocre son of a mediocre former President.  I think we all know how that worked out.			There is, of course, no guarantee that 2016 will be Round Three of Team Bush v Team Clinton, but if you don't want the GOP Clown Car to pull up to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and dump any of the occupants on the front door, put your apathy and complacency in a "lock box" and vote.","depth":0,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gogojack","name":"t1_cqa0tgj","parent_id":"t3_32cezn","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428868958,"created_utc":1428865358}
{"body":"TELL IT!			It's about time we started to look at ourselves as the biggest part of the problem with American politics.		Politics isn't about pressing a magic button on election day marked "Obama" or "Sanders" then patting yourself on the back for "all your hard work" and sitting on your asses in the next midterm -- allowing republicans to take the House, the Senate, and 26 state governments, where they can gerrymander their way to an unbeatable single-party dominance.		Politics is hard work.  Politics requires that you make intelligent choices and compromise when you have to.		And most of all:  **Politics is struggle.**  There are no magic buttons.

{"body":"I'm not entirely convinced by this generalization both philosophically and empirically.		Using Barack Obama as an example, it's temping to say something like, "black people voted for Obama because he's black" because about 92% of black people voted for Obama. But it turns out that about 90% of black people vote Democratic no matter who's running: In 2004 88% percent of blacks voted for Kerry and 90% voted for Gore in 2000. So maybe about 2% of black people who wouldn't have voted for him otherwise did so for some reason. _Maybe_ because it was because he was black. Maybe it's because they just plain liked him. And honestly I can't imagine there were a whole lot of people in the U.S. of African descent who said to themselves: I am a pro-life, pro-gun, small government state's rights Conservative and Barack Obama stands for everything I don't but I'm going to vote for him anyway because his skin color is closer to mine than the other guy's.		Translating that to Hillary, I don't think the "she's a woman" will garner her more votes than normal. Imagine for a second that Hillary doesn't run but Sarah Palin does. There is no way that everyone who was going to vote for Hillary is going to vote for Sarah Palin "because she's a woman". If you're pro-gay marriage, pro-choice and believe in universal healthcare and taxing capital gains at the same rate as personal income, you're probably not voting for Sarah Palin over a male Democrat who shares those values.		So getting back to the stats, just over half of women (about 54%) generally vote Democrat. 54% voted for Clinton in 1996, 54% voted for Gore in 2000, 51% voted for Kerry in  2004, 55% voted for Obama in 2008 and 56% voted for Obama in 2012. So I think you could expect a mild swing on the order of 2-3% towards Hillary from Women. _However_ you would just as likely also a see a swing _away_ from Hillary of a roughly equal percentage of swing-voting males voting for the male candidate, making it a wash. 		But when you look at Hillary's other demographics (white and over 65) the question of influence over vote as ascribed to identifying with the candidate could gets a bit more interesting. Old people and especially old white people vote Republican by HUGE margins: 65+ voters (22% of the electorate) voted GOP by a margin of 16 points. And white people over 45 (53% of the electorate[!]) voted Republican by an astounding 26 point margin. 		If Hillary has any advantage going into 2016 based on her demographics it's not her gender; it's her age and race. If there's any group that puts her in the white house based solely on identity politics it's the one that makes up half the electorate and identify with her because she's old and white and not because she's a woman. If she pulls half of the electorate that won't vote for Obama just a couple of points her way, the game is over.","depth":1,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SomeNorCalGuy","name":"t1_cqa04xx","parent_id":"t1_cq9xopc","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428867704,"created_utc":1428864104}

Things aren't all hunky-dory until all of a sudden, some village idiot from Texas jumps up and yells "WAR!" and shazam! All of a sudden you have a war on, you know.  No, there's always a historical context to them. They're a long time in developing.		What you think of as a war that Bush started in 2003 by invading Iraq was actually started by his father, in 1991, when in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the US govt decided that it wanted to remove Saddam and "regime change" Iraq. Clinton pursued this goal by maintaining a sanctions regime that starved 500,000 Iraqi children to death, trying to foment unrest/revolt, perhaps assassinate SH if possible, and occasionally dropping bombs on Iraq.		To say that Clinton didn't have us in a war vs Iraq, while Bush got us into one, is like saying that an army that has surrounded a walled city, and is besieging it, trying to starve it into submission, isn't at war with that city, while if it attempts to actually assault the walls, pound down its gates with battering rams, etc, it's at war. That's simply just absurd. Both situations are clearly wars. Just different tactics and methods are being used.		The other major foreign policy landmine that Bill Clinton left for us was his policy of aggressively pushing into Russia's former sphere of interest, by expanding NATO.  Bush I had promised Gorbachev that if the USSR let East Germany go peacefully, the US/NATO would not seek to further encroach on the USSR's buffer zone/sphere of interest.  Bill Clinton is the president who reneged on that, and step #1 in starting the process of dismantling Russia's position in the Balkans & Eastern Europe was the neutralization of Serbia.  That process has finally borne fruit under Obama, when we find ourselves in a proxy war against Russia (the world's #2 nuclear armed power) in UKRAINE. Basically their back yard.  A foreign policy so insanely aggressive and neocon that it makes Bush's invasion of Iraq look like a sober, careful, well-deliberated, and conservative move.		> raised taxes on the rich.		What he really did was something like help them steal $1 trillion, then collect back $250bn of it.  Now all the naive people are going "ooooh look, he got $250bn from rich people! What a man of the people, that Bill!"		Clinton was basically a fascist.  The reason why more people don't realize that can be laid at the feet of that incredible prevarication machine, the Dem party propaganda apparatus, and their useful idiots, liberal & Dem partisan commentators.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"StopHitlary","name":"t1_cqab9a0","parent_id":"t1_cqa6icr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428888251,"created_utc":1428884651}
