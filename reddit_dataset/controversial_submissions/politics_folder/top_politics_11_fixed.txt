{"body":"i'm not sure what the best wording of the rule should be (a brainstorming meta thread would probably come up with some good ideas) but right now the rule is being applied very narrowly, and very partisanly.		there are very frequently stories that are quite obviously related to american politics that get removed for being "off topic", and there definitely seems to be a partisan bias towards what get removed (though there are on topic stories on both sides of the aisle getting wiped out.)		honestly, the best bet would be a more "hands off" approach, where something that is kind of "gray area" and has some merit is left alone and "off topic" is reserved for blatantly off topic posts.		unfortunately, "off topic" is something that really depends more on the enforcement than the actual wording, and the current enforcement has been really bad.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"reaper527","name":"t1_csmm8h8","parent_id":"t1_csmkz5s","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435604867,"created_utc":1435601267}

{"body":"* Example A: "Obama, while while doing his laundry, said that carrots are evil." Can be more clearly stated for the purpose of a title as "Obama . . . said that carrots are evil"		* Example B: "Obama said that carrots are evil, while doing his laundry."  Can be shortened to "Obama said that carrots are evil."		* Example C: "While doing his laundry, Obama said that carrots are evil." can be shorted to "Obama said that carrots are evil."		Am I correct in understanding that B and C would be acceptable but not A?  All three formulations of the sentence are identical in meaning and can be reduced to the same main idea.  If I wanted to use A as a topic title, would I be forced to include the bit about Obama's laundry?","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"VelvetElvis","name":"t1_csn9801","parent_id":"t3_3bidxv","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435645171,"created_utc":1435641571}

{"body":"It has to be an unbroken quote. We have tried in the past to allow such things but it allows for too much monkey business and makes the decision subjective as to what is and isn't distorting the meaning of a quote.  	In some cases it already is tough to determine whether the quote used in a title reflects the article as a whole, as quotes used as titles are required to. If the quote is does not stand on its own in terms of context, then it probably should not be used as the title for the article since it more than likely does not reflect the article as a whole.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"L_Cranston_Shadow","name":"t1_csokckz","parent_id":"t1_csn915y","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435752512,"created_utc":1435748912}
