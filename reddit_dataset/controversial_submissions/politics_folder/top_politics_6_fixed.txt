We've taken a more peaceful approach to the turmoil in the middle east, and where military intervention was considered necessary were able to narrow that intervention to use of drone strikes rather than commit additional troops.  However rocky, we have Obamacare laws reforming health care to require insurance meet some basic coverage standards, and providing an alternative where the free market refuses to play ball.		But there are some pretty significant misses, too.  In 2008 we were promised by Obama that his administration would support transparency and open government.  But here as we approach 2016, petitions on whitehouse.gov are a joke, Gitmo remains open despite questionable torture tactics, and whistleblowers like Manning and Snowden are either in prison or exile, while previous leaders like Bush and Cheney that allowed and encouraged torture remain free.		So Hillary, if you want my vote, tell your buddy Obama to deliver on his campaign promises.  Amnesty for Snowden and Manning and any other whistleblower that comes forth with information that the government is LYING to its own people.

{"body":"Not saying I expected him to 'completely enforce all of his campaign promises.'		Saying I expected him to not compromise to the point that many of the bills lost their entire sense of purpose.		Consider the stimulus.  Originally slated to be a primarily infrastructure rebuilding bill to replace the majority of the jobs lost (laborers) by funding necessary highway and other transportation repairs.  What we got was half tax cuts, 25% pet projects for democratic senators, and about 25% actual infrastructure spending.		Consider the ACA.  What we were sold on was a public option.  House passed one.  Senate didn't, because Ben Nelson was a dick about it.  There are many tools available to a sitting president to make things happen: threaten to veto anything without a public option, tell Harry Reid to strip Nelson of the benefits he had gained over the years, et cetera.  None of this was done.   What we got is arguably worse than nothing, because it removes the impending financial cliff that would have driven real reform without actually implementing the changes that would give us long-term stability--it's a band-aid that keeps us afloat, but effectively removes the motivation to have the surgery that fixes the problem.		Consider his promise to limit the revolving door of lobbyists.  He just ignored that one outright.  That one was not subject to republican obstructionism; it was something he could have done on his own.  He chose not to.		Consider Guantanamo bay.  He promised that our actions there would stop.  Republicans couldn't stop him from closing it; that's within his power as commander-in-chief.  He did not.  		I could go on.  Obama delivered on many things and I am not miserable with him as a president, but I am wary of democrats campaigning as being solidly to the left of center, because his administration was not.		And I am frustrated that our total debt grew greatly during this time (not solely his fault--he inherited a huge deficit, but all his deficit reduction since has still not cut it to the level of two years prior during the Bush admin which is reflective of large permanent spending increases), yet the average American household is not much better off for it.  We are lucky that market fears and federal reserve action have kept interest on our debt low.  Most of our debt isn't of the long-term variety.  A spike in our interest rate could dramatically raise our deficit again.

{"body":"**That's actually an issue with the primary process more than anything else.** You have to survive two different forms of voter "vetting" during the U.S. presidential election process, assuming you're doing so as your party's nominee (or nominee-to-be). Your party's own voters have to approve of you during the primaries, and then the general population and the electors representing them have to approve of you.		**Here's the thing: The overwhelming majority of party members don't vote during the primaries; it's almost exclusively the party diehards.** Most Republicans and Democrats really don't care strongly enough about politics to vote in their party primaries; it's a very small minority who votes. The result is that winning a primary means moving further (or more accurately, *appearing* to move further) to the right or left than you really are. By their very nature, primaries drive each candidate toward more extremist public statements, because it's either that or watch the party nominations go to someone else *purely because of the nature of the voting base.*		Once you secure the nomination, now you have to run back to the center to appeal to other voters, because (as you point out here) appealing to your party diehards means the rest of the country won't give you the time of day. Political commenters have previously described this as "Fake right, run left" and vice versa.		So we wind up with the following effects:		 - Centrists like McCain and Obama are forced to exaggerate the degree of affection they actually have for hard "right" or "left" policies.	 - Party diehards complain without fail in each election that their nominees "lied" to them or flip-flopped immediately after winning the party nomination. (They don't seem to realize that the behavior they describe is basically the result of their own voting patterns and the extreme lack of interest that most party members have in the primaries. Then again, political extremists aren't known for their intelligence.)	 - Moderate voters with half a brain usually don't start paying attention to the election in earnest until after the primaries are over.	 - People outside of the U.S. think that people like Rick Santorum might actually be electable because they occasionally do well in smaller, non-binding state primaries that attract a few hundred or few thousand voters. And Ted Cruz is just as unelectable as Santorum was.","depth":9,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cenodoxus","name":"t1_cqabcbo","parent_id":"t1_cqa8vh8","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428888410,"created_utc":1428884810}

There's a complete absence of acknowledging similar incidents under other leaders or actionable policies that would prevent it from reoccurring. It's clearly political, and it was a desperate move for '12 election that's outlived its usefulness. That's why it wont stick.		The problem is that conservatives invent a new scandal every 6 months.

They said: "Well, these are the people that have the qualifications." And I said: "Well gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?" And we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: "Can you help us find folks?" And they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet, and my senior staff, the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.		He wasn't even saying HE has "binders"-- but that women's groups were bringing him full resumes with qualified women, showing that his states had more women in leadership than others because his policies were more pro-gender equality.

Because they are responsible for at least half the problems that Americans and the willfully ignorant media blame on the President.  Patriot Act?  Couldn't have happened without Congress.  Iraq?  Couldn't have happened without Congress.  Government shutdowns since Clinton?  100% Congress.  Closing Guantanamo?  Oh yeah.  Obama literally did everything in his power, and then Congress shot it down.  Tax policy?  The President can only sponsor it.  Congress crafts it and passes it before the President gets his/her hands on it.  On and on.  Defense contracting?  Do you really think that the President does anything about that?  That's a budget policy.  Which goes to the legislature.  Congress.  You want more?  Okay, same sweetheart deals with energy lobbies.  Again, the President only sponsors environmental action.  Yet we treat him like he's an action movie star King come election year.		So go ahead and lament for poor Mitt Romney's raw deal that he in no way earned.  I for one don't have time for that.  Because first all, he did earn it.  Every bit of it.  And second, you're crying up the wrong tree.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"laxt","name":"t1_cqaltg4","parent_id":"t1_cqairb2","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428911946,"created_utc":1428908346}

{"body":"Well, I can sum it up. We have a multi-party system; The AKP (Religious right-wing party that's currently in power) has had approx. 45%-49% of the votes in the last four elections, after that there is CHP (which is the left-wing party that you HAVE to vote for if you don't want religious or fascist parties in power) has around 26-32% percent of the votes. After that you have some smaller ones.		The lefties are definitely the "good" party to vote for, the problem is they appear lazy, and the last time they were in power they didn't do so well. Not on the social issues but the economics and other actually important stuff. 		"Decent" people(I include everyone who doesn't want AKP in power) have little choice but to vote for CHP even if they don't share their ideologies, some go for independent candidates but even if they get in the "senate"(we don't have a senate but something quite similar) they don't have the power to change anything by themselves. 		Now that doesn't mean half of the country is bigoted and want an anti-west government in power(I mean it kinda does but--), they are the more rural and uneducated areas and Erdogan (the guy at the head of the AKP) has that "man of the people" feel for them, which means he reacts like an uneducated person would, he uses media to blame the protest or any criticism against himself or his political party to "outside influences" who want to weaken Turkey. People eat this right up, they trust him because "he is our President" or some other nonsensical, uninformed excuse.

We (officially) don't help ISIS. The fighters getting across the border were kurdish fighters who wanted to join the fight but they stopped that too. Turkey has taken in over 2 million Syrian refugees and believe me that's not something you should take lightly. 2 million is a big number, and its causing problems with anti-immigration people. Turkey has a long history with kurds, it's not something that's started with ISIS, it's been going on 30-40 years now. 		In the last few years, Turkey has trying a so-called "peace solution", which involves Kurdish "terrorists"(I mean from the perspective of the government they are terrorists, from a Kurdish perspective they are freedom fighters) laying down arms and negotiating a solution to this mess. It's a long process and it's not going so smoothly. If Turkey helps defeat ISIS and they succeed, then the Kurdish people will finally have the chance to have an official Kurdistan which will strengthen their hand in the negotiation with Turkey, and they don't want that. There's also the fact that we are VERY close to ISIS geographically, unlike any other country who chose to bomb them from the sky.		We don't hate the kurds, but you have to look at it from a normal persons point of view. If you just watch the news, an ordinary person sees Kurds as people living in the eastern regions of the country and using guerilla tactics to thematically kill of Turkish soldiers and attack convoys. The media and the government branded them terrorists and 20 years of this builds up a prejudice in an everyday persons head.

I think you're really giving the typical American far, far more credit with interpreting symbolism than is warranted. 		> there's literally no way of using Reductio ad absurdum type argumentation because it's very very literally already the most absurd and stupid design choice possible.		"A swastika would have been a better design choice."  -- 		Like that? 		I think the flag thing is dull and uninspired, but I don't think it's really as bad as you're saying. I mean, I could think it was the second-worst designed thing ever, and it still wouldn't be as bad as you're saying. That by the way is a decent litmus test for another philosophy concept that you may want to familiarize yourself with: hyperbole. 		People read left to right, we play (older, and now platform) games left to right. Those connections are much easier to make for *most*, but not all people than understanding the political implications of a democrat using right-leaning iconography on their logo. 		Also, when the arrow points to the right, it can be used to point directly at talking points, pictures, whatever else is on the page -- if the arrow points left, it's constantly pointing off page. If you want to talk about the *design* of the thing, don't conflate it with its political implications; design is as much utility and mechanics (in a sense) as aesthetics and symbolism.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"addledhands","name":"t1_cqai1lm","parent_id":"t1_cqaf3m9","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428901455,"created_utc":1428897855}

I think it's a bad thing that he ramped it up, but technically war hawk doesn't have to be a bad thing in one's mind. People can genuinely agree with his military actions, but he can still be deserving of the title. 		Sometimes war is necessary. But the War on Terror that we are fighting, is just a never ending war, with a completely unattainable goal. If the goal is to eliminate terrorism, that will never happen. So we have a choice; either go toward that goal, which will never be achieved, and stay there forever, or cut and run, because maybe our intervention is *causing* the terrorism. 		>Drone strikes, yes. That happened. Not going to argue on that. Except for that with any military solution, how it's handled makes all the difference in world.		Drone strikes have trivialized war; Obama has expanded through them, the battlefield to places like Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. If we dropped a huge bomb in any of these places, there would be outcry. Drones are secretive and quiet, and there's disagreement over whether they are considered war; which I think that they are.		>There was not a single instance of the President speaking about sending American troops to Syria. American intelligence and air support? Obviously. But if you can't tell the difference (aside from that fact that this means by definition that he wasn't interested in declaring war in Syria), then you're not a big enough boy/girl for this conversation.		So? 'Warhawk' doesn't necessarily mean that he's always for sending troops in. Airstrikes, intelligence, etc. He's in fact already launched airstrikes in Syria, against ISIS, likely breaking the AUMF. More of this Middle East intervention is helping to create the terrorist threat there; Obama is not changing that. 				>Please don't mistake my reply with the notion that I think you know what you're talking about.

Hillary's policy record.  FTAs are not progressive. Ditto domestic spying; ditto more military conflicts. And she's way too chummy with Wall St. to expect any new regulation there.

I would argue (as others on the Left have) that the fault for the ever rightward shift of American politics for the better part of a decade lies with the so-called "Centrist" wing like yourself insisting on a strategy of compromise for the sake of compromise because doing so made sense 20+ years ago when the political landscape looked drastically different.

The thing is that every time I see someone say "I agree with everything he says but he'll never win," I imagine all those people following through and voting for him and suddenly small, incremental anecdotes start snowballing into an actual movement, where people begin to realize that, hey, if we all vote for the guy we agree with, there's really not a reason to believe he can't win.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alanpugh","name":"t1_cqarfy1","parent_id":"t1_cqambfq","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428933965,"created_utc":1428930365}

{"body":"***Full Disclosure: I am a paid consultant for the Draft Biden PAC.***		Actually, I thought it was sub-par, and I make viral videos for a living, including some political commercials and online announcement videos. 		The video is 2:15.  She doesn't even show up until 1:30. The first 90 seconds show a bunch of smiling people - 80% smiling women, I happen to notice - and not much else. 		As a TV ad, maybe this would work. Maybe even as a convention ad. But online, you don't want to waste anyone's time. Think about it- what do all the viral videos you've seen have in common? They get right into the start.  		Does anyone want to go and watch that a second time? Or even share it with their friends?  Would you even have known about it if it wasn't HRC's announcment video?  		As for the content, it is slickly produced, and it's clear that the video is targeting her strong demographics - women, Hispanics, and blue-collar manufacturing industry. But the video was SO full of "smiling people" and so slickly produced, and so well... like every other political ad you've ever seen except it somehow says even less despite taking five times the amount of time... that I'm wondering if this won't backfire. It didn't *say* anything other than: "See! I'm Hillary Clinton! I'm a woman! Like you! And I'm running for President!" 		Look, I obviously have a dog in the fight here. Only Ted Cruz seems to be worse than Hillary Clinton on the BIG issue - the undue influence of money in politics which is grinding everything in Washington to a dead-halt.

Claiming voting third party is wasting a vote and as bad as not voting shows you don't know anything except what you were told in your couple of GE classes.

It's people like YOU that are the problem, that prevent real change from succeeding by denying it a chance to succeed before it even begins.  This is why sometimes, even with the writing on the wall, things have to get worse before they get better.		I proposed two options (and neither of them was not voting): change the system now for the better (voting third party) or expose the insanity of the system, make it worse until enough people are willing to get involved to cause change.  Your path is stagnation, and I don't want to live in the society that you propose we maintain, I want a better one, a brighter future.  Even at the risk of it having to first get worse.		You can quit trying to paint your opinion as more logical, you've done it in every reply, but it doesn't make it any more true.  Your opinion is preservationist, it's the opinion of someone scared of how much worse it could be and afraid to lose what little you have, without considering how much you and your fellow human beings who share this planet with you have to gain.  You've had a defeatist attitude from the beginning, you've ignored my points and alternative paths, and continued to espouse the view that a slow slide down into shit is better than the alternatives.  I disagree.  I would rather gamble on real change.  If that means that we fail and things get worse, then I predict next time more people will come out and demand real change, like the changed we were promised when we voted in Obama.  This slow slide into oblivion is like trying to watch successive generations of a species evolve and determine at what point the child was a different species than its parent, we'll never see the break point that we so desperately need to finally incite people to change.  Because at some point, this change must happen, it is inevitable.  And I, for one, don't want to pass on the responsibility to future generations.

Remember because of the incumbency advantage that this person is going to be in office for most likely eight years. I don't want to see a third Bush administration, I don't want a Bush to appoint supreme Court justices, and I don't want a unified Republican congress and executive. That's why this is important.

When Hillary was the one who supported the Iraq War and all Patriot Acts. When Hillary was the one lying about dodging snipers in Bosnia.

When Hillary was the one against violent videogames and wanted to control them because they make "children violent" and stirred shit about the GTA hot coffee scandal. When Hillary served in the Walmart board for 6 years and received more contributions from Walmart than any other politician.		When Hillary just stayed with her husband after she was cheated, just because she had political ambitions. She was considered a cold, calculating machine. When Hillary was fired from the Watergate investigation because of "lying, unethical behaviour". When Hillary was against gay marriage(but now suddenly she is all for it!!!).		When Hillary ordered US diplomats to spy each other and other diplomats. When Hillary oversaw a effort to block investigations regarding US tortures in Spain. When Hillary not only bypassed government security mail standards but also deleted those mails. I bet it was because she wanted to be so transparent /s		Anyway, this whole thing is hilarious.

{"body":"If she wins the nomination, I'll be voting third party. In fact, I'd sooner write in "Jim Lahey" for President. I live in a non-swing state, so I do not have to worry about invoking the "spoiler effect". I recommend that any of you who do live in a swing state vote for Hillary. While she's very conservative, there are a few key issues (mostly Supreme Court), where it'd be preferable to have her to a Republican on. Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg have both gone on record as saying that finding any differences is necessary in a swing state.		I have no idea who will be running for the third parties, but I cannot imagine that they're won't be a more liberal candidate than Clinton. The reason I'll be doing this is because Hillary shouldn't get the votes of progressives unless it's **necessary**. She clearly hasn't earned them; in my view, she's a Wall St. stooge and hawk, and a continuing of Obama's center-right governance (even more conservative than Obama). 		People may ask, "what do you hope to accomplish by voting third party"? I think I can accomplish more in my non-swing state than voting for Hillary. There are several reasons. 		First, let me say that my preference is that a real progressive challenges Hillary. If someone like Bernie, or anyone to the left challenges her in the primary, you can bet I'll work tooth and nail to get them elected. But Hillary, if in all likelihood wins the nomination, my plan is to vote third party. 		1. Attention for a third party can help to raise conversations on issues the two parties wouldn't otherwise touch. As Chris Hedges says ["It was the Liberty Party that first fought slavery. It was the Prohibition and Socialist parties, along with the Suffragists, that began the fight for the vote for women and made possible the 19th Amendment. It was the Socialist Party, along with radical labor unions, that first battled against child labor and made possible the 40-hour workweek. It was the organizing of the Populist Party that gave us the Immigration Act of 1924 along with a ???progressive??? tax system. And it was the Socialists who battled for unemployment benefits, leading the way to the Social Security Act of 1935. No one in the ruling elite, including Franklin Roosevelt, would have passed this legislation without pressure from the outside."](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/why_im_voting_green_20121029). In Germany, the Green Party inspired people to care about the environment, without actually winning many seats. Third parties can affect change, even if they don't win.		2. [If third parties receive only a few percent of the vote, they can qualify for matching funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_fund). I think that this is a good step in establishing another viable option. 		3. I think that this will send an actual message to the Dems that they need to pull to the left. Not voting and staying at home doesn't really make that message clear. If they see that the Green Party or another liberal party, gets more votes than in years past, they will see that it's liberals they're losing the vote from.		Of course, if New Jersey starts to look in danger, I'll vote for Hillary, but that's unlikely. I won't be voting Democrat in other races, unless the Democrat is a truly qualified candidate, or if the election is very close.","depth":0,"score":186,"ups":186,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ben1204","name":"t1_cqa5ekr","parent_id":"t3_32czwg","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428877211,"created_utc":1428873611}

{"body":"Excellent post.  I get so annoyed at people saying I'd be wasting my vote or playing spoiler if I vote third party.  The legitimacy and fairness of that argument is debateable to begin with, but even if you buy that argument it completely ignores the reality of the electoral college system.  Around 40 of the 50 states are not even in contention.  If you live in one of those 40 states you are wasting your vote by voting either major party because you are helping maintain the status quo of your states' irrelevance in presidential politics.		The odds of a 3rd party growing large enough to seriously threaten the big 2 are slim, but that is not really the point.  If a third party starts eating up 10 percent of the vote, it will force one of the two main parties to shift their positions to accommodate the 3rd party voters.","depth":1,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bodiwire","name":"t1_cqacejj","parent_id":"t1_cqa5ekr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428890346,"created_utc":1428886746}

How are you defining "the center" in American politics except as the median of current political views in America?  Is it the center at some point in the past (was FDR's era the "true" definition of where the center was)?  Is it the center of the EU, and America is just wrong and bad?		If the former, do you not believe the center moves?  Or does it move on some issues (gay rights) and not others?  *Or* is there some inherent "true" center that you have somehow been keyed in to by divine inspiration?		If the latter, the population of America is roughly 3/4ths that of the EU.  So if the real center is somewhere between "the center of political views in the EU" and "the center of political views in the U.S", it should swing somewhere significantly to the *right* of where centrist candidates in the EU stand.","depth":1,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BolshevikMuppet","name":"t1_cqag1e9","parent_id":"t1_cqa5ekr","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428897269,"created_utc":1428893669}
{"body":"I recognize that the center moves, and that's actually the reason I'll vote third party. 		To be clear, I make the comparison of Obama to a center-right 90s Republican, or a European conservative because I think it's necessary that we challenge the current political spectrum. Now by American standards in 2015, could he be considered liberal, relatively speaking to the other politcians? Sure. But I think that in order to fix our system, I'm of the belief we need to pull the conversation left and challenge our current spectrum.		Now how will voting third party fix this? I think obviously, that not voting is a waste of time in shifting the conversation. The democrats could of course falsely assume "Oh, we're too liberal, we need more conservative voters". But I think that if they can see liberal third party, Green let's say, get some more votes (in a non-swing state, I don't want to spoil), then they'll notice the reason people aren't voting for them is because they're too conservative.		The center probably, is where you'd find a moderate European party (Liberal Democrats in the UK are the example I think of atm). On center right, you'd find European conservatives and American Democrats. Solid, hard right, you'd find Republicans. And center-left is where you'd find European social democrats.		I think gay rights is maybe an example of an issue where the center has moved to the left, but there are plenty where the center has moved to the right---for example, Nixon created the EPA under his administration, and used price controls during a recession.

Honest question: do you have *any* reason you believe that other than that you *like* where the center is in the EU?		>I think gay rights is maybe an example of an issue where the center has moved to the left, but there are plenty where the center has moved to the right		Well, there are a bunch, but that's kind of the point.

{"body":"The difference is that shit actually gets done and a parliamentary system actually puts more pressure on the legislature to perform better rather than letting them get away with everything. 		Your comment about the politics of Australia and Canada is kind of ignorant of what has happened in those countries.  In Australia, Labor was a hot mess of infighting which allowed the Liberal-National Coalition to sneak through and win the last election.  Polls are consistently showing now that the next election there will be a landslide for Labor again now that they've straightened up and the Liberals have made a mockery of themselves.  In Canada, which has FPTP not an instant runoff system, the next election will give Stephen Harper the boot as well.  Hell in Alberta, which is having an election right now and is the Conservative stronghold of the nation, the socialist aligned NDP is giving the PCs and Wildrose (two conservative parties)  a three way race for power.

{"body":"Its not about making him President.  It's about recognizing the system as it stands is corrupt to the core and willingly in the hands of corporate powers at the expense of the people.  		And yes it does work like that.  The Libertarian party reached a thresh hold and the movement inspired the tea party.  The tea party was co-opted, but it now exercises considerable influence within the Republican platform.  Several major agendas (in the Libertarian mindset) have become part of the Republican's stated policy.  These agendas would have been ignored without significant gains by the Libertarians. Arguably voting Libertarian served people of that mindset better than voting Republican at an earlier time ever would have, even if it took a few election cycles for results to materialize.  This voter support, in turn, allowed that party to much more effectively spread its message, which is now making a concrete impact on mainstream politics.		The point is that any significant chunk of voters becomes attractive and the parties will adjust accordingly.  If not, then those parties have an opportunity to gain momentum and eventually a status which ensures matching funds.   		Incremental change is better than not participating.  In my opinion it is better than supporting a non-choice between two parties that are fully supporting the military-industrial-war complex and the expansion of NSA power.		This is especially true if you live in a non-swing state where your vote is essentially otherwise meaningless. 		If a significant number of people can be convinced to position against the status quo then they will have to be taken seriously, as at the end of the day, its votes that determine who is allowed to be in power.  		I'm old enough to have voted in numerous elections, and there is no way in hell I'm going to vote to sustain the status quo.  Since neither party is willing to support a positive shift in direction on the issues that are important to me, I'm going to use my vote against them, to send a signal that change is necessary.  		Many people simply choose not to vote in this situation, this is the wrong answer and does not contribute to a solution.  Voting against my interests does not contribute to a solution either.  Supporting  and strengthening an upstart party is the only answer that makes sense in this situation.		By advocating this position, perhaps others will agree with me.  If enough people step up, then results will happen, at the minimum the groundwork will be set for the future.  		If the election comes down to Clinton vs. Bush, I think many people will understand the importance of this approach.   Voting for either of them at this point is wasting my vote, in my opinion.  If the Democrats or the Republicans want my support then they need to represent the people and not whoever is stuffing the most cash in their pocket.

{"body":"It depends on the issue.		Economically, I'll totally agree that Hillary Clinton is slightly right of center and she's almost indistinguishable from centrist Republicans. It's awful - but that's not the only issue.		On the military, same thing - Clinton is slightly right of center, not far off from Obama. Also awful.		Same with domestic / civil liberties. Tragic.		Socially, Hillary Clinton is reasonably left of center and way, way left of any Republicans. This is not at all insignificant - Republicans have been fighting gay marriage and gay rights, and successfully closing down abortion clinics in many states. While this is not the *only* issue I vote on, I think it's pretty important. I also know that the next president is very likely to fill one or more Supreme Court vacancies, and has the potential to totally swing the balance.		On Immigration, it really depends on who the Republican is - they're the least unified on this issue - but Clinton would definitely continue Obama's push towards a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, while most Republicans still suffer from the delusion that it would be possible to "completely" secure the border and that it'd be a good idea to deport pretty much anyone here illegally no matter what their circumstances.		On taxes, Clinton is quite different from Republicans. Even though she favors big business interests too much, she's consistently been in favor of lower taxes for the middle class and eliminating tax breaks and corporate loopholes for the very rich. This puts her completely at odds with the whole Republican party.		So there you have it. I would love to see someone more liberal than Hillary Clinton run and have a shot at winning. I am planning to donate time and money to get Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Al Franken, or someone else more liberal to make a valiant effort in the primary, hopefully win a few states - and heck, if Clinton has a major gaffe, I'd be thrilled if one of them won.		But if none of them win, I'm not going to make the argument that Clinton and the Republicans running are the same. They're not, by a mile. Clinton would be a better president, by far, than any of them.		A lot of Democrats made the mistake of assuming that because Bush and Gore said basically the same things on a lot of issues, there wasn't much of a difference. That was a big mistake. Bush went against nearly all of his centrist promises and governed from the right.

I think it'd be great if Bernie Sanders won the democratic primary, but we both know how controlled the democratic party is these days and it's nearly impossible to imagine Sanders winning the primary.		It's going to be Clinton vs some extremely bought-and-sold republican. I think Clinton is awful for the reasons in your first 3 paragraphs. I'm going to vote 3rd party because it seems like the only morally culpable thing to do. I can't hold my nose and pretend I agree with feeding the military-industrial complex more and more, as Hillary will. It's just too important an issue. Governments are being overthrown, people are dying, people's lives are being ruined in a very systematic way.

{"body":"Exactly. I would vote for that in a heartbeat. 		The difficulty is the libertarian party has been pushed very far to the right the last few years by people like the Koch Brothers and Sarah Palin. These right-libertarians do not like to play ball with the left-libertarians, who used to be the core of the party. Getting the right-libertarians (who now make up the large majority of the party) to agree with anything that has the word "progressive" in it will probably be quite a challenge. Especially when many of these right-libertarian people are informed by heavily controlled media like Fox News. 		Then there's also a tiny bit of the inverse, where progressives won't vote for anything that has the name "libertarian" on it because they associate it with right-libertarianism, since that's 95% of the media about libertarians that most people come across. That should be more easily overcome.		I'm not saying it can't be done or that we shouldn't try, I'm just telling you the first major roadblock I see in your plan so that we can brainstorm to figure out how to overcome it. 		Perhaps those two words alltogether should be avoided. I have always liked the sound of an "Independent" candidate, and that party identification polls well with most Americans, from the polls I've seen.		Then to an progressive audience you could talk about it in those terms. To a right-libertarian audience you could use their words. But there's so much overlap in the list of things you said between those two parties. So you'd have to walk this careful line between the two, without being clearly identified as one or the either.

{"body":"I understand the issues with first past the post, I've also seen the video before.  		The fallacy in the video is that the third party voter hurts the candidate they most identify with by drawing from that voter pool. If neither of the parties are closely identified then the spoiler effect is irrelevant.  It also supports the status quo, by assuming deferrence.  What it ignores is that the third party gains strength and is better able to promote it's message in the future.		It also ignores that both parties will cater to the large new voting block and it will affect policy making (this is clearly demonstrated by the current influence the Tea party holds, despite registered Libertarians being a fairly small block).  		It also makes some false assumptions about previous results, that dissatisfied voters will switch to the main parties because their candidate didn't secure many votes.  I'd posit that truly dissatisfied voters would have the tenacity to look beyond a single election cycle.		Further, if this idea gains momentum, the spoiler effect will work against both parties, especially if a concentrated effort is made to do this (by promotion of voting outside the two parties, in general).		Votes at the edge of the spectrum, and the percentage of these votes, sends a strong signal of what voting blocks need to be catered to and accommodated by the dominant parties.  Any significant threat to their narrow margins will be catered too, which is why for example the far religious right has such a strong influence on the Republican platform.  In fact, that voting bloc has disproportionate representation in the party's policies.		Failure to move the goal posts, or attempting to do so is 100% buying into the current paradigm.  In absence of opposition signals, the powers that are in control of the parties will not feel threatened, nor will they feel a need to accommodate those voting blocs, and instead will continue with business as usual.		Many voters, determine that the outcome is hopeless and simply allow themselves to be disenfranchised.  This is an inferior solution to voting for a third party which if nothing else sends a signal of "none of the above".  It does this in a way that gives those positions value instead of non-importance. 		If 50% turnout happens with 50% non-voters, the non-voters can safely be ignored.  (50-70% turnout is typical -- many of the rest simply feel voting is pointless)		If the majority of disenfranchised voters actively oppose by voting third party then the spread looks much different.  Suddenly both sides realize that they are losing their leverage and will move towards the other platforms in an attempt to reel in those votes.  Those votes now have more influence than the habitual and predictable "rubber stamp" dem/rep voters.		An additional benefit, is those parties will divert funds that might have otherwise gone towards the major parties.  This is important as these funds will go to spread awareness of the new  ideas.  Even if those ideas are co-opted by the majority parties, they now have influence.		If for instance, a strongly anti-surveillance party emerged and gathered even 5% of the votes, that is a huge amount considering the typical spread between the major parties. Candidates will arise seeking to capitalize on that political capital.		EDIT:  As far as gerrymandering, that can be used against them as well.  Gerrymandering has created a situation where there are only a few swing states.  The non-swing state voters (even those that have some investment in one of the two parties) can now much more safely issue an effective **vote of no confidence** by supporting third parties.  This is no more throwing away the vote than either; not voting, or voting in a pre-decided election.  As stated above, this choice (and the more people that telegraph this choice and actively make it), will have **more** of an impact than taking the *safe* vote.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"escalation","name":"t1_cqb1gnw","parent_id":"t1_cqazk3e","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428951643,"created_utc":1428948043}

{"body":"Except it did go somewhere, and it is having an impact, and in fact is proving to be a major problem for the Dems in congress right now.  That entire voter base is highly mobilized and their points of view are drawing a lot more attention than they ever did as a fringe party.		Had libertarian leaning people just voted republican, there would be no voice at all, and the ideas would be a lot less far reaching than they are now.		By attaining a degree of critical mass, and attracting a controversial candidate to their cause, their exposure magnified despite the main stream media's best efforts to suppress it.   This in turn also attracted financing (albiet in a somewhat corrupting form), but this enabled the memes to spread much more rapidly.  Other aspects of the platform will eventually catch up, and are starting to make headway, despite resistance from other wings of the Republican party.   		That the Democrats didn't see the consequences of this, is a problem of their own underestimation of the situation and the actual dynamics at work.		This becomes a much more powerful affect when multiple edge parties start gaining margin.  A third party has a degree of spoiler effect.  The addition of splinter groups on the other side of the aisle will provide somewhat of a balancing effect.  		Interestingly, as enough of these groups gain a foothold, they will be able to collectively dismantle the protections that the two main parties have built for themselves against outside political influences, as it becomes beneficial for those partially vested interests to build bases that are more adaptable to their goals.		Maintaining the current paradigm by voting for the lesser of two evils, or buying into that line, just perpetuates the current situation.  Since neither of the parties represents my interests, then they have not earned my vote.  A vote for a third party is a vote of no-confidence, as opposed to a non-vote, which is simply apathy.  Voting against my interests is what is wrong, and until such time as my interests and the candidates interests are significantly aligned, it would be senseless to offer direct support in the form of a vote.		I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I also think that if Hillary and Jeb win the nomination, more people will take this path, which will ultimately serve to improve what is left of the current situation.

Again, there's no reason to lop off the 2011-2012 years. There is no credible primary challenge during a sitting President's terms. I've pointed this out to you multiple times, now. Quit being purposefully obtuse.		> You're wrong, as I've done the math. I'm not standing behind Hillary. She's too conservative and we need to do much better, by highlighting issues she won't.		You will not accomplish anything by "highlighting issues". That's incredibly naive. The most you could possibly hope to accomplish by highlighting the candidate's weaknesses is to strengthen her opposition - the *Republican nominee*. That's what you're going to do. That's the endgame of your brilliant plan. A Republican President.		> No, you're wrong. Democrat/=/progressive. I would vote for her in a swing state, but in a non-swing state, I see no compelling reason for me to vote for her. 		What does that have to do with your political beliefs? Even a very Clinton-aligned centrist could say the same - they don't have a compelling reason to vote either way if they don't live in a swing state.		> The job needs to be highlighting to the public, the very important issues Hillary will never breach-the perpetual crapping on our civil liberties, TPP and free trade, and her record of fracking and environmental deprecation as SoS.		How's that going for you?		> You are looking through a very biased lens. You have said you like Obama, and while his and Hillary's positions may be palatable to you, you're more to the center, whereas people to the left really disagree with a majority of what she says.		Not a majority. Just some of it. And that's *tough*. People far to the left of the Democratic platform are solidly in the minority. They can either stubbornly stick to their "principles", and accomplish nothing, or they can get on board and accept that they should be supporting the better of the available two options.		> According to you, there's hardly any time to take a principle stand, by illustrating important issues she won't touch when all are watching and during election time, it should be even worse you say, by lying that she's qualified. 		You have six years. Hell, you have longer if you start now and don't make a fuss about it. Quit whining.		Clinton is plenty qualified. You may not agree with her positions, but there are few people on the planet better suited for the job.		> Again, I'm not against pushing a more progressive candidate. I'll gladly campaign if Bernie or someone else challenges her. But if they lose, the important issue, which is very urgent, will fade into the sunset, and Americans will be none the wiser.		Which is why you don't support losers. If your candidate is coming out the gate a loser, you've failed. Build up your progressive candidate, and get the country on board. The biggest challenge you face isn't finding the right candidate. It's convincing the rest of the country that your beliefs are worth supporting. You're skipping straight to telling people what they should be doing, without bothering to convince them they should even be listening to you. Your beliefs just *aren't that popular*.		> You, and other Democrats, need to stop convincing people to stop pushing important issues,		The Presidency is ***the*** important issue. Your pet trade agreement or privacy causes don't even rank. In two years things will calm down and you can return to your failed "highlighting" strategy so that you can fail, once more, to advance an electable progressive.		> and that criticizing the Democrats is treason. 		No one is saying that. We'd just rather you develop a bit of perspective. Even just a little.		> You run your ideas, completely on fear that the other candidates will win, never, never on your own candidates' merits. 		Nonsense. That's the Republican strategy. I support Democrats because I think they, by and large, have reasonable policy positions and are generally intellectually honest. The only time we trot out the fear-of-the-opposition routine is when we're dealing with people like you, who already reject the candidate on his or her merits. You should support Democrats on their merits. If you don't, you should at least support them for the sake of preventing a Republican presidency.		And you know what the worst part is? ***I'm a progressive.*** I probably agree with all of the policy positions you want to support, but I know there is no reality in which I get exactly what I want. The perfect is the enemy of the good, and we're trying to do some real good here - ***and we have a shot***.","depth":17,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dannager","name":"t1_cqbelvz","parent_id":"t1_cqb5p9w","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428972434,"created_utc":1428968834}
{"body":"> Time to get on board. You have zero power as an independent. You will never have a candidate, and your views will continue to be marginalized. There are no other parties; just distractions (sometimes painful distractions). You are either a Democrat, a Republican, or a fool.		This is wrong. Political parties for the most part, simply create group think and broadly limit the Overton Window or list of acceptable ideas to the public and people within them. I have a problem with parties in general; that being said, we need to have a conversation about where we are, which is much too far right, both parties.		Do I want to reform the Democratic Party? Of course I do. This was once the party of George McGovern and RFK. I've campaigned for progressive, "unique" candidates, that are sometimes democrats, and intern for a group that looks to elect progressive individuals.		You and I it seems, have very different ideas on how to pull the Democrats left. I think that if the Democrats see that they lost a certain number of votes, to the Green Party for example (in a non-swing state, I don't want to spoil), they'd see they need to pull left. If progressives continue to give the Democrats votes for granted, they'll stay where they are.		Independents and third parties, like I said, have had an effect on politics. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly gotten elected as an independent; Angus King in Maine, is another independent. These two men got elected because they called for something different, not like Bloomberg who simply had money.		>Again, there's no reason to lop off the 2011-2012 years. There is no credible primary challenge during a sitting President's terms. I've pointed this out to you multiple times, now. Quit being purposefully obtuse.		Honestly, what's the difference for calling Obama out say, on the Patriot Act 3 months before the 2012 elections, and 3 months before the 2016 elections? Under your view, both ways can be construed as undermining the Democrats. Which I obviously disagree with, but I'm talking about issues, not just primary candidates.		>You will not accomplish anything by "highlighting issues". That's incredibly naive. The most you could possibly hope to accomplish by highlighting the candidate's weaknesses is to strengthen her opposition - the Republican nominee. That's what you're going to do. That's the endgame of your brilliant plan. A Republican President.		How can opposing the Patriot Act or TPP, be remotely construed as a Republican endorsement? That's what I don't get. If I'm going to call out Obama on, gay marriage, for example (I don't agree with this, I'm 100% for LGBT rights), that could be construed as helping the Republicans. I really don't see how these issues would deliver voters to Republicans.		>What does that have to do with your political beliefs? Even a very Clinton-aligned centrist could say the same - they don't have a compelling reason to vote either way if they don't live in a swing state.		A Clinton aligned centrist would say that she matches their views closest, so why not vote for her?		I think someone like you, who is much closer to Obama and Clinton, has an easier time saying this stuff than most.		>How's that going for you?		I'm sure that if during election season, people could hear about these issues, more people would care and act.		>Not a majority. Just some of it. And that's tough. People far to the left of the Democratic platform are solidly in the minority. They can either stubbornly stick to their "principles", and accomplish nothing, or they can get on board and accept that they should be supporting the better of the available two options.		No, we're not getting any better if we keep supporting "the better option" simply out of fear of the other side.		>You have six years. Hell, you have longer if you start now and don't make a fuss about it. Quit whining.		I have outlined this, and we don't		>Clinton is plenty qualified. You may not agree with her positions, but there are few people on the planet better suited for the job.		I don't care. I don't care how qualified one is if their hands are in the pockets of wall street and they push endless war. Ted Cruz was attorney general of Texas, Harvard grad, and Senator. He's technically qualified, but who would want him?		>Which is why you don't support losers. If your candidate is coming out the gate a loser, you've failed.

You're skipping straight to telling people what they should be doing, without bothering to convince them they should even be listening to you. Your beliefs just aren't that popular.		You're wrong. Sometimes we have to run on issues, not on candidates. That's what I don't like about hardcore Democrats. They care about defending Obama more than principles.		>The Presidency is the important issue. Your pet trade agreement or privacy causes don't even rank. In two years things will calm down and you can return to your failed "highlighting" strategy so that you can fail, once more, to advance an electable progressive.		I really, really resent you calling these "pet" issues. They are both incredibly important issues, that the corporations have covered up. During election season, we can get them the publicity we need.		I will try this whole time to elect progressive officials and push progressive issues. Fear of letting the Republicans win will not stop me. 		Is that all partisan democrats do? Put down anyone who is not satisfied with their centrist direction.		>No one is saying that. We'd just rather you develop a bit of perspective. Even just a little.		You certainly are. You aren't asking for perspective, you demand my complete and binding support of Democrats, and say whenever I criticize them, I'm helping the Republicans.		>Nonsense. That's the Republican strategy. I support Democrats because I think they, by and large, have reasonable policy positions and are generally intellectually honest.		You do. Have you considered people on the left genuinely, would vehemently disagree with you on these positions? I couldn't disagree more that they're intellectually honest.		This is *you*. This is your bubble, and stop trying to suck people who have different views into it. 		>The only time we trot out the fear-of-the-opposition routine is when we're dealing with people like you, who already reject the candidate on his or her merits.		They don't have many merits. That's the whole effing point.		You are entirely working off of fear.

The topic with the lowest number is Roe V. Wade with 3. Add 2 and you have five. Five is all you need for a majority vote. 		A Republican president doesn't make a Supreme Court justice vote one way or the other so saying that 8 years of a Bush president didn't eradicate Roe v. Wade means nothing. A president isn't able to just get rid of all the justices and implement new ones. They have to be implemented when the justices retire. Therefore it doesn't matter how many decades of Republican presidency we have as long as they aren't during periods when justices retire/die. 		It is a fact that the next presidency (especially if the next one is a 2 term) will likely chose at least 2 new supreme court justices because two of them over well over the age of 70 and will retire soon. The president that gets picked in 2016 WILL have a very influential role to play in the future of American laws because they will be responsible for implementing no less than 2 justices which can stack the deck either way in the high court.

Now imagine that every voter, in this imaginary world, voted for the person who *exactly* matched their personal political views. The votes would be insanely scattered. Someone *would* win, of course, but that person would have the support of only a tiny fraction of the overall population. They may have very extreme views, in fact! A well-organized cult could easily hijack such a system by forcing a uniform set of opinions on their followers. It would be chaos, and almost no one would be happy with the outcome.		The rational thing to do, instead, is to *band together* with people who share *similar* (but not identical!) political views. By prioritizing which positions you consider most important, you are now able to sacrifice some of your less important opinions (that maybe other people don't often agree with) in order to ensure that your *most* important views are represented. And, most importantly, the people who you *really* disagree with are doing the exact same thing with a different candidate - which means that if your chosen candidate loses, the result will be a President with a set of political views that you *really* disagree with! That provides even more incentive for you to come to a compromise.		That's what democracy is about, and that's one of the many reasons why supporting a third-party is a terrible idea (I haven't even touched on the spoiler effect).","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dannager","name":"t1_cqa5957","parent_id":"t1_cqa4jn1","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428876943,"created_utc":1428873343}

In many cases, that's true! In Florida in the 2000 general election, however, a handful of votes decided the election in favor of Bush. That number of votes was dramatically smaller than the number of votes received by liberal third-party candidates in that district, the vast majority of which would have gone to Gore if that third-party option were not available. This is called the spoiler effect, and it's the reason we had eight years of a Bush presidency.		> Why support a candidate with a vote when that person doesn't represent your views better than another?		Because democracy isn't about getting exactly what you want. That's called a dictatorship. Democracy is about compromising with those who share views similar (but not identical!) to yours in order to elect a more favorable candidate.		The view that you should vote for the candidate who matches your views exactly is, to be frank, childish.

While Republican turnout is already going to be high because they can't stand the Clintons any scandal that comes out will drive down Democratic and Independent turn out.  She is not the most inspiring campaigner to begin with and this will remind people of all the silliness of the Clinton presidency of the 90s.

President Obama is far more liberal and progressive than Conservative Stephen Harper, the Canadian PM. Harper hires Republican strategists, employs Republican electoral tactics including election fraud and voter suppression. Harper is the closest thing to if you made Dick Cheney the head of a country. 		And I always laugh at people who make statements like this 		>European or Canadian conservatives, much more so than their social democrats.		This always proves one's tremendous ignorance of international politics. When you assume Europe is one big monolithic block of social democrats, not a continent with dozens of countries ranging on the political scale. 		The main liberal party in the UK for example is the Labour Party. They are not social democrats. They are centre-centre left. To their left you have the Liberal Democrats. Which are similar to Canada's NDP, the New Democratic Party. They even share the same colour, orange. You of course have the Conservative Party. You have the euro-skeptic UKIP led by Nigel Farage. Then you have a whole bunch of nationalist parties like Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru, SNP. You really want to debate national and international politics with me?

This is another stupid thing to say. Republicans could only dream of having the economic success of the Clinton era of the Boom Boom 90s. 23 million net new jobs created. The greatest American peacetime economic expansion in history. 		Bill Clinton was a Democratic President. He won the Democratic Primaries in 1992 for heaven's sakes. He still is a Democrat who campaigns extensively for Democrats across the country. I can't wait to see him, Hillary, and President Obama campaigning together to make sure Hillary wins in 2016 so the country can continue prospering. 		I hear the same tired talking point about derulgating the banks. The Republicans are the party of deregulation. The Democrats are pro-regulation. There's a reason why it's called Dodd-Frank. Not Boehner-McConnell. There's a reason why Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat. 		>I have seriously, never, ever, heard a "democratic socialist" praise a Democrat		Really? That's absurd.

If you lose your job, you have 1 year to find a new one.	* Abolish the PATRIOT act and instruct the NSA to dismantle PRISM and wipe its records	* Provide conditionless funding to the OpenSSH project (as well as a host of other open source projects)	* Make the capital gains tax progressive, increase the top end of the income tax to 40%, and fix the "you don't pay taxes" line to half median personal full-time income, per person.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fordiman","name":"t1_cqairrk","parent_id":"t3_32czwg","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428903104,"created_utc":1428899504}

{"body":"Hillary won't win, here's why.		In presidential elections you have to appeal to the opponents base demographic. Not the base electorate, mind you, there lies idealogues. But the demo itself. 		Republicans are mostly white men, with many white women. Very few minorities at all. Dems are mostly the youth, minorities, and white women, with fewer white men. The numbers shift around all the time so I won't tack on percentages, but those are the rolls. 		When Obama won it wasn't because of the black vote solely, they make up a rather small percentage of the total electorate. He won because white men in battleground states like Florida and Ohio followed his message. Obama already had the dems locked up and McCain/Romney the Repubs, so it was a battle to see who could pilfer the others voters.		In this election Hillary will likely win the primary, but has no chance at the general. She needs white men. Republicans need women and minorities. So what will happen?		The Republicans, being quite clever, will roll out pro-women and pro-minority language in battleground states. They might even fall center on some policy points to seal the deal. Hillary, however, will build her primary victory on hard left feminist ideals. She will push the wage gap number incessantly. Her downfall will be that she is all emotion and no substance. The wage gap is a myth that has been debunked for decades. It exists, yes, but when controlled for personal choice and freedom, it vanishes almost completely. The actual percentages of workplace discrimination are staggeringly low.

{"body":"The election is most likely going to come down between Hillary and either Rand Paul or Jeb Bush. She's by far the most high profile democratic potential nominee. On the red side Rand Paul has gained a lot of traction in the media, especially with a lot of people who identify as libertarians. 		As far as who wins I think Hillary is going to win by a landslide. In terms of what people are actually going to be voting on this election will be civil rights: (reproductive rights, queer rights etc.) along with minority rights (with all the high profile cop killings. The US as a population has been progressively leaning more and more left on all these issues and with the rise of all these movements, they're what people are going to be voting on.		Second to civil liberties and whatnot, people are likely going to be voting democrat in terms of economic gain. They'll see that unemployment is way down and the economy is improving. One criticism of the democrats from the republicans right now is how they're handling Iran and also Obama's immigration policy, however voters tend to not care about foreign policy issues at all. Benghazi won't be a primordial factor in the election and neither will Hillary's email scandal, as voters don't care about privacy enough either.

{"body":"Open note to Hillary Clinton		In 1968, the year you received your bachelor's degree from Wellesley, the U.S. GDP was $982 billion, Federal minimum wage was $1.25/hr and median household income was about $8,600.		As of last year, GDP had risen to $16.7 trillion (17X). In order to have the equivalent ability to demand goods and service from the existing economy, the minimum wage would need to be $21.25/hr. Put baldly, anyone earning LESS THAN $21.25/hr has less buying power than the minimum wage earner of 1968. Using the same factors, median household income should be $146,200. This calculation does not take population growth into account, which could drop these number by a third. 		How did this happen? The long slide of U.S incomes from 'all of us' to 'a few of us' happened for each presidency since Kennedy including YOUR HUSBAND's. One of NAFTA's unforeseen consequences was a wave of illegal immigration north of the border and has had a definite impact on American family incomes.		I support you and will vote for you if you are the nominee but I want to know how the coring out of lower-tier and middle-tier incomes can be reversed. Until now, income distribution, tax policy and Fed banking policy appear to only benefit the wealthy.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rucb_alum","name":"t1_cqfif8d","parent_id":"t3_32czwg","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1429286292,"created_utc":1429282692}

I frankly don't see any Republicans who have anything of substance to offer, if anything, they would like to take us backwards with terrible social policies. The GOP is too busy trying to pass pointless "religious freedom" laws rather than doing anything productive.  When the GOP pushes for policies that support only the rich and the wealthy, why should we be surprised when Democrats get elected for president? The *majority* of Americans are just getting by by, or struggling. When one party seeks to speak for "Everyday Americans" and the other does not... it's really no wonder Dems get elected and GOP is slowly dying. The shift we've seen of Republicans becoming more extreme is their attempt to appeal to their old base, which will eventually die out. Once that happens, they'll have alienated themselves from the vast majority of Americans who support Democratic social values, that they're setting themselves up for a long succession of Democrats as president.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hashslingingslashar","name":"t1_cqa3i0y","parent_id":"t1_cqa2zzo","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428873818,"created_utc":1428870218}

Republican economic policies could work in theory, I'll admit that, but it makes one horrible wrong assumption that makes it not work - it assumes that people with money will be generous and use it to create jobs and wealth for others. This is demonstratively wrong, as the wealthy seek to evade taxes and hide money off shore. The rich try to implement policies that destroy competition and make themselves richer. It simply doesn't work. The assumption that people on welfare want to be on welfare is wrong too. I know a lot of really kind, hard working people on welfare who really try to make their lives better for themselves and for their families. It's just extremely difficult when the game is rigged in favor of the wealthy. Giving people opportunities is what this country is supposed to be about, and I think the Democratic Party at least tries to help the middle and lower class.

If she obtains the Democratic nomination, then we can almost certainly expect a Republican to get into office, especially given that Republicans currently control both the house and senate. It doesn't matter if their attacks are based on facts or not--the attacks will be effective regardless. Review the debates from the last election and you'll see what I mean; Obama may have won the election, but Romney's piss-poor behavior in the debates still received great praise from the media.

I apologize for this, but it's difficult to explain how a Democratic candidate will get obliterated without pointing to a similar situation, and I have my own ideological biases (and I assure you that I set these aside during elections to ensure an informed vote).

{"body":"While I agree she most likely will opt for a man to balance to the ticket I, there are some scenarios where Warren could be picked, largely depending on how the GOP primary drives the conversation. If there is a large populist undercurrent (I.E if Rand Paul or maybe Rubio are going strong) then Clinton may feel pressured to go for Warren to have a stronger populist voice. 	The other scenario is that Clinton enters the convention having won the nomination easily but without much excitement from the base. Again it depends a little on how the GOP primaries shake out, but if they end up being more right wing than usual Clinton may opt for Warren to energize the base and boost turn-out.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Chir0nex","name":"t1_cqabbc5","parent_id":"t1_cqa3a69","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1428888360,"created_utc":1428884760}
