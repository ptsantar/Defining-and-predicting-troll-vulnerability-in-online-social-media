{"body":"That is just so fucking absurd. There were three major reasons Obama won the primary and the ensuing election.		1. The *fundamental* issue for Hillary was that during the primaries, there was a perception that the deciding campaign issue in the general election was going to be the war. And Hillary voted for the war. Now, that almost seems inconsequential. At the time, it was a *HUGE* mark against her.	2. The entire Democratic side was essentially aligned as anti-Bush. Everyone was running on a "change" message. There wasn't much differentiation between the actual platforms of Clinton and Obama and Edwards--it was essentially "Bush sucks, end the war." The result of this was that there was a lot of tendency towards the candidate who most eloquently made the case.	3. Obama is probably one of the best political orators of the past 20-30 years. His first moment in the spotlight was an electrifying speech. At key times throughout the campaign he delivered truly special speeches. Given 2, this was incredibly attractive to a lot of people.		Obama would have won that race if he was white man or a white woman. He was the best situated politically, he was the best politician, and each of the three candidates he ran against were career politicians that are actually *each* notable for their general lack of charisma. 		Realistically, though, even if he was running against more charismatic opponents, he probably would have won, because he was an *unstoppable* political force. This was not because he was black. Plenty of black men have run for President in the past. Typically they are marginalized as race-oriented candidates.

He started the war on unions, the war on the poor, significantly cut taxes on the rich (no president since has been able to raise the top marginal rate to the level that it was *after* Reagan's first cut), sent wealth and income inequality on a death spiral, started the deregulation craze that led to 3 financial meltdowns in 3 decades (vs 0 in the preceding 5 decades), and put the military industrial complex on steroids (largest increase in defense spending during peacetime in the country's history). That's not even mentioning the escalation of the war on drugs, the installation of radical regimes around the world, and the blatantly illegal shit like negotiating for the Iranian prisoners to be held until after the election that we didn't find out about until later. 		The worst part is, he didn't even do the things Republicans always love to talk about. He raised taxes 11 times (as long as it wasn't on the rich), had a higher tax revenue as a percentage of GDP than Obama, tripled the national debt, grew the deficit, and he had a higher unemployment rate when he left office than Obama has right now (and in case you're wondering, the rate when he took office was 3 points lower than when Obama took office). 		Every time I hear some Republican politician wax poetic about the great Ronald Reagan I just shake my head.

More importantly, the decisions sometimes have to be made in split seconds. More-over, health care choices are fundamentally vague.

Since "health" is fundamentally unquantifiable (it includes concepts such as happiness and welfare) this is not achievable.		So how do we quantify how much a doctor should earn? The honest answer is that we can't, and we don't want to, to prevent introducing perverse motives. The best option is society (or the government) estimating how much a doctor should earn, given his years of education, experience and track-record. The moment we tie payment of doctors to their "performance" in care, it introduces incentives contrary to the patients interests.		Now, in my country, there's still a very strong sense of "professionalism" in health care, which often means _not_ doing things. Not doing that MRI (although it may earn you money, it's useless). Not prescribing antibiotics. This mindset is, maybe counter-intuitively, very important in providing health to a patient. The art of medicine is doing nothing as much as possible.

You certainly can't trust a scoundrel, especially not when it's in their interest to screw you over, but you can trust that they'll at least carry out their own interests. And it's within a president's interest not to intentionally screw over the country and to do a good enough job to get elected to a second term.		Also the fact is, as much as you may deny it, all presidents, both the saints and the scoundrels pretty much act along party lines. Look at Obama, when has he gone against party lines where virtually all republicans wouldn't have been with him? You can call out the NSA spying or the TPP but any republican would have done the same. It's a reason to consider a better democrat over Obama *cough*Bernie*cough*, but it's not a reason to cross party lines. Republicans are even more predictable than Democrats as they vote as a single unified block that virtually never crosses party lines.		The fact is, regardless of who a candidate is, you can pretty much always count on them to tow the party line and that's what you're gonna get from both their policies and their actions. If I vote for a scoundrel within my own party I think I can pretty much trust that they will, for the most part, stick to the side I'm more likely to agree with, and when they don't the other guy would have been right there with them anyways.		>I can't trust X to be implemented, I'll give Y a shot.

The reason I say not taxing high earners as much as Bernie wants to would help the country as a whole is because, if such high taxes get put in place, people are just going to leave. Liberals keep on talking about how the marginal rate was above 90% in Eisenhower's time, but what they forget is that, back then, a man working on Wall Street had to deal with such high taxes, because he couldn't go anywhere else. Back in the fifties, all of Asia was an impoverished shithole (even China and Japan), Latin America was an impoverished shithole, Europe wasn't doing nearly as well as it is now, Russia was the USSR, and the now prosperous parts of the Middle East (like Qatar) were basically deserts. A man making millions at say, Goldman Sachs, would have had to live in America back then because Goldman Sachs only had offices in America, you had to be in America to trade American markets, and there was no where else to go. 		Now, Qatar, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Rio De Janeiro, and many other places in the third world have low tax rates, have offices of various investment banks, and thanks to the internet you can trade American markets while in these places. So everyone will leave. The high earners like me working in finance can easily transfer to places like Hong Kong and renounce our American citizenship, we will make a little less money but it will be worth it if we are paying a flat tax of 15% instead of a 90% marginal rate. The doctors will move to places like Qatar (in fact my mother now works in Qatar and makes more money there then she ever did in America taking care of wealthy clients as a doctor because she is taxed less). All of Silicon Valley will move to top tech cities in Asia like Tokyo and Singapore (in fact one of the men who cofounded Facebook, Eduardo Saverine I think, moved to Singapore to avoid capital gains tax). Basically any person who is wealthy and has skills that can be used in any country (finance, tech, medical, business admin, engineering) will move if the tax increases so much. The only wealthy people who won't be able to move are lawyers (because they studied specifically American law and can't transfer that knowledge to other countries). But other than that, every wealthy person who moves will renounce their American citizenship (so they are no longer subject to the tax) and the other countries will gladly accept them (because countries want wealthy people to move in).

The US will just get new wealthy people to take their place. The Western world is still in its apex and I don't see Asia overtaking it until the end of the century.

Pretty much all innovation comes from the Western world. The little that does come from Asia is just improvements on already made designs. China is mostly a behemoth of manufacturing but it the US and EU that create the demand for that manufacturing. The dependency goes both ways but China could be replaced in my point of view while the US/EU are dominating the world in practically every aspect including culture, technological innovation, economy, education, etc. Let me know when the majority of Westerners actually know there isn't a language called Chinese and maybe that's the day things are actually changing from the status quo but I highly doubt that will ever happen.

These places benefit more than Vancouver because its not just old rich people buying up property, these young rich people still have jobs, which means their host countries get a steady supply of tax revenue in addition to their economy benefiting from them spending money there.

Do they not watch television and movies? Do they not like pop music? Do they not like fast food? Internet? Automobiles? Airplanes? Has anything modern originated in an Asian country? 		And that leads me back to innovation. I can't think of a single significant innovation originating from Asia. Russia doesn't count as it's practically European.

No, we're not losing anything really. We're gaining cheaper products is all. If and when robots are capable of mass producing consumer products cheaper than Asian workers, that is the day Asian better be self-sustainable.

{"body":"I think Federal Government needs to be fiscally conservative at the National level for the benefit of all citizens. 		For example, the number of DoD employees doesn't mean squat, what counts is their budget and the ROI we get on that budget. Replacing military members to reduce employee numbers with $250/day contractors is not fiscally conservative. It's expensive and a farce. If we want people to be 'boots on the ground' in a combat zone, they either need to enlist in the military or GTFO. If we can't get people to enlist, then start the draft back up. If a country wants contractors, let them pay XE directly and leave us out of it all together.		Healthcare is a huge suck on our GDP that needs to be fixed. Insurance is a big part of that suckage. I don't care who runs insurance or who I pay my premiums to. There is no reason they can't just expand Medicare (with premiums just like any other insurance company) and let it compete with private insurance companies. If private insurance companies can't compete, well that's the Free Market.		If Federal Funds pay for research, then the tax payers should have the right to get a return on any patents that result. If your company funds all of your own research (including not getting huge tax breaks for it), then have at it. But, if we give grants and tax breaks to companies to do research, they need to surrender part of that patent rights.		I'm also tired of the "privatize everything" crap when we have example after example of how that just ends up costing more money. Turnpikes that have been privatized now cost more to the people who use them and are no longer available for infrastructure purposes (like mass evacuation in the event of disaster) without costing the community an arm and a leg in fees.		The US population is growing and that means we need a right sized government. People who yell that they want to shrink government so small that it can be drown in a bathtub are stupid because the functions still need to continue. They're just outsourced, adding a layer of government project management and a couple layers of corporate sales and corporate management. Those people don't work for free and that outsourced company isn't going to give up their profits. The whole concept of shrinking government is a farce when you look at the GS pay scales compared to private sector. So, one day when those types finally get their taxes down to zero, they'll also be paying through the nose for everything because ever truck that delivered their groceries had to pay huge tolls to cross rutted up roads that break their equipment faster than normal... and they'll be paying $5k/mo for health insurance because of the darn ACA limit of 20% profits says that increasing medical costs is the only way for insurance companies to increase their profits. And they'll be paying $80/mo for the 'basic internet throughway access' fee to Comcast on top of their $170/mo cable bill.  And we'll have people working 60 hours a week to keep up with the rate they're bleeding money... and you know what happens then?		NOTHING... who can start a business when they're broke and exhausted? who can innovate when they've spent 60hrs trying to tread water? who can engage in recreational spending when they can barely keep their bills paid or their car on roads that are no longer maintained?

{"body":"Well, for example, the repeal of Glass-Steagall basically deregulated the financial market (yes, the SEC still existed to prosecute simple offenses like insider trading, but the real regulation to normal business was minimal). Now, on the one hand, it led to exactly what libertarians always claim... rapid growth. But historically, rapid growth is always followed by a bust because it's unsustainable and there's nothing to keep it in check. It happened in 99-00 and again in 07-08.		During that time, they consolidated and became the largest controllers of wealth in the world. Being creditors, they owned the lien on citizen's property. They owned most of the capital in the business world. And on top of that, they used their wealth to buy politicians (Goldman-Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Citibank, and Chase-Morgan are consistently Clinton's top donors). There's now hard statistical data that shows Congress is more attentive to the policy demands of wealthy bankers than they are to the voting public. 		Then, when they overextended and shit hit the fan, the entire global economy melted down. The state stepped in to minimize the damage, but if they hadn't (i.e. if the state didn't exist, as you mentioned), what you're seeing happen in Greece (a country that, by the way, has a constitutional ban on taxing their largest industry) is more like what would've happened everywhere in the world.		So, to recap, first they owned our property. Then, they owned our politicians. Then, when the capitalist chickens came home to roost, so to speak, for their bad business decisions, they held the entire world hostage for bailouts to avoid a global depression. And to this day they remain the richest, most powerful institutions in the country. They continue to buy politicians, they continue to own our property, and they continue to gamble with our money. And that's under the "regulatory burden" of Dodd-Frank.		And it's not as if nobody could see this coming. Economists were sounding alarm bells in the mid-aughts. They were begging the Fed to step in and raise interest rates to curb the speculation and reckless lending. But Greenspan, an Ayn Rand devotee of sorts, insisted that all was fine.

{"body":"So, its good that you acknowledged that the market was still regulated outside glass steagall. I have heard some arguments that Glass-steagall had very little to do with this, but for the sake of conversation we will go with it.		The state removed a restriction ... But not the protection that went along with it. When we see regulation occur, a lot of the time it is in response to problems deriving from past intrusions into the market. So you have business that is already shielded from what a libertarian would call "market forces" (more or less, them not being open to losing everything if they fuck up) and now, they are also free of the restriction that came along to temper problems arising from them being shielded from the market. 		So lets say, that the banks did not know that they would be bailed out if they fucked up bad enough. Lets say all this risk was on them, and at the end of the day they did not have the connections and de facto insurance that they currently enjoy. Do you think they take all those risks? Say it was their own wealth they stood to lose. Do you think they take those risks? 		This is why it is not enough to remove one restriction, to the libertarians mind at least. The removal of glass stegall is not really an argument against what libertarians call for, because of the way everything functions together with out current political system. The removal of the glass steagall restrictions does not funtion as a deregulation in this case, it functions more like a fine tuning of regulation to unleash a small group.

Fraud, and violence, and coercion are what makes a market not free. The libertarian wants to organize either a small government, or a self assembling society, that regulates the markets in respect to those problems. A market that has no coercion or violence or monopoly and fraud, is a free market. This is not perfectly attainable, it is the goal you keep working towards to improve society and increase freedom.

{"body":"I rarely ever post on this subreddit but here it goes:		I would consider myself an independent moderate, and my political philosophies range pretty heavily. That being said, I was raised with two libertarian parents and an attorney for a sister who is also extremely libertarian. I think one thing that is constantly confused about libertarians is that they must by definition of their political stance believe that taxing the rich more is immoral. Now maybe this is the norm, but from many that I have talked with, they more believe that the tax code is way too convoluted, and many of the laws and such surrounding the tax code are really just mechanisms for people to game and abuse the system. I actually agree with this sentiment as a moderate, I wish and would vote for an extremely simplified tax code for basically the exact same aforementioned reasons. Many times on this subreddit (which from what I have gathered is pretty left-leaning) people will quote rich people such as Warren Buffet saying things about how he pays a lower effective tax rate due to the way he games the tax code and other laws surrounding money and assets. Here's my point, just because in general you believe in smaller government doesn't mean that on a broad level you don't believe in helping the middle class. So if given an option between voting into another political monkey, and someone who at least seems to give a shit about the middle class, even if he goes about it in a different way than you would, you can still be a conservative or a libertarian and vote for him.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"clashmt","name":"t1_csrarv3","parent_id":"t1_csqqcbd","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435956921,"created_utc":1435953321}

So, it doesn't matter if they snake that money out of your pocket through taxes, premiums, co-pays, or public assistance for the ill... it's still a HUGE percentage of our funds as a nation tied up in healthcare and getting worse outcomes than other countries with single payer systems.		Studies have show that a single payer system (where you can have private add on insurance if you want, but not needed), would significantly reduce the percentage of GDP taken up by healthcare. Not to mention that sick people can't work and that means that with more healthy people we'd have fewer on public assistance.		Imagine if even 2% of GDP were to be freed up to be used in other places or no place at all if that's what the individual wants.

Imagine the small companies that can't compete for the best workers because they can't afford to pay good health insurance. Instead, they can compete for high quality workers based on the type of challenge and opportunity they offer instead of "we cover all your health care costs!"		If I need electric, I don't care where it comes from as long as it's cost effective. And, I don't care who runs the insurance end of paying for health care as long as they're cost effective.

{"body":"Absolutely, it's a very statist perspective.		George Lakoff talks about the ideology behind politics in some of his books.  Essentially, most political thinking stems from a metaphor between the government/citizen relationship and the parent/child relationship.		Taken to the extreme:		* **Libertarians** (socially liberal, fiscally conservative) are neglectful parents, who let the kid do whatever they want but maybe forget to feed them: no guidance, no nuturing	* **Democrats** (socially and fiscally liberal) are spoilers and enablers, who give the kid whatever they want and don't make any rules: no guidance, all nuturing	* **Republicans** (socially and fiscally conservative) are those "wait till your father gets home" dads who beat their kids into shape and expect them to learn from the school of hard knocks: all guidance, no nuturing	* **Statists** (socially conservative, fiscally liberal) are helicopter parents who give the child everything they want but schedule everything for them and never give them a moment to breathe: lots of guidance, lots of nuturing		Note that what we think of as traditionally "conservative" and "liberal" in the US is not necessarily so.  For example, opposition to gay rights is currently considered socially conservative because traditionally we haven't had gay rights in this country.  But imagine a country 200 years in the future, where gay rights are standard.  A socially conservative person might support gay rights, going so far as to insist that homosexuality is constantly talked about in school and that there are quotas for the number of gay workers you must have, whereas a socially liberal person might encourage free speech against homosexuality and the right for businesses to discriminate against gay people.		Basically, social conservatism is "the state supports traditional values" and social liberalism is "people get to make their own choices free from influence."		Incidentally, a lot of people who argue against "politically correct" language and policies (like affirmative action) don't realize that race is an issue that is making this transition now - the socially "mandatory" respect for people of different races, supported by our educational and political system and mass media, that they're rebelling against is actually in the process of becoming the conservative position.  This transition causes a lot of tension as people start feeling a new power dynamic.

Even if they ever could have liked her for some reasons, the propaganda is too ingrained.		But Sanders has been dismissed by the Beltway for so long because until a few months ago, he was just that one weird iconoclastic socialist from that one weird sleepy state of woodsmen who wouldn't swear fealty to either party. So there has never been any propaganda formed against him, and as a result, people are being introduced to him with a completely clean emotional slate.		And because he's so extraordinarily honest, they immediately find camaraderie in him even if they don't immediately agree with things he's saying. "An honest politician? How the hell have I never heard of this guy before?!" Then they realize that they *do* agree with what he's saying, but they've never been allowed to think such things before without it being tainted by propaganda.		And by the time their first impression has set in and they now thoroughly like this honest, straight-shooting grumpy old coot who really seems to actually, truly care about them, and they realize that they actually are with him on a great many issues, they hear that dog whistle word "socialist". And instead of their first impression of him being "Bah, an evil socialist? Fuck that guy," it's now, "Ah, an honest man? This could be my granddad!" So they hear that word and go, "*That's* a socialist? What the fuck. I *agree with that.*"		And everything clicks. They've just realized, on a very deep level, that they're being literally played for fools by the people they vote for, and here's a man whom they thoroughly like just on principle who's espousing ideas they've always wanted to agree with but couldn't and now they can, and the one word that used to work as a buzzword for "the dirty other" is now ineffectual. And bam, you've got another convert from the Republican Party. Or, honestly, also from a lot of Democrats who keep supporting establishment candidates without realizing how neoliberal they really are.		If he can get enough exposure before the Republican propaganda machine starts to focus in on him (which is likely going to happen because it's completely locked on Hillary for now and will be until she either drops out of the primaries or loses the general election), he'll snag a huge portion of disenfranchised Republican supporters. And the Democratic machine can't do much more than to marginalize him by constantly referencing Clinton's prohibitive nominee status, because they can't target his platform without exposing themselves as corporate shills and they can't attack him as a person without looking like massive assholes, since he absolutely refuses to run negative campaign ads and won't badmouth Hillary. He's got the moral high ground *and* the policy high ground, and bizarrely swelling support because the moment someone actually hears him speak, every sensor goes off in their heads telling them to rally beside him.

{"body":"May I make a suggestion?  Don't be fooled by the either/or abortion debate.		The modern Republican party knows that abortion is an issue people feel passionate about, and they use it as a wedge issue to distract from their real motive, which is increasing profit for the very wealthy and corporations (a very un-Christlike thing to do, and which the Pope recently spoke out against).		The modern Republican party also is in favor of reducing as many environmental protections as possible, again in the name of profit.  Again, something which the Pope has recently spoken out against.  Interestingly, you will notice that many Republican politicians who claim to be Catholic have actually ***condemned the Pope*** for mixing politics with religion, which is so gross to me.		Anyway, on abortion: if you look, you'll find that a lot of pro-choice people - both religious and nonreligious - are actually anti-abortion.  I, for example, hate the idea of abortion and think children are precious (and also don't necessarily like the idea of people having sex willy-nilly with the solution of "abortion" in the back of their minds, although of course there are a ton of people who don't fit this category).  But the truth is, making abortion illegal doesn't reduce the number of abortions much, it just drives women to back-alley, dangerous operations and attempted self-harm to get rid of the unwanted pregnancy.		In my view, these are the two real solutions:		1. Reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.  Abstinence-only education is scientifically proven not to work.  In addition, if abstinence is a value you hold on faith, then you should realize that virtue only "counts" if it's a choice you have made freely yourself.  This is why God gave us free will in the first place.  Children (and adults) should be taught the scientific principles of reproduction, they should be taught about the medical and social processes of childbirth and child-rearing, they should be taught about STIs, they should be taught about contraception and medical intervention, they should be taught about relationships and consent and self-esteem.  Sex should be presented as neutral or a net positive, because sex is a gift from God and/or a natural process, depending on your view.  They should also be taught about different value systems and how people view sex, from a neutral position, and allowed to make their own choice.  		2. Provide resources for pregnant women.  Free healthcare for both mother and child, a guaranteed place to live and eat, a way to support their baby, government-subsidized childcare for women who want to work, paid maternity and paternity leave, clothing and toys and food, parenting classes, support groups, adoption support and counselling, and outreach and societal approval of single mothers and nontraditional families will all go a REALLY long way toward reducing overall abortion numbers.","depth":3,"score":24,"ups":24,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"peppermint-kiss","name":"t1_csqx3nh","parent_id":"t1_csqt9kk","subreddit":"politics","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","created":1435928145,"created_utc":1435924545}

It should always be the responsibility of a community to make sure it's members are properly cared for. A society is only as strong as it's weakest members.

In an economy where college grads are having to compete for jobs normally occupied by the uneducated, choosing who you work for isn't always possible. Also, some businesses you can't boycott, like telecoms, energy and medical.		>And the only way roads can be built is with institutionalized theft and coercion? 		Hyperbole aside, yes.

Police, fire, schools, etc. There is a reason why countries deal with these things directly, it can't be and never should be dealt with by private entities.		>So who protects them from the laws that limit their ability to do business? The state has no legitimate authority to interfere in the voluntary transactions between individuals. 		Noone. There should be laws in place to protect consumers and the poor. If you or anyone else do not like that, I'm sure there are some countries still left who will let you exploit people. I'm sure dealing with warlords and drug cartels will be more to your liking then a civilized government?		>Define "fair share". Who decides what is a "fair share"? Surely, it can only be the individuals entering the voluntary agreement. 		The wealthy use far more of our natural and infrastructure resources then the common person. They also require more resources to protect what they have, be it in Police coverage and military strength. Why should the rich have to pay more? They use more and they have more to lose, that's why.		>Indeed. The Federal Reserve and endless money printing has made sure of that. The Fed is the reason why Americans can't save money, and the inflation is the biggest hurdle for upward mobility. 		... Ok. That has nothing to do with what I said. When I say hording of wealth, I mean the practice of lowering taxes on the wealthy and allowing them to shelter their money in overseas havens that have been made legal by lobbying efforts of the wealthy. The Fed is another issue entirely.		>And you'll wonder why all the wealth has left the nation. 		I will welcome that if it happens. I won't though. It's a common fallacy that the rich will take their money and leave if the tax structure becomes less in their favor. They didn't leave in the 50's, and they won't leave now because they still won't find a better deal anywhere else, unless they want to play with the warlords and drug cartels I mentioned earlier. Hell, some of them might even feel more at home among those types.		If they do leave, all that does is open the doors for small business and entrepreneurship to explode, and that is what successful and sustainable capitalism is about. So I hope they do leave.		>"Allowed"? No, I'll be forced to participate if I stay here. Furthermore, I refuse to benefit from stolen money. Some of us have integrity. 		So you never drive on the roads? You never went to school? I hope not. Wouldn't want you to compromise your vaunted principles. I'm kinda surprised you have time to be on Reddit what with all that wall building and armed patroling you must have to do since you apparently live in a community without police coverage or law enforcement. /s		Taxes are NOT stolen money, they are part of the social contract.

If we did away with taxes, not only would there be more money available for voluntary charities, but the state would also have less money to spend on war, banks, and Fortune 500 companies. Ending systemic theft could only end well for society as a whole. This kind of illustrates my point... you don't care about the morality of taxation.

I'm sorry, I thought it was clearly stated.  I understand that democide is governments killing citizens excluding military combatants.  This is the third largest group of human deaths, following *all* natural causes, and *all* military fatalities.

What's so special about the institution of *property*, that makes it the only human addition to biological necessity when considering social order?  You said, "there needs to be a way to distinguish who owns what and what dictates legitimate ownership."  Why is this a necessity?

I think you tried to explain that *this* invention was necessary because it's the only way to address our shared material circumstances... but one particular formulation of sovereign private property is not the *only* way a social order can cope with material scarcity.		I want to be clear (or try, since it didn't work so well before).  I absolutely think a person should benefit from their labor.  I simply don't think they should get to benefit from exploiting the vulnerability or poverty of others.

As a cause of death.		Where are you getting this? I've never heard that as a definition for democide, and I've done rather comprehensive papers on it. Even Wikipedia states: Democide is a term revived and redefined by the political scientist R. J. Rummel as "the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide and mass murder." Perhaps you're using an older definition. We're back to semantics. 		>so we can't simply combine military deaths and democide to make the state appear more bloodthirsty.		That's not what is taking place.

I don't think I said that. Let me put it this way: what is the point of security when there's nothing to secure? Where is comfort, when you have no guarantee that you'll be keeping "your" bed? How well would education work if everyone just grabbed the books and took them away? What kind of community could exist when everyone tears town public utilities for their personal use? Without property norms, everything becomes a cluster-fuck. 		>I simply don't think they should get to benefit from exploiting the vulnerability or poverty of others.		Is it despicable? Yes. Immoral? Certainly. However, there comes a point where you have to understand that there is *very* little that can be done to prevent that. Hell, look at politicians. That's all they fucking do, and they're the ones that are supposed to be preventing that kind of manipulation. There's no way we can prevent clever assholes from taking advantage of gullible morons. The best we can do is work to educate people. Any kind of systemic mechanism for achieving this end will always be sought after by the clever assholes. It's not that power corrupts, but the fact that power attracts the corruptable. With the existence of a central authority like government, the gullible morons elects the clever assholes, and the clever assholes get to dictate things to *everyone*, even if you wouldn't have been a gullible moron otherwise. People *must* be allowed to make decisions for themselves. Hell, self-governance is the only realistic level of government, anyway. Only the individual thinks. Only the individual reasons. Only the individual acts. 		>invariably, a system where wealth accumulates among the wealthy, states arise and shed blood, and an entire class of human beings is denied the opportunity to improve their lives.		That's what we have *now*. As I've said: we already live in anarchy. This is what anarchy looks like when people don't understand the requirements necessary for living in a civilized society. That's why it's so important to educate people on the principles of self-ownership, voluntaryism, and the NAP. Once people understand these things, the sociopaths at the top of the pyramid don't have any power. I'm not afraid of the Maos and the Stalins, and the Hitlers... I'm afraid of the people who think they have to follow those lunatics. 		>This "initiation of violent force" line-in-the-sand is a legalistic loophole championed by the rich as a moral imperative		Are you suggesting you wouldn't be better off if you were free from coercion, theft, and violence? 		>but I fully believe you can wrong someone without initiating violence against them.		As a side note, I have to mention that fraud is also considered a violation of the NAP. 		>What do you think, am I hopelessly insane?		Not at all. You're actually asking the same questions I was a few years ago. There are some things you'll have to learn to accept... you can't save everyone. People aren't really free unless they are free to make bad decisions. This goes back to my little example of the clever assholes vs the gullible morons.

{"body":"> My view is that human rights are objective, not subjective. We develop "rights" as a tool for determining what is or isn't ethical in the realm of human interaction.		If the source of these tools is a process of human decision-making and mutual consent, doesn't that make human rights subjective?  Or am I missing something in how we develop these tools?		> Where will the food come from when no one is working and everyone expects to be fed?		When in human history has there ever been a time when "no one was working," as part of any social group?  I know there have been small examples of human organization where they did feel food was what we might call a human right.  If those groups thrived internally until conquered, what leads you to conclude that characterizing food as a human right will lead to a time "when no one is working"?		> Where are you getting this? I've never heard that as a definition for democide		You said:		>>> How about this one: democide is the leading cause of unnatural death in the past century, not including military casualties.		To which I replied:		>> Just to be clear, democide follows all natural deaths and all military casualties as a cause of death?		To which you answered:		> No, democide is the killing of citizens by government, NOT including military deaths. Combine the two, and you quickly see just how dangerous the state is.		I haven't been confused about the definition of democide anywhere along this conversation, as far as I can tell.  I was trying to clarify that the top three causes of death, broadly, were natural causes, military casualties, and democide, as exclusive sets.  		I'm really not sure why replacing the third group with homicide is likely to bring about global peace and prosperity, or even individual peace and prosperity, considering how much death comes from nature (which anarchism doesn't automatically) and consensual warfare (which anarchism doesn't automatically stop).		> Every right can be traced back to the principle of self-ownership.		For those of us who disagree with this principle, are our lives subject to rights developed by others, for the benefit of others?  Or, if we deny this principle in reforming our institution of property, can we still effectively develop tools for ethical human interaction?  What's the case for the supremacy of this particular, human-sourced right over any other tool we might develop?		> False. Animals also create territories and "property" in nature.		Animals have no concept of a contract.  No animal, spending years away from a place, would return as anything other than a new resident to the territory.  Non-human examples of territorial behavior are not congruent to the principle of self-ownership, and the absolute, sovereign private property rules which follow from it.		> Let me put it this way: what is the point of security when there's nothing to secure? Where is comfort, when you have no guarantee that you'll be keeping "your" bed? 		Comfort is knowing that there's not a soul around who has any reason to want my bed.  Security is knowing there will be food to eat next year, even if I break both my legs.		> How well would education work if everyone just grabbed the books and took them away? What kind of community could exist when everyone tears town public utilities for their personal use? Without property norms, everything becomes a cluster-fuck.		Why?  What force makes it inevitable that, absent property norms, "everyone tears down public utilities"?  Why couldn't norms concerning public utilities arise to address this, distinct from the currently-formulated private property rules?		> Is it despicable? Yes. Immoral? Certainly. However, there comes a point where you have to understand that there is very little that can be done to prevent that.		Is ethics about developing the most practical rules?  In that case, aren't feudalism and tribalism already ideally suited?  If our ethics aren't aimed at preventing the immoral victimization of human beings, what is the purpose of them?		> There's no way we can prevent clever assholes from taking advantage of gullible morons.		If the asshole has everything he needs, and the moron has nothing the asshole wants, what's going to cause the asshole to take advantage of the moron?		> With the existence of a central authority like government, the gullible morons elects the clever assholes, and the clever assholes get to dictate things to everyone, even if you wouldn't have been a gullible moron otherwise. 		We've already agreed that these clever assholes will work to establish such an authority over an anarchistic society, and since there's nothing to prevent it, the outcome is inevitably a reactionary opposition and clumsy, brutal warfare.  Since anarchism does nothing to prevent the rise of the state, isn't it better to establish a state already responsible to its people, instead?		> People must be allowed to make decisions for themselves. Hell, self-governance is the only realistic level of government, anyway. Only the individual thinks. Only the individual reasons. Only the individual acts.		Very zen.  Groups think.  Groups reason.  Groups certainly act.  Certain countless individual actions of great significance to human history would never have happened without their group.  		Self-governance is the only level of government on which anarchism is realistically sustainable.		> As I've said: we already live in anarchy.		We live under a state.  It's a question of perspective, whether the tale of human history is anarchy punctuated by frequent, massive states of tremendous impact, or one of civil government punctuated by frequent disruptions of tremendous impact.  Is the zebra black or white?		The outcome is the same regardless.  Where we are now we can see the state and we can conceive of anarchism.  Under your ideal, the state is still inevitable, and inevitably fought.  Under my ideal, whatever that is, the state is inevitable, but can address individual needs and concerns sufficiently to prevent being destabilized or becoming despotic.		> Are you suggesting you wouldn't be better off if you were free from coercion, theft, and violence?		I'm suggesting that I've never heard a realistic scenario which frees me from the possibility of coercion, theft, and violence.  I'm saying outright, now, that if the coercion is following the rule of law, if the theft is taxation, if the violence is following the rule of law, and if the system wielding them answers to the people it governs, it is a better system than one which frees nobody of anything but the state.		> As a side note, I have to mention that fraud is also considered a violation of the NAP.		I'm not sure how that follows.  What's aggressive about omitting facts?  How do I violate your self-ownership by giving an incomplete answer?		> Once you claim that you have the right to tell people what to do, you become no different from the clever assholes trying to control other people.		This is a tautology; you might also say "once you support the state, you become no different from the state," or "once you oppose the state, you become no different from enemies of the state."  It doesn't address the ethics or effectiveness of the state.  Why is the NAP superior to establishing a state under the rule of law?		Is anarchism about fostering self-improvement by letting people make their own mistakes?  Is it about protecting people from the demonstrated dangers of a despotic or imperial state?  Is it about freeing people to make it easier to find and exploit the most easily exploited?

Would we say that Obama delivered on his core campaign promises? I don't think anybody can say yes. He did get healthcare through (props, but the execution has been poor from the get-go)  the economic stimulus package didn't deliver the big boost as he touted it would, his most transparent government in the history of the world promise goes down as one of the biggest lies that a President pledged to his people. 		We all got duped. Obama really didn't stand up to Wall St or the institutions. He's honestly trying to run out the door while pushing through a treaty that has negative benefits for nearly everyone--including the government--except corporations. Obama couldn't beat the corporations. But now Bernie Sanders is going to walk in and throw down his gloves, show the corporations and institutions who the boss is? That's extremely wishful at best.

Obama abandoned the zeal of his base and set his opponents up to form a counter-movement that has had some *pretty* good media and legislative success. Bernie's explicitly stated over and over that this was one of Obama's biggest mistakes and that he vows to keep his movement alive and fighting because he knows that there's no way *any* President can accomplish what he's fighting for without a massive public referendum behind him voting out establishment politicians in favor of ever-increasing numbers of insurgent progressives that share his vision and years of work with his new supermajority.

The question is whether this movement is large enough to win him the primary, because if it is, it should be pretty "easy" for that movement to sweep out the stooges during the general election and usher in a New Deal 2.0.
