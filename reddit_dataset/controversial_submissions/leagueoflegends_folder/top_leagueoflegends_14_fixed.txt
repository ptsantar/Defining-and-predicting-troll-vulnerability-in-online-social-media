Darius has 901 mana at lvl 18. the mana deficit is 62.5-390 = -327,5 mana per 25s.	901/327 x 25s = 68,9s of constant ability usage nonstop. 	If mana has the gating purpose as opposed to long cooldown gating mechanisms, 68,9s or even half of it will last darius through multiple teamfights unhindered.

But you know what made even less sense?		Quinn was considered as a hard counter, *but actually was easy to take on*. All thanks to the fact the pull was technically longer, and your damage was instant. Now you get kicked and she jumps away as it's supposed to be. And that's the case on other ranged champs too as well, now you don't get a 100% assured pull once you get the perfect feel of the range.		Blame Riot for giving him the noob friendly mechanic of instant stacking and insane numbers, but don't mention anything about pre-rework Darius just because you people have no damn idea.","depth":8,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RoznosicielCiast","name":"t1_cupm49u","parent_id":"t1_cupf246","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1441338568,"created_utc":1441309768}

{"body":"You are completely incorrect. Darius Q has a 5 second cooldown and he regens 12.5 mana per 5 seconds at level 18. His Q alone is more than double his mana regen actually regens. If you spam all of his abilities every 12 seconds (which is the cooldown of Apprehend if I remember correctly) thats 105 mana every 12 seconds and he only regens about 27 mana in that time. Darius doesn't really have much mana issues at all but your assertion that he cannot run out of mana is incorrect.		Edit: With pure base stats Darius has 901 mana and 12.5 mana regen per 5. Spamming as hard as possible is 60 mana every 5 seconds and 45 additional mana every 12 seconds. So if Darius is using abilities the moment they come up (and is attacking an invulnerable target) he spents on average 15.75 mana per second but regens 2.5 mana per second. So he losts 13.25 mana per second on average. If Darius uses abilities as quick as possible he runs out of mana in 68 seconds. That is also at level 18 and as Darius' mana costs are completely flat, he runs out mana much faster at early levels when his total base mana is around 500 and if he casts it when his ultimate has a mana cost (can't cast ultimate if you have less than 100 mana even if it would kill them and refund the mana cost).		This is obviously a very unrealistic example but it can happen if you are continuously using your abilities with very little breaks in between them (i.e pushing a wave, then getting into a fight then doing an objective. etc.)","depth":4,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TechyKat","name":"t1_cupc4wq","parent_id":"t1_cupbbh2","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1441323381,"created_utc":1441294581}

Item reworks and the exp change sort of turned him into a not-to-effective split pusher who couldn't really kill too many people who didn't want to die. 		So Riot reworks him to bring back this identity in the new meta! In lane, he's still a monster(wouldn't want them to take that away), and the addition of the Q heal and Bloodrage means he can stay alive in teamfights long enough to...dunk on people. The problem is that he does that last part a little too well. 		Mana changes won't stop him from doing that, it won't make the people playing against Darius any happier and it would just be slight frustration to the people playing Darius.

Increase radius of inner (handle) zone, creating more counter-play by making staying inside the blade easier to avoid proc'ing his heal.		W) With the refund mechanic in place, increase mana cost to 30/40/50/60/70. Doesn't hurt farming at all, matters in prolonged teamfights.		R) Change it from 100/100/0 to 100/75/50 mana. No need for its bizarre mana progression, and it doesn't need free mana at Rank 3, it already gets a full reset at rank 3.		If after that, his mana-related sustain is still infinity with no mana supporting items/runes, make his Q cost 40/45/50/55/60 mana, but have its cost reduced by 5 mana each time he hits with an auto-attack, down to a minimum of 30 mana.

In this case, Darius has to wait 23 seconds, *14 seconds longer than the cooldown,* to regenerate the lost mana.		**Even if Darius levels to 18 without increasing the ranks of Decimate past the first,** the improved base regeneration of 12.5 mana per 5 seconds *still* doesn't prevent him from running out of mana, as it instead takes 12 seconds to regenerate the lost mana.		In fact, maxing Decimate - Darius' primary ability - only leads to him losing mana faster, as the cooldown is shorter. Additionally, this ignores any purchased CDR, which would amplify that.		Therefore, using Decimate more frequently than once every 12 seconds, at any level, with base regeneration, can absolutely mean that Darius runs out of mana.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"I_Am_Ravenous","name":"t1_cuphs85","parent_id":"t3_3jhg4t","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1441332018,"created_utc":1441303218}

{"body":"I do have a question pertaining to Darius: according to champion.gg, Darius has the 2nd lowest winrate as a toplaner. Sure, winrate doesn't mean that much, but.... why..?			If Darius is in fact **underpowered**, then adding mana issues to his gameplay might not be viable. 			Personally, I think they should make it so his heal is more balanced. Instead of 15% of missing HP, it should be a flat amount scaling with Q level. I've seen too many incidents where Darius has like 30 HP and heals 450 HP with one Q.			A second option could be to change his resource to show his dots instead and make his heal scale with how many dots he has, sort of like combo points on rogues in WoW. So you auto-attack an enemy once and you put 1 dot on them AND you get 1 resource point out of a possible 5. Every 3 seconds you lose 1 resource point and you can only earn one per attack (so you can't get 5 from using Q once). Each resource point increases his heal amount by a certain % stacking up to a maximum of 15-20%. This way he'll be forced to stay in fights more and you can counter his play style a lot more effectively by not letting him restack his dots and earning more resources. I feel like that'll synergize a lot with his whole blood lust background. It'll also be really cool if instead of giving him a flat AD amount for having 5 dots/resource points, each point could convert a certain amount of Armor -> AD instead. This'll allow him to build pure tank and make it so he doesn't get soooooooo much gold's worth of AD for running into battle and ulting one guy once.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ILetTheDogesOut","name":"t1_cupjke0","parent_id":"t3_3jhg4t","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1441334732,"created_utc":1441305932}
