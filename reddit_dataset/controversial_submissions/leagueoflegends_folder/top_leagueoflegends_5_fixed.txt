The 8 PM slot is actually the official start of Prime Time, according to Broadcasting Companies. That's why the most popular TV shows always air from 8-9 pm.		The start times are set up to Maximize viewership across both Regions. Let's say you swapped NA and EU time slots so that NA airs at 8 PM Prime time on weekdays. This is what that looks like.		NA LCS: 5 PM PST, 8 PM CST, 1 AM GMT	EU LCS: 7 AM PST, 10 AM EST, 3 PM GMT.		Please tell me how this would be better? NA LCS loses its entire EU viewer base, and EU LCS uses a good chunk of its NA viewer base due to the early start time.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SuperbianMG","name":"t1_cz1nvy1","parent_id":"t1_cz1kgur","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1453080770,"created_utc":1453051970}

The different languages is no explanation either. Lobbying from the VCs of the NA scene is also not the explanation as I explained in the post I linked.			There is a bigger viewership potential in EU, simply because there is a lot more people in Europe than in North America. Riot is simply not unveiling EU LCS's viewership potential : they communicate way less about it, they do way less hype videos, and they put it on weekdays when EU folks are still at work/leaving work (and coincidentally between 9/12am in NA during a business day, so not much people outside of EU can watch it : way worse situation than being run parallel to the most popular sport in the country !).

{"body":"How many times do you have to be told that it is because of time zone scheduling and logistics? The schedule for lcs is the best compromise possible for people who want to watch BOTH while still prioritizing each region's ability to view it's own games. First, you have to accept that fact that either they broadcast all the games on Saturday/Sunday OR someone ends up having to play on a weekday when many people won't be able to watch regardless of which region it is. Once you take this into account, alongside their goal to make it possible to watch both EU and NA lcs for both regions if you enjoy both, the entire schedule makes sense. EU lcs starts in the early evening local time on week days so that it can be broadcast at a watchable hour in NA, where many people will be at work regardless, but those who aren't can watch it (it is 9-12 am local time in NA when EU lcs starts). NA lcs starts around noon local time (12-4 pm) on weekends, which is late evening in EU, but not super late (although it can drag close). 		Right now viewership is best scheduled in this order: Europeans who want to watch BOTH leagues (EU matches start just late enough most Europeans are just off of work on week days, NA matches are on weekends to begin with, making it possible for most Europeans to watch every match of both LCS putting them in the best position of any viewer) > North Americans that want to watch BOTH leagues (EU is played during regular work hours on week days, making it difficult to impossible to watch for 9-5 viewers but otherwise not at an unreasonable hour like 12pm-3 am or something super late, NA is of course on weekends) > North Americans that do not care about EU LCS (weekends>weekdays) > Europeans that do not care about NA LCS (weekends>weekday evenings, even if the games are on at a view able hour for most). All I can say is if you are among those only interested in one LCS or another, suck it up, Riot is designing it's broadcast structure for everyone not just you. 		If NA games were on week days they would have to do the same thing they do for EU, put them on in the early evening so that most local viewers could catch them after work. This would result in the NA broadcast being in the complete middle of the night (or really the middle of the early, early morning of the next day) for Europeans, making them inaccessible for the vast majority of Europeans interested in the NA lcs. It is that fucking simple. The current system allows both regions to have a good shot of viewing the games from their own region while making it fairly doable to watch the games of the other region as well, you are an idiot who does not understand timezones if you disagree with this simple logic.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Orchelium","name":"t1_cz1kh2s","parent_id":"t3_41djec","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1453074479,"created_utc":1453045679}

Can you give me these facts instead of your word.Furthermore I guess you never have heard about the problem of induction? And the actual point is that NA has/had better number due to the weekends, whereas EU has definitly a worse time schedule.		>NA has more storyline 			They don't have more storyline. You are more interested into the NA one and that's it. As a european, who watches mostly EU LCS and just big games in other leagues, I am really not interested into an adc, who played since season 1 and and besides of a regional trophy in summer seaon 5 hasn't achieved anything and played poorly on every international stage so far. I'm more interested into EU storyline, but i am not so stupid to think that this is more important than others, because it is a personal preference.		>more big names	Again false. What are these big names? If you measure just league, than EU has by far the biggest name of all time in the western scene with fnatic. Then you have OG, based on former fnatic members. NA has only TSM and C9, the rest aren't big. 		>more competition 	That is by far the most hilarious thing you said. NA claims every year that besides of the top teams NA is far more competitive than EU. It is just a statement without any fact, because you cant extrapolate team matches. If you do you get shit like. (Roccat>Vitality>Fnatic>OG>CLG>Jin Air>SKT). No one will believe this shit, yet you think NA is more competitive for whatever reason? 	EU played better then NA in the most international tournaments.

Can you prove this(maybe through screenshots) or are these just statements out of your mind without any real evidence.

It is the same shit again, you just make a statement without any proof and claim that your favourite region has more fans and the most dedicated ones. Particulary how can you even measure how dedicated someone is? Many polish friends of mine were big Roccat and Kikis fans, are they less dedicated to them as Dignitas and Crumbz fans?

When determining whether a region will have weekends or weekdays you must also look at other factors than just twitch and azubu.

{"body":"Except, if you look at average broadcast numbers, NA still dumped on EU. EU LCS numbers dropped below 200k for every match after that one. Way to cherry pick a single game to falsely make your point.		OG vs Fnatic had benefit of being first LCS match in 4 months, and pitted two world semi-finalists against each other. Not surprised the peak viewership was a little higher.		Don't be surprised if NA LCS beats EU LCS every day the rest of the split.","depth":0,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SuperbianMG","name":"t1_cz1k2sq","parent_id":"t3_41djec","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1453073682,"created_utc":1453044882}
