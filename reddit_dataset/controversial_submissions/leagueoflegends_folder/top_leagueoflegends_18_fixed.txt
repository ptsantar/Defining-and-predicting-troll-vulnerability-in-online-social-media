{"body":"I agree with comments in here requesting an actual conversation about the subject, and not about Lewis himself. I feel like Lewis is posting this in hopes that people will read the subheadings without looking at the actual content, though, because there's nothing really to discuss about the subject. Whether deliberately or not, Lewis is misrepresenting extremely trivial issues that are not ethical dilemmas. 		The crux of his argument is this:	> While there is no evidence of moderators taking money in exchange for preferential treatment, the evidence does suggest that the relationship between both parties certainly is **closer than many suspected**. Whether a reader ultimately decides this relationship is concerning or simply benign, it’s important that it be in the public sphere.		Then, Lewis posts somewhat of a followup to his NDA article, saying:	> As some argued, the NDA violated the spirit of the rule, if not the letter. (...) While Riot emphasized that the Skype room and contracts were never used to exert influence over the community, their very existence at least raises the specter of leverage.		This, like each of the other pieces of evidence that Lewis annotates, elucidates his argument perfectly. Since there is an easy line of communication between Riot and the mods, it's obviously possible for them to exert their influence over the community.		> Respond with your mailing address if you want potential for Riot Swag		This is a very smart piece with which to begin, because it plays on the jealousy of the community who are not mods and did not get this potential for Riot Swag. I consider this a very minor issue, though; my line of thinking is that the mods are unpaid and part of a fan community about a video game. There is no evidence that this is anything more than an extremely insubstantial gift, like skin codes given out at PAX. Since there's no real evidence that the company is paying the moderation staff to silence community issues with Teemo hats, there's really nothing here to discuss, in my opinion. But I suppose it's arguable.		Lewis's next point concerns a subreddit redesign from 2012. Lewis's issue:		> Riot apparently paid a contractor for the work. “Riot has stated **they are ready to go live** and have us incorporate it…”		In the subheading, Lewis editorializes:		>Riot paid for a subreddit redesign in 2012 and **dictated** when the new design was made public		Sure, it might be true. It's a stretch, though. All we have to go on is the bolded statements. Lewis takes "Riot... [is] ready to go live" to mean that Riot "dictated" a timetable. From this evidence, it's really impossible to get anything from Goggris's words, let alone enough to cry foul over it.		Next:		> Multiple moderators have become Riot employees and some remain in daily contact with the moderation team		This is a summary of several Rioters who used to be moderators on the sub and their parts in the NDA "scandal". It is possible that this is a conflict of interest, I suppose, even though video game critics all over this industry have working relationships and friendships with developers, just like music and film critics are also fans of their field and friends with musicians and filmmakers. It's only as conflicting as any of these things. 		Moreover, I am unconvinced because this point is obvious. Lewis previously established that Riot talks directly to the mods. Also, it's public knowledge that these mods became Rioters. It is also common sense that people with working relationships, or friendships, talk to each other using written or oral forms of communication.		> One active moderator is seeking a job with Riot		This seems to be very similar to the above point. Lewis does not editorialize here, so anything I write here is mostly interpretation. Lewis's implication, I deduce, is not that Riot is actively exerting influence over this moderator, but that the moderator would be influenced indirectly by his desire to join Riot and attempt to moderate in a biased manner to do so. This is complete inference, and I apologize if it is very incorrect or misleading.		If this is the correct implication, I dismiss it because it's a stretch, because there is no actual evidence either way. Other than this deduction on my part, there is no evidence of impropriety, other than it being inferred or imagined by the reader.		> Moderators held private conversations with Riot staff about moderation issues		Lewis links an image of a long letter from a moderator to RiotLyte attempting to brainstorm ways in which to improve this subreddit's community in terms of negativity towards other users, esports professionals, Riot itself, and so on, as well as increasing the quality of submissions to the site.		Most of the letter is completely benign. Lewis established earlier in the NDA article that Riot was in contact with the mods. Is it now news that they actually talk to each other through this channel of contact? Characterizing this letter as "private conversations" about "moderator issues" is not factually incorrect, but, at least to me, it conveys the sense that the moderators were asking about specific instances of moderation and deferring to Riot on how to handle topics. However, the letter is actually just a moderator of a large League of Legends community asking a League of Legends community manager how to manage a community made up of League of Legends fans. (Granted, Lyte is not a community manager, but actually "Lead Designer of Social Systems", but that would not have worked in the flow of the previous sentence. Apologies.)		> Riot staff has an open channel of communication with mods and have made numerous requests to change the layout or add features		Yet again Lewis mentions the same thing that he did in his NDA article, the open channel of communication to the mods. This time, it is a different one, though. Apparently, Riot and the mods can e-mail each other on the internet through a private e-mail list.		As for these "numerous requests to change the layout or add features", I'm unsure as to why these were included, because these are in line with what Riot and the moderation team said in responding to the NDA article. These seem to be the specific issues that Riot and the mods would discuss. They are all things to help the community.		The last one seems to be Lewis's real piece of evidence, though this is only by my assumption and not any of Lewis's own verbiage.		> ...a moderator agreed to remove "account related threads" on the subreddit, which included complaining about “stuff related to poor or no help from Riot support.”		The actual e-mail says:		> ...we wanted to inform you that we will be removing all Account related threads from the subreddit, this includes but not limited to Hacked accounts, Selling / Buying, Permanent / Temporary bans, RP crediting issues, stuff related to poor or no help from riot [sic] support etc. We want you to help us enforce this by kindly asking rioters to not respond to any such threads...		This is probably the worst thing in this article, because I feel like I can draw a conclusion from this evidence here. My conclusion is that this e-mail was taken out of context with no other e-mails in the chain because it would become clear that this was not in response to being asked to remove things from the sub by Riot. It is clear a moderator did not "agree" to anything. The point is this e-mail is to ask rioters not to respond to the threads to aid in their own moderation. The inclusion of this is extremely misleading.		Lastly,	> Mods removed content that violated Riot’s terms and conditions for playing League of Legends	Lewis takes issue with this rule for whatever reason, even though it is commonplace, even on reddit, to disallow certain types of rules-breaking talk even if it is not illegal. He then describes that his insider looked at the private moderator form, and actually found the moderators enforcing this rule, including in an instance when a video advertised one of those scam skin sellers or something against the ToS. For unknown reasons, this is actual evidence of impropriety, even though the moderators are actually following their own rules. This is the most bizarre part of the article because I struggle to try to figure out what Lewis is trying to say here. He calls on his insider to confirm that the moderators are doing their jobs? Is this meant to credit or discredit the moderators?		In conclusion,	I wrote this post because I saw many people mentioning here how the article’s implications deserved to be discussed without resorting to ad hominem attacks against Lewis or Riot. I agree, kind of. I think that we should not attack Lewis and call him names, but I also do not think his article is worth talking about. At least the NDA was not common knowledge, even if Lewis overstated its significance. There is nothing worthwhile whatsoever in this particular article, and I made this long post to explain that.		TL;DR I attempt to explain why Richard Lewis’s article is of little worth without resorting to ad hominem attacks.","depth":0,"score":53,"ups":53,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"probune","name":"t1_cpx22fr","parent_id":"t3_30y3yf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427862808,"created_utc":1427834008}

You left out the reasoning he provides, which is much stronger than the ending statement, which is admittedly kind of leading.

It is possible that this is a conflict of interest, I suppose, even though video game critics all over this industry have working relationships and friendships with developers, just like music and film critics are also fans of their field and friends with musicians and filmmakers. It's only as conflicting as any of these things.		This is a poor argument in my opinion, considering how many critics will just straight out sell reviews, especially in the mainstream media. Just like companies constantly post, or buy, "customer reviews" on social media.		Otherwise, a decent post. Richard's bias is a bit too heavy to my liking, although it's not as bad as in the previous one. But it does show that the communication between mods and Riot goes way beyond just "server status" info. It's not necessarily a bad thing, and it does at least provide a valid reason for the NDAs, but the lack of transparency is always a minus.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Haxenkk","name":"t1_cpx3t1w","parent_id":"t1_cpx22fr","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427865508,"created_utc":1427836708}

Riot Triggs claims:		“We do have zero influence over this subreddit… The NDA is the same standard that anyone has to sign when they may come across any confidential information. It ensures that player information and sensitive security issues remain confidential.”		Lewis then offers numerous counterexamples to the claim that Riot does *not* influence r/leagueoflegends:		* Moderators could receive products from Riot.	* Riot paid to design the subreddit in 2012 and dictated when this would be revealed to the public, lending credence to the idea that the moderators have worked and continue to work with Riot.	* Moderators have sought and continue to seek positions within Riot.	* Moderators have held and continue to hold discussions with Riot on issues regarding moderation, including but not limited to (a) subreddit layout (b) upcoming content (c) content which violates Riot's terms and conditions. (I believe this is the most controversial point, because the extent of this relationship remains unclear.)		In light of the fourth point, it's evident that Riot games does *not* have zero influence on this subreddit, contrary to claims by Riot Triggs. Whether this is truly harmful for the state of the subreddit has yet to be seen, but it is clear that the interaction between Riot and the moderators warrants some carefulness.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"UjuDmfpe","name":"t1_cpx5fmo","parent_id":"t1_cpwwsm7","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427868206,"created_utc":1427839406}

Reddit moderators are not paid to mod this subreddit. Riot offered to cover expenses for proper artwork. The mods would have been crazy not to accept that kind of help. I don't think them dictating when it's revealed is a big issue as Riot probably wanted to make an article on the League website about it, which isn't a bad thing.		> Moderators have sought and continue to seek positions within Riot.		That's down to moderators and has nothing to do with Riot, they aren't intentionally making people apply to them for a job. Riot has influence in pretty much every league players life. I mean, there's some people who have opted in to a game design education with the end goal of working for Riot.		> Moderators have held and continue to hold discussions with Riot on issues regarding moderation, including but not limited to (a) subreddit layout (b) upcoming content (c) content which violates Riot's terms and conditions.

{"body":"I'm going to come at this from the perspective of someone who is responsible for managing an organization.		The League of Legends Subreddit is a volunteer organization which has grown to tremendous proportions in terms of members. Management of any organization will undergo various growth milestones which alter management requirements.	 	In its earliest stages (Lets say S1, possibly part of S2?) this Subreddit was simply a place for people who had picked up yet another new online game to congregate and speak about their experiences. This type of forum is especially important for a couple of reasons. 		1. Unlike MMORPG online games there is no permanently online community, however this MOBA has an extremely variable and complex nature, thus a forum for discussion and sharing experiences in necessary.		2. In my opinion, compared to my experience with other online games, and perhaps due to the average age of the client base, the Official forums for League of Legends is not an especially desirable place to conduct discussion. It seems to be that the userbase of Reddit tends to be a bit older and on average a bit more interested in both discussion and growth of their ability as a player.		It is not overly difficult to police a forum of this size and nature. 		At some point the game grew past a critical mass. People more involved that I or with actual data could attempt to date this event. I would tentatively state that S3 and the explosion of popularity and development of LCS is a good timestamp. All of a sudden this game which has been very fun to play has highly promoted professional play which everyone is prompted to watch. Discussion around professional play, strategy, champion selection, begins to flood the subreddit. The growth of the subreddit and the amount of new threads hitting the front page is not astounding. 		**What community do we want to create?** How can we still manage this in a way to provide quality content? What do the 500k members really want on the front page? What is fair/unfair to moderate? What are unpopular decisions where the vocal minority will explode but are necessary for the health of the community?		These questions need to be asked on a regular basis, and I believe they are. 		I am happy that there is communication between the subreddit and Riot. 		I am happy the Mods are reaching out to Riot for experiences and best practices on managing a large community. 		I am happy that the Mods have decided to adopt sections of the TOS as Subreddit rules. I hate cheaters, I dont mind witch hunting them, but I also understand false positives and the need for the rule.		I am happy that some of the former (and current) moderators were so capable at managing a community under these growth rates that they went on to work at Riot games to do so in a professional capacity.			**Tl:DR** - I think everything in the Daily Dot post signifies that the mod team is actually doing the best they can (and a very good job) at managing a Subreddit which has undergone an explosive growth period. Reaching out to and working with Riot is in the benefit of all of us in this community.

He had his own intent. He then went to Richard Lewis and Richard said we would be interested in your findings. (and I assume he means the Daily Dot when he says we).		You claiming that he is biased but then are acting like a saint when in fact you are biased too as a moderator. Until more information is in the light we won't truly know how much influence Riot has. You can't just dismiss everything as "Bias" when actually all he did was post facts to let people interpret them himself.		All I see the mods post everytime is "the Skype chat is for Server status and free gifts because Riot is nice" sorta things but no actual proof to prove that is it and obviously it would be easy to cover up and pick out what you screen cap. This subreddit was suppose to be *RIOT INFLUENCE FREE*. Sure doing the stuff to get riot aware about server status is nice but free gifts? That sounds like a bribe to me. From what I learn giving someone something then asking them to do something later is in fact a bribe.		My final point is I really don't have a side I am new to this subreddit relatively. 7 months now and I did look at the mod application because I thought I had free time, nothing to do at the moment and lets be honest, barely if any had to do with moderating a sub reddit or moderating anything. (Why is your main better then [enter mods name here]'s Lulu?) really?  Why also have a "you have to be a redditor for a year cap on it? Because I was only here for 6 months anyway I am better qualified (I was an admin on several CS:source servers that are now long gone) then most they still could get it? Lets be honest if you give someone a position of authority and they never had it, they do get the "Napoleon Complex" and go power hungry. I went there before when I first got a Admin status and I seen it on everyone else that got it for the first time. You guys are anonymous, You are behind a computer using alias. Richard at least is brave enough to put out his real name and his face. Maybe it was a threat to dox or maybe he was just trying to prove a point that hiding behind a mask makes you think your able to get away with shit.		This is my point sorry if it sounds "Bias" but I am actually neutral. Just from seeing the information all from this drama, I have to lean towards Richard's side. So far with the information present it is up to the moderators to prove it wrong because the information posted does show Riot has some influence. If it really is "misinterpreted" like you moderators say then prove it. Show us the full chat logs, show us all the emails, not just several, all. STOP HIDING BEHIND A MASK!		Sorry if I made a mistake. Trying to get all of my points down before they leave my head.		EDIT: thought came to mind. If you say the NDA is optional but that most people sign it is really pressuring them into signing it. Which is while not professionally wrong, is morally wrong using peer pressure to do so.		EDIT2: If your wondering how I know if the leak wasn't planted I ask Richard (yes I know that is a biased view but we have 2 peoples words going at it and innocent until proven guilty for me in USA) on twitter.  		EDIT3: I also stated above that this sub reddit is suppose to be *RIOT INFLUENCE FREE* but they payed the for the re-designing of the sub reddit is a concern (and as a company when they have their own forums I doubt it was for free).

{"body":"It's not that this is "suddenly so important."  It has always been important that /r/leagueoflegends does not turn into Riot's own personal marketing forum and thus the relationship between the Mods and Riot is important.  The question is whether or not you actually care about the issue which you clearly do not (along with the majority of people here.)  Saying "I don't understand why this is suddenly so important" to this is the equivalent of people saying "why is it suddenly important that the NSA is keeping phone records of Americans" when Edward Snowden leaked documents; obviously equivalent in mentality, not in scale of importance.  It's always an important issue, it's just a matter of whether or not you care about the issue and how you feel about it.  		You personally, as well as a large amount of people on this subreddit, either do not care about the relationship between reddit mods and Riot, do not care if there is a relationship between reddit mods and Riot, or do not believe there is a significant relationship between reddit mods and Riot.  Which is perfectly fine.  There are other people who do believe there is a significant relationship between reddit mods and Riot and it's a bad thing as a whole for the community.  That is also fine.  For whatever reason for the last five days or so it seems that this entire subreddit has lost the ability to have any sort of conversation.		Richard Lewis wrote a series of articles highlighting the possibility of a connection between reddit mods and Riot.  He has backed up most of what he has said with quotes and evidence and, for the most part, the articles seem to be factual based on the quotes and screen shots that he has posted.  Now, someone could say "these quotes are taken out of context."  That's great!  Let's have a discussion about that!  What is out of context?  What is the correct context of those quotes?

{"body":"If the last article about Riot NDAs which turned out to be a complete non issue are anything to go by, we need to look at this article with critical eye:		>**Moderators held private conversations with Riot staff about moderation issues**		That sounds really nefarious. Private conversations? Riot staff interfering in the moderation of the subreddit? Then we read the article itself and we realize they were just asking for feedback on how to improve user behaviour on subreddit, like hivemind bandwagoning, or witchhunting pro personalities. Can any of you really deny this is an issue in the subreddit? In fact, I would go one step further and say that Richard Lewis would prefer nothing better than if we would go back to bandwagoning/witchhunting against voyboy like his wtfast article wanted us to do, and like the good little boys and girls we are. 		Or take these two titles about mods applying to be rioters, which RL sees as something nefarious:		>**Multiple moderators have become Riot employees and some remain in daily contact with the moderation team**		>**One active moderator is seeking a job with Riot**		 Here is what krispykrackers, the site administrator had to say when asked about this:		>>And mods becoming Riot employees can't be seen as some kind of compensation and is not worrying at all...		>**I mean, being a moderator of an online community is seen as that person being passionate and focused on the topic of that community. If people put that on a job application, isn't that relevant and positive? Don't you want the people in charge of a community you care about to be proud of what they're doing?**		After reading that quote ask yourselves, is it really that nefarious that a community member who is clearly passionate about the community, wants to contribute to the making of the game? Why is it, that with just a little bit of spin, Richard lewis can alter our perception about something relatively innocuous into some full blown conspiracy?		>**Mods removed content that violated Riot’s terms and conditions for playing League of Legends**		Once again, this seems like a gross overstep from the reddit mods. Then you read what they were actually banning with these rules: videos with sponsors that included fake referrals, account leveling, skin selling. The reason for doing this seems to be pretty clear: the more people are exposed to these websites, the more people are going to use them. The more people use them, the more botters/scripters/exploiters we see in league of legends. 		Let's stop upvoting Richard Lewis's private vendetta to the front page, and give him and his sensationalist "journalism" the ignominy it deserves.

A journalist is not always obligated to be neutral, nor are they required to simply "report facts."

Notice how the title says that commentary, criticism, and personal essays fit *into* journalism rather than lie outside the realm of journalism. 		All reporters are journalists, but not all journalists are reporters. Sometimes a journalist has an ethical obligation to not be neutral and to advocate strongly against an injustice or flaw that they have found. Many great journalists are investigative journalists who exposed corruption and crime, in a way that is not very neutral at all. 		Brian Deer, the man who debunked the Lancet article that linked autism and vaccines, was clearly not neutral in his depiction of the parties involved. 		What you're looking for is for a journalist to be neutral to the material involved; to view it impartially and create conclusions that are backed up by sound and accurate evidence rather than emotion or prejudice.

As [Lyte said:](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2y41j0/why_doesnt_riot_have_a_system_where_they_email/cp634zo) "However, the Tribunal is currently going through a re-work so Reform Cards are down as well. Right now, our Player Support teams will send out chat logs in e-mails for 'escalated bans' like the 14-day and permanent bans." This allegedly only applies to straight up bans whereas a lot of players need this information a lot sooner (chat+ranked restrictions)		This is pretty clearly an issue with Riot's support and it needs to be discussed here and we need to raise awareness about this. Players left in the fog are very unlikely to 'reform' and ameliorate their behavior.		I understand that you don't want all users to suddenly post about their support issues but deleting the threads isn't a solution.

Yes Richard, that means you're not allowed to provide PERSONAL INFORMATION of people when it isn't publicly available in order to incite action against them, especially with little to no evidence to back it up, as per this article and it's claims, as the community has proven.		If you're going to throw a fit over trying to witch-hunt the moderators of the subreddit and complain when they take down your articles when they contain sensitive information to verify whether or not it conforms to their rules, then repost it later once they verify that it does, then you're only furthering the case against you.		The only war against you is in your head, and all the negative attention and actions levied against you are just consequences for you acting outside of the established rules and threatening to break more for not getting your way. Stop being such an outlandish child and learn how to be a professional at your job, or else give up and find something else to do. This community has no place for overgrown children who refuse to accept the consequences of their actions. Furthermore, if you threaten to expose the lives and identities of people within a moderation team of one of the largest subreddits on the entire site, without due reason and for all apparent intents and purposes are doing so for your own malicious intent, then you're literally no better than a 4chan troll circa 2005, and you shouldn't be surprised when reddit shadowbans you from their site.

{"body":"Hopefully continuing a level headed discussion:		The issue at hand is that this forum is the primary source for all 3rd party content, information and analyses. If anything LoL related happens the news is shared here, if Rapidstar or Monte analyse a game it fill be found here and if TheOddone's new video comes out it will be discussed here as someone counts the number of 'F-words' in it. So when this forum is spoken about, we are speaking about not only a residence of 600k+fans but also what amounts to a very important place for any content creator, die hard fan or someone who makes their money from journalism whether or not they are 'journalists'. There are hundreds for whom this isn't just a chill forum- team owners who want roster moves kept silent, managers/coaches who don't want \#BenchPlayer posts destroying their team's morale, players who want to reach out to their fans in AMAs without having threads detailing their past errors make front-page, casters looking for feedback on increasingly tolerable Danish accents, game designers looking at whether their name has become synonymous with broken champions, analysts who aren't real coaches, comedians who don't play a trope, dudes who want to propose in slippers, Youtubers, Riot PR agents dedicated to this forum and a thousand other things including random guys stuck in promos contemplating the beautiful world where Lee Sin has all his nerfs reverted and KeSPA outbid China. And everyone has their own agendas, some of which are quite monetarily significant. Their will be obvious conflicts and at this time everyone is at some level required to bow to the collective might of the 660k. As such the rules and regulations of this site are fast becoming inadequate and lacking in both clarity and consistency of application.		You need to understand that every mod decision-legitimate or not- will always be observed and recorded by everyone over here. There will be content critical of Riot and content that furthers Riot's own stance, both articles on how Riot is considering a ban on LCS players streaming HS and content regarding making the game less toxic or a hell lot of Rito pls/TY Rito posts. Thus when a situation arises when there are very controversial removals of content questions and finger pointing are likely to follow. When NDAs are signed or people communicate with former LCS players turned streamers without this *being made public by the team themselves* obviously there will be a lack of faith. This lack stems from 2 things- 'witch-hunting'/'hate-speech' rules which are arbitrary at best and potentially abusable tbh, and this previous lack of demonstration of transparency by the mods. And as long as both of these remain, and especially as financial motivations exist going in the millions, their will always be mistrust.		Looking forward neither RL/KT are presently on this forum. There are however, still more than a half million who are. KT did allow for communication b/w the team and the sub itself and RL has allowed for a lot to come out in the open. I see no reason why the mods themselves couldn't do both(w.r.t this forum) in the future. Could the witch-hunting rules finally have a set of parameters established with some detail as to what counts as evidence? The NDA being entirely for security reasons could this not have been communicated by the mods and discussed in the open? If instead of articles being pulled 'because MYM provided real evidence' could the mods not just sticky saying that it is a refuted claim? I do respect the job that mods are doing but I believe these are all legitimate concerns. Considering the nature of this place including the die hard fandom, slightly immature portion of the audience, pathetic content creators with bad documentaries using this site for revenue generation and certain shady individuals, this site could be a lot worse. But it could also be a lot better.

"Please upvote"/"please subscribe"/"please donate" are already treated contemptuously, can the same not be said for "please tune in to watch a match we sponsors want you to watch"? Not only is it blatant manipulation of a very impressionable audience(I know this will draw flack but this is the case) but also that if they valued TSM/C9 so highly they would have paid more for a sponsorship instead of buying advertisement space at a low rate then artificially increase viewership.

It implies that Riot asked (sorry, Richard Lewis would say "*demanded*" - see what I did there?) these threads be removed, when in actuality, it's the mod team that decided to remove them and was simply informing Riot of this fact.		These are the last-ditch efforts of a man desperate to dig up any dirt he can.  He takes the most banal, inane, and perfunctory issues and spins them as dramatically as possible.

{"body":"To your first point, I don't know if this actually was the case, or if the subreddit ever actually existed. I'd like to see some positive proof that the place was real before I personally jump to any conclusions.		To your second point, that's not whole-heartedly surprising considering the lack of factual content in the article. If you've been reading the thread, regardless of any truth contained within, people have ripped it apart and exposed very heavy anti-mod bias and propaganda within the content of the article, which is more than enough reason for that article to be removed, IMO.		One of the big rules of this subreddit is no witch-hunting, and this article reads as nothing short of exactly that, IMO, other possible transgressions aside.		Which leads me o your third point. I don't argue that what you say is true, as is evident, but I will say the following; this was already NOT a neutral place of discussion in the first place. The rules on the sideboard give clear guidelines about what is and isn't acceptable to be brought up on the sub-reddit. These are rules that the mods have put in place. We have no evidence to believe that there was any collusion between Riot and the moderating staff regarding these rules, and if we did, I'm certain that the mod who resigned after dox dropping all this information to RL would have gladly forked over any evidence of collusion if it ran that deep. There'd be no reason not to, and it would immediately prove RL to be right.		The only reason I can assume that no such dox were dropped is because they must not exist, (Though I admit I could be wrong, but that's my assumption to make) which, if we do follow that assumption, resolves us to looking at the facts presented, which are few and are presented with dubious intent.			To clarify, I'm not saying RL is necessarily at fault here. He wrote a clearly biased article, but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt about this supposed other subreddit, at least until evidence emerges otherwise, and only because I don't want to jump to assumptions and witch-hunt someone over something, regardless of whatever opinion the community might hold at the moment.		We need all of the facts to come out regarding this, before we can act as an informed community and properly lay blame and consequences regarding the fallout of this particular set of circumstances. That's only fair to both parties involved, and is in the true spirit of acting unbiased and impartial.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cryptekz","name":"t1_cpx1f9t","parent_id":"t1_cpwybmj","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427861822,"created_utc":1427833022}

{"body":"The basic gist: Richard's article is hardly fair or unbiased.  Our coordination with Riot has been exclusively to provide better content to the community through the willing employees that would work with us.  If the resources are there, why not use them?		So, let's start at the top: 		The (former) moderator who felt "pressured" to sign an NDA was told explicitly several times that he didn't need to sign it.  And he actually initiated several inquiries about the NDAs to try to pressure *us* into getting him the form.  The moderator who manages that paperwork told me that the former mod was pestering over several days to be allowed to see and sign the NDA (that moderator stalled because "it's a headache to deal with, and I was busy").  This former mod then told me privately (in skype) that he would need some time to look it over, and I told him that was entirely acceptable and that he should.  The idea that he was peer-pressured into feeling like he had to sign it is, in my view, unsubstantiated.		---	> After all, the moderators would have never been asked to sign an NDA if they were not moderators of the subreddit to begin with,		So many people have been asked to sign NDAs.  Ever been to Riot Headquarters?  To get inside, you have to sign an NDA, even if you're just visiting.  It isn't uncommon for Rioters to ask people to sign NDAs for any amount of coordination with them.  If we were regular community members trying to let Riot know when server issues were coming up, they'd ask us to sign NDAs.  Our being moderators doesn't matter nearly as much as Richard seems to think.		---	>The email says nothing about what, if anything, moderators had to do to secure these gifts.		Moderators did nothing to obtain the gifts except state their interest in receiving a gift.  And not everyone on the team received gifts.  I asked someone from Riot if he could hook the team up with physical gifts (I've long felt that physical gifts are appreciated more than intangible points), and he delivered. Simple as that.		---	> "Goggris,” the head moderator at the time,		False.  In 2012, Goggris was only a moderator.  The head moderator at that time was largely inactive.  Goggris became head moderator almost a year later, in May of 2013.		There are also only two moderators currently still on the team that were on the team at that time.  We all agree that it was horribly communicated and largely was broken as shit--literally CSS wasn't working as it was designed to.  (Incidentally, we have been working for the past half a year or so on a new theme, designed exclusively by the mod team, which you can find over at /r/lolcsstest.)		---	* Multiple moderators became Riot employees or tried to seek employment.		Totally true. The article does a good job of listing who on the team since the time I started as a moderator has joined Riot.  It really isn't surprising for a company to look at how passionate an applicant is when considering their application.  Moderating demonstrates passion for the game and community--values that Riot has reliably said matter to them.		More to the point, the number of people who became Rioters or seek employment is *pretty low*.  They also make very little effort to hide their intentions at any point in the process.  We look for good help, not for whether or not they want to be on a certain company's payroll.  The "Snowden" moderator was a trial writer for Richard Lewis' former place of employment (EsportsHeaven) and we took him anyway because we valued the diversity of opinion that he would bring.		And that's really what matters here, isn't it?  Even if we have a couple mods that hope to be employed by Riot, their influence within the team is offset by the people who aren't so cozy with Riot or have other interests and values.  We like having a diverse team and strive to keep the team reasonably diverse.		No one can be both on the moderator team and on Riot's payroll.  We made that decision very early and have held consistent to it.  Everyone knows that if they get a job with Riot, they have to leave the team.		---	* A rule concerning Terms of Service		This rule is all my creation, so let me explain it.  Back in March 2013, I was trying to consolidate the long list of rules into a smaller list that would be easier to understand.  In that effort, I decided to group together the longstanding prohibitions on hacks and exploits, account purchasing, and Elo boosting services.  My way of organizing that grouping was to frame it in terms of what would get you banned from Riot.  I understand it looks bad to have that sort of rule, and we're working on a revamped version of the rules that fixes that problem.  But that mistake is mine alone, not proof of collusion.  The rules that general umbrella contains have existed since before I was a moderator, before anyone even dreamed of talking with Riot about community issues as much as we now do.		---	>“What I saw made me question how independent the sub is and I believe it has a problem that needs to be addressed," he said. "I care about that more than any site privileges.”		I laughed when I read this. The only corruption we've ever had from active moderators has, ironically, been from the moderator who decided to leak all this information.  He was offered a trial with esportsheaven where he was writing esports articles on league of legends.  He had written one article for Richard's former place of employment prior to joining the mod team.  We told him that he couldn't do both and that he'd need to choose when we should have just told him that it was too much of a conflict of interest.  I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt though, because I valued his perspective and thought it added good diversity to the team.		---	TL;DR: Richard's portrayal of events here is obviously slanted, full of minor inaccuracies and more major misrepresentations, and the bits that are entirely true prove that we have been interested enough in improving the subreddit experience to seek help from experts on the topic.  I would think that is what you want from your moderators, but different strokes from different folks.","depth":1,"score":159,"ups":159,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BuckeyeSundae","name":"t1_cpwyca8","parent_id":"t1_cpwv6ak","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427857085,"created_utc":1427828285}

To say that Riot is in the wrong for giving mods a Teemo hat is complete pettiness. In my opinion, RL is upset because he didn't get chosen to receive a hat, and he is choosing to throw a fit. He's attacking the character of those that received the hats when, in reality, they are doing a lot more for the community than they get credit for. A hat is a small thank you to deal with the childish tantrums that people such as RL throw. 		The fact that RL dedicates another section to the fact that Riot has suggested changes to this subreddit is a joke. Of course Riot is going to make suggestions to make the community better. In the same way that Morgana's ultimate got a range indicator because this subreddit suggested it, Riot is just as free to make suggestions to improve quality of life.

You've yet to provide any example of how this might be the case. I've taken the time to explain that being a subreddit moderator doesn't require privileged access to NDA information. Most subreddits don't even interact with a company in a way that would require an NDA. The only demonstrable examples so far have been receiving direct contact about status updates (to be shared at the top of the subreddit) and to know when AMAs are happening.

{"body":"> I don't have to explain or expound upon this at all, because it is self evident.		Except it's not.		> which the mods have specifically said has led to many great things for the subreddit.		Yes, the **moderating team** having this information has allowed for great things. There's been no indication that an individual moderator is impaired from doing their job; it's even noted in the OP that there are some moderators that haven't signed the NDA:		> He was told it was optional but that **most mods** signed it		And what were some of those great things for the subreddit?		> Riot staffers in the room provided information that was used to help the community, **such as updates on server issues**.		If you can give me a good example of communications between Riot and the subreddit moderators that were:		1. Not permitted to be relayed down to NDA non-signers for the sake of keeping corporate secrets	2. Created a clear benefit to the subreddit; and	3. Prevented a non-NDA moderator from performing subreddit moderating duties at an equal capacity to NDA moderators		... then maybe you'd have a valid case to make. But, I'll once again note you're only dreaming hypothetical scenarios. NDAs are often used as a safety net to prevent potentially private information from being leaked. That doesn't necessarily mean that you're constantly sharing private information.		All you've been doing is assuming that there's some sort of secret information always being relayed that's hampering non-NDA moderators from doing the same level of moderating as NDA moderators. There's been absolutely no implication of such a thing, and it's ridiculous for you to keep acting as if it's self-evident.		I'll go further to note that your original point was about a "culture of pressure" generated from your blatantly unsubstantiated assumption, which was an even more ridiculous stretch of the imagination.		EDIT: By the way, once again you commit a logical fallacy in the form of burden of proof. You're the one claiming that not signing the NDA incapacitates a moderator's ability to do their job, and that there's a culture of pressure to sign the NDA. It's your responsibility to provide evidence of these claims; my responses have been in refutation, noting that you're talking out of your ass.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"iamcaustic","name":"t1_cpzl0zd","parent_id":"t1_cpz9z32","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1428056966,"created_utc":1428028166}

{"body":"I think people (and certainly Richard) are mistaking a line of open communication between a studio and the administrative management of a fan community as "influence" or another form of malignant "censorship". 		As someone who has been on both sides of this relationship, I can tell people a few things. I have TL;DR'd in bold:		**Studios try not to influence fansites or fan communities because it is counter to the purpose of having them.** A good studio recognizes the value of having a fan community, because it is a sphere which creates organic feedback or perception about things they do in a place where they do NOT have direct control. This is valuable feedback because gamers value places in which they can speak more freely and feel like they have a grassroots community grown outside of official channels. To influence this in any way hamstrings a studio's own ability to gather unfiltered, dynamic feedback.		**Fansites gain legitimacy by being recognized by a studio and being able to communicate with them. That legitimacy hinges, however, on being perceived as putting their communities first.** Any fansite or fan community that comes up is seen as credible if recognized by the studio their game is associated with. This means that a channel for communication and talk is a natural consequence of that legitimacy. But being "legit" only goes so far insofar as the community thinks the fansite is not seen to be a shill for the studio and retains its independence when it comes to decision-making. It's thus in their best interest to not do things that seem counter to their mission as a fan-based community. This includes looking like they're an extension of the studio.		**Studios and fansite/fancommunity relationships are typically a give-and-take of communication, mutual respect and openness. But in the end, the decision-making is independent because it's best for both parties.** A relationship of this nature relies on the fact that consideration must be given for the other's viewpoint. A studio may not like some content that appears on a fansite or fan community. A fansite's staff might absolutely not agree with getting wind of a future game update from the studio that is detrimental to players. But ultimately, if the fansite decides the content is fine and the studio decides the game update is good to go, they have to respect that and understand that they are separate entities that make their own decisions. Not doing this disrespects the relationship and ruins the point of having it. A fansite doesn't want to be seen as a shill. A studio doesn't want to be seen as controlling about the opinions of their content. It makes no logical sense in the context of having the relationship.		I read the article and looked at the screenshots, and the current relationship between Riot and this subreddit's staff appears to fall in line with any of the three points I made. It's a normal relationship established for the benefit of open communication and ultimately, for the community itself. Anything sinister to be gathered from it is honestly a stretch, and I can tell you from direct experience that the more deplorable scenarios that can result from a studio-fan community relationship are most certainly the exception, and not the rule.","depth":2,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dresdenologist","name":"t1_cpwzwhk","parent_id":"t1_cpwviyy","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427859503,"created_utc":1427830703}

{"body":"I think Brazierlady is specifically referencing things like spinning a situation. Politicians do it a lot and while many claim to have the best interest of the people the represent at heart (much like the mods of a subreddit) many also have their own agendas. If something unfavorable makes it's way to the public then politicians "spin" the information to make it look either intentional or unintentionally defamatory. Deleting posts that bash RIOT would be heavy handed and obvious. 		Do I feel that way? I'm not sure. When critically thinking one should be more inclined to doubt something when the "truth" is something that suits your line of thought. I think many people in this sub **want** to believe that the mods are good people who look out for the health of this sub.  Many of those same people also want to believe that RL is only doing this to start drama in order to profit off the sensationalism. Using Occam's razor we can try to break down each of these lines of thought. 		* Are the mods good people and looking out for the health of the subreddit in terms of discussion while remaining uninfluenced by RIOT? Well that begs at least one assumption: **Mods are people who do not desire a job at RIOT games.** In the real world having someone vouch for you in a business scenario can do wonders for your job outlook. Even beyond that if a mod was shown to be agreeable to the suggestions that official RIOT community managers made then you've now shown that you would be a good fit for the company as you are agreeable within that company's culture. I find it hard to argue for this assumption since the reason someone accepts a mod position in a sub is because they are passionate about the topic. Being passionate about League may not mean one is passionate about RIOT but I also find it hard to argue that someone who is passionate about league wouldn't entertain the idea of working at RIOT for the chance to have an impact on the game itself. 		* Does RL only put out these articles for the purposes of sensationalism in order to drive his numbers up? Just in the few moments of research I just conducted RL has been writing at the daily dot since June 30th of last year. Yes, he has been highly critical of RIOT since he joined the Daily Dot. In fact, his first article was about how it was [controversial that RIOT removed curse voice and the implemented one of it's primary features.] (http://www.dailydot.com/esports/curse-voice-riot-games/) You'll notice that in his articles he doesn't remain critical and use biased language at the expense of accuracy, in order to provoke public interest or excitement. Which is essentially what sensationalism is defined as and that's nearly verbatim. So I think the assumption that he only does these things to generate wealth for himself is hard to argue. An assumption that he enjoys being critical of RIOT would be easy to agree with. It's clear that he does and I can't think of any assumptions that need to be made to be in line with that assessment. 		RL's job as a journalist, regardless of how people love to put quotations around the word in reference to it's application to him, is primarily concerned with being accurate and truthful. He specifically seems to like the whistle-blower role in journalism. Having a whistle-blower to draw attention to shady practices is necessary and healthy. It doesn't matter that it goes against the grain and ruins the happy image that all is right with the world. **If there is one thing RL struggles with terribly though** it's the principle of harm limitation. It requires that journalists or reporters withhold certain sensitive information from their reports before they are formally charged. The main aim is in order to avoid reports that cause harm to the reputation of someone innocent or that can worsen the grief of someone who has been a victim of a calamity or crime. The reason it's a big deal for him is two fold. The first is the witch hunting rule and the second is the fact that e-sports is still growing and thus there are shady practices in place with no true formal governing body to regulate these issues. RIOT does it's best in this regard but it's primarily a video game company with a clear conflict of interest that esportslaw has pointed out on multiple occasions in certain conflict resolution cases. Due to these two facts RL does his best to not instigate witch hunting while drawing attention to things that could be shady/illegal/terrible for the community. The issue is that when his information comes close to catching someone red handed they will often invoke the power of "witch hunting or hateful speech" and claim there is a call to arms implied within the article to maintain their innocence. 		TL;DR: People in positions to benefit from working with others behind the scenes benefit from not rocking the boat and spinning things in the favor of their associates. Many orgs have lied before and laid the blame at the feet of the journalist that reported on it to maintain their reputation/profit margin. Too many assumptions have to be made about a journalist to discredit their work as sensationalism unless they truly have sacrificed the accuracy of the piece for the sake of generating excitement or interest. Sorry for getting off topic a little at the end there.

{"body":"The whole attitude of this article is a bit played out in the comments, so I want to view this in another way. Just how bad, argumentatively, this article is.		I'll skip the introduction because that's setting up the basis, the context, and the situation. There's not much that can be criticized here from an academic point of view, because he's setting up what he wants to say later. I am also going to skip out on the background for the previous NDA, because most of that is direct quoting. I'm going to go on to, instead, the "new information".		"Subreddit mods could receive “swag” from Riot" section:		Firstly, RL fails to connect this back to the bribery argument presented in the introduction. There is a direct quote, saying "You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties", which I assume is the intended argument to be made here, however, it is clearly listed in the statement that "The email says nothing about what, if anything, moderators had to do to secure these gifts". Therefore, there is nothing that can suggest that the gifts given are in return for moderation actions. The argument here has not been connected; only that the question can be raised.		"Riot paid for a subreddit redesign in 2012 and dictated when the new design was made public" section		Again, there is a failure to connect this to moderation work. The most important thing to establish is not the activity of asking the company for help, the important thing to establish a breaking of the terms of service is what the activity in return for this work is. At this point, most viewers should, at some point, begin to doubt whether there is any rules dancing at all, not because the relationship is suspicious, but because what this relationship can actually entail *means*. There is also no counter-examples of why this is strange among the subreddit; supposing that you are a new user to reddit and you read this article, it is left entirely up to the reader to guess whether this activity is unusual or not, simply because there is no context. Perhaps that is intended, as readers may be likely to side with the journalist under neutral circumstances, but if that is so, that is a very dicey argument to make and assumes that the reader is purely braindead and naive.		"Multiple moderators have become Riot employees and some remain in daily contact with the moderation team"		This is an argument that is more self-evident, that Riot employees are not allowed on the moderation team. However, it completely bungles its establishment of the timeline. We are not given context whether the Riot employee is *still* on the moderation team or is not. In addition, all we are given is that a Riot employee is "in close contact" with the moderation team, in the case of RiotTriggs, but if so, what does that exactly mean? It is assumed, by the tone of the article, that it is intended to convey an air of conspiracy, but none of the details actually describe this fully. So we, the reader, are left to ask; is it as friends? Is it as former coworkers? Is it in official capacity as Riot and, if so, where in the rules is that disallowed? Argumentatively, this is thin air. If this is intended to establish that *these* are the favors that moderators get, then this has failed, due to the next section.		"One active moderator is seeking a job with Riot" section		Why is this relevant? There has been no argument established that moderators cannot apply to Riot, only that they cannot serve at the same time. The *correct* method to add an additional clause, stating or conveying some sort of conflict of interest without calling upon Reddit's rules. By quoting Reddit's rules at the beginning, this whole argument is shot in the foot before it can be established, because the beginning section implies a strict reading of the rules is the reason why this is suspicious. This is the kind of section that you should go through and begin painting the situation or establish the conflict of interest, because this is not an argument that is relevant to what has been established at the beginning of the article. In fact, this part is counterproductive because, in the previous section, it may be implied that the positions at Riot are the favors implied at in the rules, but if so, is there a reason why EnigmaBlade has not gotten the position? To show unfair bribery, you need to establish that the reward has been gotten unfairly, which this section actually goes against because there is an example of someone not receiving that reward. I mean, if I were to debate with someone that said "Riot gave out jobs to Reddit mods unfairly", the *first* argument I'd bring up off the top of my head is "This dude didn't get a job, are you sure there isn't another factor at play?" And it's not even a HARD argument to disassemble, but is IS critical.		"Moderators held private conversations with Riot staff about moderation issues"		Finally. FINALLY. Something that can be connected to the beginning argument, that moderation work was influenced by Riot. This is probably the most solid argument of them all, although, the details of this transaction are sparse. That is rather understandable, however, and this is probably the most solid argument that something suspicious is going on.		"Riot staff have an open channel of communication with mods and have made numerous requests to change the layout or add features"		And here we go, back to grasping straws again. This is slightly different (and better) because it shows correspondence of the moderators following commands of the Riot team. However, the problem is that the quoted section of the rules that RL draws upon, has two parts, in that they must be "in exchanged for favors". Nowhere is this premise suppoted, so we are, again, left to jump at shadows, at best. There is no narrative here supporting the rest.		Argh, gotta go off to class, maybe I'll read the rest. Honestly, though, probably not, I have a feeling the rest of the article is the same failure to establish links between actions and the premise at large.		EDIT: After returning and a brief scan, it's pointless to scan the rest of the article. There are some stuff I'd probably find (like the EnigmaBlade section, which is patently absurd), but here's the central problem behind the article.		There are, in fact, two premises to this article. The first, implied by the quotation of the Reddit rules and the negative tone, is the opposite of "You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties". The second, stated, is that there is a relationship between the Reddit mods and Riot Games. The most important problem is that these two premises are not linked together at all, by narrative or fact. Normally, this would be just a mere confusion factor, but here, the reason why that is so lethal to this article is because the tone of the article is derived from one premise and the facts support the other premise.		Did RL establish that Reddit mods and Riot Games have a relationship? Absolutely. But, the article seems to imply that this is a breaking of Reddit terms and this *does not automatically compute*. The opposite of "You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties" is that "Reddit mods performed at least one act of moderation in return for compensation or favor from third parties" and there is no argument that actually shows that, nor any narrative that makes that likely. Without that central link, the only way a reader will ever be convinced is if they are predisposed to link these two statements automatically, which means you must already be biased in a way that is negative against Riot in order to interpret the article that way.		During self-editing, someone should have immediately looked at the quoted section and say, "This is the reason why people would suspect corruption when reading this article. Not that Riot and Reddit have a relationship.

{"body":"Going through the points made:		1. **Swag:** ~~This is clearly against reddit TOS for moderators (merchandise is a form of compensation).~~ (Edit: reddit mods have investigated and say this is [in the clear](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/30y3yf/a_look_at_the_relationship_between_riot_games_and/cpwytl8?context=3).  I still think it's unethical.)  Definitely a cause for concern, though it appears to have been a one-time thing and it happened a year ago.  Certainly worth investigating further in order to determine if it truly was one-time.  Mods should not be accepting gifts from anyone (affiliated with Riot or not) in relation to their moderation duties.  At the same time though, it alone is hardly evidence of some sort of global Riot-moderator conspiracy.  I don't like it, but I'll keep the pitchfork stashed for now.		2. **Subreddit Redesign:** Probably the second-most concerning thing in the article, because it shows Riot as willing to spend money in order to influence the appearance of the subreddit.  However, the mods appear to have been pretty open about the whole thing, it happened 2+ years ago, and I haven't seen anything to suggest that Riot has done anything similar with the subreddit design since.  Again, worth some further investigation to see if Riot truly hasn't had further influence on the design, but as-is, not really relevant to the current situation.		3. **Mods becoming Riot employees:** I don't see how this is even worth mentioning.  People who have a passion for a particular game are more likely to become moderators for discussion forums revolving around that game.  They're also more likely to apply for job openings at the company that makes the game, and their time spent moderating is something that would make them more attractive to the game company, especially in a community liaison role (such as what Triggs does).  If he had evidence that moderators were getting special treatment in the application process (i.e. it was an internal requirement that only moderators of /r/leagueoflegends would be considered, or mods were getting special early application periods), then this would be newsworthy.  But I don't see anything of the sort.		4. **Conversations with Riot employees:** Again, I don't see the relevance.  First of all, there's no actual conversation shown, just a one-sided message to Lyte.  Anyone at all could send this on reddit.  And second, he's just asking for advice on general moderation/community management issues - something that Lyte has experience with.  Furthermore, we have no idea when this happened (the post date is cut off in the image and Lewis does not provide it in the article), and the proposed Riot-related measures listed in it have clearly not been implemented.  To me this appears to be a case of the moderation team reaching out to an individual who they thought might be able to provide a helpful perspective on some issues they were having with the sub.  That individual happened to be employed by Riot, but it was his employment that gave him access to that helpful perspective.		5. **Site influence by Riot:** This certainly challenges the mods' claims of independence from Riot, though we really have no context for the provided emails.  It is a little concerning that the mod staff seems to take the suggestions or ideas that Riot employees provide as requests or directions on how to proceed with certain things, but we *don't* see how many of these suggestions Riot makes or even the context for the posted emails.  The final email says nothing about "agreement."  The mod is informing the Rioter that posts related to support will be removed (as they should be - they belong on the Riot forums or in emails to Riot support) and requesting that Rioters not respond to any such threads.  There appears to be absolutely zero Riot influence at work in this email.		6. **Adhering to the Riot User Agreement:** This is just good business sense, especially the instances that Lewis cites (removing content that relates to account leveling/fake referrals - even if it is just a sponsor).  These are behaviors that no reasonable player should support, and the mods are well within their rights to dictate the rules of the subreddit.  If there was any evidence that Riot provided some incentive to the mods in order to force them to implement this rule, then this would be worth reporting.  As it is, it's a non-issue.		7. **NDA:** Been beaten to death by this point.  Suffice to say, it's not worrying at all.		**Getting to the main point of the article: is the subreddit independent of Riot Games?**		The only pieces of evidence I see for dependence are the subreddit design from two years ago (Riot paid for it) and some of the email chains (where mods agreed to all Riot suggestions).  The thing is, neither of these alone is really sufficient to *prove* dependence.  The redesign happened two years ago, and much has changed since.  Unless Riot continues to pay for site redesigns or the subreddit continues to use the Riot design from 2012 (I wasn't around then, so I don't know if this is the case, but I doubt it) then there is no dependence based on that fact.  As for the second, we have no context for the emails and we don't know how many Riot suggestions are implemented into the site.  If every suggestion they make is incorporated, then there is definitely a dependence.  But if Lewis is just cherry-picking a couple of instances, then it's simply a working relationship.		There is most certainly a relationship between the subreddit and Riot, and I think it was foolish for both the mods and Riot employees to make absolute statements such as "we have zero influence on the subreddit."  However, I think that such a relationship is both healthy for the community and good business-sense for Riot and it's honestly something I expected to exist.  I think it's a good thing - important even - for game developers to be in communication with their community, and this subreddit gives them a way to do so, especially considering that it gets so much more traffic than the official forums.		**Conclusions**		- A relationship between the mods and Riot does indeed exist.  This is not a bad thing.  It also does not preclude independence for the subreddit.		- While there is some evidence that the subreddit is dependent on Riot, more investigation needs to be done before it gets reported as fact.		- Some mods did apparently receive a gift from a Riot employee.  ~~This is almost certainly against the TOS for reddit mods.~~ (Edit: [not against the TOS](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/30y3yf/a_look_at_the_relationship_between_riot_games_and/cpwytl8?context=3), apparently) In my opinion, those mods who received the gift should consider returning it or resigning in the name of transparency and impartiality.  No further gifts should be accepted by the mods.		I think that Lewis made a couple of good points in the article.  However, his bias clearly shows in the lack of research into several of the claims he makes and the way he takes certain quotes out of context or uses wording that implies a different meaning.  This greatly diminishes the credibility of his article and distracts from the key issues he raises.","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChristophColombo","name":"t1_cpx1qg0","parent_id":"t3_30y3yf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427862300,"created_utc":1427833500}

That I didn't know, though I would argue that this isn't really the business world.  Since mods don't get paid for their work and we have no way of knowing what their RL financial situations are, we can't really say what level of gift would be influential.  While I highly doubt that the mods could be influenced by a Teemo hat, it's more the principle of the matter.  Now we know they got one gift, maybe they've been given more?  Again, I doubt this is the case, but I hope you can see where I'm coming from.

The first situation isn't legally wrong.  However, look at it this way: you're working in a volunteer position, and someone with a vested interest in seeing things done a certain way in the organization you work for has just given you a gift.  Sure, it probably won't influence your decisions, but it might if you were a little less moral.  Even if there's no explicit quid pro quo, some people might read one in.  		And more importantly, when a situation comes up like what's going on now, with the information that the mods received gifts is leaked to the public, suddenly people start to review everything you've done in light of the fact that you've received a gift.  There will always be things that look bad in that light, even if they really aren't, and that erodes trust with the community.  Until the reason for that loss of trust is removed, either through resignation or the return of the gifts, there will always be that doubt lingering in the back of some peoples' minds.		**TL;DR: It's all about perception.**","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChristophColombo","name":"t1_cpx9d03","parent_id":"t1_cpx5jas","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427875025,"created_utc":1427846225}

This is how you try and make your readers *think* there is monetary exchange or goods/services of worth, by simply adding a line like "oh, we got no evidence of money, but you know... they're close, wink wink". 		>And according to Reddit's community manager, Kristine “krispykrackers” Fasnacht, signing the document didn't violate the site's rules: 		A legit comment from a legit source, which is basically ignored by the rest of the article.		>While Riot emphasized that the Skype room and contracts were never used to exert influence over the community, their very existence at least raises the specter of leverage.		No, it doesn't. Really, if it's been established that the benefits provided from the NDA (which even a lawyer looked at) are so minor in nature and gives Riot no leverage, then there isn't one.		---	It's just honestly a bad article. /u/AncientSpark has some brilliant points below.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EpicAdde","name":"t1_cpx87jf","parent_id":"t3_30y3yf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427873040,"created_utc":1427844240}

Did someone actually click the picture? Because it shows that the mods have made a new rule that should get rid of the rubbish posts and QQ RITO PLS and whatever and *asked Riot to not answer those* because they might get to frontpage and will be harder to deal with, as well as probably getting the sub spammed even more with those kind of things, which, honestly, no one wants to see. 		Taking into account that RL is more salty than the Khewra salt mine, and that if he had any kind of proof to actually start a shitstorm, he would, this is just funny. 		The best people in this discussion are those yelling "read the article, then after that you might have a relevant opinion!", you might want to try to just click at the pictures and not let RL tell you what context he sees in there, but form a valid opinion.

His best interests have always been for the players... so its actually kind of weird that people dismiss him before even considering that... but perhaps not because the majority of redditors are under the age of 18.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"matthitsthetrails","name":"t1_cpx2a6r","parent_id":"t1_cpx1hcs","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1427863136,"created_utc":1427834336}
