On the other hand, a GREAT support can correct for all but the largest mistakes the adc makes (most of these involve being overextended) and will be the only thing keeping the lane from failing completely. Similarly a GREAT adc can take advantage of less obvious opportunities, meaning that the support doesnt need to provide as many openings and mistakes can be compensated for.

{"body":"Tristana can already push very fast, early mid-game crits aren't worth anything, you'll do slightly higher damage in 1/5 shots and you'd have to be pretty lucky for it to proc on a harass shot and not a minion, statistically you're more likely to be hitting a minion with a crit rather than a champion in lane. The 100 magic damage is nice, yeah, but when you compare it to the sustain, self-peel and better damage of a bork it comes up short unless you can crit proc the Shiv proc every time on an enemy champ, which is unlikely to happen. 		Crits isn't a basket you want to put all your eggs in, before you finish the shiv you'll be extremely weak and probably easy to zone as your opposition will likely either have a vamp scepter or a bf sword, maybe both. Even when you finish shiv your only strength is pushing and the ***slim*** chance that you might crit a champion instead of a minion. Shiv is also extremely predictable, you could easily be engaged upon when your enemy sees you proc it and realises you have no damage without it. Again your crits only hit for 206~ on level 9 tristana without factoring in armour and you'd still only have a 1/5 chance for it to happen.		Cloak isn't better than pickaxe because it could go an entire skirmish without ever procing whereas a pickaxe works every auto. AD is better than Crit because until you have two items crits are extremely unreliable damage whereas AD isn't.		I'm not talking about starting IE i'm just saying if you were to build it you would build the AD first as not only is it bigger gold items and therefore more slot efficient but the crit chance is useless without AD or another crit item (or Ashe passive).

For example, I'm Diamond as well. I could level up a new account to Diamond by playing Thresh and starting Coin every game. Does that mean coin is a good start on him? Not in the slightest, it just means I know the champion well enough to make up for the sub-par build-pathing.		That all said, your first explanation is good but not really a generally rule of thumb. Again, a lot of factors go into early game play, especially with trading(as I'm sure that you're well-aware). For example, if the other team has an ADC with longer range than you, your Support is melee, and the other team's Support is poke-based/has sustain, you're going to have a bad time if you grab zerks first just because it offers you more trade "flexibility." You'll still end up losing out on trades and will likely pushed be out of lane. And on the flip side, I'm sure there are many scenarios in which grabbing zerks could offer benefits over Vamp to a mechanically-skilled ADC.		So when it all comes down to it, yes I'm sure there are instances where you can properly utilize early zerks. However, until you get to some pretty high-level play most players don't have the skills needed to properly execute on that build path over Vamp.
