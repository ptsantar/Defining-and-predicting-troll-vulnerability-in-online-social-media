{"body":">**Do you think the 'KeSPA One Team Rule' will have an overall positive or negative effect on the Korean scene?**		I can't see any possible context in which it could be positive, with the exception that it make collusion to match-fix less likely.  The two team system quite clearly brought great benefits, which helped propel the Korean scene ahead.		Consider the number of occasions on which the second team, in nearly all cases starting out as the weaker of the two, has overtaken the main team.  Without a two team system, there would have been no Blaze, no NaJin Sword, no MVP Ozone/White and no SKT K.  Any fan of Korean LoL history should be able to appreciate the impact a world without those teams would have had.		No Blaze for Flame to be recruited to.  No secondary team built around the aggressive style of MaKNooN, instead he would have been thrown out and left to find a new team.  No SKT K to show the wisdom of building a team, using fresh parts, around a superstar rookie talent, as opposed to the leader-picks-the-players approach of Reapered on the main SKT team.  Finally, imp would never have been able to stick around until he got the pieces around him to become a champion and go on a streak of five straight OGN semi-final appearances.		A lot of the companies sponsoring the best teams in Korea as enormous companies, so it's not as simple as taking a team from one of those companies and then having another enormous company who is looking for a team of their own.  It's very likely that the one team system will mean a number of good players simply retire, seeing their chances at getting teams with the same kind of salary and resources as low and/or not being willing to try and climb back up again when it seems impossible to reach the same heights of accomplishment or career.		From MaKNooN going over to Sword to dade and PawN being swapped between the Samsung teams, we've seen great inter-team moves made as a result of the coaching staff analysing a player as having strengths but those being better suited for the other team.  Under the one team system, you either have to throw away star talent that doesn't fit or simply hold onto it for the sake of not losing a big name.  Neither of those are positive scenarios.		Imagine if fnatic had a second team and could simply move Cyanide and xPeke over there, adding in young up and coming players around them, while keeping their main line-up and bringing in Jankos and Nukeduck, or equivalent players with promise.  If TSM could have put Xpecial onto a B team, they could have given him time to get back in line with their team and then returned him to the team once the gleeb experiment had failed.		>**Do you think Korean imports are good for local talent?**		Yes, since it provides better players for them to play with and against.  There has only been one approach proven to consistently raise the level of players from lesser regions in esports games: going to the better region and playing against the players from that region.  In CS, teams from Brazil, North America and Korea would go to Sweden and bootcamp at a LAN centre for a couple of weeks before a major tournament, getting online practice against the best EU teams on the best internet connection possible.  That allowed a number of those teams to become world contenders, despite hailing from regions where they should have been going out 9th-12th and so on.		Likewise, the best example of Westerners getting to the level of top Koreans in SC2, are NaNiwa and HuK.  Where players like Scarlett and Stephano have largely gotten by on natural talent, which cannot be learned, players like NaNiwa and HuK went from merely top foreigners to some of the best players in the world, for a time, as a result of extended periods of living and practicing in Korea.		In the case of NaNiwa, I know him personally and from talking to him the routine was the same each time: arrive back in Korea, get destroyed for the first week super hard, keep getting beaten but gradually start to add some wins and figure out some strategies that work, eventually begin to win at a good clip and feel like your level is high, get to a really good level of winning a lot.  Once he had hit the last stage, he'd go to international tournaments and most of the time finish as one of the best non-Korean players in attendance, recording many top 4 finishes and wins over Koreans.		Bringing Koreans into other regions is a short-cut to avoid Westerners having to travel to Korea and practice there.  It also allows players who are good, by Western standards, but no longer capable of competing for championships within Korea, to still have careers and show their play to the world.		Personally, I'd be most in favour of something like shorter LCS splits, so that Western teams could directly go to Korea for either regular bootcamps, every few months, or to actually compete in OGN seasons.		>**Does Europe need to start using Korean imports to become strong again or is the main problem elsewhere?**		When you say again, I assume you mean in comparison to China and Korea, since I think the European talent is stronger than the NA talent, as witnessed by how diluted the NA teams have become.  I don't think Europe technically needs any Korean imports, though when it worked it would provide a short-cut to higher performance.  I think Europe's biggest problem has always been that the lower exposure and interest in streaming means that Europe's talent is not maximised in the same way as NA's is.		Think of the NA scene and practically every top level talent has either milked their whole career's worth of competition, until they have to retire or are forced out, or is still battling to be recognised.  In Europe there are countless names who have never been in the right team or quit too soon or had a good team finish on them and just decided the struggle wasn't worth it.		Think of names like extinkt, Zorozero, nukeduck, mithy, Tabzz (at mid lane), Linak and FORG1VEN.  These were all premier talents who were never able to make the most of their talents.  Consider that Bjergsen "should" be competing in EU right now, that Kev1n hasn't had a legitimately top 3 team since LCS Spring of 2013, that Creaton never recovered his form from his hand injury, that Alex Ich doesn't even play in LCS anymore.		Europe has more than enough talent, but it seems terrible at putting teams together.  Adding in some Koreans would be a good short-term fix for teams who can't find the right local talent.  It's also worth mentioning, that Europe's talent pool is also more locked off and difficult to access, as calling it "Europe" doesn't work in the same way as it does with all the other regions.  Try putting a Spanish guy with a French guy, a Pole, a Russian and a Swede.  That's a nightmare mix of English accents, cultural diversity and wildly differing backgrounds.		I think Europe's strength has always been that it played its own distinct style, according to its own intuitive internal logic.  If League has shown us anything, and the Chinese are a great modern day example of this, then it's that even if there is an ideal way to play, which is often the approach the Koreans show-case, it will always be more powerful to play your own style to its max than simply attempt to ape the theoretical ideal.		C9 are by far the best North American team in the last two years and they don't play a style that is anything like the historical stereotype of NA teams, which TSM are more in line with now, yet they are incredibly effective and get the absolute maximum out of their team.		I'm fond of an answer the legendary Korean Brood War player sAviOr gave, when asked for advice to those who wanted to become pro-gamers:		*"Anyone can try. 'I try hard, but why doesn’t it work for me?” types of thinking don’t get you anywhere. If you don’t have good results there is a reason for it. Take full advantage of your individuality, and with it surpass your competitors.'*		>**Are there any Korean pros you'd like to see play in other regions?**		Plenty of them.  My main criteria is that they should no longer be capable of winning OGN as a core member of a line-up there (i.e. you can't just put watch onto Samsung White and say it's fine for him to stay in Korea).  As a result, I would keep players like Flame and Faker in Korea, since they can still be the best players with the right teams.		The kinds of players I want to see in other regions are either guys who haven't been used correctly and look far from getting into right teams, so perhaps players like BetKyo, Nagne, Leopard, MidKing and H0R0.  That, or I want good players who are past their prime or not gonna get another chance at a title: Ambition, Shy, MadLife, Ryu, Piglet, Lilac etc.","depth":1,"score":1000,"ups":1000,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8hfnv","parent_id":"t1_cl8e7if","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413258492,"created_utc":1413229692}

{"body":"> When you say again, I assume you mean in comparison to China and Korea, since I think the European talent is stronger than the NA talent, as witnessed by how diluted the NA teams have become. I don't think Europe technically needs any Korean imports, though when it worked it would provide a short-cut to higher performance. I think Europe's biggest problem has always been that the lower exposure and interest in streaming means that Europe's talent is not maximised in the same way as NA's is.	Think of the NA scene and practically every top level talent has either milked their whole career's worth of competition, until they have to retire or are forced out, or is still battling to be recognised. In Europe there are countless names who have never been in the right team or quit too soon or had a good team finish on them and just decided the struggle wasn't worth it.	Think of names like extinkt, Zorozero, nukeduck, mithy, Tabzz (at mid lane), Linak and FORG1VEN. These were all premier talents who were never able to make the most of their talents. Consider that Bjergsen "should" be competing in EU right now, that Kev1n hasn't had a legitimately top 3 team since LCS Spring of 2013, that Creaton never recovered his form from his hand injury, that Alex Ich doesn't even play in LCS anymore.	Europe has more than enough talent, but it seems terrible at putting teams together. Adding in some Koreans would be a good short-term fix for teams who can't find the right local talent. It's also worth mentioning, that Europe's talent pool is also more locked off and difficult to access, as calling it "Europe" doesn't work in the same way as it does with all the other regions. Try putting a Spanish guy with a French guy, a Pole, a Russian and a Swede. That's a nightmare mix of English accents, cultural diversity and wildly differing backgrounds.	I think Europe's strength has always been that it played its own distinct style, according to its own intuitive internal logic. If League has shown us anything, and the Chinese are a great modern day example of this, then it's that even if there is an ideal way to play, which is often the approach the Koreans show-case, it will always be more powerful to play your own style to its max than simply attempt to ape the theoretical ideal.	C9 are by far the best North American team in the last two years and they don't play a style that is anything like the historical stereotype of NA teams, which TSM are more in line with now, yet they are incredibly effective and get the absolute maximum out of their team.		That's how you answer EU>NA/NA>EU","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jaymalade","name":"t1_cl8jk0o","parent_id":"t1_cl8hfnv","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413262487,"created_utc":1413233687}

{"body":">**Are you still playing LoL daily and are you still maining ADC?**		Yes, I usually play at least 1-2 games per day.  I don't main ADC, I just play it if I am sick of losing or to fill.  I main Support, as I find it the most challenging and cerebral role.		>**Is Ezreal still your favourite champion to play?**		No, my favourite champion to play is Nami.  There is so much finesse possible that it feels as if the perfect Nami game is impossible for even the best Support players in the world.   Add in that there is so much versatility in the directions one can go in itemisation, even if Belgian analysts might get mad at you, and it allows for a good player to really read the game and weigh up what his team needs right now with what they'll need soon.		As a long-time former in-game leader of CS teams, I find Support the best role to co-ordinate a macro view of the game from, so it appeals to me most.		>**Do you think the reason you prefer to play ADC is due to your background in First Person Shooters?**		I think ADC is just a good starting point to learn the importance of farm, trade estimations and synergising with another player.  It has always been my approach in games to pick the skill-focused roles first and grind those, then transition into the finesse/strategical roles as my base understanding of the game improves.		>**Can you rate the 5 great leagues (NA LCS, EU LCS, OGN, LPL and GPL) from most to least interesting for you personally?**		OGN  	LPL  	NA LCS  	EU LCS  	GPL		I never watch the GPL, so it's almost pointless even listing that.  I will add a caveat that the main factor that makes the NA LCS more interesting than the EU LCS is simply the existence of Cloud9.  Every C9 game has the potential to be very entertaining and satisfying, from a strategical standpoint.		>**Do you watch NACS, EUCS, LSPL or NLB at all?**		No, almost never.

Do you play Thresh, Thorin? Because that's what Thresh is. Thresh is the mechanical support player's wet dream. The utility ceiling for that champion is completely limitless, and - just like we learned from watching NWS beat Alliance - he also has insane carry potential from that role. Thresh, when played at the highest level, has to be the strongest champion in the entire game by a long shot. I also feel like he has more build options than Nami, as building tanky items on him is better than Nami, but things like Talisman of Ascension and Mikael's Crucible are still great on him. Thresh has incredible engage and multiple engage options, multiple disengage options. Thresh has arguably the best play from controlled vision of any support champion.

{"body":"A guy asked me to name my favourite athlete and then compare League pros to sports players, then deleted his comment, so I'll just post my answer here:		I think Roger Federer would be my favourite.  He has unbelievable grace of movement, making his play seem effortless; he is clutch under pressure, or at least was in his prime; he is very versatile in his skill-set and has every shot in the book, to a high level; he has a wonderful reactive and strategic mind, building up points but also executing impromptu brilliance.		I think Faker is comparable in terms of how effortlessly he controls practically every champion he plays, no matter the level of mechanical difficulty needed.  That recent [Veigar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tW90-I9mfw) really showed that he is on another level mechanically.		I would say that Froggen is comparable to Djokovic, he's an incredible reactive and passive player, but he also has an under-rated offensive game.  His entire style is predicated on being able to make the correct reactive decision, depending on what the opponent does, and then punishing the opponent for any mistakes made.		Uzi is Charles Barkley, cos he's an offensive machine, impossibly aggressive, has insane presence and seemingly doesn't give two fucks about playing defense.  Those who didn't see Barkely from 1988-1993, sadly didn't see the real Barkley.  There was a time when he was the most impactful 2 point player in the game.		inSec can be Shawn Kemp, cos he is a freak of nature in terms of his mechanical abilities, but he's also pretty much all offense and hasn't had the career his potential suggested he should have.","depth":0,"score":71,"ups":71,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8uemz","parent_id":"t3_2j4wde","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413284984,"created_utc":1413256184}

{"body":"Hi Thorin, I currently coach for Machi e-Sport in Taiwan, and I am extremely grateful for all your contents, including your articles, Grilled, Reflection, talk shows like Summoning Insight, etc, as they have been the major influence of my e-Sport career.		I've got a few questions that I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.		* In your explanation of Reginald situation, you have well explained that the analogy of Caesar implies to the statement of "great man, motivational leader, again, possible father figure," which makes sense to a movie lover like me. How would you describe your own personality/strength/traits, and which character of what movie would fit into the context?		* In your Grilled with MonteCristo, there was this section of MonteCristo's one year Guatemalan-Mayan experience, which later led into how this experience influenced his approach in his analysis and casting. In the interview, you stated that you learned many transferable skills/perspectives from non e-Sport related fields, which actually enhance your ability to perform your job in e-Sport. Could you give any specific example from your own experience?		* While many people only follow a few fields, I find you follow many scenes at an in-depth level. Not only are you very knowledgeable about e-Sport scene for many games, but also traditional sports like NBA (or simply read more than average people). On top of that you also create numerous in-depth content for them. Everyone has 24 hours, and you are one of the few people who I know utilizes time efficiently. How would you describe your approach/philosophy in terms of time management?		* You have mentioned many times that you have only a few favorite writers out there, including Kelsey Moser and Richard Lewis. As a content creator with extreme high standard yourself, what quality do you look for when you read/watch other articles/videos? What do you specifically like about Kelsey and Richard?		* From reading your last AMA and your extensive response to many questions in the past, I find much philosophical approach in your words. In other words, you include life education in your words. For example, when asked about your approach toward research, you answered ''getting by on natural talent was cheating myself out of satisfaction in life''. Do you do this just to explain your logic, or do you actually have an intention of pass on something to others? Did you have any thought of becoming any form of educator when you were young?		* I personally have been writing articles on Taiwanese bloggers for months already, where my in-game analysis would be greatly appreciated by many fans and Taiwanese e-Sport scene people. As I am hired as a remote coach now, even though I still continue to write, I purposely hid some stuff when explaining game knowledge and leave them for my own team. For example, I might explain 75% of a specific knowledge, but only explain it fully to my own players, in order for them to have advantage over their opponents. I used to think this is for the good of my own team, but recently I don't know if I can continue to do this.In the past, when the master of some kind of knowledge, say a specific recipe or ship building, wants to keep his current high status, he may only pass on 80% of the knowledge. When that master dies, if the second level person that holds 80% of the knowledge wants to keep his current high status as well, he may pass only 80% of what he knows, or 64% of the original knowledge. Eventually, stuff like this gets lost.From your experience in many scenes, how often do coaches or players pass only portions of what they know? Do you think the community/average people could be more educated if we pass on everything we know eventually? What is your own opinion over this matter?		Thank you for taking time to do this, and I'm sorry for the abuse comments.

How would you describe your own personality/strength/traits, and which character of what movie would fit into the context?**		I would pick the eponymous character of the movie '[Rudy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108002/reference)'.  I'm not talented in any area and I'm not supposed to even be in or succeed in my chosen field of life, but I don't give up.  All I have in this life is endurance.  I don't give up.  Even if it all goes to shit and I fail, I keep going.  Failure is not something I'm ashamed of, it's just part of life.  Giving up is a choice, though.  I can't choose to succeed, but I can choose not to give up yet.		I think anything can be learned, at least enough to be effective.  I don't accept any talent or advantage as being insurmountable, given enough time and effort.  I don't concern myself with what others have or are doing, I focus on how to refine what I have and am doing.  I don't think there are such things as limitations, those are merely guesses based on where you are now.  Until you've climbed this mountain, how can you know what is on the other side?		>**In your Grilled with MonteCristo, there was this section of MonteCristo's one year Guatemalan-Mayan experience, which later led into how this experience influenced his approach in his analysis and casting. In the interview, you stated that you learned many transferable skills/perspectives from non e-Sport related fields, which actually enhance your ability to perform your job in e-Sport. Could you give any specific example from your own experience?**		Much of my success has been because I was fortunate enough to learn one of the secrets of magic, namely how to remember almost anything.  The problem with memories is that if they have no significance then they may seem impossible to recall or put to any use. 		The secret to find a way to create a meaning or significance for every memory you want to store.  Not only do you do so, but you create as many connections of meaning as possible, so that if one pathway is blocked or forgotten, there are other ways to the same information.  I found my own approach to achieving that, arising from observing my own natural tendency to remember things I was interested in and then combining it with techniques I found in medieval ceremonial magic.		I take all ideas as a process of modelling and understanding the world, so it is perfectly reasonable to apply models found in one area to another.  I think a lot of innovation comes not from being hit by the lightning bolt of a brilliant idea out of nowhere, but taking a concept from one field and applying it to a seemingly unrelated one, finding new observations or approaches with it there.		I don't divide life up into esports and other non-overlapping magisteria.  On some level everything is everything else, depending on how philosophical you want to get, and the same applies to the realm of ideas.  When I take time off my esports work and read some fiction or explore other thoughts, there will be moments when I'll consider a reference point within esports or how a concept could be applied there.		That's why I don't believe in the concept of wasted effort when it comes to learning or research.  It adds up towards something more meaningful, given enough time and the right mental approach.		I've had thousands of hours of research that have seemingly gone to waste, perhaps because of an interview that never went through or a piece that the time for had passed it by or a game losing popularity, but ultimately I can find a way for everything I've learned of significance to wrap back into something I work on in the future, or inform it in some manner.		To give you a very specific example, by reading Chauster's AMA on the CLG site, thousands of pages long, I could only draw from that a limited amount when it came to actually interviewing him, but it gave me a very expansive and wide-reaching perspective on the game, which I was still very much in the beginning phases of learning.		>**You have mentioned many times that you have only a few favorite writers out there, including Kelsey Moser and Richard Lewis. As a content creator with extreme high standard yourself, what quality do you look for when you read/watch other articles/videos? What do you specifically like about Kelsey and Richard?**		As should be an emergent trend in my answers in this AMA, I value distinct personalities, whether that be in play or writing.  It's because I think the best approach in life is to find the things only you can do in your particular way and then set about doing them as well as you can.  Of course, one must learn from others, but those lessons are taken and then refracted through the prism of oneself and in one's own manner.		You cannot influence Kelsey Moser's thought processes unduly, regardless of who you are.  Maybe you can make a good point, but it will only be taken on its own merits, examined and then processed for information or perspectives of value, that match up with her own internal criteria.  That makes her work both capable of great detail, as she has the tools to explore in whatever depth she so deems necessary, and fascinating, as it is dominated by a comprehensive single perspective.		Richard is writing almost nothing about the game itself, in a field entirely dominated by information and media regarding the game.  In spite of that, he is very successful and highly respected.  Stop and consider that for a moment.  Rather than become another guy trying to explain why SSW beat TSM, he's found other areas and aspects of esports to unpack an entire career into and explore.  Esports is so much more than this narrow window we see through right now, but so far can conceive of more than they seen before them.","depth":1,"score":123,"ups":123,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8oh1n","parent_id":"t1_cl8jcsf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413272750,"created_utc":1413243950}

{"body":"His entire point was about using memory as a tool for making connections. You can see it in action in his interviews. 		The book he referenced to you is about Hermeticism. Hermeticism was essentially a philosophical tradition that sprang from writings falsely attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.		It's really hard to explain the connection simply. I've typed like three different paragraphs trying to break it down. As Thorin said, it's extremely dense. There are a ton of layers. But I'll try to relate it in a more modern term.		Are you familiar with the Bible Code? Think about Hermeticism like that. We have all of these writings of arcane origin that people use as a foundation to reverse-engineer predictions, and then use the credibility that sprang from those manufactured prophecies to create new ones. An entire mystical practice sprang up around this during the Renaissance. People drawing connections between things and using those connections to "predict" stuff.		Sort of like Tarot Cards or Palm Reading, but more elaborate, accepted, and academic. It's not really magic in the sense you're thinking of it (though it certainly did get a nice peppering of the stuff). 		Like, imagine if I found a book supposedly by Oscar Wilde that supposedly predicted 9/11, and then I used the same convoluted means of interpreting that prediction to come up with other things, like the end of the world, or the death of the President, or a huge war. Now imagine if I surrounded these predictions with theater and mystique. That's kind of what Hermeticism is like.		But it's still not the whole picture.		Look into it. It's really, really interesting.

{"body":">**From reading your last AMA and your extensive response to many questions in the past, I find much philosophical approach in your words. In other words, you include life education in your words. For example, when asked about your approach toward research, you answered ''getting by on natural talent was cheating myself out of satisfaction in life''. Do you do this just to explain your logic, or do you actually have an intention of pass on something to others? Did you have any thought of becoming any form of educator when you were young?**		No, I only think of the reader in terms of attempting to have an idea of what his understanding of the context of what I write about is.  Beyond that, I don't write with any intention on how what I write should be taken or used or any influence or impact it may have.  I think it is not only condescending, but perhaps even immoral to attempt to influence others' thoughts.		I imagine my readers to be capable of thought processes similar to mine, so I outline my thoughts and my reasoning, what they make of those is up to them.  The people I've learned the most from have been those who have taken a similar approach: essentially writing what they think and why, then letting me come to my own conclusions and extrapolations.  In the end, that's the highest goal of all communication, I think.		The philosophical component of life has taken on this strange air because it has been so largely neglected over the last few thousand years, so that it now appears a kind of affectation.  I think that part of life is as vibrant and necessary as any other, so it's always worth trying to consider it and relate it to whatever you are doing or thinking about, however mundane.		As a result, it creeps into my work and allows me a frame-work from which to elevate what may simply be someone playing a game into more.		>**I personally have been writing articles on Taiwanese bloggers for months already, where my in-game analysis would be greatly appreciated by many fans and Taiwanese e-Sport scene people. As I am hired as a remote coach now, even though I still continue to write, I purposely hid some stuff when explaining game knowledge and leave them for my own team. For example, I might explain 75% of a specific knowledge, but only explain it fully to my own players, in order for them to have advantage over their opponents. I used to think this is for the good of my own team, but recently I don't know if I can continue to do this.In the past, when the master of some kind of knowledge, say a specific recipe or ship building, wants to keep his current high status, he may only pass on 80% of the knowledge. When that master dies, if the second level person that holds 80% of the knowledge wants to keep his current high status as well, he may pass only 80% of what he knows, or 64% of the original knowledge. Eventually, stuff like this gets lost.From your experience in many scenes, how often do coaches or players pass only portions of what they know? Do you think the community/average people could be more educated if we pass on everything we know eventually? What is your own opinion over this matter?**		I think that's quite a common approach, much of the hermetic information I have an interest in was guarded within secret societies and fraternities prior to the information age.  I can't say that I think it is a good thing.  There are certain experiences beyond words that should be experienced directly, much like the ending of a great piece of cinema, and so should not be spoken idly about or "spoiled", but I think a distinction can be drawn between that area and information itself.		In my opinion, one should never withhold significant information.  Firstly, the person you give it to may not even be capable of using it in the same manner as you.  Secondly, if they do and find similar or even greater success, perhaps you will learn something from them in return which will elevate your own understanding, either by some new revelation or simply considering their perspective on the same topics.		Finally, I think that's a mentality of scarcity.  If I tell someone how something works, at least for me, and they make use of it in their own life, then that's not a problem for me.  There is plenty more to be learned and yet discovered and I don't need to hang on to a few small trinkets, when vast worlds of ideas still remain unexplored.		On a side note, it's also an interesting observation I've come to that a lot of my best work opportunities have come as a result of giving people ideas I had no use for, at the time, or simply advice or my perspective on something they were working on.  People don't just forget such actions, they leave an impression.","depth":1,"score":73,"ups":73,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8ormw","parent_id":"t1_cl8jcsf","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413273380,"created_utc":1413244580}

{"body":">**Hypothetically you've just won the National Lottery and you want to invest money into a game to create an eSports scene larger than League of Legends. What game do you pick?**		I think it could be argued that Dota2's esports scene is already bigger than LoL's.  It has probably 10x more significant tournaments, a lot more professional level teams and many more high level matches played every single week.  The vast majority of LoL's player-base is not involved directly with esports.		I have no idea how one would create a bigger scene, since the size of a game tends to be a dynamic and unpredictable quality that nobody can anticipate.  Perhaps if you dumped $50,000,000 into next year's CS:GO circuit, it could surpass LoL, as the teams all went into overdrive to try and get the money.		>**If you could go back to the days where your personality wasn't well known, and you were just known as 'the historian' doing player interviews and creating content silently behind the scenes, would you?**		No, I used to make 1/3rd as much money, there was no guarantee of when it would come and I was forced to attend numerous events that were terrible experiences, outside the satisfaction of doing good work at them.		The pros of my current situation out-weigh the cons.  I earn more money, I have more creative freedom and I'm able to work according to my own schedule, in any location and at any time I desire.		>**Is there a particular moment, article, interview, etc in your career that you're most proud or fond of?**		I think these were good pieces:		* [Alex Ich - The model of an esports man](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/alex-ich-the-model-of-an-esports-man/1100-2256/)	* [moto - America's Counter-Strike mind](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/moto-america-s-counter-strike-mind/1100-577/)	* [CLG - The last supper](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/clg-the-last-supper/1100-836/)	* [End of an Era for Russian LoL Royalty](http://www.aceresport.com/en/end_of_an_era_for_russian_lol_royalty.htm)	* [Jaedong - The Tyrant who hated to lose](http://www.aceresport.com/en/jaedong__the_tyrant_who_hated_to_lose.htm)	* [Stephano doesn't care](http://www.aceresport.com/en/stephano_doesnt_care.htm)	* [The Toil of Foreign SC2's King Beyond the Wall](http://www.aceresport.com/en/the_toil_of_foreign_sc2s_king_beyond_the_wall.htm)	* ['Reflections' with Flame](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/reflections-with-flame/1100-1983/)	* ['Reflections' with Jaedong](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/reflections-with-jaedong/1100-1021/)	* ['Reflections' with Imaqtpie](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/reflections-with-imaqtpie/1100-494/)	* [Chauster 'Grilled'](http://www.aceresport.com/en/chauster_grilled.htm)		>**Is the handle 'Thorin' based off the character in The Hobbit or something else?**		It is from The Hobbit.","depth":1,"score":273,"ups":273,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8i7vj","parent_id":"t1_cl8e8fk","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413259990,"created_utc":1413231190}

{"body":"I don't think anyone has an answer to that (riot probably doesn't, and I'm sure Thorin doesnt).		Honestly to me it sounds like a short term vs. long term argument. If you have better competition with less forgiving formats and lower "job security", that means less players are allowed to go to their parents and say "look at this! This is actually a feasible way for me to spend my time".		Having some light job security for pro players could in fact have very good long term benefits to the scene as a whole. It could take esports for a particular game from an anomaly to a steady and (somewhat) mainstream thing. But its risky... if it doesn't work out that means you've sacrificed some of the best years of competition for nothing.		I personally think Riot is still trying to find a balance between the 2.

I will say, that it seemed as if Blue's level was worse at Worlds, especially Dade and Deft's individual play.		>**-T1 K situation**		While I can see their rationale in replacing the whole botlane, I'd rather they'd just removed Bengi and then the member of the botlane they felt was easiest to replace.","depth":1,"score":47,"ups":47,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8qdky","parent_id":"t1_cl8fbg2","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413276785,"created_utc":1413247985}

{"body":"The current form one is difficult, since any non-Worlds players likely hasn't played in months.  So I'll do three.		**Worlds form:**		* Gogoing (OMG)	* DanDy (SSW)	* PawN (SSW)	* Uzi (SHRC)	* Mata (SSW)		Gogoing had the tournament of his life and his champion pool was very impressive, in an era where we saw other great players exposed for their champion pool (sOAZ, Save etc.)		DanDy is just unbelievable in his level of consistency and his effectiveness against all forms of opponent.  I'd love to have someone run some basic ESP tests on him, because it's something more than just guess-work or preparation in his part, he has a sense for where or why an opponent should be something.		PawN was always over-rated in Korea for his success against Faker, the best player of all time.  With that said, this tournament has been something special for PawN.  He has be able to seemingly do anything he wants on any champion he wants and against any opponent.  I doubt this kind of form will continue back in Korea, but it's certainly something spectacular to behold while it lasts.		Uzi had the tournament of his life, for real this time.  Last Worlds, he basically just destroyed OMG, coasted against Fnatic and then could get nothing done against SKT.  This tournament has been quite different and he has transformed into the perfect carry-style ADC.  The problem being, people don't realise how far above his usual LPL level this Uzi is, so one really can't expect it to simply last forever.		Mata is god.  Perfect in every sense imaginable for a Support.  Think of your top 5 Support players in the world, now, and you'll immediately think of one or two champions on which they're much better than the rest of their pool.  That doesn't even apply to Mata, he is a god on specific champions and still absolutely incredible on all the rest.  That's a hall-mark of the all-time great godlike players.		**Current, expanding beyond Worlds:**		* Lord Flame (CJB)	* KaKAO (ex-KTA)	* Faker (SKT)	* NaMei (EDG)	* Mata (SSW)		Flame is just the best.  Can play anything, would dominate without being target-banned due to Blaze's roster problems and is the best laner ever at his position.		KaKAO is a jungle god in terms of his individual impact on the game, where DanDy is more of the traditional Support jungler, albeit a monster within that approach.  With KaKAO, you don't even need godly solo laners, he can make magic out of very little to work with.  The series that sealed it with KaKAO for me was the NJWS loss, believe it or not, as he still played to a high level as his whole team was shitting the bed.		Faker is the closest thing to perfection we will maybe ever seen in LoL and some of his team-mates dropping off a cliff, performance-wise, hasn't changed that.		NaMei may yet turn out to have some kind of psychological block in international tournaments, we can't be sure either way yet.  With that said, when he is playing in China, that NaMei is just the best mixture I've ever seen between intelligence and mechanical execution at the AD Carry position.  He is the modern equivalent of WeiXiao in late S2/early S3.		Mata is god.		**All-time:**		* Lord Flame	* DanDy	* Faker	* WeiXiao	* Mata		Nobody has quite claimed WeiXiao's throne for me, as NaMei hasn't proven himself enough outside of China, Uzi hasn't proven himself enough in China, Deft hasn't been on top long enough and imp has had team-mates who have meant he hasn't had to carry hard enough for the latter part of his career.","depth":1,"score":198,"ups":198,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8k8li","parent_id":"t1_cl8e7ok","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413263822,"created_utc":1413235022}

{"body":"> **You often use football anologies: Is football just a point of interest for you regarding the structure, characters, infrastructure comparing to esports or do you have an "emotional" relationship like rooting for a club?**		I have barely followed football since I was a boy.  I usually only use it as a reference point when talking to Europeans, since they don't know about the NBA, MMA or NHL.  I used to support Liverpool, as a boy, because I liked their cavalier style of play and they had very exciting young players (Fowler, McManaman and Redknapp).		>**You seem to strictly differ your personal and working relationship.

Also, when I speak to players privately, I am myself, not Thorin the pundit.  You'd really have to ask them what they think.  I know I wouldn't even need all the fingers of one hand to count the number who had ever expressed to me that they wouldn't do interviews or appear on SI due to something I'd said about them.		>**In your last AMA you stated which games u enjoy most to either play yourself or watch. Has this changed since then regarding LoL and CSGO? (Sadly i cant find the original answer but it was like 7/6 or 6/7 in both games)**		I think CS:GO and LoL are probably at the same number, as I only enjoy watching the really high level matches.		>**What was better comparing CSGO and CSS/1.6? and what could be done to improve it? What do you think about the past changes (2013-2014) and the movement tweaks in the latetst updates?**		There is nothing gameplay-related in CS:GO that is better than in CS 1.6.  I haven't played the latest update yet, so I can't comment on that.  In general, I think the game is improving, but there are still a lot of things holding it back from being as good a game as 1.6 was.		>**Is it just me or did you concentrate more on LoL then CSGO in the past months? I guess you created more LoL content (propably because Finals) then CSGO if you look at the articles and SI, Reflections and "only" 3 Counter Pilot episodes.**		LoL gets significantly more hits, so I balance my work accordingly.  I can think of a near infinite amount of interesting work to publish in each game, but I balance my work-load according to what makes sense to put time and effort into.  I'm now in a position where it might be possible to balance out with more CS:GO stuff, ideally by becoming more productive rather than reducing my LoL work.		Counter-Points gets significantly less hits than SI or Reflections, so that's self-explanatory.  CS:GO players are also all mainly European, so a number can't or won't speak English, and in general are less media-conscious, so it's a lot harder to book guests.  I also don't think a show every week is necessary for CS:GO, as I prefer to center it around big LANs, in general.		>**You said you would keep doing SI if u can publish it. Does this apply to Counter Pilots too?**		Yes, it will continue.		>**How would you describe your jounaltistic sytle?**		History is the coolest component of the game, for me, so I try to mine that area for topics and themes which excite and express the wonderful context of esports history and the excellence of the best players.","depth":1,"score":33,"ups":33,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8rd5z","parent_id":"t1_cl8houu","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413278802,"created_utc":1413250002}

{"body":">**Do you think that the West can eventually catch up to Korea in LoL (or any other esport that Korea takes seriously)?**		To me that's such a sci-fi concept, that I can barely actually imagine it in the real world.  Rather than trying to get the entire West to catch up to all of Korea, I'd rather there were just more C9/M5/CLG.EU type teams, that have a very distinct and unique style and get the right line-up for a specific period of time and can compete and sometimes beat the top Koreans.		>**how long do you think it will take?**		How long is a piece of string?  With no parameters, that really doesn't work as a question.  If everything I think would be beneficial was implemented tomorrow (real coaching, life-style management, mental development, better tournament circuits) then I think Western teams could compete with the best Koreans, legitimately, by S5 Worlds.		>**why hasn't it happened yet?**		There are very few innovators in this world, instead people look at what others have found success with and attempt to simply copy that or reverse-engineer it and apply it to their own approach.  Short-term thinking like how to make money or be popular right now, also holds you back from more elegant but subtle solutions.		>**what sets Koreans apart in your eyes?**		In terms of work ethic, their culture is a nightmare of proportions no amount of blue collar rhetoric or Protestant work ethic can match in the West.  It's a negative as much as it is a positive, since they have no notion of balance at all.  They essentially give up what a Westerner would conceive of as a life, in the quest to become the best.		>**do you think the gap will increase or stay roughly the same?**		It will increase, which is not to say that Western teams won't be more capable of winning games or competing.		>**does it bother you in any way that the competition is so lopsided?**		No, I've never appreciated that kind of perspective on esports games.  If a game is very competitive because all the teams are at a high level, then great, we get a very high level and exciting game.  If a game is competitive because there is no great team, then I actually find that to be the most dull.  If a great team is dominating everything, then I am too busy admiring their excellence to find any problems with that set of circumstances.

Which 5 players and why?**		* Flame (CJB)	* KaKAO (ex-KTA)	* Faker (SKT K)	* WeiXiao (ex-WE)	* Xpecial (CRS)		Flame, KaKAO and Faker for the same reasons I out-lined in the other question about all-stars.  For WeiXiao, it's one of the criminal shames that LPL really isn't presented at the same level as OGN and there is an undue bias against Chinese LoL, as it means that people don't realise the kind of incredible renaissance WeiXiao had this year.		All that crap Doublelift has said in interviews, not even that long enough, about how much WX fell off only applies to S3, and suggests Doublelift doesn't watch LPL or simply processes it through Doublelift's brain and thus comes up with Doublelift conclusions, take your pick.  In S4 WX has been amazing.  He has had next-to-nothing to work with, a Support neven vaguely comparable to the other elite ADCs, yet he has been playing at a very impressive level.		Technically, WX has retired, but it was not that long ago and he still plays, so I'll go in on the chopper and talk him out of retirement, as he's chopping wood with an axe out the back of his cabin.		The reasoning behind having Xpecial, is that I think the drop-off in Korea at the Support position, after Mata and Gorilla, is pretty significant.  In fact, Gorilla doesn't even deserve to be up there with Mata.  Once you get past Mata and Gorilla, I think YellOwStaR and Xpecial are right there with the Koreans.		I picked Xpecial because  he has shown himself to be incredibly clutch, time and time again.  Xpecial is also another player who simply has no set champion pool, he just becomes really good on whatever is OP.  I think he's probably the most under-rated Western player of all time.		>**Will Summoning Insight continue?**		Without a doubt.  Monte is fully on-board and all we technically need is the equipment we currently have an a streaming channel.  Right now, I'm still figuring out the place it will be broadcasted and getting the business side of things finalised.  Once that's all ready, we'll start the show.  It's likely we'll run it as an independent entity from both of our careers.  That will likely make more sense than tying it to one of our other jobs, as I did at OnGamers.		>**What do you think of worlds so far?**		It's a huge international LoL tournament, so of course it is by far the best part of the LoL year, excluding the OGN seasons.  Personally, the fact OGN is so high level allows me to imagine LoL does have a decent sized circuit, as the best teams essentially do play in Korea, but there is a part of me which always looks at Worlds and then at circuits like Dota2 and CS:GO has and thinks "What a waste!  LoL could be such an incredible international esports game".		EDG were very underwhelming, even in their 5 game series against SHRC, where it was U carrying most of the time.  OMG finally showed the kind of potential all LPL viewers knew they had, even if it wasn't enough to get them to the final.  C9 finally replicated their domestic style and were able to win against international teams in similar fashion, though Hai really exposed himself as the key flaw which is inextricably tied to their biggest strength, so there's that.		ALL were quite impressive, outside of the KaBuM loss.  NJWS were a little weaker than I expected, though I thought people had quite overblown their everyday level.  SSB seemed off the whole tournament, despite still managing to reach the semis and probably being the second best team in the world right now.  Dade and Deft never really showed the kind of form they consistently displayed in the past two OGN seasons, that almost had them winning back-to-back titles.","depth":1,"score":110,"ups":110,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8kqka","parent_id":"t1_cl8ebpj","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413264819,"created_utc":1413236019}

If I'm crossing a line or sth with a question or if you'd rather not answer, just tell me and that will be the end of it (from me at least).		---			1. How long does it usually take, to set up a "Reflections" interview, to edit it, to cut it, and how much time is average between you asking for an interview and you actually getting to do the interview? (just something that ive always wondered)		2. Summoning Insight has reigned supreme in the "LoL talk show" area, presumably largely due to both Montes popularity and your own, shall we say... unique? view of the game, the circumstances surrounding the games, and of the players in general. Richard Lewis has now started to host a talk show, and it seems to be off to a great start. Do you have any plans to alter SI's focus? Did you watch the first episode, and if so what is your impression? Can both shows carve out a unique space in the LoL-sphere in your opinion?		3. Reddit has been an infamously bad place for you to post your content, and it seems hypocritical, that most if not ALL people seem unable to refute the quality of your work, yet the interviews have never reached the top of the front page of the subreddit. How do you think this could be adressed? Is this maybe inherent in the system? Are my assumptions just plain wrong here?		4. Both you and Monte seem avid propagators of the superiority of korean LoL. How much better do you think western teams COULD BE if more international competition took place? Do you think that regional talent could develop without region lock? Would it be hindered?

The best four teams from each region battle it out in a final fourth tournament with both regions competing against one another. Repeat once, give circuit points to teams according to placing and based on circuit point decide on who goes to Worlds. 		6.

One was about Napoleon and the other was a holocaust movie.  In both cases, movies on the same topics came out before he could finish researching, so the conventional wisdom was that there was no point continuing on and making his movies.		What makes a movie about Napoleon great is not that the topic is Napoleon, it's the same qualities that make any movie great: the skill and vision of the director, the strength and inventiveness of the script and the talent and execution of the actors.  Only hollywood studio heads, accountants and marketing men would think it was merely the subject which decides everything.		There is plenty of room for dozens of League talk shows to exist.  People who want to watch SI for our opinions and to see us interact with our guests can watch ours for those very reasons and the others as well for other reasons.  I would still watch China Talk to find out what Froskurinn thinks about EDG, even if Doublelift, scarra, Crumbzz and Krepo had their own show in which they discussed the same topic at length.		I have no plans to alter the content or direction of the show and the factors behind such a change would never be that another show exists and might discuss some of the same topics.  I'm not trying to convince anyone to watch SI, I think it's a good show and provides a good platform to discuss topics in a manner I don't see others replicating, so it's not a concern for me.		I watched some of 'First Blood' and it looked like a good show.  I can't say much more, as a single episode is not a large enough data set to draw any strong conclusions from.  The guests and host seem like a good fit and there is strong potential going forwards.		**Edit:** I'll add that I don't see any League shows as any kind of threat to SI.  Besides, for all the lovely, fascinating and insightful guests out there, I've got the all-time reigning League MVP of talking about LoL on my show:  MonteCristo.  Better bring your A game, boys, cos my guy is putting up LeBron-type numbers season in and season out.  Too smart, too eloquent and too experienced.  They didn't say it would be easy, fellas.		>**Both you and Monte seem avid propagators of the superiority of korean LoL. How much better do you think western teams COULD BE if more international competition took place? Do you think that regional talent could develop without region lock? Would it be hindered? Has the gap between Korea/the east and the west closed? (edit: i mean "closed" in the sense of the regions are now closer together, not in the sense "the gap doesnt exist anymore", that would be ridiculous)**		I've yet to see any kind of conclusive proof that without a roster lock there was any kind of difficulty in developing local talent.  NA as a region are the ones who seem to have decided, for themselves, that NA talent is inferior and rushed to import talent.  That's the same mentality which has plagued that region since the early days.		There's some component of being a top NA pro that seems to demand the player them assigns victories both to him being good and his opponent being shit, meaning players who are in lesser teams can't be as good and thus aren't considered to be recruited.		If NA had made the most of its talent, players like Mancloud, Xmithie, Sneaky, WildTurtle, BloodWater, ZionSpartan and Balls could all have been in top teams long ago and still in them now.  Based on the precedent of history and my own experiences in following esports games, I've little doubt there is real talent in the NA scene, it's just poorly developed.		This topic of the gap is so played out.  In S2 M5 was the best team at Worlds, they simply didn't win the tournament.  In S3, fnatic and Gambit both went with weaker teams than they might otherwise have had (puszu and Voidle) and C9 had never been able to play a single international LAN in their careers as a single five man unit.		If the right teams are formed in all of the major regions, the elite teams will be able to compete and play close games no matter where they are from.  I do think that the West is still far from having constructed a suitable training environment and approach, so far.  All it currently has is a bastardised sub-par knock-off of what the Koreans do.  As a result, the Koreans continue to refine the approach that works for them and the gap opens wider, in the sense that the absolute best Korean teams have the potential to become even better in comparison to the best of the other regions.		If the West takes what makes sense from the Korean approach, but combines it with strengths that are uniquely of the West, then there can always be amazing Western teams who at least have a chance to win Worlds, even if they aren't the favourites.		>**You have often stated, that you would prefer a circuit point tournament system to the current LCS one, given that lcs prevents filtering of bad tournament players, Yet emphasizes tournament play in the structure for playoffs and worlds. as such, what would you think of the following system :	3 tournaments over one half season, region locked in the west to Europe and NA, say 2 groups with 5 teams each, and a knockout round best of five to follow up.

This is a topic I will address at length in the future, but I have my own ideas for a tournament circuit that still fulfils some of the positives of a league, while also ensuring players are fully tested as tournament players under pressure.		The big problem right now, is that nobody truly knew Link crumbled under pressure until late 2014, as he had only played in three LCS play-offs over the previous two years, often representing the team expected to lose.  If he had already had 10 play-off runs under his belt, it would be no news to anyone that he crumbled under pressure in such circumstances.		Likewise, nobody would be comparing Aphromoo to Xpecial, if a similar amount of tournaments had been played.  Or perhaps they would and he'd have been given enough of a chance to prove his level.  The point is, the larger the data set, the more concrete conclusions can be drawn from them.		>**What would your "perfect system" for LoL-games/tournaments look like, under one condition: Riots regional player rules still apply.**		The short version is that I'd have LCS be a regular split of 5 LANs, one every two weeks.  You have the LAN over a week, then a week off.  Group stage on the first two days, then playoff rounds over the next few.  Using a circuit point system, you'd then have a final tournament to decide the Worlds spot and the split champion.		Think how much better of a story-line is generated if Curse has a really hot fifth tournament, winning it where they had never made it to the semi-finals or beyond during the rest of the split.  How much more memorable that would be in six months, as opposed to them winning some superweek games.		Likewise, C9 might have a catalogue of LAN victories to rival the legendary 2012 run of TSM by now, under such a format.  Then we'd truly know they were by far the best NA team.","depth":1,"score":178,"ups":178,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8j9li","parent_id":"t1_cl8e80b","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413261950,"created_utc":1413233150}

What bothers me is that I can't tell if XDG really fucked it up, or to what extent it was XDG going to hell and Bloodwater saying "fuck this" and how much of it was the simple fact that we've seen a LOT of NA pros get into the LCS and then realize they didn't like it as much, or that in order to stay at the top, the amount of effort they put in for the money they got out . . . wasn't enough.

{"body":">**Can you explain KESPA what it is, its objectives and what are your personal opinions on it**		The closest parallel I can draw in the West is probably something like when the owners all get together in the NBA and NHL and fight with the player's union over the collective bargaining agreement, sometimes resulting in lockout seasons.  KeSPA would basically be the owners, in that respect, and there is no balancing force of a player union in Korea.  All the rights are in the power of the big businessmen.		KeSPA basically represented the elite of Korean esports, the business interests of huge companies that sponsor teams, the organisers, the TV channels and the teams.  If you look into the structure of the [huge Korean businesses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol) it may help in getting a context on the way these entities behave.  Essentially, KeSPA is primarily there to protect the business interests of its members.		I think KeSPA has helped create some incredible esports memories, but not by methods I personally agree with.  So, for example, IIRC, mandating players play 12 hours a day, or something to that effect, during the BW days.  Likewise, the transfer system in BW was absolutely ludicrous and essentially gave a ridiculous amount of leverage to the team a player was already a member of.		>**What are the traits you look for most in players?**		That's such a wide-ranging question.  Over the years, I've come to be able to appreciate practically all kinds of top players.  From players who lean heavily on a high degree of mechanical skill to those who play the game as if it were a chess of positional advantage to those who simply excel under pressure and find a way to win when it is hardest to do so.		Players who innovate and bring something new are to be appreciated just as those who take what others have brought and refine it to perfection have their own charm.  I think every successful and great player has something special about them, it's less about what is right and more what is ideal.  The ideal style of ADC might be Deft or NaMei's style, but for Uzi his aggression is a better approach, even if it would work so poorly for almost anyone else.		>**What styles of play do you enjoy the most in any game?**		My initial impulse was always to appreciate very aggressive and highly skilled players (markeloff, f0rest, Bisu, Cypher, Faker and Alex Ich), but that's on an instinctual level.  On an intellectual level, I have a great amount of admiration for those who can play a very controlled, calculating and reactive style (GeT_RiGhT, Cooller, rapha, Flash, Froggen and Deft).		I think being able to appreciate all the spectrums of style is a core component of being able to truly appreciate esports itself.  Once that is accomplished and developed, one can enjoy almost any outcome of a match between two top level teams.		>**Who was the player who changed your opinion of them after you interacted with them/interviewed?**		Almost every player has changed my opinion of them following the interview, as I can see the emphasis they place on certain ideas and gain an understanding of their reasoning and perspective.  Being able to empathise with the player is an important part of my approach.		I think the two most startling examples would be Cooller and Flame.  Interviewing Cooller allowed me to unlock the poetic soul of Russian culture.  I realised that sometimes his words were off how someone would express something in English, but that they were often misinterpreted, as a result, and that he in fact often thought in a very philosophical and subtle manner.		In Flame's case, I actually knew very little about his personality and most past interviews had done little to probe beyond the surface.  He would have been my favourite player regardless, but it was a delight to discover such an earnest and intellectually honest thinker behind the player.  There are many great esports competitors who can only speak their brilliance through the language of the game, but Flame is more than capable of expressing his mental processes in words.		>**Who is the person you most respect in Esports?**		[Alex Ich](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/alex-ich-the-model-of-an-esports-man/1100-2256/), he's the kind of older brother I wish I'd had as a boy.		>**What changes would you make to the pro-lol scene today if you had the power**		Take the control of the esports side of things out of the hands of the developer and banish them to merely developing the game.","depth":1,"score":53,"ups":53,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8q74e","parent_id":"t1_cl8efew","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413276406,"created_utc":1413247606}

{"body":">**CLG**		I think CLG is one of the worst teams in history at acquiring talent, so I doubt any suggestion I make will match up with what they end up doing.  Plus, I think CLG's roster is completely fucked:		They need a new top laner, a new jungler, their Mid laner has huge problems carrying, their Support became just alright in the playoffs and their best player, the AD Carry, seems to have an incredibly negative influence on the rest of the team, particularly those most easily shaken.  Toss the whole thing out and recruit an entire team?		If it were me in control of the CLG roster and I didn't know about recent contract stuff, I'd put Link top lane and recruit Jankos and Nukeduck.		>**Curse**		For Curse, I think their biggest problem is that they need an absolute monster at AD Carry to have any chance of contending for the LCS title.  Voyboy can't be the main carry of the team, he doesn't have the consistency to pull that off.  As a secondary carry, okay, now we're talking.		So, if Curse was able to get FORG1VEN, Rekkles, Tabzz or Piglet, then we'd be in business.  Hell, I think even Freeze would be worth a look.		>**TSM**		The biggest problem TSM has is that I don't think Bjergsen can be the shot-caller if they want to become the best Western team.  He has to be free to focus on his individual game.  Problem is, you look at the rest of the members and Dyrus obviously can't do it, since he's playing 1v1, Lustboy doesn't speak good enough English and WildTurtle is WildTurtle.		Now, they need a Jungler and I know of very few who do any kind of shot-calling role.  If we ignore shot-calling, then guys like Jankos, Xmithie and Diamondprox should be real considerations.  Finally, with so much ADC talent out there, particularly in EU, I'd consider importing, if I were them.		Except, of course, they can't import all this talent, because they already have players imported, which leaves us with only NA Junglers and ADCs, which isn't a pretty state of affairs.  So Xmithie for Jungle, else they have to somehow buy out players like IWD or Crumbzz.  I think both would be good, IWD for his skills and Crumbzz for his mind.		At ADC, I really don't think there is anyone you can get to join you at this point in time who will be an upgrade and is from NA.  Doublelift seemingly won't leave CLG and isn't going to help shot-calling issues one bit.  Maybe gamble on Altec?  Wouldn't be the worst call.","depth":1,"score":80,"ups":80,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8qrfq","parent_id":"t1_cl8ee08","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413277568,"created_utc":1413248768}

{"body":">**1: What would you personally like to see in an eSport? (Game genre, infastructure, league, orgs, etc.)**		I don't think game genre is so important, provided you have a good structure and pool of players to draw from.  FPS has always been my initial preference, but I've grown to appreciate RTS greatly and MOBA/RTS has grown on me more and more over the years.		The most important factors for me are the structure of the tournament circuit and the number of geniuses playing at any one time.  My favourite kind of circuit is the type you see in Dota2 and CS:GO, where it's entirely open and there's a massive amount of money, opportunity and competition for all, relative to the size of the games in question.		In terms of my comment about the number of geniuses, I think the most under-appreciated aspect of esports is that there are lots of good players at the pro level and even lots of top players, who rise up for their time, often when the game suits them, and then fall back off as the meta and playing style shifts away from them, like the waves of the ocean coming in and out.  What cannot be accounted for, though, are the geniuses.  Absolute anomalies who are so out of place that when they play you can watch almost every game of their careers and be amazed and intrigued.  These kinds of players buck the trend of the rise and fall, as they can seemingly return to the top at any time and find a way to compete and translate their brilliance.		When these players retire from a game, you can't simply replace them with the next hot player.  They have something beyond the game, some quality of being and expression, through the vehicle of the game, that transcends it.  I can find more beauty and awe in watching a series that Cooller, Faker and Bisu lost than some of the convincing series wins of Strenx, PawN and Hydra.		I'd like a tourney organiser to come along who gets it and uses the positive qualities of the other leagues to their own benefit.  Design your tournament as the world championship, as if it were, and seed and structure it as if the other tournaments were your regionals and qualifiers.  Then you can, theoretically, have the best event of the year, all at a lost cost, comparative to running an entire circuit, and with the best seeding imaginable.		>**2: What kind of direction would you like eSports to grow into? More into the traditional sports culture, keep it's own identity/culture that its had, or some healthy mix between the two.**		The worst thing that ever happened to esports was people who love traditional sports trying to force it into moulds from those fields.  Sadly, Riot are one of the worst offenders in this respect.  There are a seemingly endless array of real sports out there, coming in any flavour one might hope for, so if someone wants what those offer then let them go and have it where it is appropriate.		Esports is something else and should be treated as such.  Only take on board ideas from traditional sports which can stand on their own merits and in the context of esports, not merely because a well-established sport does things that way.  A simple example of this, is that there have been a number of occasions in esports history when organisers made a push to get rid of aliases.  To me that is rampant stupidity, as aliases are one of the best features of esports.		The names themselves have no innate significance, and so the player's play and exploits come to define how we think of that word.  Faker, Diamondprox and Cooller are pretty crap names in their own rights, but legendary and heavily evocative when attached to their esports competitors.  Ignoring all the problems we would run into with Chinese and Korean names, I think aliases also stress the disconnect between "real life" and the game.  Inside the game, it doesn't matter who you are or where you are from, it merely matters how well you can play the game.		To me, the topic of aliases conjures up the memory of that scene in 'The Matrix' where NEO tells Agent Smith *"My name... is Neo*".  If you can appreciate why that's a great scene, then you can see why aliases are a great feature of esports, regardless of what some real world guy in a sharp suit might tell you.		>**3: Hypothetically, aliens ( ;) ) came to earth to take over via the olympic vidya games. What 10 pro players from whatever game(from Quake all the way to League etc.) would you want to represent Earth?**		In no order:		* **Cooller** (Q3/QL) - A master of creating his own approaches to situations, all on-the-fly and within seconds, then being able to execute them and enforce his will upon his opponents.	* **Faker** (LoL) - Mechanically perfect, incredibly highly in-game intuitive intelligence and seemingly unshakeable.  Some will say Faker went on tilt vs. Pawn, but I think his tilt was more to do with his team not having made it into 2014, not the play of PawN.	* **Bisu** (BW) - Multi-tasking from heaven, paired with perfect precision.	* Cypher (QL) - Talent beyond talent.  A complete freak of nature in terms of the level he can raise his play to in big tournament.	* **Flash** (BW) - The Ultimate Weapon - his name really said it all.  What's insane, is that he got that nickname long before he truly deserved it.  By the end of BW, you could see this look of almost confusion on the faces of some of his top level opponents, as if they were thinking *"but I didn't make mistakes that game, I did exactly what I set out to do and he still adapted and rolled over me"*.	* **rapha** (QL) - Maybe the smartest player in any esports game, ever.  His entire approach seems to be reacting exactly the right way at all times, as if he doesn't ever have runs of confidence and simply knows there is a solution out there for every possible problem that arises.	* **Flame** (LoL) - Look at the motivation level of pro players and you'll see they tend to coincidence with the level their team is at, as great players struggle to maintain their own form as their team-mates fall off and have to be replaced.  Flame has one of the most insane work ethics I've ever seen and seems incapable of conceiving of a world in which he isn't supposed to be capable of succeeding, regardless of what team or meta he is given to perform in.	* **Thresh** (Q1) - He was the original genius of esports and he left soon enough that I simply can't understand how he wouldn't find a way to be successful and win, no matter the odds.  The first player to realise that if you beat the opponent convincingly enough with your brain, your skill level compared to his need not even become relevant.	* **NEO** (CS) - So good it doesn't even make sense.  No, really... his aim doesn't look good enough for him to get those kills and consistently dominate the game in any needed.	* **Mvp** (SC2) - Can win with any % of his skills at his disposal.  Impossibly large balls, near impossible to tilt and throw off.  If he can see that cheesing you is his chance to win the game, he'll do it and execute it as if it was a meaningless game in the team house.

{"body":"Really depends how you judge that term.  On the one hand, I think it can apply to really good players are boosted a few spots too high, as at the very top the difference can be quite significant.  So, I think the two biggest candidates in that respect would be Uzi and PawN.  Neither have been able to show this kind of performance with consistency in their domestic leagues, so I suspect fans will think they are much better than their everyday level.		Viewing the topic in terms of the largest drop-off from where people think of a player to his actual level, I think Rekkles is the obvious fit right now.  Shook and Bjergsen could have contended earlier on in the year, but Rekkles is the player so many have their money on as the best Western player and a potential contender to the elite Asian ADCs, but I just don't see anywhere close to the game impact to merit that kind of rating right now.		I think Rekkles does have the skillset and potential to be at the level people are talking about, but his mentality is not matched with his skills.  He's neither the late-game carry with the team built around him that players like NaMei and Deft are.  Nor is he the aggressive and lane-dominant player that imp and Uzi is.  Rekkles is not enough in either direction and doesn't seem suited to a role of being the hard carry.  He can't play like Genja and then hope to be called the best ADC in the world.		At this point, I think either fnatic has to be built around Rekkles or he has to go elsewhere.","depth":1,"score":41,"ups":41,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cl8t7ut","parent_id":"t1_cl8ejxo","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413282530,"created_utc":1413253730}

{"body":"There's a difference though. Thorin has already stated before that dlift is past his prime and in addition most people don't think that dlift can be equal of world class adcs currently. Most people don't say dlift is world class anymore, instead they just talk about him still being the best in NA. Maybe in the past you could say dlift was most overrated because he had room to grow and all he needed was the right team. Remember, dlift used to play the UZI style until he was forced by his team to change (which is clearly not his forte). Now come back to current times and you see a young rekkles, who probably hasn't even hit his prime yet. Nobody in the west right now has more hype about becoming great than rekkles. He really does have the skill to reach that level, but two things need to happen for him right now: 1) he needs to define his style clearly, he's pretty close to being like deft and Namei, but he needs to improve his game sense in order to perfect it 2) he needs a team built around him (ideally a top that actually plays utility tank champs, mid or jungle that is the primary "distractor/secondary carry" while the other is utility, and yellowstar can obviously stay. In addition, he needs to get that über winning mentality (which I only consistently see from yellowstar from fnatic this past year). One thing that can't be questioned about dlift is that super desire to win (really reminds me of uzi's desire). He wants it so bad that he demands that same passion and determination from his team, often resulting in him getting angry and snapping at his team. Yes, the way he snaps is a problem from his personality, but the reason as to why he snaps is due to that huge burning passion to win. Had you said that dlift "was" the most overrated from the past, then I would agree with you, but he's definitely not the most right now. In addition I find it funny that you think that an answer like thorin's is what makes you hate him. It would make sense if you said that you just dot agree with his opinion, but it's weird that a well thought out, non-controversial opinion of a player. Would you say that it makes sense for me to hate you for giving your opinion on dlift being most overrated? I don't think it makes sense. To me it sounds like you already hated thorin for something else and you're using this answer to vent, or you tend to take his opinions on things personally, which then makes you hate him because he's somehow offend you.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Voltiate","name":"t1_cl8vyik","parent_id":"t1_cl8tzy1","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413288469,"created_utc":1413259669}

{"body":"I feel that you are just going to far with the thorin hate. Most people have a problem with his opinion just like you, and that's fine, but most would completely disagree with the tabloid journalism. Keep in mind that tabloids are about rushing lies just to get noticed. That's not really thorin at all. He doesn't tell blatant lies (the guy offers analysis and opinions, which isn't really something tabloids do) and most of his content is literally backed up by multiple stats. Your criticism of him being ill informed is quite interesting when he's been at this job for years, regarded as one of the best, yet here you are shutting him down when you're most likely a person who hasn't even had access to information for league or cs like he does. Keep in mind that literally for years his past jobs have all been about researching and acquiring information on these games. Hardly sounds ill informed to me. Also I'm not going to believe your tabloid case unless there is significant evidence of him being a fraud and/or the journalist community has turned on him. Remember that most tabloids are known to be tabloids because other forms of journalism felt and figured out that they were fake. Since thorin has gone years without that happening, it's probably safe to assume that he isn't a tabloid journalist. As for your point on dlift... That's fine if you think he's not that good to be top. Your paragraph on dlift is perfectly fine as an opinion. Just note that thorin's definition of overrated wasn't the reason why thorin chose rekkles over dlift. The difference between you and thorin is about where you think their skill level is. You don't think it's that high, thorin does. Also, it's interesting to see you think that presenting an opinion in an aggressive way (such as a fact) produces such hate. Some people do that, and most people do that when they really believe in his/her opinion. Think about it like this: Froggen has his set way on playing the game (take multiple small advantages in lane, and snowball that instead of do something crazy), he believes that that is the best way of playing the game, believes and states it as fact, and you can't change him otherwise. Now, do you get mad at him for having an opinion and thinking that it's fact? It's the same thing with thorin. He believes in his opinion and there's nothing wrong with believing it is right. You getting mad at that kinda sounds like you have a problem with opinions when a person states them strongly, which isn't really a reflection of thorin, but a reflection of you. It also makes me wonder if you are the type of person that gets bothered by his twitter comments and likes to take them as journalism, which it isn't. And I have some questions for you: since you think thorin is ill informed, do you think you have more game knowledge of him? For what reasons why you have more? What proof do you have of more? How do you argue against most of the esports journalism community supporting and respecting thorin? Do you think all of esports journalism is a fraud/tabloid? Why? Also, what was the first thing thorin ever said that started to make you dislike him? Maybe that can give me more insight to your thought process and understand you more.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Voltiate","name":"t1_cl8x6pu","parent_id":"t1_cl8w4ch","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1413291630,"created_utc":1413262830}

{"body":"1) Going back to your Polish Problems first: The revelation of your opinion on Eastern bloc states by means of that 10000 words essay was forced onto you since your original talk on Unfiltered on the matter got interrupted and cut off even during the show, but still quoted out of context. The length of your piece suggests the topic has been on your mind for a very long time. Do you think there would've been any way you would've come forward with your opinion intrinsically motivated? Or was that something you knew you couldn't adress publically because it would rub people the wrong way and give the wrong idea of you? Do you think there wasn't any point to put out such a critical piece since it wouldn't achieve anything but contrary, perhaps makes you look like a unappreciative jerk/ stranger to business/ straight racist? Do you think your concerns regarding holding esports events in Eastern bloc countries would've received differently if you published them on your terms rather than having to justify/reply?  		2) Do you understand peoples anger and allegations of racism on the back of that Unfiltered show and are you planning on treading more carefully in talk shows specifically because of the feedback? People seem to not even be willing to hear you out and unless it's your own talk show, they won't even let you finish your point, but still jump at your throat for what they think your opinion is. Now, you can't change haters hatin' and purposely misinterpreting to fit their propaganda, but what's your approach towards putting out controversial statements in 	the future? And how does feedback affect your work, if at all? To what feedback to you pay attention?  		3) What do you think of the lol community/ r/lol in general now? It was in your first ama, I think, you stated this was the gaming community that received you the best. How do you feel about it now? What led to changes? I feel like once reddit has detected some sort of flaw in a person, they will forever be harping on the same string. Link is the 24/7 Hearthstone guy, Brokenshard is the ama every week/red buff guy, Saintvicious will always be known as Smitevicious, Travis/Slasher/all of ongamers will always rig reddit's upvote system etc. Do you think it's the same with you since people keep bringing up racism in every one of your SI/reflections threads? You're not big into schmoozing people, but is there any way you could've done anything to change peoples perception of you? Or is some kind of that inevitabely the road every critical content creater has to go down, will the community always attach some negative exaggerated quality to you? Is it even important to you, do you think your current image has a positive effect on the viewership of your shows?    		4) Feel free to leave this unanswered, I know you're a private person and don't want to reveal too much about yourself.

I remember that in those interviews, you were not visible - the series seemed focused on eliciting information / opinions from the player.		As time has passed, your character/personality has sort of taken the forefront compared to your content.  I usually appreciate the content, but (*for me*) your personality feels like it gets in the way.  Not to be rude, I just am not as interested in your opinions (which are okay) as much as your interviewing (which can be great).		- Would you ever consider returning to a way of creating content without being as on-screen yourself?		- As you aren't working for OnGamers now, is there a place people should go to check out any eSports related content from you?		- Personality often seems like a focus of attention in League of Legends eSports (from players, coaches, journalists, etc.).  How does it compare to other scenes you have reported on?  Is there anything the community / Riot / Teams should do to improve in this area?

First off are there any books you'd recommend to any aspiring journalist (be that esports or not)?		When arranging your longer interviews (grilled and reflections), do you ever encounter resistance from people unwilling to do a longer interview like that? Have you ever started one only to abandon it and if so, for what reasons?		What do you find the most frustrating thing as a esports journalist outside of travelling to and from events?		I know you're interested in sports so did you ever consider a path into more mainstream journalism?

My next question is much more simple?	-Why have you not done one of your long-form interviews with IdrA? He lasted the longest in KR out of all the foreigners. Ret, Draco, and Nony all left KR after a short time period and IdrA stayed for years. Personal differences aside, surely Greg has some interesting stories about Kespa training houses.

By the time league really started to explode his career was already winding down so I and I'm sure many others never got to see Jiji in his prime. It'd be great to hear how much weight the myths and legends hold, his thoughts on CLGs management of his career, and old CLG drama is always fun.		2) Do you believe older (I use the term loosely) gamers have inherent disadvantage due to slower reaction times than younger players which explains the relatively quick turnover in the league scene? It's an idea that seems to have made the rounds in this community as fact. If anything to me reaction time differences are marginal at best and it's more to the fact that players burnout, external factors like marriage and kids, and organizations that rather take chances on cheaper raw talent they can mold instead of older players possibly set in their ways. I think the whole "their too old" argument is bullshit, I don't follow CS or Dota but aren't many of their top players 25+?

You love winners and big time performers, I always thought you would be a fan boy of Peke. Yet you constantly show so much love to Froggen and even Alex Ich over xPeke. xPeke's career is one if not THE most decorated in all of League of Legends all while being the face of Fnatic. Don't get me wrong Froggen is a god tier mid and so was Alex in his prime. But if Lol esport scene ended today xPeke in my opinion would go down as the best western mid ever.

He couldnt pause or fast forward he couldnt rewatch certain nuances that you want to see again. In my eyes it is two different jobs and can not be compared.		I dont think anyone knows how long each teams coach analyze games especially since its more important to analyze the teams your playing against. That being said every major sport have analyst that communicate to the coach, to where the coach does analyze but more so lets the analyst do it so he can coach the team.		I agree that CLG is not mature enough, many sports teams have these young athletes that are not mature. The problem is that, the coaches job is to keep his players on the right track and to keep them a team. A psychologist is for individuals to not go on tilt or to successfully manage the stress they receive (etc.). To keep the team together is the coaches job, and monte being half a world away he couldnt do that. 		I think the biggest issue is that coaches are new to the scene. I dont think there is any successful coach. I know charlie was mostly an analyst for C9 and not really their coach. I dont know who leviathan is, but again I think most LOL teams do not have a dedicated coach.
