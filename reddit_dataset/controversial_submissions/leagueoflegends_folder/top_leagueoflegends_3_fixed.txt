{"body":"Lane swaps or not, there are many games in which low interaction is obvious. Dont believe that lane swaps are the only culprit, although in lane swaps scenarios there is even less interaction.		 The main reason is that Dragons arent important anymore and the recent buffs did nothing to adress the issue. The idea behind the 2nd dragon is good but it is very undertuned, his impact is barely noticeable. Also 4th dragon is useless at that point of the game, which team would ever turret dive in 35-40 min, especially with death timers being so long?		 Riot said that they dont want Dragons to be mandatory because they limit the strategic aspect of the game. Its something i agree with, but they forgot that Dragons were the main reason to teamfight in LoL. Baron and Dragon were where fights always happened. So you want to make Dragons non mandatory then fine, but introduce other ways for teams to interact and take risks or else you have the extremely risk adverse playstyle of the current season. And ESPECIALLY since you decided to buff the gold that turrets give for a god knows what reason","depth":0,"score":385,"ups":385,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AdoOO3Losa","name":"t1_d0yaaei","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457913476,"created_utc":1457884676}

{"body":"There should be a global passive if nobody swaps in the first 5 minutes, everyone magically gets a free trinity force in their inventory that lasts 5 minutes. If you manage to kill or get 3 assists with it, it becomes permanent. You can keep it or sell it. This will encourage early team fighting for sure. If a team gets aced, game is over. Surrender is lowered by 3 minutes per extra death the losing team gets. Honestly, I'd rather have this that what's been going on. It's a shit load of time to watch all the games each day and not worth it if most are boring. I've been seeing myself playing the game much less and watching LCS much less. I wasn't sure if LoL would make it 10 more years like many people argue newer games eventually take over and have their chance at the spotlight. I didn't buy it then, but I buy it now. If the trend continues, I can see the player base being much much smaller in 10 years with the LCS reducing number of teams to reflect a smaller market. I think it will still exist, but won't be anything special.","depth":3,"score":-18,"ups":-18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PotatoPotential","name":"t1_d0yd4oy","parent_id":"t1_d0ybc36","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457918660,"created_utc":1457889860}

The buff would be similar to Heralds pick up too but locked to that team with a timer before it dissappears (Allows the other team to deny it) while also having a CD on that choice so it can't be spammed like Kindred. So, for example:		Dragons Tribute:  When you or an ally commit a takedown on dragon, it will drop a buff choosen by the player with smite equipped. 		Buff 1: Straight Gold drop, can be given to one person (like 400g) or automatically shared between whoever helped with the takedown	Buff 2: Dragons sight, gives collector a temporary extreme range trinket ward(s)	Buff 3: Dragon knock back, gives next cast summoner spell a knock back effect like dragon(or other boost). (Imagine the flash plays) 	Buff 4: Become immune to turret penetration temporarily	Buff 5: Repair a still functional but damaged turret	Buff 6: Stat boosts.

Gold rewards the winning player rather than punishes the losing player because it makes the winning player stronger, but the next time they meet the loser could still outplay as long as the difference isn't ridiculous.  Deathtimers don't make the winning player any stronger, but punishes the losing player harshly by completely removing him from the game.  		Put it this way, imagine kills gave you 300 gold but deathtimers were 20 seconds.  The losing team would only be at a numbers disadvantage for maybe 1 turret in this scenario.  Afterwards, you have the winning player ahead one basic item, meaning he's going to be stronger 1v1, but the losing team can play around it by not fighting him 1v1 until they have someone equally strong.  		Now imagine kills gave you 50 gold but deathtimers are 60 seconds.  Now there is basically no individual reward for the winning player, but the losing team is just wrecked.  They can't afford to try another 1v1 at that time for risk of losing another player, but they also can't defend anything because contesting 4v5 is suicide.  Their only hope is someone on the winning team getting caught out, which can easily be prevented by grouping.  In this scenario, one player won't individually snowball (Riot's concern) but now the whole team can take one kill and snowball it into an inhibitor, which is much more damaging to the enemy team which has no options to counter this.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tronosaurus","name":"t1_d0yeyg0","parent_id":"t1_d0ybz5q","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457921737,"created_utc":1457892937}

Anyone can play pretty much anything in solo queue and do well. The rub with buffing rewards for kills would decimate the quality of life of the game for the standard player. They stated a while ago that they always want there to be some sort of comeback mechanic. If you buff kills then games get out of control pre 15. I think why gold has remained where it is is due to math being applied to farm levels. If you perfect farmed you are never really out of it even if your teammate gets shit on.

Personally I want to see gold readded to Dragon, all stacks removed except 5th, then reduce it to 4th so teams have a reason to take dragon while still working towards the final power spike.

{"body":""Then the duo lanes would just go top though." This by itself doesn't pose a problem. It's literally just putting the map upside down.		Second dragon in an extended siege is really strong. It's not as strong when taking a free turret, but it does boost your siege capabilities.		I was more thinking of getting rid of the mini baron buff and simply making RH a timed old school dragon. The issue with a constant gold objective that is a pushover like drake is that it snowballs a whole team really really hard. Get FB, rotate into drake. We are now in S3 (or was it S4? I don't quite remember) with the kill tower kill enemy kill dragon, all before 10 minutes, 85% winrate games again. If you get the first tower plus first drake, the enemy team will hardly be in a position to fight over the next drakes for the remainder of the game due to your team being in an increasingly advantageous position. This was one of the reasons dragon was changed.		Baron is killable at 25 minutes.The 20min baron is risky, 25-30 is very manageable and we see it being done, 30+ is pretty easy with a decently farmed team.		Global death announcements, if the objectives would actually be impactful, would be a good thing. It puts both teams on the same note for fighting over it as opposed to one team having a stranglehold over it and just farming it. the issue is that drake and RH are just not worth fighting over, you simply take them when they are free, due to turrets being of such importance and neutral objectives before baron being bad for your tempo.

Yes laneswaps can be boring but to say they take no skill is absolutely false - how many times do we see bad teams mess up laneswaps?

LoL does award aggressive plays (see ROX Tiger, IMT, AHQ), it's just that most teams find it more reliable to play a safer early game to ensure they don't straight up lose.

{"body":"The thing is the variance is not individually skillful.  Yes, Korea it works(even in Korea we see way more 2v2 lanes than other regions).  Their culture, level of drive and determination to evolve the game and it works but everyone else just learns the basics and beats teams that wouldnt even make it out of d2 in korean solo q(usually, not even consistently beating them).  It is frustrating watching how good league can be however only a handful of teams from all professional regions actually make it work or push the boundaries of the current meta.  NA and EU have literally been doing the exact same thing for two seasons now(!!!!!!!!!).  The way the game is played also doesn't give your best players a chance to be your best players.  Why is Faker on Lulu so damn much when he can demolish almost anyone on any champion that has outplay potential, why are people allowed to play champions with horrible laning phases and get away with almost no punishment?  The only lane you can't be greedy as hell with your pick is midlane and even then people are picking super safe/supportesque mid laners far too commonly.  Lulu, Zilean, etc.  These are the real problems with the game.  There is no volatility, there are all kinds of variants to the lane swap but they are very similar and very passive.  Unless someone messes up bouncing the wave or mistimes getting to lane to catch a wave there isn't much going on.  I feel like this meta cannot evolve anymore until they make serious changes to try and encourage fighting or by having some imbalanced champions in the game that force teams to play differently than this almost scripted meta.  There is no mystery or intrigue after teams appear in lane you know exactly what is going to happen the only question is "Who will execute better?"  and that is not exciting or dynamic.  Watching players just with mechanical outplays and really showing how deep their knowledge of champions and match ups are is the coolest part of league.  Remember when Faker intentionally played both sides of a match up and won with each champion...that is skill, pure skill.  Executing a plan better is pure teamwork but right now the meta is far to heavily weighed upon drafting and executing a lane swap than it is being more skillful than your opponent.

The bottom line is that teams are making decisions based on very tight risk / reward metrics, aka "what is the most reward I can get for the least risk".  IMO what Riot needs to do is to create incentives for more risky play by rewarding teams who can create kills and objectives in the early game rather than just trade towers and Herald / Dragon.  		I do agree that lane swaps are more of a category that encompasses a host of strategies, but I still think it's problematic to the entertainment value of professional play because it becomes less of a showcase of mechanical godhood and more of a "how good is my coaching staff" type game.

{"body":"The problem with your first paragraph is in general this game is going to be min maxed.  Its the easiest way to get advantages.

IDK if you have been watching the Alphago event this past week but its similar.  A ton of choices with feints and quick reactions possible and the added element of execution and different pieces.  In the moment each phase ends up being a mirror with small advantages gained.  Its the transitions from phases that the real advantages are gained.  So yes there is a ton of depth and complexity it just isn't interesting to watch without a Deficio explaining the 10 ways you could've fucked it up.  I only get this type of feeling in sports by watching NFL front 7's vs QB's.		If lane swaps happened for the first 10-15 minutes every game I would be happy as you get the deep strategy and punishments for small errors that I like watching.  The bigger issue is 15-30 min phase where its a lot prodding but not actually doing anything.  Towers are weak, split pushing has never been easier, siege comps are good, teamfighting comps is good.

Outside of Korea there is only a handful of teams with a combination of skill and knowledge to actually compete against mid/top tier korean teams.  The lane swap mechanic is also just a crutch for teams in NA and EU since they know which teams fail at it and can win the early game simply by executing a scripted plan better than the other team.  There is zero chances for mechanical outplays anywhere but mid lane the first 8 minutes of every game with a lane swap.  Give turrets 5000 extra hp that dissipates over the first 8 minutes of a game forcing people to actually go standard lanes and fight for farm and actually give a shit about laning match ups instead of exclusively picking teams for mid or late game.  Make so if you pick a lane with terrible early game you can actually be punished for it rather than just giving people and easy out via lane swap.

Lane swaps are also used to exploit weak strategic teams that cannot keep up, weeding them out and giving better teams faster, cleaner wins, These matches are supposed to be boring anyways.  To the afk farming with brain shut off bullshit, NO players in a lane swap can have shit understanding of the game or else they will be punished as not one person is aware enough to micro everyone at the same time.

{"body":"A lot of what you said is just not true.		The first 20 minutes could not be played by bots, or even amateur players. There's a lot of finesse and minutiae involved in correctly executing the tower trade, lane swap, double jungle, etc, and a lot of the best teams will put a unique spin on the start every game to react to the situation the opponent is in. Things like a support messing up the early duo jungle, then seeing that time advantage turn into an earlier tower for the support's team, and then that earlier tower turn into rift herald/dragon is pretty cool showcase of snowballing tempo into objectives. If you or I or even a challenger team lane swapped against, say, immortals, we would all be very clearly behind by the time the first two outers went down.		Secondly, "I miss the old season 2 1v1 skill matchups in which the players' skill could actually be showcased" -- I think you have slightly misremembered season 2. Season 2 was the time of Udyr vs Jax top lane, where everyone built wriggles and had infinite sustain. Mid was Anivia, Karthus, Morgana, with infinite waveclear. Laning phase never ended, and people never died. The first 20 minutes were often far more boring in season 2 than now because instead of watching rotations and objectives trades, we watched farming. Hell, CLG.eu's strategy of "pick anivia, turtle in base until they do something stupid" got them to SEMIS at worlds. It was not much better than now.		Finally, laneswaps have been around for the entirety of the LCS, and they have never been interesting. In fact, they used to be far worse, before Riot strengthened outer towers pre-8 minutes, back when people used to 4v0 lanes EVERY game. If LCS viewerships were really declining "because of laneswaps", we would expect those numbers to decrease steadily every since season 3, since laneswapping has always been around. 		In all, I agree that in their current state the laneswap meta is boring to watch. But keep in mind the alternative, always having standard lanes basically becomes one of two metas: either lanes stall out where nothing happens and everyone farms, or the teams with the best mechanical players snowball out of lane to win from there. League is first a game of strategy and team play, and there should always be the option to compensate strategically to avoid a bad champion or player matchup, and laneswaps provide that. I think rather than trying to remove it, Riot needs to accept it and balance them so that there are more meaningful ways for teams to disrupt, adapt, and innovate in the laneswap, and then shorten the whole process slightly.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WizardStar","name":"t1_d0ycymc","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457918369,"created_utc":1457889569}

{"body":"I talked about this just a few days ago with **Riot pwyff**; LoL is evolving into - or already is - **"slow and calculated chess"** (as he put it) which, in reality, I figure, no one wants to see.		And, no: Action-packed games =/= clown fiestas. Clown fiestas are bad games, where both teams play poorly.		Action-packed games are those were teams a) take risks and make proactive plays and b) have a REASON to take those risks.		Right now, they don't. The game is incredibly risk-averse.		My personal take on the reasons:		* Turret strength (too weak for too much gold?)		* Dragon/Herald (too strong for too little reward of any kind?)		* Tank Items and Masteries (overtuned, making Tanks too strong and even making it more optimal for non-Tanks to buy them/take them!)		* Anti-Tank Items (and Masteries?; Simply not efficient or practical enough?)		* Vision (too much of it?)		* Ambient Gold (too much gold for doing nothing?)		All of these factors, in theory, make it so that the **"most optimal way to play"** is to just PvE as efficiently as possible and then look for small openings.		In other words, playing passively and risk-aversely is by far the most optimal way to play... And, well, games in the LCS are few and far between - so they all matter a lot - so playing a risky style is just absolutely not worth it.		As pwyff said to me, assuming that these are indeed the problems, the questions are now this:		* What are the Goals (from their standpoint as the devs)?		* How do they get to them?		My take on the "Goals" is to, well, achieve a game-state that is, simply put, quite opposite of the current one.		As for the solutions - that is obviously the difficult topic.

{"body":"Tbh there are many factors that make the games boring to watch. As we were able to see at IEM, the laneswap-tactic gives you the biggest advantage over your enemy if they don't mimic you (especially seen in China vs EU games). As OP mentioned, dragons are literally useless up until the ~45 minute mark if one team has 4 stacks. The third factor is the long deathtimers combined with the too low stats of towers. You can most of the time finish the game if you traded like 1 for 5 after 35 minutes.		The last factor I want to mention is items like ZZ'Rot Portal and Banner of Command. Seeing these items push sidelanes, making players with TP go to that lane and clear is not interesting to watch by itself and also denies teamfights most of the time. These items also make players choose TP over other summoners again. Having a TP vs heal matchup in midlane will nearly never lead to early fights in any lane. An exception to that are games without laneswaps where bot lanes get dove by 4 people or smth like that. You can watch games like that in China and partly Korea (that's at least where I saw it), but Cn and Kr games are mostly played at times where EU-citizens have to work.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ian_ditt","name":"t1_d0yeeny","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457920806,"created_utc":1457892006}

When you see all these incredible plays, like Faker 1v1 v Ryu and xPeke 1v1 v Dade, it's not JUST the insane mechanics and forward thinking that let them come out ahead, it's the opponent making mistakes. Lane swaps minimize the chances of these mistakes as it is the META, which in case you forget stands for MOST EFFECTIVE TACTIC AVAILABLE.		Also, since late season 4 have you ever heard anyone legitimately say that chaos style is the best style? No, because it is simply sloppy. Going about the early stages strategically is far more beneficial than taking a 50/50 chance against the enemy laner.		Finally, laneswaps propel the game forward. Early tower gold accelerates the game into the midgame (the interesting bit). This is why I cannot understand why people just absent-mindedly call laneswaps boring. The games skip to the good bit!

{"body":"There's a lot of stuff that makes this game,that should be more action packed,so slow and boring.		Snowballing is now crazy,you can get 5k gold advantage at 10min in the game,and that just stole the game unless you can outplay an error from the enemy team,and even then,it's not 100% sure win condition.		Mistakes are too unforgettable,die at 20min ? Well enjoy your minute watching the map in 50 shades of gray,also the enemy had the time to get a baron,a dragon and 12 towers.		Towers are too forgettable,in a game where the only thing that protect you from a loss is a useless tower that does no damage and gets down in 2s if you misplay a rotation,and don't get me started on lvl 3 tower dives (shouldn't be happening at all).		Now laneswap are a fact of the champion select and is also a problem,why are games so based on champion select ? Easy answer,god tiers and lower tiers,champions aren't equal,and that dictates the meta,shouldn't happen in a balanced game (but it's understandably hard to balance everything),in a perfect world,champions should balance each others.		Farming is another big problem,why are camps taking so low to get back ? You can clear your jungle entirely,then back,come back to your jungle and almost everything is back up,come on riot,force a bit more risky invades !		Other question,how come a team,that push a lane at 4 people don't get any lack of xp ? Shouldn't the other team get rewarded for not doing so and then take an advantage over them ? Might be the system that makes lower xp champions get more over time to catch up (but why does that exists ? If support goes somewhere else gank hard,he should be down the other support that stayed on lane,and the other shouldn't catch up at all,making it a good decision as of strategy).		TL;DR Up towers,don't make XP catch up lower level people,less snowball,less respawn in jungle,less time dead,that should be enough for more action.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Merdhyn","name":"t1_d0yg67d","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457923765,"created_utc":1457894965}

I think in the summer we're going to see even more dynamic lane swap adaptations which honestly we've already begun to see.		EDIT: and TBH 2v2 bot lanes tend to be incredibly stale as well because no team is willing to risk dying and losing waves, and ganking bot lane as a jungler has so much potential to backfire it's not even worth it.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jkotieno","name":"t1_d0ygejw","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457924165,"created_utc":1457895365}

If the game dies out it's completely irrelevant the tactic grant wins. Any spectatorsport needs a majority that offers attractive play that make people want to watch it. Right now league is the same almost every game for almost every team. The majority do laneswaps, there ain't a lot happening before 15-20 mins into the game after outer bot and top tower are traded away. This is very unhealthy for the game. People don't want to see PvE 2/3s of the game, very much like people don't want to see possessionfootball that leads to nothing for 60 mins of the game.		There is absolutely something to the statement that laneswaps kill the competitive league scene, whether MonteCristo agrees or not.

And even if we had standard lanes it wouldn't make things more aggressive. How often do you see 1v1 kills in mid lane during lane swaps? You rarely ever see kills unless it's due to a jungler. But even then it's generally flash is blown and that laner that just lost flash plays like the jungler is right next to their lane for the next 5 minutes. Lane swaps don't do anything wrong.		Also, it's due to the fact that aggressive play is rewarded (through gold and xp) that people play passive. They don't want to give up that gold and xp or the enemy will snowball which they don't want to happen. That's why they play passive so they don't start getting "rekked". It's about 400 gold gained and 100 lost, so 500gold advantage instantly and more gold denied by having the laner be stronger. LCS teams have dominated games with 2k gold leads. 1-2 kills for an enemy team can get you a gold lead just like this.

The enemy team will simply rotate to another lane to make it a 1v3 again and you'll have two players that are already falling behind in gold by trying to defend the first tower.

In case you didn't know, back in the day, Gragas had higher than a 1.0 AP Ratio on his ult, and was played as a high burst fighter.

{"body":"The fact that people think laneswap takes no skill shows that they know nothing about competitive LoL. Laneswaping is not as easy as it looks (See China, low tier LCS teams). If you mess up the laneswap you will be behind a tower, or end up getting triple buffed or end up losing your 2nd tier side tower which would be a guaranteed lose against a really good team like ROX, Jin Air or SKT.		I have been watching competitive for years, since laneswap even became a thing. And I am only just beginning to understand everything about laneswaps, and even then nothing about laneswaps is static. What you do in a laneswap can change from game to game and even while in the game itself.		There is 3 types of laneswaps that I can tell right now. 1 is the freeze, where you just freeze top lane with the ADC and the jungle/top laner double jungle for a bit and then the top laner goes bottom with the support to lane normally. The second is the fast push, which is just how it sounds, where you build up a wave early and then crash it into the tower and take it and just keep going if you are ahead. The last one is the fast push/bounce method which is the most popular right now where you fast push the wave to the tower and let your minions die off so it bounces back and sets up a freeze for your top laner and then rotate to the other side lane and do the same.		What laneswap is used is dependent on the meta at the time, and since right now games are quicker generally than in the past and the best champions are more mid game focused and top laners are usually carries, you want to get them gold and get to the mid game which is why you have the fast push/bounce method of laneswaping. Sometimes you will just do the straight fast push into the second tier tower if you have a full tank top (and/or) you are way ahead in the laneswap and you can either stop the enemy from taking your 1st tower without losing the 2nd or just be up a tower anyways.		So yea laneswaps are really complex and to say they don't involve skill or anything just means you only care about TDM's and ARAM games.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bigfish1992","name":"t1_d0ybqx1","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457916216,"created_utc":1457887416}

{"body":"I do wonder why you watch competitive League as well.		Let me see if I can make something clear to you: Competitive League of Legends is where you watch (supposedly) the **highest level of play**. Not the **highest level of action** games. If you want fun to watch TDMs, go watch streamers play soloq. Competitive is not the place to watch what you consider entertaining games.		Now, do I think the current meta in competitive is perfect? Hell no. I do agree that teams aren't proactive enough right now and it's because there's very little incentive to force anything. However, I think lane-swaps are very far down on the list of things that cause this issue. I'd blame the long early-mid game death timers, the little importance of Dragon and Rift Herald and the obligatory jungle camp at level one for bot lanes, limiting the pathing options for a jungler, before I blame lane-swaps.		Honestly, I don't really care about the 1v1 plays being less common. I don't care that we don't get 50 kills every game. I don't care that the game has gotten more team-oriented and strategy based rather than a "which team has the better mechanical players" check. I enjoy watching high level games because they are just that: HIGH LEVEL. I love watching a team dismantle the other by always being one or two steps ahead of their opponents in the game. I might not understand all of the intricacies that go into a strategic stomp but I still love watching it unfold. This is the appeal of competitive, in my opinion. I would watch VIT's Lucian top game over C9 vs IMT any day of the week. In my opinion, if what you want is scrappy throwfests, go watch soloq streams.

{"body":"One problem I have with this post is that it takes EU viewership numbers as example. **EU lcs this split sucks** (mostly). We always had interesting teams like fnatic, gambit, origen, uol - they all had names and guaranteed plays. This season, most of all players that made EU great went to NA - making NA super exciting to watch, even with "boring state of the game", as you imply. EU on the other hand... only for hardcore fans.		My fanthusiasm died with gambit, and looking at teams now I see a major downgrade compared to last season. That may be because I lost some interest after 5 years but other long time followers of LCS that I was talking to feel the same.		NA on the other hand has good teams, legendary names, rivalry between old teams, exciting new teams...","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"icpero","name":"t1_d0yfftf","parent_id":"t3_4a8ow4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1457922540,"created_utc":1457893740}

{"body":"Agreed. Competitive league has been insanely boring for me the past season or two. I started in S1 and never have I been so turned off from watching LCS or anything similar.
