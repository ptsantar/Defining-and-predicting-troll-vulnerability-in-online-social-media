I just found this, and it actually makes more sense to me now why I might have passed, since if an algorithm scans my chats for "negative conversations" then I'm sure it will find enough evidence both in false positives (I'm a fan of good natured swearing and sarcasm) and some legitimate "negative" conversations since if someone's already flaming me then I'm not adverse to saying something back before I mute them.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"soswiftsumo","name":"t1_cuaut89","parent_id":"t1_cuatlv7","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440205859,"created_utc":1440177059}

LOL players need to grow the fuck up and take responsibilities for their own mistakes and learn to have some leniency for others.		I played a game the other day as Blitz, I missed about 90% of my grabs early game which is tbh not my norm, depending on how well the enemy is at dodging, I usually land about 60 - 90% of them. 		My adc was a randomer, and didnt rage. I apologised for my poor play and my misses. We cont. on to mid game, I started landing some pulls in lane got 1 or 2 kills for my adc and when we got in to teamfights, we started winning, and in the end we won the game.		If my ADC had raged at me from early game, we would have been most likely arguing with eachother when we should have been playing, and it would have been very unlikely that we would have secured the few kills that gave us the advantage for our team fights.

Also, expecting people to be mature in this game is a bit too much no? The demographic of the game is very young and maturity is not a commum trait in teenagers/young adults. 		Riot doesn't have to give end season rewards, that is true, but they need to give something to make average people to play ranked, some people need the drive for that skin or for that banner or ward skin.

Riot does have an obligation to the consumer to not screw him after he spent real money on the game.

B)A child who is unable to deal with basic emotions and lashes out at other human beings to make myself feel better. 		Do you know what you do to children who lash out at others? You punish them.		As an adult, when I get frustrated I manage this feeling maturely, as everyone participating in a group game should. I don't get chat banned. I've been playing since Beta. I have played around ten times the amount of games the average player has. (At least. I'm over 10k games and I believe the average is considerably below 1000) and I have never had a ban, restriction, of any kind. Because I'm an adult.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Djones0823","name":"t1_cuage0d","parent_id":"t1_cuag6hh","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440174002,"created_utc":1440145202}

I almost quit this game multiple times when I was fairly new because trolls/jackasses can ruin games so easily. What incentive is there to play League of Legends when everybody takes the fun away over playing Skyrim, where I almost can't have a bad experience if I try?

Let me explain clearly so read closely, the other champions in the game are played by REAL PEOPLE, that means you should treat them like real people!

Your dealing with people, some of them are kids but you should treat them like adults, the toxic pieces of shits are the ones who really don't give a fuck about others, they say stupid shit like "I play for fun who cares about winning" then proceed to 1v4 typing lol in all chat as they throw the lead, the people who chew and chew on someone for a mistake that they CANT UNDO, like its going to save them lp if the person begs for forgiveness for making a mistake.

{"body":"I know this thread is full blown " punish! punish! punish! They deserve this!", but would you guys humor me and look at the other side of the coin? I agree with your general sentiment about not being an asshole, but there's no reason to treat ragers as inhuman "pieces of shit" either. Humans are complicated: everyone makes mistakes and everyone gets angry from time to time, and they deal with that anger in different ways. Ragers are players just like you, but lacking the emotional maturity or mental control to not let their anger get the best of them. This is a game after all, and plenty of kids/teenagers that are still developing make up the player base.		Behavior is hard to change. I'm sure most players who are chat restricted know by now that they're a problem in game. Chat restrictions have always been about guiding players towards better behavior in-game and handicapping their ability to be a nuisance to their teammates. It's a slap on the wrist that quickly becomes a noose if they don't change their ways, and it's rather successful at cleaning up games. If you've been around a while, I'm sure you know that your average game today is way nicer and less rage filled than it was in season 1, 2, or even 3.		Isn't it a bit beyond the pale to start heaping on more punishments when the system as it stands today is already successful? All it takes now is a string of bad games to get you chat restricted, and boom, you've suddenly invalidated an entire season of generally being a friendly summoner. Maybe you had a bad day/week at work/school and your games start off poorly and you inadvertently let off steam at a player who messed up in game. You know it's wrong, but you do it anyway. Next thing you know, you're chat restricted... You recognize the problem, work on changing your behavior, and when the restriction is lifted you go back to being a normal player.		Do the type of players I mentioned above deserve to be stripped of their season rewards? Treated the same as Elo Boosters, serial ragers, and whoever else Riot decides to strip rewards from? It just seems like an excessive and mean spirited punishment on Riot's part. I'd much rather they focused on rewarding good players and reforming the bad than handing out punishment to people the system has already handled.		This is just my two cents on the matter, for what little it's worth. It's popular to hate on ragers/toxic people because of how they've acted in game, but come on...

{"body":"That is not the only reason you get chat restricted for. When I play I am always a huge part of shot calling. I will send sometimes 70+ messages in a game telling people where to be and what to do. If we win the game people tend to praise me, but if we lose they get frustrated at that annoying guy on their team who would not shut up and so they report me. Now looking at logs it is not all bubblegum and sparkles. I do say stuff like "X and Y person need to be here at this time blah blah blah". Now I generally don't have a problem with people when they don't listen but sometimes I say something like "Why were you not in that team fight" or "I wrote a message in chat about this event 2 minutes ahead of time and you were not prepared." So obviously the more negative comments come out when we are losing since that is when more mistakes are made, but none of the things are what you would consider toxic. It's just after the game people are frustrated at their own play and they think back to the guy in game who was telling them how to play.

{"body":"I am also short-tempered, and no other game has ever gotten me as angry as this game (I broke a laptop during one game xD), and if I am honest, I have before raged at people. However except for one time, every single other time when I have raged at anybody, it is because they are ruining the experience of the game for me and for the team, and I just end up putting them on ignore and asking for the rest of the people in the team to do so too. Because what you don't see is that when you decide to insult someone in the game, the whole atmosphere of the team is ruined. 		The one time I did rage unjustifiably, was because I was having a bad game, and going through a rough time outside too, and I instantly realized so, and asked my team to please put me on ignore because I was angry and I didn't want to rage at anybody. People understood, and maybe they blocked me, maybe they didn't, but I didn't rage anymore that game after that. The ignore button is there for a reason. If someone is pissing you off, block them, don't insult them.  		A game is not something worth calling another human being any insults for. Everyone has bad games, and some people are better than others, but if you are getting matched with those people, and you play enough, it's because you are on the same level as them and do as many mistakes at them. Would you like it if someone calls you a retard every time you make a mistake? Under your own argument, if someone does wrong, you don't spit at them, you try to help them improve. And you can help them improve without being an asshole. 		In my opinion, Riot is doing a lot just by letting you play the game while being chat restricted instead of banning you for the toxic behavior. What I'm saying is it requires continuous toxic behavior to be punished by riot. And to be honest, I believe that  allowing you to still play their game, and giving you the chance to prove you have improved should be reward enough for toxic players. But they not only do that, they also let you have a chance to get the rewards during the next season. So if you are truthfully reformed, prove it during the next season and earn those rewards.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"shakemmz","name":"t1_cuape0o","parent_id":"t1_cuao053","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440197827,"created_utc":1440169027}

You **can** be punished off of a single game. I moved to EU for study abroad, and 2 months ago I played 4 games on my NA account, playing for the first time in 3 years on that account. In the 4th game I was toxic, and I got a 14 day suspension for that single game. My chat logs in the e-mail only referenced that single game, and that's the only game that had any toxicity in it from that night.  My transgressions were:		1. I said fuck you Nasus (our top laner)	2. I asked the other team "how old are you?"	3. I argued in all chat post 20 minutes for around the last 15 minutes of the game (our team was down 15 kills and inhibitors at that point, a duo premade on our team refused to surrender).		The first two were the only insults I delivered that entire game. Now, even though the rest of my team was behaving worse, I can see why I got punished. I'm only listing this out so you understand what can result in a 14 day suspension based off a single game.  In terms of account history, there had never been any warnings or punishments before (I've never been punished or warned on any account otherwise).

Second,	>Completely unacceptable decision. 		O not. I find this decision completely acceptable. 		My only fear are those who were reported for no reason and due to the automatic system they received a warning. I myself received a warning for just saying "Good luck and enjoy the game" and nothing else, but that was it, a warning. No chat restriction, no ban, nothing. My girlfriend received also a warning for speaking Spanish with me in the game, but nothing else. You have to receive more than a couple of reports from trustworthy people to receive anymore than a warning. However, it could happen in some cases, albeit obviously not as many as people posting in Reddit about how they have been banned "for no reason, just because the fucktards of my team are losers". So that is my only concern, people who are falsely reported and punished.		If that is not the case, I think you should not receive the rewards. Rewards, as playing League of Legends in general, come with the agreement that you are not going to be toxic and you are going to follow the summoner's code, which you accept when you create your account and patch after patch. We could discuss about taking the rewards away only from people punished in the last half of the season because some other people may have changed their behavior, etc. However, for me, if you have been toxic, you do not deserve the rewards. It is not like Riot should bribe you to behave. You should behave or not be allowed to play.

{"body":"So I have been working my ass to make it to Plat this year. I have never left a game intentionally or fed intentionally in my entire 2 years of playing League of Legends. I have accumulated every single skin in the game because 1: I love the skins and they are fun to use and collect. And 2: Because I want to support Riot for the work they do day after day in order to make League of Legends what it is. So I went to school for the majority of this year. And at my school they blocked all gaming internet connections from literally anything video gaming related. So I couldn't play league unless I used a VPN, which I did. Now occasionally I would lag out and try to reconnect and etc etc. half way through the year this happened so much to me that I would sit in games waiting to reconnect because my computer would take so long to restart that I would miss so much of the game and affect my team mates. I didn't want this to happen, and after awhile I came back to playing normal's. And I would have the same reoccurring problem of D.C'ing, after 3-5 games of this I was banned for 7 days by the AUTO BAN system. So I emailed support in frustration and asked to have my account back sooner. And this is what they said:	BowlO'Ramen (Riot Games Player Support) Nov 05 14:13	I understand how these suspensions can seem harsh, but this system was put in place for the greater good of the community. I'm sure if you had a player on your team who left the game or sat at base, whether intentionally or not, you would hope that player received some kind of warning for their behavior.	As I said before, we understand that accidents can sometimes happen, which is why we first issue warnings and short suspensions. These measures are intended to allow players to resolve the issues causing them to disconnect.	While I understand that there's a large difference in intent between leaving a game voluntarily and disconnecting for reasons beyond your control, I'm afraid that we really aren't able to make that distinction. If we were to differentiate between disconnects and voluntary leaves, it'd open up an opportunity for severe abuse - where players just sever their connections manually rather than face the penalty of leaving a game. As such, I'm afraid that any situation in which your account does not participate in the entirety of a game can be considered a "leave", whether that be your decision or otherwise.	Now as much as this made me angry, I accepted it. And thus I stopped playing League until I made sure that I could fix my connection issues. And I did. So I learned from what the support staff said to me. I didn't want to affect my teams and so I fixed my issue and continued climbing the ranks. Here I am 7 months later finally getting my Plat V 23 LP and I stumble on RIOT LYTES IDEA OF HOW TO DEAL WITH PLAYER WHO HAVE HAD THESE RESTRICTIONS "ONCE" THIS YEAR? Are you kidding me. After all the time, money and effort I put into this game. Thinking I was helping Riot and bettering my self as a player who simply wanted to fix his internet connection? I am in pure disbelief. I feel completely shunned. So now I don't get my Plat banner or ranked rewards? I have no words to describe how I feel. It it just mind blowing. This cannot go through.

{"body":"I'll throw in my two cents for all the good they may do.  I could care less about the rewards or mystery skins or any of that horseshit.  When I signed up to play this game nobody promised me any of that so I don't expect it.  The real issue with "toxicity" and criticism of Lyte is that all this nannying that Riot is doing is for nothing.  The problem with their game is that "toxicity" is inherent to the structure of their game and they never make any efforts to cure the problem, only treating the symptoms.		League of Legends is a game where most people play with strangers and are held hostage for 40-60 mins by the worst members of their team, in terms of behavior and skill, whenever they sit down to play. Right from champ select the most bitchy troll on your team has the power to dictate how your experience is going to go and whether or not you are going to win or lose in most cases.  There's no way to kick a toxic player, vote him out of queue, or remake without penalty if it's clear from jump street that you are about to waste an hour of your life.		There is no VOIP to communicate with your team, meaning in most cases people who are intensely focused on their cs or winning a trade might not see your quiet little chat or listen to your ping because in the heat of the moment a lot of those sounds get lost in the background and then because it is in people's nature to deflect blame on to others, flaming and other things start to snowball games in a bad direction.  People who act like assholes might just be assholes, but I have watched many people I know in real life who are calm and level-headed lose their shit in game over how frustrating the experience of playing LoL can be.		Personally, I am a chronic leaver, and I don't plan to change my habits until there is a better system in place for getting out of a shitty game where I'm being held hostage by whoever is trolling and whatever other two deluded players who will never surrender under any circumstances.  For me, no punishment or restriction that Riot could hand down will ever be worse than being stuck in a frustrating game that turns me into a spiteful asshole, so I just leave games that have devolved into that.  I have no problem with low-priority queue or bans or whatever.  I would gladly take them any day over being forced to be miserable in a game, which is meant to be fun and recreational as opposed to a goddamn social experiment that intends to correct my behavior.  I personally have never even seen another game go to such lengths to scold and punish people, and it seems kind of silly and pathetic that they take so much pride in it, but whatever.  		TL;DR		My belief is not that this game just attracts toxic people or that there just happen to be a ton of assholes in the world who wake up wanting to ruin someone else's day, but rather the inherent systemic flaws that never get addressed in this game bring out the worst in many otherwise regularly tempered players.  Riot needs to fix their game and not their players.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NolanVoid","name":"t1_cuai7qr","parent_id":"t3_3htjkl","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440181377,"created_utc":1440152577}

We know there will be rewards as a bonus for beeing good/neutral all season long. You get a chance to show you have changed and you will again get these rewards.

{"body":"Lets say, you are just an ordinary student (who has average scores in exams, but who if trying hard enough can even achieve best results or sometimes meserably fail and get worst grade) and you have a group project, but you get into a group with 4 bullies, who has never touched you and you even haven't had even a talk with them. Group project starts, you start planning, researching etc and you suddenly see that those 4 are doing nothing, even worse, they are swearing at you, make fun of you even sometimes punch you for not doing your job and earning them a good grade. All that happens while teacher went to library or principles room. Then you decide: okay, i wont do anything too, maybe i will stand up to them and try to punish them somehow or even say something salty to shut them up (just this once) and BAM, teacher comes in, sees your bad behavior and hears the insult coming out of your mouth, sends you to principle, you get detention, bad grade and a notice to parents  after what follows punishment from them too. You are like: okay, i can accept that, next time i will be more careful and won't do something like that. Time goes by, school year comes to an end and you see an announcement with big black letters: **Those who recieved punishent of any kind won't earn any rewards for good grades. According to our rules, they also will need to caary with them a sign which say that the student is with bad behavior and ahouln't be trusted etc at all times.**	So what's the point of even trying to get those good grades and be good fot the rest of the year it you get 200% or even more punishment l, when the system isn't even close to being 100% perfect?	Same goes in League of legends, Riots punishment/report system isn't even close to being 100% perfect, and yet they want to punish players fot twice the ammount those players who only stood up to bullies or had a few bad days. Even for those players who flame, but have achieved their place ir their current rank don't deserve this, not even talking about those who won't recieve ranked rewards because of errors in the system. What errors? Lets see, you don't need to swear, flmame or do any of those things, you even don't need to type anything in chat, all that requires are some players who hate you. Yes, you can easy get chat ban/ranked restrict even by being nicest person in the world or never typing anything in the chat (atleast you could in spring and before that). How? It is simple, you can have a bad day and play badly or even not that bad, but there are players who wants to punish you for that and they report you for offensive language, because they know how to abuse report system. If that isn't enough, they even can convince other team players to do the same and you can't prove you are not guilty. After few games like thet you get a warning which is followed by ban, nice, isn't it? And what if you get the same players in more than one game? Sadly jerks like that exist and nothing can be done about that, you just have to sit quetly and get punished again and again and on top of that not recieve ranked rewards. How do i know that? One of my friends got ban just like that, he is a nice person and never flame, even in lost games try to raise morale of his team. So we tested it, created new accounts and wrote in /all chat, that specific player from our team is a flamer and needs to be reported, we were all 5 premades and he got atleast 6 reports per game, after 1 game he had a warning and after 3 more games a chat ban. He never wrote anything in chat, not even timers. We tried to contact Riot support, but got tired of automated responses. I don't know if this works now, but sadly it was like that and noone cared.

{"body":"As just a random guy on the internet, I don't expect my opinion to hold much weight. But around early February, my motherboard was acting up and one of my PCI cards would malfunction, making my USB Network Adapter extremely temperamental. Obviously I had no idea at the time why my internet would cut out totally out of the blue. I made a few tickets with support and tried everything from Safe boot, clean reinstall, Ipv4, Ipv6, reset, factory reset, Ethernet connection. Sometimes it would hold fine for 4 for 5 games so I'd assume it was fixed. Then it would drop again without warning and be down until I restarted. My rig was a 1.6GHz dualcore with 2 GB of RAM that struggled to top 40fps on low settings back then so restarts took a good 5-10 minutes to get back into the game. Eventually, I racked up enough leaves/AFK to warrant a position in the low priority pool and eventually a 3 day ban. I was heartbroken and didn't play League for another 3 months until I could afford a new rig.		I haven't had any problems so far and I've managed to climb from Silver 5 to Plat 4 since May.

{"body":"Reports are based on what other individuals in your game find offensive. This creates huge inconsistency as you could be in a game where there's mutually accepted 'college style' humour, or you could be in an environment with people that are expecting a more... 'dinner with the Grandparents' style of conversation.		Riot can reward whatever they want. If they want to base their season rewards off of behavior then that is fine. Some players will feel cheated that this information has only come out after they've already been restricted (assuming the information is correct of course) but again... not Riot's problem.		I think the whole automated reporting system needs scrapping as it is simply terrible. Bring back a community run tribunal, and provide rewards for accuracy. At least then there is a jury for your 'crimes' and not just some automated system that operates purely on number of reports (posibly some very basic logic that can't take into account context) and allows players to be scapegoat-reported for a loss by their team.		The system that I would use would be something like this.		- Player is reported a significant amount of times for various reasons.		- Player is informed that a tribunal case is being prepared for community evaluation. Their next 10 games will be considered in the verdict.		- Player plays their next 10 games.		- Tribunal case is presented to the community. Chat logs / reports / builds etc... A clear checklist of common behavior issues for games prior to the player notification is filled out by the participants.		- The chat logs / report details of the 10 games after the notification are presented to the tribunal.		- A set of basic final questions are asked:		-- Would you be able to enjoy a game with this player on your team? Yes / No		-- Has this player improved their behavior in their last 10 games? A lot / A little / Not at all.		-- Do you believe this player should receive a punishment and if so, what level? None, Light, Medium, Severe?		An automated system can then determine the level of punishment that the player would receive. A player who has shown improvement in their last 10 games will receive a slightly lesser punishment than they would have normally. The vast majority of players would make sure that in those 10 games they are perfectly behaved which means hey... the community gets at least 10 games of non-toxicity. That's a start right?		Repeat offenders have their previous tribunal case conclusion shown at the new one. An additional question could be asked: Has the player shown improvement since their last tribunal case?". If the answer is no, the punishment can be even greater.		People who have had a tribunal case against them cannot participate in tribunal cases themselves.		If you provide decent rewards for completing tribunal cases, we, the community would be able to police ourselves in a fair and reasoned manner.		Because the current system is vague and undocumented, players have no idea what the lines are and when they have crossed them. Sure, maybe if you set hard lines people may push right up to the limit, but you may also find fewer people cross them. If Riot do not want to implement a community run tribunal like before, then at least allow for some sort of instant reform, or reduction in punishment.		For example, a player gets chat banned for 100 games. Maybe at the end of a game, give non-premade teammates a quick vote. (Was XXX's behavior acceptable this game?). If votes are consistently saying yes, the player will see a real time reduction in the number of games they are chat banned for. This gives them real incentives to behave better in EACH game. "Your team mates have deemed your behavior to be acceptable in 8 of your last 10 games. Well done! Your punishment has been reduced accordingly". While this means people can get out of their punishments quicker, it is providing players with a game-to-game incentive to behave and ultimately all the community (and Riot) want is for people to behave and enjoy their games.		Currently players are chat banned, fire out abuse to their team using their 5 messages, get chat banned for longer and just get more and more angry. They try to behave a little better but at the end of their chat ban they just receive another one and get frustrated because in their eyes, they were behaving fine.		Anyway, this is a massive rant and I'll stop here. This system needs changing and pulling rewards from people will just make them more angry, not encourage better behavior. People need opportunity for reform, not additional punishment.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AcidReniX","name":"t1_cuailfz","parent_id":"t3_3htjkl","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440182841,"created_utc":1440154041}

The reality is that a border should display your skill level, not your toxicity or whether you've been 'toxic'. That's what the honor system is for. It would be much better to do periodic 'friendly player' mystery skin giveaways in order to promote being friendly in game, rather than randomly punishing everyone who gets a chat restriction. Hell, even a player with a 20m queue timer can be caught out. I have a friend who has a shit connection, and sometimes he leaves during queue and comes right back, or leaves halfway through game, for example. He will get a 5 min queue, and after 5 non-disconnect games, he'll leave during the queue and it gets bumped up to a 10m queue timer.		The summary is that if Lyte wants to punish toxic players, the best way to do that is to reward nice players. How can anyone say that a player who reaches diamond should not get a diamond border because they have a chat restriction. Isn't that what the honor system is for?

Because of this I would put a system into place, that FREEZES the rewards of the players. This means that if they improve their behaviour (no punishments received for 2-3 months) they get their rewards back. If they fall back to their bad roots, the rewards get frozen again and so on. This should make players improve their behaviour long term because they will lose their rewards for quite a long time if they receive any kind of punishment. This system is only for players who get chat restricted. People who got banned did a lot to get banned and I dont see a reason to go easy on them.	  	**Why should this work?**  	I think that if players improve their behaviour they should be rewarded.

The amount of people that flame the team is unreal and I get at least one or two every game, my response to then is a "LOL" and "muted" and a report after the game so I'm not sure what qualifies as being toxic yet I have not received a confirmation that said person was punished nor have I received a chat log to my email account detailing what exactly resulted in this punishment. It feels as if the people reviewing the logs are...the toxic people I'm trying to report as it is lol. I also strongly disagree with the fact that your reports diminish in value if you do it frequently, so now I'm being double punished for getting intentional feeders and toxic people every or every other game? Not sure how that's fair either because I can't help my team when top and jungle are flaming each other then somehow take it out on the adc who then tilts the entire game. I'm sorry but I can't 1v5 and so I'm glad that when I tell people to "just stop talking and play" that that's somehow worthy of even getting reported but on top of that I'm to get restricted.

Another thought I would like to point out is how you interpret "End of Season rewards" Perhaps you interpret it in a way you described: rewards based on skill, not your behavior in game. Riot probably defines it as rewards they hand out at the end of the season for players who demonstrate exemplary skill and behavior. 		Think of it as "tough love" from Riot, like how a kid (the player) would come home with a disapproving haircut (like he bleached it then gave it some nasty looking dreadlocks or something). Being the parent (Riot) who disapproves of such actions demonstrated by said kid, rather than just letting the kid keep his hair monstrosity and allow them to grow out and just cut it later (chat/rank band/restriction) they shave the kid's head clean (denying of end of season rewards).

I have said a lot of stupid/bad/mean/childish shit in lol, but nothing worse that what my friends who introduced me to lol do, and definitly nothing worse than what most regular players type. Heres my experience in lol. 		From the start you are met with people who insult, treathen and just in general act like dicks. And when I first started, I thought "man, im just gonna be nice, have a good attitude, and this will all just be fun." Que, 5 weeks in and I'm flaming like I'm a desperate BBQ cook in the middle of July.		And I honestly dont know what happen, it's just when I see the injustice that is other players who flame others or me, I get so mad. Yeah, I'm mad, and with no shame. And so slowly after a while i just gave up, and started to be just as mean and retaliate when people start to flame.  	Cause you see them everywhere, if there is a system that removes them, its flawed because for every 1 person it removes it glosses over 20 flamers. My friend who regularly advices people to go kill themselves brutaly in traffic has never gotten any bans of any sort. 		Me on the other hand apparently got my main account flagged at some point, cause after that if I wrote negatively in any way I got chat bans and ranked bans. I think i had around 200 chat bans and ranked bans before they just perma banned it. 	And the worst part is, I genuinly tried to improve my behaviour, but for every 10 matches where i wrote nothing, or just positive things, I may get one match that drove me up a wall with someone harrasing me, I retaliate and BAM ban hammer. 		And I probably deserved it, I dont mind rooting for a system that just gets away toxic players. But a system that singles out some accounts because they get flagged, and then continue to harras it with bans even efter a period with no reports is just plain out wrong. Now I have 3 new accounts that Im playing on, and heres the kicker. If I get 2 or more reports, no matter what i have written or not, I get a 14 days ban. No warning, no chat bans no nothing, just 14 days. 		How is this system fair? Yeah I have written mean stuff, yeah I have blamed, yeah I have been mad and frustrated for dying 4 times in lane, and some guy tells me to kill myself and delte my acc. It gets to you, and to write "shut up idiot" or something else is a perfectly normal human reaction to strangers insulting you. 	Could i have been a bigger man and just muted and reported? yes. Did I try to do that? yes. Did I always sucseed in this? No, cause I'm a god damned human beeing. 		I know this "Lyte" guy has made it a sport to do public witch huntings on accounts that claim to be wrongfully banned, but everytime I see that I can't help but think that while some people are just major assholes their whole game, most people does not flame every game. 		I dare lyte to go through my history, but instead of just getting up all my worst days and all my lowest moments in LoL and laugh at them like he usually does, check out how I was in the start. See the ratio of negativity to the positivity. See how I was for the most of the time when I didnt get any bans. Because the negative chat is just the tip of the iceberg, under the surface theres 80% of the other games where I have either not said anything, or tried to actively been a positive player. 		The system is flawed. It flags some accounts and IP's that get reports, and harrases them, yet leaves large amounts of toxic players still up and running and allowing them to do what they do, and it feels so unfair that I have to suffer for just adapting to the community I was joining.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Damox","name":"t1_cuanzyl","parent_id":"t3_3htjkl","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440195547,"created_utc":1440166747}

{"body":"I feel like a lot of people don't know that the word 'reward' has a different meaning from the word 'wages' or 'salary' or 'inherent human right'.  It's nothing that is automatically owed to you for you doing a pre-agreed upon amount of work.  It's something that you might be granted if you go above and beyond expectations and the person giving it to you happens to be particularly magnanimous.  Just because there is precedent in the past for toxic players still receiving rewards, it is not and never was an entitlement that anyone was ever guaranteed.  Riot is doing absolutely nothing wrong by not giving toxic players something for free.  They already let you go on playing this game for free even though you have already been punished for toxic behavior.  If they just instantly perma-banned anyone for toxicity that would also be perfectly within their right.  They are hosting a free service and they have the right to revoke any part of it from you for any reason at any time.  		The obvious retort is 'oh yeah well I'll take my business elsewhere'.  As someone who's played this game for 2 years without ever flaming anyone, being reported for anything, and just silently enduring whatever flames come my way while sending nothing but encouragement back no matter how my teammates fail, I think I speak for the normal, silent majority when I say thank god; please take your toxicity somewhere else and leave the rest of us mature normal people to play the game in peace.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hautamaki","name":"t1_cuasm5i","parent_id":"t3_3htjkl","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1440202639,"created_utc":1440173839}
