I'm not saying CLG hasn't done their fair share of mistakes in the past. They have. However, I believe Hotshot is really trying to change and have a successful team. He's made some changes after the relegations fiasco and really believed he could have a winning team. Tons of people were hating CLG for keeping Link and drafting Xmithie this season. A lot of them shut up when CLG got 2nd place during regular season. Then they went back to hating them with the playoffs results. Not saying this applies to all redditors but a LOT of people with no sense of perspective or ability to reason for more than 10 seconds are just forming opinions based on what they see. These are the same people who will absorb anything they read that confirm their bias because changing your opinion is hard when you're angry.

Like you said, 'result opportunists'. Did CLG lose their games vs Team Liquid because they choked? the meta didn't favor them? Team Liquid played the game of their lives?  picks and bans? simple map rotation mistakes? Bad nerves? Luck? Momentum? There's a million factors that can affect a game and yet people tunnel on the obvious things. LCS players like LoL for a living. When you go to school, do your homework, go to your 8-5 job, these guys are playing LoL, thinking about LoL and hang out with other LoL players.

And if they do, it's something the team is already aware. Fans, for the love of god, whenever you get new information, read, watch, hear something, think for a minute, be sceptical and don't fall into the dumbest logical fallacies. Now form an opinion. Feel like sharing your opinion on reddit? Ok, are you going to offer a unique perspective or something that other people wouldn't think about? If not, is it going to be something constructive and longer than 3 words? If it's a joke, are you going to hurt/mock someone? Think about that.

Part of the problem with the current way things are set up is that this is encouraged -- you have to be the first person to report something to get the money for it.

That's not what I said, so if you're in fact making that as a statement, then no, I don't agree with that statement.  If they have information they consider reliable and accurate and they are in the business of reporting trades and signings prior to them officially happening, then they should publish that information once they have it thoroughly investigated.		I don't even really understand what your suggestion is actually meant to mean in practice.		>make sure their information is correct		They have done that, by gathering it from reliable sources and cross-referencing it.  Should they wait until it is officially announced?  Because by that point in time, they no longer have a story.  Should they never report anything which may not yet come to be?  That's a very naive and uneducated perspective on reporting.		>it doesnt make sense that the author couldnt wait an extra couple minutes to get a comment from hotshot, same with the incarnation for c9.		Again, you're entirely wrong.  The publication is not obligated to wait for a comment from the team organisation in question.  Firstly, they may deny the story outright, even if all of the sources show that is accurate information.  Secondly, they may simply refuse to make any comment, whether the story is accurate or not.  Thirdly, this would allow organisations to stall indefinitely on stories they don't want reported, which is nearly every story in this particular field.		If a journalist was writing a story about Putin, do you imagine he would be obligated to wait until Putin had responded to a request for comment?  That's not the way that kind of reporting or the world works.  There are no "sides" to a story, there's merely the most accurate reporting on it.  A journalist should strive to make that his target goal, not representing the public opinions of all of the parties involved.","depth":7,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Thooorin_2","name":"t1_cqahtt2","parent_id":"t1_cqahnt4","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1428926172,"created_utc":1428897372}

Why are they deciding to do this is already puzzling to almost EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Seriously, we all know that CLG's weak players are Link and Xmithie but let's think about it. Link isn't a good mid laner and can't gain any pressure in lane because he isn't dominating his opponents or doesn't roam at perfect times. Xmithie has also been there playing the filler role in CLG, being either a tank, support, poke, or whatever CLG needs in their team. Now looking at this, we already know that CLG has a minimum of 1 threat (ADC) and top can also be SOMETIMES. Knowing how CLG is, they need a guaranteed second threat, someone they can rely on to make a play or exert a lot of pressure.		You can keep Link for another split to see if he's worth it but making Kori go jungle is just plain stupid. HotshotGG and friends are just making the dumbest decisions ever.

{"body":"So just as a reminder, I know Zion is considered a top top laner in LCS but before he was signed as top there were open rumors that he was considering trying out for jungle/mid as well as top. There were even rumors that because he was duoing with Bjergsen that he was in the running for TSM's jungle spot.		I am a TSM fan, but I watch Aphromoo's stream and sometimes Zion as well because I have always liked these two players. Zion is playing mid lane a lot in soloq. I think this is a very strong possibility if he can master the mechanics of the meta midlaners because he is a relatively strong laner and may be an upgrade over link. This would leave them with a Void in top lane.		As far as jungle goes, h0r0 would seem logical for them if they wanted to replace xmithie, and I don't know much about who is available for top line. Although Westrice retired, I think if CLG were to have a connection with him and try to make an offer it would be too much. There are also many challenger team players in soloq that can fill the role. You never know what new LCS talent can bring.		My suggestions may be shit, but I feel for you CLG fans. This split starts off as you being a top 2 team in NA and then finishing with 10 championship points which essentially means that you have to win summer to get to worlds.		Wish you all the best to keep the Rivalry there and competitive, but damn it sucks to have a pASSive owner who won't make the changes you deserve.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ChemBizWiz","name":"t1_cqal3a2","parent_id":"t3_32e8th","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1428934676,"created_utc":1428905876}
