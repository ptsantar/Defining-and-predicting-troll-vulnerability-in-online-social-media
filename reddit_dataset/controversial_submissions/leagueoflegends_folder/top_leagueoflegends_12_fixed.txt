{"body":"I'm talking any mainstream NA sport really. MLB, NHL, NBA and NFL are the same. It's part of the atmosphere and feeling of it all, and the opposing players, and esp the home players, usually like it. Its fun going into someone elses barn and getting booed for doing well. It gives the feeling of having different turf and rivals etc. It would really take away from the fun if the Nucks went into Chicago and didnt get booed at the madhouse on madison! 		The rest of what you said is really just you generalizing and stereotyping sports fans. In my experience, people like that are very, very much few and far between. Thats sad you think that honestly. 		tldr: A little cheeky banter and booing is all in good fun and doesnt offend opposing players and really just adds to the atmosphere and feeling of rivalry. It can even be taken as a complement by the visiting team cause usually it means youre a top rival. 		Edit: The point I made about opposing teams enjoying it too is fact based and not just my opinion btw. For example, Montreal has the hardest arena in the NHL to play in because the crowd is so brutal and its regularly named the favorite arena to visit by opposing players because of that fact. It truly is part of the fun, experience and atmosphere.","depth":7,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mr-BigDick","name":"t1_cw2teze","parent_id":"t1_cw2t1rw","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1445105392,"created_utc":1445076592}
{"body":"The difference is that both teams get an equal amount of home/away games, which evens out the booing. Usually the world cup games are all hosted by 1-2 countries, so foreign teams are at a constant disadvantage. Thus, international tournaments tend to have much less booing, unless the opposing team did something really underhanded. I'm referring to events such as IIHFWorlds and FIFA WC, and their format is much closer to LoL WC than the leagues you mentioned. 	As for the hooligans: Fans fighting is common in club level football matches; around 10 % of the games include reports of violence (and around 10 % of the fans are classified as violent). I dont know if you have such problems in the US.

The Olympics in hockey, for example, has equal if not more booing than NHL games.

{"body":"Are you trying to say that the reason sports are played in front of a live audience is to promote some kind of advantage to a team?  That's actually so retarded it's unbelievable.  There are live crowds because people want to see the game played there.  The sport caused the crowd to show up, the crowd didn't make the sport show up.  College football games in the US don't sell out stadiums because people want a chance to fuck up someone's game, it's because people want to go experience the game.  		Home field advantage is bad for competition.  Let me explain so I don't get called ignorant.  A sport is a competition generally between two players or teams.  Other than the joy of playing or watching the game, there is an outcome.  The only purpose of this outcome is to try to determine with varying sample size (long seasons to short tournaments) which player or team is better than their opponents.  The psychological effect of playing in front of a crowd is well documented and there are several examples of the home field advantage.  This does NOT mean that it is necessary or even good for a sport.  Home field advantage exists almost exclusively in games with large paying audiences.  For example, if you boo the other team at a house league hockey tournament, you'll look like an idiot and maybe get kicked out.  If you boo the other team at an NHL game, there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.		Anyways, if the whole point of scoring and winning is to show which team is better, than how is it helpful at all to have a psychological factor skewing the results in favour of a predetermined location's team?  I also think it's erroneous to say that if the teams might as well play at home if they aren't going to be influenced by the crowd.  The crowd is meant to be there to enjoy the experience.  Hecklers get kicked out of a comedy show for influencing the show everyone payed for, so why is it ok for someone to boo the other team?  		tl;dr It's crazy to expect nobody to boo a visiting team, but home field advantage is not a necessary or healthy part of sports.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Madeanaccountyousuck","name":"t1_cw34q0m","parent_id":"t1_cw2xe16","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1445134063,"created_utc":1445105263}

The worlds are being played in europe, so obviously people there want an european team to win and will try to tell the pro-players exactly that. In NA the fans would do the same thing if a NA team was playing quarters or semis. 		Also, the crowd is not there only to enjoy the experience. You would go to a concert, to cinema, to the theatre, if you want to enjoy the experience. People go to sport events to enjoy the experince AND show their support to their team and try to help them with their presence.

Uh..No.  	Most crowds will clearly cheer for one team more than the other, but they'll rarely "boo" unanimously. It's usually reserved for controversial issues, like when someone seems to be cheating / flopping / harming other players, or is known to be a complete dick, etc. Sometimes it's deserved, sometimes it's not, but there's always a reason.  	You don't "boo" a team just for presenting themselves and coming on stage, you welcome them, because that's what sports (and now e-sports) are about, not just competition.  	This is especially true for worldwide events, it's not like you're receiving a close town's rival team and having some banter with them; there are plenty of nationalities and cultures there, so the booing can be toned down for a more festive atmosphere.  	If you want to support your team and increase their chances, then cheer hard for them. You don't even have to cheer for the other one, though that'd still be nice.

If not, then we have established there is a line people wont cross. Even if we use the most extreme examples, it is fine to establish the line exists.		Once doing that, we can use less extreme examples to figure out exactly where that line is, and where it should be ideally.

The very fucking basis of communication is that different sounds have different meanings. It is not about simply making noise- you should expect that in life and especially at a sporting event.		Booing foreign teams is in poor taste especially when crowds at other events have been more accommodating. I was there at IEM Katowice when Fnatic played KT. Fnatic was stomped, but while KT wasn't cheered for as loudly there at least wasn't any booing.  		Favoring the home team is great, but you don't need to shit on the other team. That is the bottom line. You don't even have to cheer, just not boo. Seems pretty childish to me if people were to boo EDG if they win, as the grown up thing would be to accept that your team lost and congratulate the winner on some good games.","depth":3,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mazzticker","name":"t1_cw2sprh","parent_id":"t1_cw2scn1","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1445101817,"created_utc":1445073017}

Anyone who's been to such an event know how annoying it can be between games, when there is a delay of any sort,etc.	I think it's a "fault" in the organisation of many of the live events held by riots( and most lan for the matters). I've been to a couple of those events and sometimes it's difficult to stayed hyped up.Must be even worst with only a video feed to watch.		That's honestly the feeling i get watching that event. Players on stage,caster on a big screen behind it and the crowed in front,it feels really weird, and it's often the case. 		You want an hyped up crowd you get local caster/host/things to do between matches/something to keep the crowed hyped up.		People keep on saying French crowd this, french crowed that when in fact it's just simply not the same setting.This is Ogaming way of making events,ironsquid, tales of lanes,all stars,etc. What all those events have in common is caster directly addressing and interacting with the crowd as well as less downtime  cause cheering is better than watching the analyst desk talk on a screen about the same things for 30minutes then the caster desk reformulating what has been said for 15 min minutes , then pick and bans , laning phase and by the time it gets exciting everyone is asleep.		What they are doing in France is a bit like a good DJ building up the atmosphere slowly until everyone is on fire.In Paris people are starting to cheers even before picks and bans because of casters.		But there is no one in riot doing that. They are all about the stream, that how they function all years and it shows at live events where they don't have good local partners.

Sometimes the effect of the crowd can be more powerful than a player itself (in sports) and it is a cool feature in sports that IMHO needs to be kept, because morale on players can make even the smallest team win the biggest one.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"madful","name":"t1_cw2saj2","parent_id":"t3_3p2xo9","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1445099706,"created_utc":1445070906}
