{"body":"These cases can be difficult for my team to answer in a way that makes everyone happy.		I can say, that after talking to the Advocate who answered the ticket, he did indeed investigate the issue as explained, and verified whether the ban was accurate.		To double check, I went ahead and re-investigated the issue as well and the data we see checks out.  The account was engaged in multiple games of exploitative behavior to gain an unfair competitive advantage over opponents.		The tricky part is, the limits on what we can say in cases like this.  I've mentioned it before, but there are a lot of unscrupulous people out there who are always working to create exploits or hacks.  We find these exploits and hacks and fix them, and they adapt and make new ones.  This is pretty common for a lot of video games, it's a never ending game of hide and seek.		Some players will write to try and determine what we have found and banned a player for.  This is because they usually use multiple hacks or exploits and they want to see which specific ones we've found.		That's why in cases like this we don't specifically outline the things we've seen.  We WILL double check a ban to make sure it's correct.  And I can personally think of one that turned out to be a false positive.  But if it is accurate, we're going to keep the ban in place and not provide a descriptive answer for what occurred.		Sometimes this can be enough between the player and Riot, since the player ultimately knows what they did.  But sometimes a player may try to exploit our inability to be fully transparent in this issue to their own gain.		Since this has hit Reddit I feel like this would be a good opportunity to ask you guys what kinds of things you think would be helpful in a situation like this?  Keeping in mind the context I've shared, is there something else you think would help explain these exploit bans better?		**Edit: 1:45 PM PST** I appreciate the feedback that's been coming in and I'm keeping an eye on it.  A big concern seems to be the robotic or neutral tone of the message, rather than the content itself.  I think this is an area we can work to improve on so that a reasonable player can determine that there ticket was indeed actually read and their issue investigated; even if we're still not able to share specifics with them.		One thing I wanted to be sure to address was the claim by the OP that Curse Voice is the cause of the ban.   This is not the case, and **we are not currently banning any users for Curse Voice**.  Curse Voice is not currently an approved 3rd party app and SHOULD NOT be used in League of Legends, but if we do take action against Curse Voice users we would let the community know ahead of time.  Also, because Curse Voice is in a different category than the kind of exploit and hack that was used in this situation, if we were ever going to temporary ban a player for using Curse Voice we would explain those specific circumstances to them.","depth":1,"score":2804,"ups":2804,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"RiotWookieeCookie","name":"t1_cj7qswo","parent_id":"t1_cj7olu6","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1406347494,"created_utc":1406318694}

To me, if they were all banned then the IP argument could have merit, but if only he was banned, and they investigated his account for the behavior, then it is what it is.		EDIT: He also says "On July 9th after not playing for weeks" but he also links his LoLKing and he clearly played a game on July 5th. Did he not remember that?

In all fairness, the only thing that happens is that banned players lose access to their previously unlocked content. They can still create a new account and unlock things again. 		Transparancy comes at a cost in any justice system, so the cost must be weighed against the benefit of increased accuracy.

They're under no obligation to disclose their evidence, and in fact it would be detrimental for them to do so. Having worked on cheat detection in games before, I can tell you that it is a never-ending battle, and you take every advantage you can get. For a game with as many players as LoL has, it is an even bigger job than I've ever had to deal with. Though I have some idea - I met the developers of [WoWGlider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_\(bot\)) once and it was fascinating to hear about all their back-and-forth with Blizzard...before they got the shit sued out of them.

{"body":"http://i.imgur.com/fXkZLHo.gif Wooked!!!		Anyways... back to actual discussion since you asked for our concerns.		> And I can personally think of one that turned out to be a false positive.		With this statement on false positives, I would like to know if Riots (drop) hack detection methods are automated or not and estimations on how accurate/how many false positives you guys actually get. Under certain conditions, Riot's hack detection methods can certainly find more false positives than true positives due to the [false positive paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_paradox) and the fact that you admit to there being false positives begs the question of how many accused players who had their accounts banned indefinitely were actually false positives.		How this can be possible:		So let's pretend we have a population of 1,000,000 players. Within these players, let's assume the % of drop-hackers is <0.5%. This is a reasonable assumption to me since I don't even experience drop hacking 1 in every 20 games. The actually percentage is probably even smaller. Then 0.5% of 1,000,000 is 5000 hackers, which means there are also 995,000 regular players.		Then, let's assume Riot's drop-hack detection methods are 99% accurate, which is also a reasonable amount of accuracy. Then, 99% of 5000 hackers is 4950 and 1% of 995,000 regular players is 9950. Suddenly, Riot ends up with 9950 false positives (innocent regular players who Riot has accused of drop-hacking) and 4950 true positives (actual drop-hackers which Riot correctly condemned) under these assumptions.","depth":2,"score":137,"ups":137,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RainieDay","name":"t1_cj7qz41","parent_id":"t1_cj7qswo","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1406347825,"created_utc":1406319025}

{"body":"#####&#009;		######&#009;		####&#009;	 [**Six Sigma**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six%20Sigma): [](#sfw) 		---		>		>__Six Sigma__ is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It was developed by [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola) in 1986,   coinciding with the [Japanese asset price bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble) which is reflected in its terminology. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] [Jack Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch) made it central to his business strategy at [General Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric) in 1995.  Today, it is used in many industrial sectors. 		>Six Sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing [variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) in [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing) and [business processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process). It uses a set of [quality management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management) methods, including [statistical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization ("Champions", "Black Belts", "Green Belts", "Yellow Belts", etc.) who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified value targets, for example: reduce process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and increase profits. These are also core to principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) as described by [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker) and [Tom Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Peters) (particularly in his book "[In Search of Excellence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Excellence)" in which he refers to the Motorola six sigma principles).		>The term *Six Sigma* originated from terminology associated with __manufacturing__, specifically terms associated with statistical modeling of manufacturing [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_capability). The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a *sigma* rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of the products manufactured are statistically expected to be free of defects (3.4 defective parts/million), although, as discussed below, this defect level corresponds to only a 4.5 sigma level. Motorola set a goal of "six sigma" for all of its manufacturing operations, and this goal became a by-word for the management and engineering practices used to achieve it.		>====		>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/7hnRZ5d.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Six_sigma-2.svg) - *The oft-used Six Sigma symbol*		---		^Interesting: [^G.I. ^Joe: ^Sigma ^6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe:_Sigma_6) ^| [^Lean ^Six ^Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma) ^| [^Design ^for ^Six ^Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_Six_Sigma) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cj7sd65) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cj7sd65)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autowikibot","name":"t1_cj7sd65","parent_id":"t1_cj7scz7","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1406350432,"created_utc":1406321632}

Synchro Summoning involves sending 2 or more monsters to the grave (1 of them has to be a special "Tuner" Monster) and summoning a Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck whose level equals the combined level of the monsters you used to summon it (I.E. lvl 4 Tuner + lvl 4 non-tuner = lvl 8 synchro).		Xyz Summoning involves placing 2 or more monster of the same level on top of each other ("Overlaying") and then summoning an Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck (on top of the already stacked monsters) who's "Rank" is equal to the level of the monsters used to summon it (lvl 4 Monster + lvl 4 Monster = Rank 4 Xyz Monster). They then get special effect that require you to "Detach" the stacked monsters (They have to be placed underneath the Xyz Monster).		A lot of older players dislike them for making the game too "easy" or "broken", but I personally like them.

YGO has two formats, one with a ban list and one without - both formats let you use every card that has been printed aside of that.		MTG has Vintage (Every card is legal except for the Un- sets, cards with dexterity requirements or cards using Ante, there is a restricted list of cards that can only be a 1-Of). Legacy (Same as vintage, but with a ban list to ban OP things like Power9), Modern (Every set after 8th edition, with a ban list banning OP things) and Standard (Last 2 blocks, plus last core set. Usually doesn't have a ban list unless they mega fuck up)		The game is balanced around standard - since the oldest block rotates the overall power level remains the same - this also means that the newest cards don't really mean your entire legacy deck went to shit, in general you only use a card or two from the new sets at the extreme end. 		As a result, this means that Legacy/Vintage/Modern have fairly high up-front costs (Due to cards being old and not reprinted) but low long-term costs, and standard being less expensive up-front, but much higher long-term costs due to having to rebuild your deck yearly when a block rotates.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ryuujinx","name":"t1_cj7tqon","parent_id":"t1_cj7rqft","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1406353133,"created_utc":1406324333}

{"body":"If I remember correctly, Riot has stated they do not "automate" lifetime bans, and any account that has been flagged for a lifetime ban is looked at by a Rioter, meaning your account wasn't wrongfully banned. 		A Rioter has deemed that you were hacking by some means, and banned you so. Calling them lazy, ignorant, etc etc is not going to help you. By any means.		Also, as /u/mikedawg9 has posted, you seem to be switching around your Summoner Spell as well as active item keybinds. Now, be this because of what I'm assuming is a script, or if you're letting somebody else play on your account, you're still breaking the ToS and can be banned for as long as Riot sees fit. I seriously doubt you're actually switching your spells around like that just per champion, seeing as the muscle memory is there and VERY hard to change on a per-game basis. 		If op.gg had your replays I would like into them to see if you had been scripting, but they're not there. All we can do is wait to see if Riot looks at this. I honestly don't expect them to answer, seeing as they don't need to answer somebody "crying" on a forum. 		Best of luck with your situation, but honestly, don't hold your breath.

Edit3: So OP responded and the response isn't a bad one. Guys, this is by no means hard evidence. Account sharing is very likely but it's entirely possible that it's not the case. Riot response here: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2bprst/innocent_player_permanently_banned_neglected_a/cj7qswo		Apparently could be a hack/exploit and not account sharing at all.

{"body":"I actually agree with the OP here. Imagine if this was court of law and someone was arrested and not told their charges? Do none of you find it unjust to not only be punished for something that you're not being aware of but also being punished for someone elses actions when you may very well be unaware of what they are doing? IMO unless Riot can find a way to prove that he was queueing with someone who he KNEW was cheating they can't justly ban the account. It sounds unfair yes because there will be almost no way to prove it unless riot were to access their chats together and even if they do that people can avoid such things by using third party programs to communicate but that is the only actual fair way to go about this. This is a grey area and Riot is an American founded company, I would expect them to hold the account to our standards of innocent until proven guilty.

{"body":"That kind of thing happened to me too!			My account "MF Breadcrumbz" was banned for definetly no reason. I never got a chat restriction, or used an illegal program. I logged in one day, chat with a friend in-game, then watched an episode of Community. After im done (like 15-20 mins) i saw that "this account has been banned, the client will now exit" thing. I was just so shocked that i thought it was some kind of a bug. When i tried to relog, the game said that the id/pw was invalid. I messaged the riot about it but i couldn't remember my e-mail, so they didn't give me any information. After a while i said i just don't want that account and wanna know what happened to it. (it was nearly full hero and 50+ skins with plat4 rank. i know this is not too much but i paid money and time on it so it's precious to me.) they still asked for e-mail. Then after sometime, they said that it was in a different server. (?) I was kinda losing trust to support team because of that (yes i didn't remember my e-mail but they coulda just tell me what happened to the account right?) Anyway, about a month ago, i moved my smurf account from EUW to TR server with RP. Right after i did that, i saw the post on the forums that if you transfer your account with RP between  bla/bla/2014 and blabla2014, you'll get a refund. so i was like "okay fair enough" but when the time arrived, i didn't get the RP and i sent a ticket about it. And they said "you didn't pay any money" I was shocked, again. I told them they're acting even worse than EA to me and to forget about the RP. they kept sending apology mails and which i replied "pls no more" every single one of them. But 2 days ago, they sent me that email saying "sorry we messed up the account infos so we sent your RP to your account." 		I'm still mad at Riot because they just don't tell me what happened to my OWN account. And it's silly i can't make them believe that it was mine, because i can't remember my FIRST hero or skin. that's actually bs.		TL;DR: riot is making a lot of mistakes and i hope they see both your and mine post and contact with us.","depth":0,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rokkai","name":"t1_cj7s1q2","parent_id":"t3_2bprst","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1406349841,"created_utc":1406321041}
