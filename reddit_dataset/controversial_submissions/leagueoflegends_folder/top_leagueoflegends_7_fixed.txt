This headline makes a claim that doesn't appear to be true, without even a hint of attribution.		For the uninitiated, a reporter's best friend in defending against libel accusations is truth. Attribution allows you a way to ensure your reporting is true, even if the story pans out differently. You report what you are told, and you attribute those statements.		E-sports rumormongering mostly relies on unnamed sources, which should honestly be used sparingly, but are the mainstay of this scene.		If you are going to rely on shady, unnamed sources, at very least attribute to them!		The difference between **"Piglet and Team Liquid part ways"** and **"Sources say Piglet and Team Liquid part ways"** is enormous.

{"body":"Agree with this completely. It's particularly hilarious when people like Thorin or Lewis take Riot to task for their various policies, yet those two men are exactly as immature as Riot is in their work. The Esports scene is young and the coverage is a huge mess. Part of that is due to Riot intentionally obfuscating things to make independent reporters' lives more difficult. But the other part of it is that those independent reporters are sorely lacking in their ability to rise above all that shit. R Lewis basically threw a toddler tantrum on the Internet around this. Thorin constantly burns bridges with people he doesn't like on a personal level and builds up those who get him page views by being nice to him. And those two are the best out there right now... At least they have deep knowledge of the scene. But I, too, hesitate to call it journalism. If anything it's op Ed style sensationalism. They get paid, so whatever, I think they should keep it up because it's better than the softball nonsense that Riot pays people to write.

It's when he started being good (IEM Katowice) that the meta changed to diving champions. (Grag(early for counter early aggression and not farm-centric)/Reksai) 		TSM's problem with adapting to a patch is that when the Meta changes, then they won't try and fix their problems then because their mentality is that if it ain't broke don't fix it which is why they were running those champs in MSI which just didn't work anymore.		Another flaw in TSM's mentality in patches is that when the meta for them doesn't work anymore they completely wipe down their whole foundation and restart from scratch. Whereas other teams just build around their foundation. This explains the up and down pattern TSM always has inbetween patches.

{"body":"It was stated before that Piglet dictated the pick/ban phase, and comps had to be built around him which limited what TL could play.  Quas for example has had extremely strong games on multiple carry tops, yet in summer split and playoffs we saw him play a carry an entire 1 time?		Fenix was amazing on azir, and pretty good on Ori/Viktor/Ahri, yet many times we saw him get stuck on Lulu who he frankly sucked ass on.  Also while Piglet played pretty great in summer which I agree, he frequently went too crazy in team fights trying to carry it himself with flash plays, dashes forward, etc and got punished many times instead of respecting his teams ability to protect him and do their job.		I like Piglet, and I think overall he played very well in the summer split.  But he certainly had flaws.		Regardless it looks like Piglet is staying with Liquid which I'm happy about, I just hope the team is able to have better synergy this time around and they find a coach Piglet respects who can get the team playing around the team and not just around Piglet.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ATiBright","name":"t1_cvh9gea","parent_id":"t1_cvgyxfh","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1443499585,"created_utc":1443470785}

He was highly unprofessional, and I never gained respect for him since then. I actually don't mind him leaving the team since I felt they focused so much on his well being, that it made it less about the entire team and more about keeping him happy. I hope we can find a good mesh that allows Liquid to perform better as a team, not sacrificing other member's performances for one person who was hit or miss.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"b1gtym1n","name":"t1_cvh744t","parent_id":"t3_3mpjwx","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1443496353,"created_utc":1443467553}

His early deaths helped snowball their carries and put TL behind. In team fights Quas messed up several times and overrall had negative impact on their team fights. Piglet did great and I feel his talents would be better suited for a team that can play with him more effectively. Especially getting him a better support player. Xpecial played crappy most of the summer. He only had really good stats in the summer split because of how well piglet did in lane.
