Honestly, if I had to guess, I think they would be like everyone else, not really caring, not really feeling pressured. I think the ad will tailor more towards those that never really liked their breasts, and the ad finally gets them to take action. I don't think it would make a significant amount of people with small breasts feel pressured to get bigger breasts because bigger breasts or perky breasts means perfection or something. I don't know.

Tossing a middle finger at the camera (*obviously* meant for spectators to see) and saying something in your team's audio chat during the game are pretty different. 		TBH, I'm not a TSM fan or a Dyrus fan, but I don't think Riot has any problem with Dyrus saying "Get fucked bitch" because it wasn't audible to anyone at the event (except his teammates) or on the stream. He wasn't actually trying to taunt or disrespect his opponents with it, he was just excited he made a good play. He had no way of knowing the player cam would be on him and that somebody would be able to read his lips. 		I think that's pretty different from flipping off the camera in a 1v1 where you 100% know the player cam is on you, and you 100% know that everyone watching will know what you mean because no lip reading is required. 		TL;DR the intent is different. Dyrus's case seems to be him just expressing his happiness to his team, with no intent to disrespect the other player or actually broadcast his message to all the fans. In the Brazil case, the player very obviously intends to broadcast that message to the fans.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"landoindisguise","name":"t1_cvwxd81","parent_id":"t1_cvwt81u","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1444688874,"created_utc":1444660074}

{"body":"Yes but they are still both offending? And his name wasn't the reason he got banned 3 games, it was his interaction in soloqueue IIRC. And then we can look at what platform... svenskeren in soloQueue and Hai on official broadcasted stream. Even if Hai's action is less severe, it's on a more important scene which IMO equalizes the whole deal. Sure I would be fine with none of them getting a suspension/fine/punishment, but since one got a suspension consistency would be great. Competitive integrity and all that buzzword-jazz you know. However, Riot can do what ever they want. They can throw their non-existant consistency out the window and nitpick only certain cases. They probably have the rights to do so due to player contracts etc... Punishment or no punihsment, it's the inconsistency in Riot's actions that I find disturbing. Not Hai's finger, svenskeren's name, Diamondprox's gesture, dyrus cursing, brazilians cursing, forgiven flaming in soloqueue, IWD ban, incarnation lifetiem ban lifted. 			offtopic:			In season 1-2, before LCS, HSGG, dyrus pretty much every pro was "toxic" in soloqueue. it was accepted back then but not now. So why is reviewing player behaviour important now and not back then. When LCS started you pick the toxic guys and let the play in LCS cause they are the best, but when incarnation is at his peak he is too toxic for Riot. It almost feels like they no longer want the best players to compete, but player that can be used as role models. In general I feel like the Strawberry Generation is annoying as fk, you know they have thin skin, can't distance themself from critic or meanies on the interwebzzz.

He adopted the summoner name âTaipeiChingChongâ, a name with offensive racial connotations. In addition to this unacceptable act, **he proceeded to interact with the Taiwan serverâs community in a disrespectful manner.**		>Johnsen **has also exhibited inappropriate behavior in the past, including being verbally abusive to his solo queue teammates on several occasions. He has received multiple formal warnings during the 2014 LCS season regarding his interactions with other players and fans - the most recent warning was issued in late July**. Furthermore, Johnsen was aware of the importance of behaving respectfully while competing in this event. He and other Worlds competitors went through a cultural sensitivity briefing upon their arrival in Taiwan. Despite all of this, Johnsen still knowingly engaged in inappropriate behavior on the Taiwan server.		Equating Hai's middle finger to what Sven did is grossly inappropriate.

The bigger problem you seem to not understand is the vary argument you are attempting to make: context. Hai is in a professional sport scene with thousands of people watching. He's not getting paid for flipping hia middle finger around. He's expected to act professional in front of the crowd. What Hai did was not professional. I find it surprising that there are so many people who support what Hai did.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ImDeJang","name":"t1_cvx2rwl","parent_id":"t1_cvx0gs5","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1444697806,"created_utc":1444669006}
{"body":">If a profanity can be merely a joke, then why can't racial slur be. I see a lot of people use racial slur as a mean of showing friendliness.		It's tragically misused in this way by people who have forgotten or never learned the baggage carried by those words, with the possible exception of those who are "reclaiming" a word that is normally directed against them. This is a topic of great interest in linguistics, but unfortunately it can't be discussed in full detail on a subreddit related to League of Legends. I'd recommend reading or searching for "reclamation" or "reappropriation" if you're interested in learning more.		>The bigger problem you seem to not understand is the vary argument you are attempting to make: context.		Context is a consideration of *all* of the circumstances, not just some of them. In this case, that includes:		* His role - as you said, he is a professional eSports player.	* His intention in making the gesture - malicious or in jest.	* The severity of the gesture, which depends on cultural context and history; a gesture intended to show disrespect to a specific person or handful of people (giving the finger) is fundamentally different from a word intended to degrade and keep down an entire race of people (a racial slur).		Your assessment only addressed the first point. When you say that "both are bad", you ignore the third point. When you say "whether it's a joke or not", you ignore the second. Respectfully, you are not considering all of the circumstances, which is why I've continued to stress the importance of context.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Paralent","name":"t1_cvx7e99","parent_id":"t1_cvx2rwl","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1444704523,"created_utc":1444675723}

{"body":"Most people here seem to be drawing comparison to Svenskeren's ban during last years worlds, but many don't seem to remember how that situation came about.. Rito only took action "after" taiwanese players complained that the username was racist and this happened a few days after Svenskeren started playing soloq on taiwanese servers.. so basically rito had no idea themselves that his username was racist they were ignorant and when the taiwanese complained they jumped on sven and banned him.. but in retrospect rito could've warned him the day he made that acc or username since those were riot given accounts anyways, the way they handled it was the usual rito way. Now the point i want to relate to this incident is that rito only punished sven after the complaints and so in order for hai to be put under the scanner some player might have to complain to rito which i don't think any of the fnc players would do since they won't really think as much as reddit thinks of this situation. Another important incident is when gambit ex adc pinoy called Keane a korean dog in soloq which is racist and ban worthy but they managed to solve the issue by talking it out rather than go to rito about it so thats the thing rito would do something only if someone complains.

This incident seems like a poor comparison to Hai giving Febiven the finger - although neither of these stories really involve professional behavior on the part of the individuals involved, Hai isn't a repeat offender like Svenskeren was, and although his punishment had consequences for his team, I don't believe Sven deserves much sympathy for bullying other players in soloqueue and ignoring multiple warnings to stop his behavior. 		Perhaps Hai should have been given a small fine - in most sports, you probably would get fined for this sort of display, but the OP is conflating two separate incidents with the intentions of proving a rather dubious point.

This rule applies to "opposing Team Members," i.e. those sitting on stage who you are opposing in the game.  C9 was playing AHQ, so AHQ were the "opposing Team Members" not any members of Fnatic.  Febiven was giving his analysis on the desk with Sjkoz.  But if you still think the rule applies, then Riot would need to punish Febiven as well, since his statements (as evidenced by Hai's response) were clearly "antagonistic."
