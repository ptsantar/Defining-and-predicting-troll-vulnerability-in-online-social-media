{"body":"While you're right that the Turkish players should've taken the 1v1 tournaments more seriously and only have themselves to blame, you have to admit it is a pretty moronic system where the by far best team can't attend because of a bo1 knockout tournament in a very unbalanced game mode. And while you can say "all-stars is all about individual skill", I'd have to sincerely disagree with that as the IWC representatives qualify as a team, not as individuals through popular vote like with the premier regions. It's the IWC as a team that needs to win at All-Stars LA in the group stage to score points more so than them as players (because they don't stand a chance anyway in the latter).		What's also important to point out and what seemingly everyone is choosing to ignore is that SEA was pretty much winning against CIS when the game got remade due to a bad judgement call on Riot's behalf. Had SEA won that game, they would've played the finals instead and Turkey would've had the most points.		What sucks the most is this really diminishes Team Ice's chances at All-Stars. It was already a pretty unfair skill distribution where one team has the world's best region and the other has the world's worst region (Team Fire should've gotten IWC and Team Ice should've gotten NA or LMS), but at least Turkey might've been able to win a game.

I don't know how you can argue that melee champs don't fall under the category of "most champs."

Unless of course you're telling me there were no melee champs picked in 1v1s during the IWC allstar tournament.		Maybe I was watching the wrong one, but I'm pretty sure I saw melee champs get picked, and I say melee champs lose a lot, because ranged champs (like kalista) can dominate melee champs by **outranging** them.

I pray to qtpie that the indoctrinated 14 yo kids who live on this subreddit and think that riot games are a godsend to esports and totally not a cult have hopefully reevaluated their belief system and now understand what riot games are about.
