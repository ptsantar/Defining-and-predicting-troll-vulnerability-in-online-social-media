{"body":"Well the first issue is that Riot's priorities seem to dramatically differ from the playerbase.  That's going to create problems over time as people see other games get the features they want.		The second problem is that there are a lot of people simply articulating their displeasure in a sensible manner.  Instead you get people here making physical threats and racial slurs against Lyte and GC, which makes little to no sense.		If you look at the HUD discussion, Riot does listen and change things, they just get stubborn with certain parts of it, just keep talking to them in a tone that is above "I will kill you in your sleep if you don't do X", and eventually they will get it.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"awfulsome","name":"t1_ctfljq4","parent_id":"t1_ctfc7on","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437852136,"created_utc":1437823336}
{"body":"Yeah, I know what you mean, but I honestly don't think this hate right now in unwarranted. OP has a point, they're running Riot off a philosophy that is ignoring a vast majority's wants or even criticisms. No offense to other Rioters, it's just what I see when I read the posts the OP is referring to. It's almost sad to see as a long time player myself and I honestly don't understand why they're just not making the big changes we want, such as just a slider to possibly move the items and stuff around. All of the memes that people are using are coming from the fact that at one point, a Rioter had said those exact things and used them as a reason to essentially ignore us or tell us we are wrong.		I want to thank /u/riot_rayven for actually communicating the changes they plan on with the HUD and taking into account many of our comments, even if they aren't the nicest. Thanks for listening to us, I just hope you mention some of the bigger changes to your Riot buddies because a lot of the problems just stem from a few simple things that could be easily fixed.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DangerDamage","name":"t1_ctffjxn","parent_id":"t1_ctfc7on","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437829201,"created_utc":1437800401}

{"body":"Yeah, but this is different - the functionality is changed between the HUD versions.		The timer/CS/KDA aren't near each other and you need to spend more time looking at both to get a good idea of your kda/min or cs/min. Or you can't click champ icons on the side of the screen to ult anymore as Shen or anyone else. Or that the ping buttons were removed. Or that the (for some odd reason) stats next to your portrait need to be activated first. Or that you need to press ctrl f to show fps and ping.		It's just stuff that needs to be tuned and a lot of it are pretty big things that affect you in different ways. It's not the best HUD and it certainly isn't a great upgrade from the old to the new. I ESPECIALLY don't like the new C menu that just extends the stats.

There's a sub-community here who seems to take fairly out-of-context, misconstrued, or honestly just bad answers, and posts them in the effort of fueling the "Riot sucks" fire. If you only went by Reddit posts, you'd assume there are no good things coming out of their ask.fm pages, but this isn't true IMO.		2. There are often follow-up questions and answers posted on the ask.fm pages. One key example is this post: http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answer/131736334219. Similar to point #1, these don't seem to be posted or at least gain as much traction as the "negative" posts.		3. These guys are replying to dozens of questions each day.

It could (not does) show an act of considerable caring by only giving the players/community what is best and getting rid of a lesser form.		However, I think the real issue is that people are seeing updates to the HUD and getting upset because "HUD changes."

Have you ever played any of the arcade maps in Starcraft?  You do realize that DoTA started off as a mod, right?  If you let the players make their own content you allow for true competitive integrity.		Let's say I want to practice Lee sin's Flash-W-R combo.  How do I do that short of just grinding games as Lee Sin?  Right now I have to start up a custom game, add some or have a friend play with me. Grind to Level 6 and now I can finally practice my combo and *boom* just practiced!  Ok cool.  Now I get to chill for 5 more minutes until Flash comes back up.  And....fuck I messed that one up.  Five more minutes to try again.  You practice for literally **an hour** and you can practice the combo 12 times.		Imagine two teams being able to start a match at level 11 with 3 items?  Suddenly teams don't have to play for 20 minutes just to practice some mid and late game teamfights.  And if the fight goes badly, they can restart the game and start right back over and try again instantly, not 20 more minutes later.		Riot wouldn't have to spend their time making ARAM or Urf, they could let the players do that and handle more requests that the community actually wants, like replays.  I fucked my combo up, but how?  Was my placement bad?  Did I place the ward too close to me?  No idea.  Because I can't fucking go back and watch my game.		When I played Starcraft I listened to Day[9] and I would go into the replays after a game and see what I did wrong and what I did right.  Oh, I sat on mules.  That cost me gold which kept my army low, next game I need to use my energy better.  He did a fast expand.  I should have realized that he hadn't placed a spawning pool.		By being able to examine my games I could find weaknesses in my play and improve on them.  I'd love to be able to figure out how I can position better in teamfights, but I can't watch any replays of my games without installing 3rd party programs and I'm sure as hell not going to pay for coaching.

Same with the awesome ARAM map (unless it permanently replaces Howling Abyss (or the more sensible solution would be to randomly rotate the two maps kind of like what Heroes of the Storm does)) and the Bilgewater Brawlers mode.  		It's a resource dump towards temporary content.  And that's just plain silly from a development standpoint.  Why put all of that effort into new rulesets, models, maps, etc. only for it to be used once? It's like creating a new building next to the other ones you've already established within a city, and then you decide to demolish it a few weeks later only to design a new building in its place over the next few months, which again you'll demolish so you can keep up the cycle.  So many resources are simply put to waste by this stuff.  I mean it's cool and all, yeah, but when it's temporary content is it really worth the cost from a development standpoint?		I still think they need to take a page from SMITE and give what a chunk of the community wants by putting all of their Featured Game Modes into a single queue that daily/weekly rotates between the modes.  So one day/week we get URF, the next we get Bilgewater Brawlers, next we get Doombots, etc.  It could serve as a casual fun queue mode where every day/week the way you play is different.

No really though... "Hire more people" is never a solution in the tech industry unless you're currently rolling with a bare-bones crew, or you literally just need them to do monkey work.

Sometimes it works in certain areas of the tech industry because any coder will know how to do something basic that they learned in a university compsci course. 		In the gaming industry, you can't pick a top tier coder up out of college and tell him to code a line skillshot that scales damage with the level of the skill, as well as special impairment effects that apply under certain conditions like the target being below 1/2 hp. No random untrained codemonkey will know how to do that.		Let me put it this way. Imagine if at 40 minutes into a ranked game, you can choose to call in a new teammate. He'll have 50% of your gold/xp and be playing a random champion. They also have 50% lower MMR than the game average. Now try to win the game. Did it get harder, or easier?

Lyte talked about this a little [here](http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/130754822082):		>Players often say, "Don't you guys have the money to just hire people?" Well, there's a couple huge misconceptions here. One, some problems hit diminishing returns really quickly and throwing more people doesn't solve the problem faster. Two, every additional person requires proper onboarding to ramp up on the codebase and catch up before they can actually contribute to a feature and onboarding a person actually takes up the time of a current Rioter who was contributing work. Three, if you aren't careful and just hire anyone that is willing, you quickly kill your studio's culture which can affect your potential long-term success. So, you want to hire carefully and make sure you're attracting and hiring top talent that is also a culture fit. Many companies take hiring very seriously because they are afraid of the dangers of diluting their culture. If you look at Google, there's entire research teams dedicated to the hiring process, and it's been said that their CEO looks at every potential Google hire and reviews them as a final gate--that's hardcore, and shows why hiring can be slow sometimes but finding the right people is worth it.","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Scumbl3","name":"t1_ctf89z2","parent_id":"t1_ctf7qof","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437813440,"created_utc":1437784640}

{"body":"I'm sorry you feel that way. There are plenty of teams dedicated to producing content whose primary goal is simply making League of Legends a better game. Off the top of my head, stuff talked about in the last couple of weeks:		1. Skillshot refactor. We have a team that is constantly re-writing sections of the League of Legends code. One recent player-facing product of that is the skillshot re-write. They've also done major work such as re-writing the vision system, updating internal tools (for example, tools that designers can use to create new abilities), and more. Because we want to make sure League of Legends stands the test of time, enjoyed by players for years and years.		2. Team Builder Draft. Lyte's talked about this one a few times. A major overhaul of how champion select is handled so that players have a quick and painless experience for starting a new game. To pick out an under-appreciated role here, a data scientist can come in and analyze date saying, "Hey, the average time it takes to go from clicking 'Play' to getting into the loading screen is on average much longer than someone playing Blind Pick. We need to do better," which can inspire further innovation in that space. The goal here is to make League of Legends an easier and funner experience to play.		3. A plethora of champion re-works. Going back and revisiting what a champion is about, and saying, "We can do better" while doing their best to maintain the spirit of the original. If the goal was just "make money" I imagine the Fiora Rework could have been released as a new champion. But that's silly. We want all of League of Legends to be a great experience, and that includes improving old champions, not just making new ones.		4. All the work around making the NA server updates. This is all stuff I'm not even close to qualified to talk about, so I don't have a lot of context here.

It's really really really bad and it's why account selling, buying, and boosting is such a lucrative scheme within LoL.

Smite bypasses this issue by giving you access to all 60ish gods + every future god released, for $30.   DotA 2 bypasses it by giving you access to all 100+ heroes for no cost at all.

It eventually alienates people, thinking you're not valuing their opinion. And honestly, they're not. They don't give a flying shit about half the things we say, and the other half they were already debating. Which is also why a lot of people I know are stopping to play eventually, less and less. Because all the decisions they're making over like the last two years, apart from some VERY rare occasions, were awful.		2. You don't COMMUNICATE about things you're changing beforehand, because you're trying to surprise the community. What happens? They don't like it, because you NEVER gave them a chance to comment on their wishes beforehand. 		* **Examples**: 	* Karma rework. Riot didn't even deny they made a mistake. Though they said they won't make the same mistake. Of course they didn't learn out of it. 	* Almost all Reworks except Xerath because he had a feedback thread. 	* The HUD. It was rushed onto Live, with almost no changes, now they're changing a bit, but the big points people criticise? They won't change. Because they think the products they put out are perfectly thought out and shouldn't be changed too much because they're perfect.	* Biggest example yet. 3v3 map. They randomly changed it completely when they updated the map graphics. Now it's an awful version of Dominion. So much for surprises. It was the only map my two siblings would play with me, with the change they never came back, no more funny siblings times. And why don't they keep both modes? Because it would divide people that play the map. How come SMITE can get away with their small player numbers and dozens of maps all being there at once?

I think that's the issue this thread and the many posts like it are trying to convey. Obviously surprise events like this are great, but its been years since the community has been rallying for the bigger changes. Sure, you don't have to give us EVERYTHING we ask for, but give us at least one of them. Sandbox mode wouldn't even be hard to implement, considering they have all the tools for one at their disposal.  	  	What actually worries me is how poor the game is at being new-user friendly.

{"body":"This reminds me of a game called Puzzle Pirates. Many of you have probably tried it, it's quite fun. I played that game first 10 years ago, and have put thousands of hours into it. For the first 5 years there was new content all the time, and I was still learning everything and mastering what I liked even toward the end of my final stint there. Toward the end there, the only new content that came out was cosmetic stuff. The reward for spending my time there started getting smaller and many, many other players (and almost the entire 60+ friends I talked to weekly) quit. At my peak I was playing both the main servers, and often at the same time. 		The stagnation ended up killing it for me. I'd done everything I wanted do, and nothing meaningful was developed to keep my interest piqued. 		To me, League is going the same way. The same silly cosmetic stuff is being released, yet the difference here is that Riot has *over a thousand* more employees than OOO, the developer of Puzzle Pirates did. 		OOO seemed to be even less transparent, and that exacerbated the angst the declining player base already felt. Now a game that at its peak had thousands of players on each server at a time has a mere thousand at peak times *in total*. 		League is so much more bigger, but without truly impactful updates, I'm afraid it'll go the same way. Many people have already stopped playing, even I've cut down my League time considerably. It's still growing, sure, but I agree with OP, its future is in jeopardy with the lack of good Riot management.		My biggest beef is the "We don't give deadlines for things because then if we don't deliver we're called out on it" line that Riot feeds for everything.		They promised the Replay System, and it failed, and now they're so afraid of the community backlash that they don't actually release new content. Riot management needs to change, pure and simple, if they want to release new, good, and well-received content in Summoner's Rift.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LemonInYourEyes","name":"t1_ctfdvp0","parent_id":"t3_3ei2k9","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437825236,"created_utc":1437796436}

{"body":"Hey Sethlans. I'm really glad you have fond memories of 'countless hours of fun', I think that you can't give us any higher compliment so thank you.		I know what it can be like to lose your drive for League of Legends. Though I haven't shared your reasons I have taken a break from LoL a few times. For me it was frustration with my ability, frustration with ranked, and frustration with toxicity. Ugh, I just got to a point where I needed to walk away.		Now, I mention this because I don't want anyone to suffer emotional anguish over LoL like I did but being an insider I have learned that part of doing business in gaming involves disappointing players. No matter the decisions we make, good or bad, some section of the player base will not be happy with it.		This creates a weird relationship for us as developers, we make every decision we can with the complete union of all players in mind weighed against the subsets of players contained within. The LoL community is so much greater than the sum of its parts! Where it becomes difficult is knowing all the while that there are incompatible points of view that we may not be able to reconcile, ever.		Even if we make the best possible decision every time, your state of mind, the way you feel about our decisions or our responses on ask.fm, seems inevitable in some subset of the players. Can I say "let that sink in..." or is that only on TV?		So what do we do to address this seemingly unsolvable problem?! Aside from trying our damnedest to bring all of our data and experience to bear before a feature is developed we listen to your feedback and try to share our reasoning. Our hope is through that dialog we can gain greater understanding of how a feature is received and use that information to make even more informed decisions later, and improve the feature over time as well.		Secondly, we try to keep up with the needs of players as they shift and grow along with the game. We are constantly attempting to re-prioritize, pivot, etc to tackle LoL's pressing issues. This requires that aforementioned dialog between us and the players. My hope is that you will take Phreak's advice check out some more ask.fm answers and other Riot posts and help us get better!		But if you can't do that, perhaps consider taking a break like I have in the past. I realize in saying that there is a risk you will never come back, but if LoL is a game that causes you more frustration than elation these days I'd rather you were happy somewhere else. That was what I needed to refresh and dive back into LoL, perhaps the same will do the trick for you.

{"body":"It's fairly easy to see what Riot considers important feedback and what it doesn't. For example, complains about skins or coloration of champions get resolved in matter of hours (Shark Aatrox blue skin, Fiora's new face, etc.) whereas many reported big-bugs have lingered in the game unacknowledged for months. The amount of areas in which feedback is unimportant greatly outweighs the areas in which you truly listen.		> [Being clear how what comes out the far end even came to be or why something did/didn't get prioritized] is one of the things we are trying to improve on and I think why we might read as patronizing to some :\		No, the reason why Rioters look patronizing is exactly the opposite. If you pay attention to the low-priority projects in which the playerbase was properly informed (example: Poppy and Taric rework not in 2015, maybe not even 2016), nobody has complained about them. We understand that Riot gaming has different priorities than us, and as long as they are reasonable we won't complain.		The problem is that **Rioters are very bad at giving us this information**. Every single time we receive silence and/or empty answers in place of real information. We are completely taken out of the loop, and then you do the opposite of what we requested... There are very few things that feel more patronizing than that.		Just to add salt to the injury, Rioters in general never answer the questions asked. Instead, they simply use those questions as bounce-pads to talk about other topics. The fact that we are unable to receive proper answers to the questions we ask also feels patronizing as hell.		Take a deep look at GW and Lyte's ask.fm, and look at most questions about any particular subjects. They **never** tackle what's being asked. Even their most rabid defenders don't deny this point (instead they claim that *"it's context, they care about the macroscopic aspect"*).		> And to your last point, yea, you'll never hear me promise that we won't make mistakes. It eats us up inside and we hate that it happens and emails fly around the company and we will never be satisfied with how fast we can respond to real genuine fuck ups on our part.		Fucking up is ok, everybody makes mistakes. It would be illogical to ask anybody to be perfect. The problem is not learning from those mistakes.		* With Trundle and Karma, Riot insisted that they knew better than us. They were designing new and better characters. The ones that loved old Trundle/Karma where just being melancholy babies that needed to learn to love the clearly superior champions.		* With Sion and Gangplank rework, Riot insisted that they knew better than us. Now they were really good at understanding "the fantasies" behind a hero, so we don't need any traditional skin. Anyone who wants a traditional skin is being a melancholy baby that needs to love the new superior iteration of the same fantasy. 		In other words, you learned nothing from your Trundle/Karma fuck up. Sure, you admit you fucked up, but what's the point if you make similar mistakes again?

I want to know if the game is worth playing anymore.	You said you dont want to tell us what new stuff you will add to the game so you will surprise us.	What surprises did you bring? We, the comunity, repeteadly asked for: replay system, posibility to not lose LP when having AFK, posibility to vote to kick in champion select, new maps, not "skins for the existing ones", game modes cycles (this month URF, next month one for all, next month hexakill, etc).	But NOOOO, why would you listen to us? You come with "surprises"! You worked months probably for what? For a howling abyss skin? I PISS on your howling abyss skin. And I'm not the only one. We formed a pool of piss in your bilgewater map. Instead of making it a different map, you just recolored an existing one.	What other "surprises"? We have 60 champions made for top lane, 40 mid, 40 junglers, 17 adcs, and 15 supports. Make sure the next champion will be a top one please!	Another "surprise"? Well the comunity asked for reworks for certain champions, because WE, THOSE WHO PLAY THE GAME, FEEL LIKE THEY NEED CHANGES IN THEIR KIT. Among those champions we asked reworks for are Urgot, Poppy, Galio, Zyra. Who did you rework? Gankplank? Tits Fortune? For the former you changed an ability and for the latter you increased the breast size? Is this what we asked for? Excuse me, but are you sure this game is decided by the comunity, as you used to advertise it 3-4 years ago? Instead of convincing us to remain and play this game with new cool additions (we asked for maps, and game modes)  you come with champions masteries?

For example, while it's true that Riot shouldn't just change the game based on what the majority of the community wants, using this as an excuse for not having a sandbox mode and other widely demanded content is just sad.  	  	There's also the entirely different argument that their design philosophy is idiotic in the first place because instead of having an idea of what they want League of Legends to look like in terms of design and character balance, they just change everything all the time seemingly for no reason (make the bad champions better and the good champions worse, along with retuning the jungle entirely every single season) means the game can go through long periods of mediocrity without ever being significantly changed, but also that the game can become genuinly good, only to be met with entirely unessecary change in an effort to make the game seem as new and refreshing as possible to attract the masses. 	  	This is a fine business strategy for now, but in the long term, players will stick with a game that is actually well designed. The revenue they obtain from the people who spend money on the new skins and chromas and shit is limited by definition. These players are inherently not going to stick with the game forever, and constantly changing the game simply to satsify that playerbase only turns the game into a sinking ship, when they could instead just make the game good.  	  	  	I could go on and on about why this is important (another big example is there will be far less stress for the pros if everything doesn't change once a month, and professional players/esports are a massive reason as to league's popularity), but no one's probably gonna read this anyway, and it will likely just be met with "betcha didn't read the ask.fm's" instead of any sort of legitimate reply :/  	Have a nice day if you did read this tho I love you","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rockenos","name":"t1_ctfeu5h","parent_id":"t3_3ei2k9","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437827460,"created_utc":1437798660}

Mind you, the US is huge, spanning 4 timezones, and they're building dedicated lines that will likely be of little use to lowering East Coast ping to sub-50s until the next iteration of the entire fucking Internet pops out of some Japanese university's bunghole (source: have a friend studying to do basically that). All to appease kiddies who probably can't grasp that, no, complex signals CANNOT stably travel through almost any medium at the speed of light yet, let alone the fairly dated net structure of the US. I hardly think even Google has managed this, even with Google Fiber.		3. As confirmed by astralfoxy yesterday, a new client is indeed in the works. Assuming development started shortly before he jumped on board, that's still not a lot of time to put together so much as a *future-proofed* codebase. Yes, future-proofed, so it won't be a repeat of what we see today as a result of Riot being forced to cut corners as a literal startup: "gg rito spaghetti code coded as minions hurr". How would we go about making as much of the game as modular as possible without (a) changing too many of the assumptions about the old codebase that current content is designed (and likely even hardcoded) around that a lot of stuff that's dated yet relatively complex don't get broken to the point of requiring a full rework, (b) opening it up to new security vulnerabilities that could damage thousands of games or even accounts, and (c) putting too much stock in the foreseeable future in champion or feature design that new ones even further down the line that will be requested by the community might get locked out hard, necessitating more hacky solutions until we arrive at this point again? While I would like to see a bit more transparency in this regard, I also understand that it is in their best interest to keep most of the development under wraps, for various reasons on its own.		4. Corollary to the above, damn right reddit knows how a company works, but do you know how a dev team works? I think at this point more people should have learned that throwing more money at devs does NOT work past a certain point, and by now should be running into extremely diminished returns anyway. How do smaller entities or even single devs (e.g. astralfoxy) put out X amount of work in Y time? Two answers immediately come to mind.		4a. One is that for a single complex task, it's much easier to "make the connections" on your own. Say you want to play a piano  piece. You'd think that two people (one playing the right hand side and one on the left) make it easier, and four even more so. WRONG. The more people you have, the higher the likelihood of someone going off sync, even if slightly. One person will always know exactly when his fingers hit the keys, and how hard, and whatnot. Same principle in programming. This leads me to the second answer...		4b. Bureaucracy. Naturally, writing complex programs isn't exactly like playing the piano, so you can have a team of people working on slightly different aspects of a certain part of the game, which then has to seamlessly plug into the game itself. In an effort to organize all of this, Riot, like all companies with decently-sized software projects, makes a system to synchronize and document development and various changes. Said changes must be discussed and documented at length so whatever went wrong can be pointed out quickly. A single dev does not have to deal with this, further expediating the work and coming out with the product faster. My best guess at Riot's allocation of devs is that most are being assigned to various big projects that little ones have to be left by the wayside temporarily or picked up by the community, which, incidentally, seems to have worked fine thus far. I will note the comments from some employees that it can be hard to be heard because of the startup-like environment that remains, and possibly the lack of a truly unified vision for the game, but that's a story better left to those who actually work there.

For example: When Blizz was bought by Activision or when they released D3 I was angry maybe even a little afraid. But at some point I realized that even though they aren't the company that I fell in love with when I was a kid anymore all they did is grow up.  	Yeah they aren't this "games by gamers for gamers" company anymore but they are at their core still a company which is able to create ridiculously good games. They still have this "its done when its done" philosophy and they still put the game before looks.  	They made D3 playable after all and for that they had to abandon its entire monetisation strategy, yet they did it and did a good job.

Nothing of all that can be applied to Riot in any measurable sense. They don't create games in the first place, they only have a single game and they even neglect that one game.  	They don't seem to have the slightest motivation to be as good as their competitors. Their popularity might carry them a long way so maybe what they do is not even completely wrong from a financial point of view (which I would personally argue against) but the most devastating issue is that they, as a cooperate entity, do not care in the slightest that Dota2 looks so much better and has such awesome features.

So....thing is, they're not making this stuff up.  Change-aversion is a *VERY* common bias among...basically everyone.  If you're among the lucky few who can self-filter change-aversion, congratulations, but prepare yourself for a lifetime of being held-back so the class can catch up.		Also, "linear intelligence" is a myth.  Just because you have spatial awareness to handle a fully-customizable HUD doesn't mean that someone you'd deem "smarter" could too.		Finally, full customizability requires a massive amount of buck for the actual benefits it gives compared to a tighter design scheme with several popular customization options.  How much return they'd get in increased player satisfaction for increased customization is hard to gauge, but its definitely diminishing as options are added.  Its simply not worth the cost for full customization.		> Arguements like: You shouldn't have customisation because it'd give you 40 pages of options and you'd get confused or competitive integrity are just insulting to me.

I think it's fair to say that i may of made some assumptions in my arguement, but I'll try to give you a bit of a clearer understanding of what I'm feeling		 I do not dislike the new HUD, merely the layout of it, and even then I could get used to it.What annoyed me here was GC respones to it being static was it'd hurt cometitive integrity(?), that it is better game design to not have anything than to let us customise it beause riot leaving it to us is lazy (which I also find slightly Ironic)		>They're not targeted at you, though		I understand this completley, and I get that some people have rubbish spatial awareness (like me, as I am dyspraxic), and may not want to fiddle with the HUD, in which case, why couldn't they leave it as defult? 		As for the 40 page of options, sure I don't want that either, but honestly I'd assume that it's not too hard to compact some limited options, and it's be Riot's bad if they did give us 40 pages worth. I just find it irritating that GC pretty much says "actually, you don't want this because..." I find the actual arguement valid, but it annoys me that he can't just say "we felt the resources required would be too great for such a feature" or something, and instead just tries to tell me why I'm wrong.		Riot also said: We'll provide customization in order to solve specific problems (such as accessibility) or in service of gameplay (I want stats or I’d like to see more of the game space). This helps ensure a level playing field which a competitive game like League of Legends should always have while allowing for some meaningful flexibility.

However, one of the things I do dislike is how often the PBE is seemingly ignored. Obviously i can't really tell you how much stuff is changed/ignored from the PBE feedback, but I do have a distict memeory of the skarner rework in patch 4.2:		I shall try to find it (no luck yet) but I remeber a league website forum set up by RiotScruffy to see PBE testers feedback. I scrolled through something like 5 or 6 pages worth of replies, and I remember something like only 2 responses being positive. This was then ignored, the rework went ahead, Skarner was pretty poor until being reworked again in patch 4.10.		Sure this was an isolated, anacdotal bit of evidence, but it has stuck with me and I regularly hear people complaning on such issues (though whether they are genuine i do not know)		>Replays have likely been delayed so long because they'd add to the complexity of rewriting the client, and drain resources from completing that project.

These updates have been very great, but I feel somethings are still being sat upon, such as many champ bugs (e.g typical angry redditor quinn buggs, invisible nida spears,), 5 years of replays, new clients blah blah blah^(I really do sound like an angry redditor)		I know nothing of the complexities of their code, but with an estimated 1000 employees in 2013 (though granted many are not programmers/software devs ec), I think it's fair to expect 'a bit of a move on' for want of a better phrase.		And again, I'm not annoyed at the lack of these; they are not essential to me. What I'm cross at is the lack of open discussion, as for me, all it seems to be atm is either soon^^tm or "it's lots of work". I have a great deal of respect for riot when they annonced they weren't going to complete Magma chamber. 		Now I just wish they'd give us some information rather than "It's lots of work" (e.g "Localization for 25+ languages") or some uncited sources (e.g  In an external study by a university, they did an experiment where a female and male voice used voice chat and said the exact same phrases; in this study they found out that the female voice received 300% more harassment than the male voice)		>it's simply their attidude (or maybe even arrogance) towards it that annoys me.

I think that yeah, the majority of people vocalizing opinions about the Ask.Fm's are negatively criticizing it. However, that does not in any way indicate that a majority of players or subreddit users agree with that sentiment. 		I've played this game for almost 4 years now and I have not grown tired of Riot's "antics". Perhaps because I have a bit of coding background, I can understand the truly *vast* and *innumerable* difficulties that arrive when a library of assets is hastily created and then attempted to be remedied a great while later.		I think questions are the best way to test your beliefs. I could give you a million reasons why Riot is doing basically the best job anyone could ask of them. But I know that when you have an opinion you will likely ignore counterpoints because in your mind the reasons you've created simply outweigh points made. 		Anyways, ask yourself a few questions. If the changes needed are so easy that the vast horrors of reddit can come up with them in days, why hasn't Riot just adapted them? If it were so easy to simply shift priority to developing key features, revamping the client, and releasing the replay system concurrently, why haven't they just done that? If the way they run their company is so deplorable, so inefficient, why do they manage the top grossing free to play game in the world? Why, if their teams are so poorly implemented, are they able to release a plethora of skins, new champions, and make balance updates on a bi-weekly basis. If they are so worse compared to other companies like blizzard or valve in terms of patch content, do they consistently succeed in releasing balance patches and bug-fixes at a rate that blows blizzard or valve out of the water? Why, if they care only for money, do they funnel so much of their resources into creating a high quality professional scene with live matches in studios attended by audiences with high production values? Similarly, if they only care for money, why do they release so many community events (like Ocean Week, Pool Party festivities, Bilgewater event) that literally only offer free rewards to those who participate?

Instead of giving the other champions the ability to play around assassins, they just weakened assassins and made tanky champs tankier.

You can explain logistics all you want, but when you run the biggest and one of the most profitable games in the world, you shouldn't have to constantly excuse yourself and rely on your die-hard fans to shut down any criticism that occurs.		I think them trying to say "we dont want ppl to customize HUD because competitive integrity/someone who puts time into hud should not have advantage over someone who doesn't" is a huge hypocritical statement when you still have runes/masteries in the game. 		I hate how Riot tries to solve toxicity in games (IE lets do what no one else has ever done before - lets try to stop people from being dicks!), and in the meantime, lets trolls and douchebags run un-restricted ruining games through champ select and in game (until they get posted on reddit and reach front page lol) because they're too afraid to implement ANYTHING.

People want a smother client,one that does not consume 500 mb of memory and 30% cpu power. there is still none.		People want quality balancing, massive issues there.		In league you get nothing for being cooperative and nice to team mates, absolutely nothing(those banners are pointless).		You lose nothing for being an asshole, you get banned after ages, and then you can just get a bot account for 2 bucks and continue on  with the same shit every day.		League is the only game where you are helpless, once you enter a game with a troll, ashole, flamer, there is absolutely nothing you can do but to endure 30 minutes of shit talk and hopelessness.		When you meet an troll, asshole in chamselect, there is nothing you can do but to dodge and get punished by not being able for playing for 5 min, 30 min etc, the troll and asshole gets not punishment what so ever , EVER, and he can just continue into the next que and do the same shit over and over again.		The benefits for being cooperative and constructive are basically non existent.		I honestly stooped playing the game, as soon as i try again and meet just 1 troll, asshole, i get League of legends ptsp and i get a flashback off all the countless times i had to endure bullshit from assholes and i just flip and start flaming back, i have 0 fun playing league, this game turns you into a frustrated toxic asshole game by game. And the only reason for that is that good behaviour is not rewarder, and the punishments are irelevant since you can just make a new acc for free. if positives players had a separate que from assholes that would be nice, if positive players had a positive counter that increases your ip gain by 100% at max, that would be awesome. if i could report in champselect or post game ppl for forcing picks that would be really nice. If there was anything that empowers good behavior that would be amazing, i do not need to be parented by riot.		And btw, riot made this community the way it is, by slowly sucking all the fun and soul out of the game and players, instead on focusing on competitive balance a bit better (nerf irelia) they just realease skins and new gamemodes most ppl dont care about, i really wanna play ranked, but the immense frustrating experience, the pure non fun of it just makes ranked a big NO NO, and that is riots fault, for turning their own players into a bunch of frustrated ppl who like the game and hope it changes for the better, but all they get is new skins and huds not one asked for or wanted.","depth":1,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bpozega","name":"t1_ctfjmod","parent_id":"t1_ctfim9n","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437843088,"created_utc":1437814288}

The latter play in professional teams, where the balancing model of solo queue applies very little. 		You need a lot of patience to enjoy this game if you're somewhat average at it.		Furthermore, on things such as the retarded HUD changes and 100:1 scale of attention towards "making money off chromas:making the game stable and bugfree" just very clearly proves that Riot cares very little about customer satisfaction, and only about the money they get. This game is free to play though, which is bound to attract the scum of the earth (especially young teenagers) who irresponsibly throw away money, which happens all too easily in a game like this where not having a skin on your champion is like not having an Apple Smartphone. It feels weird to them, and they will ultimately be tempted to buy it anyway.		Back to HUD changes; it's fucking atrocious and should've been tested before release, much like many other complete fuckups such as release Feral Flare or release Yasuo. The PBE SHOULD be used for this, but it isn't, it's just yet another server that runs one patch in the future with the intend of pre-hyping new content easily for surrender@20 to post about and instil a buyer's high for those who are weakminded enough.		All in all, Riot is a laughable "company". If you don't really have fun playing anymore, it's not going to get better. Don't bother. Find something more fun to play. I very rarely play League now, and that's solely with a group of friends usually in custom games to avoid the shit matchmaking algorithms and generally disgusting community which has yet to receive steady punishments for cancerous behavior for longer than a day (great system there, Lyte!).","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DojiDoj","name":"t1_ctfcgmn","parent_id":"t3_3ei2k9","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1437822103,"created_utc":1437793303}

{"body":"Riot recently starts communicating more openly with the community, regardless of what comes out of their mouths that step is an important one. Starting a dialog is the best way to get what we want in this game and now we have the ability to talk directly to rioters about our concerns. I try and look at it this way, blizzard made a lot of mistakes in their most popular games. When making design decisions about WoW, blizzard listened too much to the community about what the game need. This community feedback was overwhelmingly "we want better access to the content". Unfortunately blizzard listened and nerfed every raid in the game so that everyone could see the content. The consequence of the nerfs were that people no longer had something to look forward to, blizzard had sucked their drive to improve out of the game. I think riot is afraid of making the same mistakes as blizzard so they have sprinted in the opposite direction. The fact that they are opening a dialog now tells me that they realize they need to be more transparent than they have been in the past.

They implemented a much better match history, and a rioter just informed us that a new client is in progress. It may take a long time before they gets that ready, but they are doing something with it. And I agree that this game is lacking a lot that should be pretty basic, like a replay system for example.

{"body":"You won't like this but this is mainly your fault, there isn't a single gaming community out there that is prone to having immature behavior or trolls that has successfully been changed for a long period of time. The thing is it takes 1 kid to piss in the sandbox to ruin it for everyone, and about 80% of the wrong behavior is verbal (someone just being bad at the game doesn't count). So there's a simple solution to it, either realize all kinds of people play this game and don't get offended by the likely a 12 year old kid yelling at you, or just use the /muteall command. 		The levels of "toxicity" go as such: evenings > weekend evenings > holidays > holiday evenings. So for the majority of time most games are pretty chill. But lets say even on holiday evenings every 3rd game will be chill without anyone flaming anyone, and in those 2 other games it's usually 1-4 people engaged in it. So my point is the toxicity is also exaggerated, but it seems much more to us because it stands out way more, if you play 10 games today and in 1 of them someone said "fuck you idiot" you're gonna think about that 1 game at the end of the day, so either as i said just have a tough skin or /muteall.
