The show had actually spoiled things for books readers, for example there was a character shown who's status was unknown (I can't remember the details since it was ages ago) and they also showed what happens to craster's boys when the white walkers take them.		This is not filler, the first one was later shown in the books and the second is too big of an event to be filler.		The one gripe I do have with the show though is the actual filler.

{"body":"Just lazy? Interesting. Usually I don't check runes(except lately), but if I see in game someone running weird runes I then check their other rune pages that they didn't use to see if they simply lack better runes or actually prefer it over a "meta" page or whatever.		It doesn't spoil only one's that play with you but also if someone is looking up your runes from op.gg for example for some other reason than having you in the same game.		Also I don't know if Scarra would have known, but Qtpie didn't seem to notice he's opponent had 1% crit before checking runes. And that's why I nowdays check runes even if I have good idea already what they have I check it up. Just to make sure that they don't have any cheese like xp quints where sudden lv2 spike could catch you off guard if you don't pay attention on their xp bar which could be case if there would for example be some early jungle stuff happening and you need to use most of your attention to looking if you should go help or not etc.		Also it makes it easier to know everyone's runes jungler especially. It is completely possible that you don't see their jungler before first gank happens and when that does you might need to know what kind of runes jungler is running. For example I remember brokenshard using some specific rune page on elise which was reason that they were able to win 3v3 at bot lane when first ganked happened. Would their opponents have played that situation differently know that they know that was the case, possibly.		I think if you think you can know everyone's runes without checking them up is arrogant and partly even impossible in those first gank situations because no-one will realistacally have time to click opponent jungler when getting ganked by that jungler and figure out junglers runes before deciding how to react to that gank.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cryst4","name":"t1_chvolis","parent_id":"t1_chvnijj","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1401577410,"created_utc":1401548610}

{"body":"Yeah, but you want to know he can crit before he actually crits you. Because how I understand it he got killed by crit and the reason he got killed was because he miscalculated how much damage that guy could do since he didn't know before that crit that he had crit chance.		The whole point is to know everything your opponent has BEFORE you have to fight him so you can adjust your actions, positioning etc. correctly. It's cool to know opponent has crit in his runes WHEN he crits you but if you didn't know that and positioned like he wouldn't have crit it's too late at that point. So my point was that if qtpie would have checked that guy's runes before the game even started he at least would have known that guy had crit chance before getting killed by it and maybe, just maybe could have expected it.		Also I would like to remind you that it doesn't have to be third party program. Someone can still search him in league client itself etc. To me I don't see much difference between naming rune pages to spoilers or just straight up saying spoilers in chat. After all playing a game of league is your own choice just like looking someone's profile in client or in 3rd party program.		I do agree that he has every right to name runepages as spoilers just like he would have every right to write spoilers in game chat. At least as far as I know neither is punishable. However I disagree by him having right to name runepages however he wants since I would assume there is somewhat similar rules to runepage names as there are for your summoner name etc. Maybe not as much enforced, but I would assume riot wouldn't look too kindly someone naming they're runepages offensively or in a racist way etc.		Also you seem to make big point of this 3rd party programs which is weird since you can do same for client and sometimes when I play I find that while my game is open I can alt tab and my client is still open and I can use it so I could use that to do it too instead of 3rd party program. Also I don't know about advantage over him since like already discussed eariler you see peoples rune pages in many other occasions than when you are actually in game with them.		I also find weird that you are stating that 80% are dickheads. By no means I think that is accurate statistic that you would have taken and it also begs the question of what is interpertation of a dickhead. I would say that during my time playing the game I have found that majority of players are actually more or less decent people. I wouldn't count in anyone who I have played once with since I don't think you can reliably judge if someone is totally, overall dickhead by having only one game with them. Of course if you definition of dickhead is everyone who has ever been rude once in their life then yes I would actually say that probably more than 80%, me included.		But about the OP I would say he isn't any more or less jerk/asshole etc. than anyone who would spoil something any other way. Saying in chat/having spoiling summoner name etc etc. 		Personally I think that is kinda childish and bit jerky move although I wouldn't personally care about spoilers since there's not really anything anyone could realistcally spoil from me since I don't watch GoT or any other TV Series etc.		It just seems like he would be guy who would get flamed and the flame back or whatever and justify it by "defending himself". Like both should still get report equally. 		Also the thing that those 3rd party programs in question or using client while playing are both allowed by Riot so the are essentially more or less part of the game. So I don't really get what the OP is is exactly mad about. It seems like he wants to make everyone play, not by rules set by riot, but rules set by him. And one's not following his rules that he has set that the might not even know of are being punished by him doing this asshole move to them. Or if it's not asshole move then I guess someone writing spoilers to game chat or reddit or whatever is not asshole move either since it's not really that much different.		I would agree that if Riot would have stated these 3rd party programs or checking runes from client to be not allowed then that would be completely okay thing to do, but since they are allowed it is part of the game.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cryst4","name":"t1_chvuxvw","parent_id":"t1_chvow1z","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1401594489,"created_utc":1401565689}
