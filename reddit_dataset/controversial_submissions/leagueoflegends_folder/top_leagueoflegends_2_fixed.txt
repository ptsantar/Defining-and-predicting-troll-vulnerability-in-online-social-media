It'd be like if a lemonade stand made $100 dollars of profit a day and then decided to invest that money into making a orange juice stand, buying oranges to make the orange juice consumed the profit but everyday the lemonaide stand made a profit.

But you're arguing they don't have plenty of money and haven't made a profit off league of legends yet. League of Legends itself has made a profit, Riot games has reinvested that profit into esports, esports is a luxury for a gaming company like Riot and they do have plenty of money because they can easily change how big of venues/setups/prizes/etc should the game itself need some which goes back to my original point that you were arguing against, that riot has the money to make the game as good as they want to... they are just happy with the game the way it is and are putting that money into esports instead.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tryphikik","name":"t1_ccpzizm","parent_id":"t1_ccpzb0h","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1381571215,"created_utc":1381542415}

While you can still find some on eBay (most still highly overpriced), Charizards are no longer printed. Those particular skins were no longer sold. Definitely similar. 		Though not as rare as the hype, there were still only a specific number printed. There was no limitation on skin quantities. Similar. Both were limited by time, though you can re-sell a Charizard.

The series of Charizard changes the function of the deck.

And as you mentioned, I think that giving you the loading screen watermarks is a fantastic job to give the sense of exclusivity while simultaneously making it possible for skins like Snow Bunny Nidalee to show up in more than 1 out of every 100K games. With this feature in play, I literally don't understand any reason to hold hostile feelings towards Riot. You still have your exclusivity.		To your question, I didn't play at release, but I had started playing the game around fall of 2010. I didn't play it as regularly as I do now but I was in my learning stages. I was mostly focused on SCII at the time. And believe me, I understand the "I helped make this" sentiment; I was a Vanilla WoW player. I know all too well what it's like to have a company give away things that previously took hours and hours of effort to get. Now *that* was something to get upset about.

You spent somewhere between five and one-hundred and seventy dollars US because you thought something would be "rare" but not because you actually liked it and it wasn't a fucking antique that you intended to re-sell at some point for profit?		That defeats the entire purpose of skins; they're art and you're supposed to buy the ones that are appealing to you; not the ones you think you can use to be cool and special later.  You guys are the fucking hipsters of this game's community.		Are most of you that juvenile that you're butthurt because someone else can get your video game character skin?  Face it, when you play a god damn game with millions of players, you're not unique unless you're a ranked ladder god in competitive or PvE in an mmo with that sort of content and even then, you're only unique in "status" because of your accomplishments, not because you spent a few dollars when other people didn't/couldn't/weren't playing yet.		I own several of those limited skins and I'm just glad they're giving me RP for them and a summoner icon; I don't need anything else.  		On a final note, directed at the people saying they "invested" in Riot by buying these skins back then - get over yourself, you didn't help them become established with that amount and you aren't the reason they expanded - you (like me) just helped them to confirm that players liked the ability to change the look of their characters and that holiday and event-themed skins were positively-received.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Carryusdarius","name":"t1_ccpjrxu","parent_id":"t1_ccpj68v","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1381527751,"created_utc":1381498951}

{"body":"I do not own any limited skins myself,  but here is why I do not like Riot bringing back these limited skins (or their compensation):		* You can say Riot compensated those who owned the skins because they effectively got it for free, but I know if I invested my $ on those skins that I thought would be limited-time only, I would put my value on its complete exclusivity. I know I am not the only one, because think about limited edition stuff in real life (that's not beanie babies and the like). Nothing will ever be proper compensation because, well, that's just how limited-edition stuff are. Nothing is supposed to "match" their value.	* Riot says they do not believe that skins should be limited at all, basically available to all because they are a form of self expression. I quote:		> We think it’s important to solve this, especially since we believe skins are primarily about self-expression and fun, not exclusivity.		If that's what they really think, then don't they allow all skins to be bought by all, even Triumphant Ryze or Victorious Jarvan? They're about fun and self-expression, right? Yeah, they are but my next point:		* These skins have no function in the game, and it's normal for there to be limited-edition stuff. There's no problem with this, I don't see why Riot worded it as there would be a problem for players just because they are limited. It's not as if it's a limited edition tier 4 rune that's OP (as other games may have their limited-edition items to be like). I'm not going to lie when I say the return of these skins are motivated by $, and if I bought a limited edition skins, I know I would be **pissed**.		> Everyone being butthurt about this must be kids.

{"body":"I started playing league right around the Poppy patch in January/February of 2010 after a buddy who had been in open beta got me hooked. I was pretty casual about it back then, didn't spend much money on the game at first, didn't get too worked up about skins.		I don't own any of the affected limited skins, despite having been playing for 3 1/2 years. I have a few of the more common legacy skins (nightmare Cho-Gath, Yellow Jacket Shen) but I only own 1 "white whale" skin, my beloved "Urf the Manatee Warwick".		Why do I mention all this? Well I think it puts me in a pretty good position to comment on the current situation because I fall kind of on both sides. Now that I play much more regularly than I did 3 years ago, part of me is very excited to get a shot at owning some pretty awesome skins that I didn't really pay attention to when they first came out. There are skins coming out again that I have been intensely jealous of, and I really want to buy. 		At the same time, I think what has happened really kinda sucks. Exclusivity is cool, it's something to be proud of and sought after. It's a badge of honor, and for good reason. Some of the newer players seem to get offended at this notion, that the players that own these limited skins somehow think they are "better" than the newer players simply "because they spent $3 on a skin first". I think this is very misguided. Older summoners should be proud of their experience, regardless of skill, and Riot should be proud of them. 		Most of you that read this post will likely be better at League than I am. I've spent 3 1/2 years playing this game, and yet I started Season 3 firmly in Bronze and have only recently clawed my way up to the land of Silver 1. I'm not very good. I realize this. Having a special skin doesn't change that fact. However, League of Legends wouldn't be the game it is today, and Riot wouldn't be where it is as a company without the loyalty and money of those early summoners who joined this game, fell in love with it, got their friends to join, and spent their money on a game they truly enjoyed. This is why I have a problem with the re-release of the skins.		I was a cheapskate when I first started playing league. Sure I got more than a handful of friends to join, and I did buy a few skins here and there, but in general, I saved my money and enjoyed the "free-to-play" aspect of the game. Because of this, I missed out on a lot of the more exclusive skins that I could have easily gotten my hands on. A lot of players weren't cheap though. A lot of players spent their money supporting a new game and a new company. They were rewarded for that early loyalty with some pretty sweet skins that weren't available to the masses of gamers that eventually joined the ranks. They wear these skins as badges of honor, regardless of skill level. 		Limited skins are one of the only indicators as to how long a certain summoner has been playing and supporting League. I still get excited whenever I see King Rammus pop up in a game. My buddy who got me into the game treasures his UFO Corki, and I have gotten some of my biggest smiles from the comments I still get when I bring out Urf the Manatee. The most recent time I played with him a fellow summoner likened it to seeing a Kangaskhan in Pokemon. I realize that these skins all will currently remain untouched, but I know players that take a lot pride in their limited skins, not because it makes them better than any of the newer summoners, but because it's a badge of honor that shows just how long they have been invested in this game and in this company. 		I understand this decision is sort of a no-brainer for Riot. They make a ton of money on work they have already done, new loyal players get skins they have always longed for, and they have even tried to compensate original holders of the limited skins. I wish they hadn't gone this route though. It feels a little bit like they have taken away some of what made this game special from the gamers that have been with them and supported them the longest.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"steadfast1558","name":"t1_ccpnfeq","parent_id":"t3_1o7qis","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1381538171,"created_utc":1381509371}

{"body":"As an owner of several vintage skins I fully support this decision. The fact of the matter is their "promise" of this being limited availability was a terrible idea and came from an era when League was a completely different animal. You have to realize that when most of these skins came out League was TINY (relatively speaking), I mean we're talking like 1/50th of the user base, their revenues were nowhere near what they are now, and they were still fledglings as a company in general. I'd be surprised if ANY business decisions/plans/whatever they made back then would be even remotely applicable to the game today given the massive change in scale.		And let's be honest, plenty of these skins are not of amazing quality (blitzcrank with a jersey! ezreal with a jersey! I mean come on, toboggan corki was a *legendary* and is nowhere near up to snuff for a legendary), plenty were just recolors, and plenty were terribly unpopular when they were available.		I really don't see this is as a case of "omg Riot is LIARS", it's not as if there was some malicious intent behind their original promise to try and dick people out of money (obviously, given the refunds people are getting). It was just a shit decision made by a company that had no idea what their game was going to turn in to.

{"body":"OP I'd love to hear your thoughts on this:		I think you're showing a bit of a lack of compassion. Let me explain a bit of a different angle on this.		I started playing this game in beta. I played DotA for 7 years before that, and I fell in love with this game. They made improvements on mechanics of the core game, a lot of what I liked was still there, all good things. As a financially stable young adult, I wanted to support this game going places.		Well, Riot came to me and said, we want you to support it too! We'll promise you, early backer, that you can show off your early supporting self by buying these skins that will *never be available again*.		Fast forward to today, my dreams have come true. They're playing this game in the Staples Center, broadcasting live to millions. The game is MUCH more stable here in NA (sorry EU folks, not sure what the deal is there but be patient, keep the faith) than it was in 2009. They're making active strides to make players more civil with one another, and the game is still super fun to play with friends.		But that promise Riot made to me about those skins I bought? They decided that wasn't worth as much as what they could make by selling these skins to everyone.		Personally, I'm still getting a nod that I was there, backing early, with the loading screen watermark, I'm getting an RP refund, and Riot is succeeding. So I'm not too upset.		But do I understand why others are upset their trust is being betrayed? That, as a reward for their early loyalty, a promise is being broken? Yeah, I totally understand why some people are upset about it. I'm a bit disappointed myself, but I'll get over it.		Don't belittle others just because you don't understand where they're coming from though. Early players have a right to be upset at this news, and I personally would appreciate at least an apology from Riot that they're breaking their promise to me and the other early skin purchasers that helped get them where they are today.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FrozenStorm","name":"t1_ccpqonp","parent_id":"t3_1o7qis","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","subreddit_id":"t5_2rfxx","created":1381546240,"created_utc":1381517440}

{"body":"I'm going to be rude and say, I understand why riot is doing this. You start a game and put out a couple skins say that "If you buy them now, you'll be the only ones with them. you'll be really cool, and you'd be showing your loyalty to a game that we're trying really hard to get off the ground." Quite a couple buy them, maybe...500,000-1,000,000 I have no real numbers. So time goes on, those skins remain rare. Then some new players join, like...30 times the current playerbase. and they're looking at all the skins and theres just that one skin that they can't get....there taking up space, can't get it or nothing. Maybe some dudes got a boner for Veigar and has like 5/6 skins, and would buy that last one in a heartbeat. Some might call him, devoted. 		   So, its 2-3 years down the line, your games playerbase has gone up 3000% and perhaps you've lost some of that minority to time, or other games/MoBAs. And you've got new blood. These devoted people with money. They'd blow it all even if they were told the skins were coming back again, simply because they like the skin. Would you turn that money down? You could call them hitler, or fucking corporate scum or something, but we're talking about a LOT of money being raked in. AND more skin diversity. Maybe I'm not up there in the +2,500 game wins area, but I almost never seen these skins, (Though I will say the last time I saw a Pumpkinhead Fiddle was about 3 weeks ago, I was scared at the load in screen, and scared end game when he was 21/8/14 and had carried his whole team.) Beyond that one event I've seen...8 or 9 of those skins. They're far too rare. 		That said, those original devotees blindly trusting a game should be given more than a pretty cool Icon, a banner, a special art change that shows they're still special, and the money they spent of the skin. they got to get....more RP. That last part sounded sarcastic, but I mean it. Oh or you know what'd be cool? A really bad ass gold frame around the skin art itself that shows the date of purchase at the bottom. I'm serious, that'd be...well really flashy, but equally really damn awesome.

Last time they tried to do this was when they announced that they were raising the price of Surprise Party Fiddlesticks. They had previously promised that SPF would remain on permanent sale, and the community made them revert their decision to raise the price. This is no different.	- The compensation feels pretty weak. Refunding RP is the bare minimum, and I don't think most people will even use the new summoner icon. The loading screen watermark is a great way to differentiate those who came first from those who did not, but that on its own just feels inadequate. 		On the other hand		- It's pretty silly that I have played thousands of games in the last (almost) two years and still have never even *seen* the majority of these skins.	- A substantial number of accounts that hold Limited Edition skins now sit dormant and inactive, awaiting the possible eventual return of their owners.

On one hand it's fair for everyone to at least get one chance to buy the skin they always wanted, on the other hand it's unfair to the people who bought the skin thinking it would be extremely unique. In the end though, the first group is much much much larger than the second, which makes this a logical move by Riot.		However this post is just stupid. "Grow some maturity please!" ??? You show zero respect for people who don't like this, even though I'm sure you understand their reasoning.

If they had just stuck to their guns with a hard line of "No, these skins will never be available again, just like we said when they were released" then this would not be an issue.		Instead they hint at some genius marketing where everyone will be happy, they are going to reimburse current owners (which as is constantly brought up is way less than 1% of player base) and then re-release old skins at planned dates to ensure maximum income.		The new skins that are being brought out are unbelievably cool and obviously take a lot of time/money to design.
