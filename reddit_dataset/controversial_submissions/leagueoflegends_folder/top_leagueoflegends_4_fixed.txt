Problem is, as first pick you are VERY likely to get counter picked and so we have the worst player picking a champ and getting reasonably counter picked. This usually results in a heavy defeat. Whereas the mmr system would attempt to solve this by letting the 'better' players pick whatever and would be more experienced to deal with counter picks.

The problem is that Masters is too easy to get into and basically people who were in low Diamond are now in Masters as well because it only really takes a few games win streak to get in promos.		So the skill gap is really high, it's basically the skill gap from low D1 to high D1 before Masters league, but before Masters you never got queued with players who were below 50 LP (unless they were smurf accounts or dropped due to inactivity or whatever).

I could just as easily say the 5th pick is the best player in a random silver solo queue game because they might have been on a losing streak because his internet has been shitty recently, but he recently go a new provider and will wreck this game to make up for those past losses from packet loss. I could also discover that first pick might of had his cousin playing for him the last few matches and he really is the worse of the group.		MMR between the 10 players (unless a duo queue with two players of vastly different MMR compared to their elo) has very little impact on a game for the average player.
