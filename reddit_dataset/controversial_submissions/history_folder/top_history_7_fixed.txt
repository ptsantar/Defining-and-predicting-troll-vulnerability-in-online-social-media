{"body":"The dude's response video is awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iLTA43MBuA	The debunking video just seems like a case of sour grapes, mixed with a pseudo-commercial for the lady who made it.","depth":0,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GoodMerlinpeen","name":"t1_cs85v9z","parent_id":"t3_3a0ecz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1434445089,"created_utc":1434441489}
{"body":"ugh...stopped it at the third time it cut to the hipster making air quotes.		what a non-story. 		theres skepticism, and there's just acting like a college freshman home on break who, 'just cant even..' deal with how no one's as smart as they are.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Parade_Precipitation","name":"t1_cs858hi","parent_id":"t3_3a0ecz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1434442633,"created_utc":1434439033}
{"body":"Is this the video where they do as little research as possible to "disprove" him? 			It was like a wiki-warrior YouTube video.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cs86ktr","parent_id":"t3_3a0ecz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1434448075,"created_utc":1434444475}
{"body":"Okay, this person is talking out of their ass.		First they say that pictures aren't reliable sources of information (honestly probably a fair point) then they go on to say how archers DID practice on stationary targets BECAUSE ALL THESE PICTURES SHOW THAT THEY DID.		So are pictures reliable or AREN'T THEY???		I'll go ahead and ignore everything in this video.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PhD_in_internet","name":"t1_cs87mr9","parent_id":"t3_3a0ecz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1434452911,"created_utc":1434449311}
{"body":"This video is exceptionally helpful as it actually references  primary sources, whilst all Lars Anderson achieves is essentially trick shooting. The greatest injury to an understanding of history is not the perpetuation of false-hoods, but the absence of countering arguments.","depth":0,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ByzantineBasileus","name":"t1_cs84e7d","parent_id":"t3_3a0ecz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1434439774,"created_utc":1434436174}

{"body":"Yea, they don't look at the source materials. If I recall correctly they use a screen shot from his video as their only reference for one source to say it doesn't say what he claims.		They're wiki-warriors in video form. They onto research enough to find something they think disproves what he says. Maybe that dude is wrong, but I won't take the word of a bunch of non-experts who don't even do proper research. 		What a joke.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cs86puq","parent_id":"t1_cs862m6","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1434448701,"created_utc":1434445101}
