{"body":"From the [top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/2y1wr9/was_there_an_israelite_exodus_out_of_egypt/cp5na13) by /u/Atanar when this was put on /r/Archaeology a month ago (edit:Wiki link wasn't working properly from parenthesis in link):		This article is 100% religious agenda, with deliberate misrepresentation of the case. **All apologetics, no science.**		>The case against the historicity of the exodus is straightforward, and its essence can be stated in five words: a sustained lack of evidence.		That is wrong, because there is enough positive evidence that the Israelites are a composite nation of tribes which were native to Judea. Additionally, there are plenty of hints within the torah that it's a made-up story, the similarity of the baby Sargon and baby Moses story just being one example.		>More generally, there is a limit to what we can expect from the written record of ancient Egypt.		That's why we have archaeology. People leave their trash behind. Whole nations of people are not likely to leave not one shard of pottery behind.		>In fact, many major events reported in various ancient writings are archaeologically invisible. The migrations of Celts in Asia Minor, Slavs into Greece, Arameans across the Levant???all described in written sources???have left no archeological trace.		Just plain wrong. Again, just one example, I don't want to waste all my time on this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatians_(people)#Tribes		>migrants are by definition nomadic.		Israelites in Egypt are supposed to be sedentary. How else could they mark their doors with lamb blood? And it's hardly possible for elites to get wandering people to participate in public building projects, like the work of brick-making suggests.		>Is this because conquest is usually accompanied by destruction? Not really: the biblical books of Joshua and Judges, for instance, tell of a gradual infiltration into the land of Israel, with only a small handful of cities said to have been destroyed.		We have some of those, and we excavated some of those. The accounts in the torah and actual findings match the time the torah was written, not when the supposed conquest took place. For example, Jericho didn't even have defensive walls in the late bronze age.		>Many details of the exodus story do appear to reflect the realities of ancient Egypt.		We aren't even given the Pharaohs name, for crying out loud. The description of Egypt cannot even fit the realities of the supposed time, because back then Egypt controlled most of the Levant! The exodus account(s) could only be written by someone ignorant of the extension of the New Kingdom of Egypt.		>Why is the figure of 600,000 fighting-age males so wildly out of sync with so many other elements in the Torah???s desert account?		Because it matches the definition of "legend", that's why. But it's nice that we get the acknowledgement that the numbers in the torah are wildly out of place, but you could have come to that conclusion easier, physically impossible ages should have been a hint.		**I just realized how long the article is, and how much I would have to write to refute everything wrong in it.** I'll just leave this for the first half of part I.		In total, this article violates the rules since it de facto declares the current consensus to be some kind of conspiracy.","depth":0,"score":35,"ups":35,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ZhouLe","name":"t1_cq2uibh","parent_id":"t3_31lf68","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1428324077,"created_utc":1428320477}

{"body":"Being an amateur Egyptologist, the Exodus story is an interesting one. Probably one of the worst anachronisms is the belief that Exodus took place during the rule of Ramesses 2, The Great. In fact, it took place centuries earlier. When Kathleen Kenyon excavated Jericho in the mid 1950's she revolutionized archaeology by using highly structured, detailed and recorded methods, which eventually got her knighted.		What she found was that using C-14 dating, that Jericho was Not occupied during the time of Ramesses 2, the 13th C. BC, but only earlier during the Tchehudimosid dynasty. Further, the name of Moses was spelled with an "o" and by the ReMESsid dynasty it was an "e". And the excavation of Hazor and other cities related to have been destroyed or taken by Joshua, viz. those which can be ID'd with certainty, showed much the same.		The biggest current myth is that Exodus took place during the Ramessid time, when it in fact it likely took place during early in the 17th Dynasty. The eruption of Thera was likely the source of the plagues, including the 3 days where it was as night at noon and the "dust" which created skin sores, surprisingly similar to that found in the last few centuries in the eruptions of Krakatoa and other calderic eruptions. The Eruptions of Thera were a series of lesser eruptions until the final, climactic eruption took place, which killed so many. Interesting enough, Theran ash which is characteristic for Thera, was found in the Egyptian Mediterranean costal lake deposits levels at just that time, too. So we know Theran ash rained down on Northern Egypt, just as many of the plagues also only affected northern Egypt.		Wilson talks about these rather serious contradictions to the belief it took place during Ramesses 2 reign IN his book on "Exodus, the True Story".		As far as the  heqa khaseshet, the foreign princes, Or Hyksos as the Brits and Greeks had cobbled the name's spelling to, they were a Canaanite people who took over after the weaknesses of the collapse of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. They shared common names with the Hapiru, the Hebrew, who ARE mentioned by the Pharoanic Egyptians of the time. Those  heqa khaseshet kings were named "Ba'al"  "Iakob", and so forth. Interestingly enough, Ahmose was THE pharoanic king at about that time, and Amos is also Hebrew, note the "o" of the Djehudimosid dynasty, a common Hebrew name, as well, as were others, viz. Sethi.		For some reason, saying that the Israelites left during the Exodus at the site of Pi-ramesses has clouded the issue. IN earlier times that site was known as Avaris, the  heqa khaseshet capital, and so that fits pretty well. & then there is the stela of Kamose, brother of the Pharoah Ahmose, the first of the Djehudimosid Dynasty,who states, "I caused 100K familes of the Hekuset to leave northern Khemet", again a number which agrees with the Exodus number, too. This was when the upper Egyptians at last drove out the  heqa khaseshet from northern Egypt. There is some evidence at that time that in Canaan, there was very large influx of people, too.		So, actually, the Exodus is a lot more interesting and complicated than it once looked. Could discuss what happens to the sun when the sky is very smoky as it was during the time of the Exodus, which creates a very red sun, which many of us have seen during smoky air from very large wildfires, locally, or regionally. & where the red Nile came from, but will not.		It's an interesting subject, actually. And if we are to believe Prince Kamose, it very likely occurred. Just NOT exactly in the way it has been traditionally believed in, without concurrent and more evidence.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"herbw","name":"t1_cq335cj","parent_id":"t1_cq2uoqr","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1428342564,"created_utc":1428338964}
{"body":"> Further, the name of Moses was spelled with an "o" and by the ReMESsid dynasty it was an "e".		If you had any clue about egyptian hieroglyphs, you'd know that this makes no sense. That's discussing the difference between M_s_ and M_s_. 		>The Eruptions of Thera were a series of lesser eruptions until the final, climactic eruption took place, which killed so many.		You pulled that out of thin air. There is no geology method that could verify such a claim, months, even years, would be within the error margin if you tried to date consecutive eruptions.		Trying to make the Hyksos fit in the bible is a terrible mistake that can only speak of ignorance or willful deceit. They established sovereignty in a part of the Nile delta, and were expelled via war. We know [many details about them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyksos), but none of that is compatible with the bible account. The identification has been a scientific dead end for over half a century now.		The rest of your argument falls within the same criticism: Vaguely alike sounding words are terrible evidence.  	On the assumption that you are unwilling and unable to defend your claims within the use of scientific methodology I'll leave it with that.  		The case for the historical Exodus has been long lost, it's consensus between archaeologists that it never happened and was later made up, and if you don't accept that you are willfully ignorant.","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Atanar","name":"t1_cq393ql","parent_id":"t1_cq335cj","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1428351805,"created_utc":1428348205}

The people who immigrated from Egypt would have mixed with the people they found. Of course there are elements that parallel other myths. No one [here] is saying that this is a purely historic narrative, only that it likely contains an element of history in it.		*That's why we have archaeology. People leave their trash behind. Whole nations of people are not likely to leave not one shard of pottery behind.*		Various Asiatic pottery has been found in Egypt, and Egyptian pottery in Israel and the Levant. If a proto-Israelite group left Egypt for Canaan, would they have produced a pottery that would be recognized as distinctive? We aren't talking about a huge "nation."		*Just plain wrong. Again, just one example, I don't want to waste all my time on this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatians_(people)#Tribes*		That is one example, but how can you argue that all migrations of ancient history are known through archaeology? That is obviously ridiculous.		*Israelites in Egypt are supposed to be sedentary. How else could they mark their doors with lamb blood? And it's hardly possible for elites to get wandering people to participate in public building projects, like the work of brick-making suggests.*		To go by Exodus, they are mainly sedentary slaves in Egypt, and then they become desert nomads for a substantial period.		Jericho did have walls in the Bronze Age	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho#Bronze_Age		Ancient Egyptians referred to the Pharaoh as "Pharaoh"		Numbers of soldiers are probably inflated in most ancient texts that mention them, sometimes wildly so.
