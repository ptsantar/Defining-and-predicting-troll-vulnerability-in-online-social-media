{"body":"The American antislavery movement included a trend of taking the lyrics of popular songs and rewriting them to attack slavery and those who defended it. Samuel Francis Smith's song, written in 1831, was rewritten in 1843 by A. G. Duncan and published in "Antislavery Melodies: for The Friends of Freedom" edited by Jarius Lincoln. I couldn't find many versions of the song performed with these lyrics, so I decided to do it myself. Would love some feedback!

{"body":"Absolutely chilling. Great performance, you have incredible tone especially in your upper register. The story behind this was incredibly moving as well.		Just my two cents, but I had a point of feedback from a production standpoint. Perhaps you felt it was monotonous to sing multiple verses without adding something, hence the third and fourth layer of harmony. However, in my opinion it was a bit heavy towards the end, particularly with the bgvs not being as far behind the lead in terms of mix. 		Personally, I would have followed something maybe more like AB solo, AB solo, AB harmony AB 2nd harmony. I would have put the harmony and particularly the second harmony a teensy bit further back.  Your lead was incredibly compelling, and I think letting that sit out there a bit longer, and allowing it to resonate both emotionally and literally would have given this a bit more polish. 		If you were doing a piece with LESS substance, less poetic power, then I can see the layering and split screen being more of interest. For me it was just a bit busy for your message and the buoyancy of your lead.		Maybe it's my taste as a long time jazz vocalist and aficionado coming through, as leads rarely have heavy or multilayered bgvs in the classic genre.  But a vocal like yours, it's like Django playing his solo on Nuages. Let it just sit. The silence and the substance is absolutely enough. Ella and Joe Pass' recordings (in particular "solitude") have that kind of almost painful pause and space in them, and that's what makes them so engaging. 		Vocals in my opinion are like design. White space is your friend, it's also necessary and part of the engagement for the viewer and in this case listener. You have a powerful interpretation ability and crazy range. Don't overdress it for dinner. What distinguishes singers with great chops from the kind of artists we remember for generations is 9/10 taste and interpretation, rather than just ability. 		Incredibly nice work overall, I hope the two cents doesn't offend.

{"body":"Right.		Kind of the beauty of singing your own backups was that it was supposed to be a very subtle art where people *might* pick up that you're doing your own backing vocals or harmonies but where the split is 25/25/25/25 four octaves of almost equal weight being sung together. 		I feel like what Mercury and Joel did was to sing their parts twice (sometimes exactly the same, sometimes in harmony) to achieve stereo effects. Elliott Smith did the exact same thing on many of his recordings (and would also play guitar parts twice over one another to get a more impressive sound from the left and right).		But yeah what he has done is effectively cloned himself to create a quartet (or trio, I wasn't paying attention enough after the screen kept splitting) and yeah, I think the way this has been done historically is very subtly and in a way that nobody would really know except the guys in the production room and mixing/post production.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brightest-night","name":"t1_cssacoj","parent_id":"t1_css4y9d","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436048699,"created_utc":1436045099}
