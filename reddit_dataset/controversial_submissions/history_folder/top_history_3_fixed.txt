{"body":"Thanks, guys. I knew the Act of Union was during this period, but failed to take into account the effect on ensignage (if that's a word). 	Bangdazap's web link also answered the question I should have asked; what flag would an English ship be flying in the West Indies in 1700?		Thanks again.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fb97e4ad","name":"t1_csqzdlt","parent_id":"t1_csqw5uc","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435934733,"created_utc":1435931133}
{"body":"Between 1650 and 1707 there was no such thing as a 'British' Man-of-War so you're going to struggle to find a national ensign for that period - bangdazaps link should show the English ones for that period though, and I understand the Scottish flag was similar but with a saltire instead of a cross of St. George.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Eggiebumfluff","name":"t1_csq6o5b","parent_id":"t3_3bu311","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435868472,"created_utc":1435864872}
