{"body":"Nice idea, bad article.		  Mother Theresa didn't set out to alleviate poverty, and did no work in Africa. She spent most of her life in India, which is why she's called Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Also, she was not really concerned with AIDS, which she could not have assisted with much anyway given her views on contraception.		  Martin Luther King having affairs does not constitute a "dark side", and everybody knows why Mandela was imprisoned.		  Aristotle's views on women were completely consistent with those generally held in 4 century BCE Athens. There is nothing sinister about that, nor is there any reason for us to expect him to think any differently. While he influenced a mode of enquiry, anyone who has actually read Aristotle will know that he was wrong all the time by our standards.		  Roosevelt having a mistress? Big deal. That was pretty normal at the time. Have you ever seen a picture of Eleanor? Anyway, I wouldn't place him in the category of "history's favourite people".		  Columbus doesn't need to be on the list at all. He's not the favourite of anyone who actually knows anything about him.		  Franklin visiting brothels and Mozart's crude sense of humour? Not really dark sides, and pretty normal for their time.		  Kissinger and Churchill do/did have genuine "dark sides" that affected millions directly and billions indirectly.  It would be worth writing an article (or a series of books) focused solely on these two.		 EDIT: Newton could be described as the first modern scientist. Before his time, alchemy, philosophy and science were indistinguishable, and in many cases they continued to be for some time after his death. The fact that he had an interest in both is not really surprising, as he would not have made any distinction between the two. He was a man of learning, and both the search for the philosopher's stone and describing the motion of objects were perfectly legitimate and worthy pursuits at that time. Most early chemists were alchemists, and the knowledge they worked from came from earlier alchemical experimentation.","depth":0,"score":372,"ups":372,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Furthur_slimeking","name":"t1_ckyaloh","parent_id":"t3_2i2uga","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1412251329,"created_utc":1412247729}

Until then, it was basically legal in 1/3 of the United States.  To the point that several Presidents out and out refused to even pursue attempts to get rid of it.   		Harry Truman had more credibility with the Southern states because he was from Missouri, rather than a purely northern state.    Credibility that FDR (New York), Coolidge (Massachusetts), Harding (Ohio) or Wilson (New Jersey) lacked.  So Truman was able to break some aspects of the solid south and get enough Southerns to follow his lead as to ban things like Lynching.  		And even then it wasn't via a new law, but just a reinterpretation of murder statues.  		If 99.9% of the population believes something, every politician in the country will do their bidding.  Clinton didn't get removed from office in the 90's because most of the country was against impeachment.   If a majority had been in favor of it, even just 50.01%... the Republicans would have found a way to get the Senate to vote for removal.   The House still impeached him.   Stupid as that was.   		You Really think any politician in American history would have stood up to 99.9% of the people on anything?    65% maybe somebody like FDR, Lincoln or Washington would.

So why did she go to Calcutta?  Seriously, did you think she went there just to twiddle her thumbs?  Mother Theresa was running hospices - literally houses for the dying where people went when they had no where else to go.  She did not invent these places, but greatly expanded their use.  She created homes so that the impoverished people might have the chance to spend their last few days in relative comfort, surrounded by people who cared for them.  But according to you that does not count as "alleviating their suffering".  Yeah, she sounds like a real monster.		>Her brand of Catholicism holds that suffering brings one closer to God		This is massively exaggerated by Hitchens and co.  Critics try to claim that she intentionally and actively prevented any use of painkillers in the hospices.  This completely ignores the point that due to the lingering problems of the Opium trade, opiates were subject to absurd restrictions in India, and were poorly supplied in hospitals, let alone hospices.  As late as 2001, researchers were commenting that pain relief was a relatively new treatment in much of India.  Yeah there were some issues with proper treatment and medical hygiene these facilities - probably due to the fact that they were run by volunteers, usually nuns, with very little medical training.  Regardless, they still provided comfort and support to countless people, who would have died alone without them.		>The fact that most of her "patients" were Muslim or Hindu didn't seem to cross her mind.		It did cross her mind, and she was extremely respectful to these people.    They were given the last rites of their religion; Muslims read the quran and Hindus were brought water from the Ganges.

Hitchens has nothing to do with this. If you're attempting to suggest that her brand of catholicism was in any way progressive then you're deluding yourself. Her beliefs and devotional practices are from a different time, before the post-war doctrinal reforms. Her belief structure would have had more in common with 17th century, counter reformation catholicism than modern catholicism. This is a simple matter of religious history.		>  Yes, this horrible woman who "did nothing" by treating countless sick people and didn't discriminate on basis of religion even though being extremely religious herself.		  You said yourself that she didn't treat them. Her views of death and suffering, which were the motivations behind her mission, were not the same as those of her patients. Interestingly, Catholicism does not suggest that non-Catholics cannot enter heaven. They can, but it becomes more difficult when they are aware of the church and choose not to join it. She was trying to save souls, not lives. This is plainly obvious and only had meaning to other catholics.			  She, when her time came, was afforded the best treatment available.

{"body":"A naive analysis of the list (I am not expert on any of these people, good chance I would be totally wrong on some).		Mother Teresa: Basically held out on the poor/sick thinking its God's will. She thought she was doing the right thing though. At worst can be thought of as "didn't help due to ignorance".		Mandela: Probably saw himself as communist revolutionary at the time. But still, crimes are crimes nonetheless. 		Martin Luther King: There was a lot of effort put into Smear Campaign against King. Like, he hired prostitutes, they were WHITE prostitutes, he got drunk and beat them, and wait... he used Church money to hire the prostitutes. Like someone was trying to portray a Black Civil Rights leader in the worst possible way. And including plagiarism, he can be thought of at worst as a Reposter.		Einstein: It's to do with his personal life. Must have had his own reasons.		Newton: It seems laughable now that a scientist tried to create Philosopher's Stone. But things were vastly different before fundamentals of Chemistry were understood.		Aristotle: Seems like a mysogynist today. But at his time, the society's views were quite different (not justifying it).		Roosevelt: So, he had an affair. Its only his and his wife's business. No reason why a president who has a mistress has to be bad for the nation.		Caravaggio: Artists often experience ups and downs of life more severely than most people. And there's a huge percetage of artists known to frequent prostitures (e.g. Wilde). Adds up.		Columbus: No justification. He was truly a cunt it apprears.		Mozart: Most shocking of all (as he's seen as 'refined' artist based on his compositions), but then again, to each their own.
