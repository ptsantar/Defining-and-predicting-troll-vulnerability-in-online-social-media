{"body":">heavy drinking, 		Just to pick on this example; pretending the 2000s+ are somehow notable for heavy drinking is very wrong. In the early part of the 19th century, [average alcohol consumption reached about 4 gallons of pure alcohol annually](https://books.google.ca/books?id=2AUH0vchHRIC&q=pint+of+whiskey+a+day#v=snippet&q=pint%20of%20whiskey%20a%20day&f=false) - a level it has never approached since (it averaged about 2 gallons for most of the 20th century). In the early 19th century, "temperate drinking" was considered to be merely 6 oz of whiskey a day. Today that would be considered being a serious alcoholic. 		Drinking levels in the US today are, overall, [some of the lowest they've ever been](http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/usa.pdf). They haven't gone up notably in anyone's lifetime. In fact, they've been falling since the 1980s, down from about 10 litres/year to 8.7 litres/year. 		Either in long-run historical terms, or even recent terms, there's nothing too notable about drinking in the US today. It's actually fairly low by most measurements.","depth":0,"score":48,"ups":48,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fencerman","name":"t1_csjj9kx","parent_id":"t3_3b662s","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435339088,"created_utc":1435335488}

{"body":"I'm not sure I agree with your assessment of makes the millenial era so hedonistic. (It might be, I just disagree with your reasoning)		Selfies- people have been taking selfies since the invention of the camera. The advent of a camera in your pocket and social media is unlike anything we have experienced before. Humans like to look at themselves, now they can do it a of the time. It might be narcissistic, but I don't think it is hedonistic. 		Twerking- "Twerking" is (arguably and unfortunately) just a new dance style. Throughout history new dance styles and music are almost always looked upon negatively by the older generations. Twerking is no more hedonistic now than dancing the twist in a polka dot skirt was in the 1950's.		Yolo- The premise of "you only live once" is, I would agree, a hedonistic concept. That being said, it is a common theme through human history. Off the top of my head I can think of "carpe diem" originally from the late 1st venture BCE but gained popularity in the 1990s and a song by Frank Sinatra called "I'm gonna live till I die". I'm sure some research would yield a similar "yolo" concept in nearly every generation of human history. 		Alcohol/drug use- I think Marijuana legalization has nothing to do with hedonism. It is am issue of individual rights. Alcohol is a constant throughout human and American history, but unfortunately we don't have much historical drinking data from all of American history. Especially detailed reports since in thus case I would be more interested in binge drinking, not your casual one beer a night drinker. I'm going to do some research when I get home to see what data I can find on drinking levels.		In summary, I think if there were a way to quantifiable measure hedonism, it would be relatively constant with only small changes. It just manifests itself in different ways.		TL; DR young people like dancing and drinking etc. Old people are cranky. It's about as constant as death and taxes.","depth":0,"score":73,"ups":73,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FinallyNotGawking","name":"t1_csjacqc","parent_id":"t3_3b662s","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435321469,"created_utc":1435317869}

Right now it's absolutely not the case. My generation actually works really hard, by most metrics just as hard as any other country and jumps through as many hoops as any generation from ours.
