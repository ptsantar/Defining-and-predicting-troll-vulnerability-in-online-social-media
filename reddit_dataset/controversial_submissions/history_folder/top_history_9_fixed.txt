{"body":"Anything with Buzzfeed's name attached to it needs to be examined with a grain of salt. They don't exactly make much effort to hide the fact that they like to revise history and push radical progressive attitudes. The body types depicted compared to the classical images in the backdrop don't actually match up. And I *really* wish people would put the, "BUT I'M WEARING THE SIZE MARILIN MONROE WORE!" demon to church. Dress sizes were held to a different scale back then. Even today what we understand as "obese" is different, even in a clinical sense. 			And it is worth pointing out that for many of these cultures had an entirely different problem than what we face today in western society- we have to worry about eating too much, they had to worry about too little. Fat as a symbol 1000 years ago was completely different than what it means today. 			And it is a bit racist to shove cultures under the rug. They want to have you believe that once you get past 200 AD or so everything was about a bunch of Europeans. I can understand that Ancient Greece was supplanted in the public consciousness of Europe in favor of, say, Victorian England, but Asia? The entire continent? Han Dynasty ends and suddenly they don't think anything?","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cob5f6x","parent_id":"t3_2urk5m","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1423076165,"created_utc":1423076165}

{"body":""healthy = beautiful as a general guideline"		That's right.	Very simplified, this is basically what the research on attractiveness says.		beautiful => looks healthy and 'of good quality' => if I have kids with this person, our kids would be more likely to survive		For instance, one factor that makes a body or face look beautiful is symmetry. Symmetry, in turn, is a signal for a good immune system.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sapientior","name":"t1_cobo9y2","parent_id":"t1_cob41gs","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1423107706,"created_utc":1423107706}
{"body":":) Yep, that about sums it up. Then again, from an artistic perspective I've come to appreciate the ages and stages of life. What's attractive doesn't have to be beautiful and vice versa. 		Usually, combining the elements of survival with eventual demise seem interesting to me. This is why I adore photographers who concern themselves with 'fringe elements'. Expose the beauty of old bodies, amputees, the terminally ill etc. A while back I visited a gallery with an expose which had as a theme those married for more than 50 yrs. Some even 70! These couples were photographed in many settings (intimate as well, go team great-grandparents!) It was among the most beautiful exposes I've been to and I've been to quite a few. 		I really believe the computer age is ruining our brain chemistry and development with its photoshopping (among other things).","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LadyAntipathy","name":"t1_coc4ijn","parent_id":"t1_cobo9y2","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1423154473,"created_utc":1423154473}

{"body":"In order to judge this, I think you have to distinguish between "attractive because it signals wealth/social status" and "attractive as in actually being sexually attractive/good looking".		When we talk about the ideal figure, we are talking about the second, not the first.		It is true that overweight can be a signal of wealth. The same is true for being tanned. In Europe in the 1700's it was the other way around: being pale was signal of wealth. If you were pale, this suggested wealth because you could afford to stay inside when almost everyone else had to work outside. 		However, these unconventional ideals of attractiveness are exceptions. They are specific to a culture and a time. When fashions change and it becomes possible to show your wealth or social status in other ways, the ideal reverts back to what people find sexually attractive.		What is good looking or sexually attractive, is mostly genetically determined and because of this it does not change much over time.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sapientior","name":"t1_cobntr5","parent_id":"t1_coazrxq","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1423106895,"created_utc":1423106895}

{"body":"This is anything but accurate: it looks like a deliberate attempt to deceive people into thinking that the ideal female figure was very different historically than it is today. In reality, the ideal hasn't changed much.   		* First, for this to be accurate, the figures in the historical pictures must be representative of the actual ideal of that time. Here, they are not. 		* Second, the remake photo must accurately reflect the historical picture. Here, they do not. If you look at the remake models, you will see that the historical ones are fatter than in the picture, but the contemporary ones are thinner.		According to the actual science on this, the (male) ideal of the female figure is a signal for health and the ability to reproduce. Consistently, this ideal has been found to be a waist-to-hip ratio of about 0,7. That means a thin figure. 		TL, DR: the Buzzfeed photos are not accurate. Instead they have been designed to make readers believe that the ideal female figure used to be fatter than today.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sapientior","name":"t1_cobmjoo","parent_id":"t1_coazfqd","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1423104614,"created_utc":1423104614}
