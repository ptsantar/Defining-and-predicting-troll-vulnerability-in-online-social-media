{"body":"I've researched and stumbled across this before.  I suspected the Portuguese had some easy early successes because the age of exploration seem to take off very quickly.  The reason being the age of exploration was linked to the age of exploitation from day one.  I'm American and I've recently been watching quite a bit of BBC tv lately.  They said the Tudors society were the first to get large scale access to sugar.  But it was still so expensive some people blackened their teeth on purpose to look like they had tooth decay because they wanted people to think they could afford to buy sugar on a regular basis.  I am curious though, on another show they said bee keeping and honey production was pretty common.  I'm curious how sugar production compared to honey production.   The other thing I've noticed is, based on portraits of people, it looks like that was about the same time people started to become overweight.   Recently I've started to get rid of all added sugar  in my diet.  No candy, baked goods, sauces, or ice cream.  I tried to get a bottle of salad dressing with just oil and vinegar, but they all had added sugar.  I have to make my own.   I've never felt better.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kennj123","name":"t1_cspfw0w","parent_id":"t3_3btn6h","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435807650,"created_utc":1435804050}
