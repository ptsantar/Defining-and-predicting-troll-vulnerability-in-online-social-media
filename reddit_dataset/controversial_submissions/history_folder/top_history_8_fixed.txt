{"body":"I totally disagree. The same thing happened in Germany after the Holocaust and it only led to a cult who hates his own history the most, it became some kind of making money with a mea culpa orgy.	Remembering is ok. Institutionalized forced remembering will only lead to self hate and monetary abuse of the topic.","depth":0,"score":18,"ups":18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SPLMN","name":"t1_csxbrfi","parent_id":"t3_3cn63e","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436448784,"created_utc":1436445184}

{"body":"The Iron Cross is a medal and sign a lot of German Jews wore proudly, a sign for the german military tradition which almost exists a thousand years. It was misused by the NS-dictatorship.

{"body":"I understand the German issue. I can't remember the world, it was long, but in the decades following Nazi Germany there was a real identity crisis.

{"body":"Not sure what that has to do with memorializing lynchings, but this focus on what Lincoln's personal motivations were isn't as relevant an issue as people make it out to be. The reason the South went to war was because new states were being created in which the Federal Government outlawed slavery, which in turn diluted the Southern states representation in congress while further endangering their right to own slaves and the health of a slave-driven agricultural economy. The reason the North went to war was to preserve the Union, and bring the Southern states back into the fold.

{"body":"I love the idea. I'm actually surprised they are not already there. However, it should not be "in response" to confederate memorials as the article kind of suggests. That seems way too tic for tack. Black people who were lynched were wronged. It was unjust, there is no denying that. The least we can do is put a plack on a rock to honor them. We have memorials for the Indians that were killed, we have memorials for Jewish people who died in the holocaust. Why is this any different? If you take that personal then that's on you.		We as people and we as a society make mistakes. We always have and we always will.

Around where I lived you were a christian, a conservative republican, and God knows you had an agenda against minorities you would only talk about with those you trusted. (mind you I am Canadian, grew up around Toronto so this is a very strange mentality to me). All I am saying, is even as far north as Pennsylvania, discrimination still stands and it is disgusting.
