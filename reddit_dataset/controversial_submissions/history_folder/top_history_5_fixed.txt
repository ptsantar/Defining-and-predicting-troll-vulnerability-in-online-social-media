{"body":"Well, actually some became narrower and spikier, and some evolved and became bigger and heavier into the halberd, partizan and similar big heavy axe/spear hybrids.		The early spears were cutting and stabbing weapons, and as armour improved they became heavier to cleave through that armour, and grew spikes to puncture it. The spears you speak of abandoned the cutting idea entirely and became pikes.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"drays","name":"t1_cqw26e5","parent_id":"t1_cqw05lz","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430582515,"created_utc":1430578915}

The Macedonian *Sarissa* is normally referred to as a spear, they were often over twenty feet long.		Pike and spear are essentially synonyms, and they mean 'spike on the end of a shaft'.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"drays","name":"t1_cqwnimc","parent_id":"t1_cqwn19n","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430627853,"created_utc":1430624253}

{"body":"First paragraph of the wikipedia article on the sarissa. Italics mine for emphasis:		The sarissa or sarisa (Greek: ????????????) was a long *spear* or pike about 4???7 metres (13???23 ft) in length used in ancient Greek and Hellenistic warfare. It was introduced by Philip II of Macedon and was used in his Macedonian phalanxes as a replacement for the earlier dory, which was considerably shorter. These longer *spears* improved the traditional strength of the phalanx by extending the rows of overlapping weapons projecting towards the enemy, and the word remained in use throughout the Byzantine years to sometimes describe the long *spears* of their own infantry.[1][2]","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"drays","name":"t1_cqws0nc","parent_id":"t1_cqwrhzv","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430642506,"created_utc":1430638906}
