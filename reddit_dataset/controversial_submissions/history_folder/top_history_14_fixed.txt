{"body":"Lollander here. We think of this concept as a double-edged sword thing. Of course, it is a good thing to find artifacts (or "Danef??" as we Danes call'em) before the building process starts, but it isn't without trouble; a lot of projects that would create jobs (which is very much wanted on Lolland) have been severely delayed because of this. 		But more importantly, it is the business that is impacted by the archaeological surveys that have to pay for them (in the case of the Femern tunnel, it is the government, so it isn't as much of a problem). But a lot of small entrepreneurs have been nearly bankrupted because of this (which means no new jobs).		Tl;DR: Concept is good, but the way it is done is not very good.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SorenxD123","name":"t1_csowcws","parent_id":"t1_csom1o5","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435775624,"created_utc":1435772024}
