{"body":"Hmm I can do my best. People may say history repeats itself, and I'd have to agree with those people, mostly. I would say history does repeat itself, but in a never-ending pattern like a fractal. At each step in the fractal's sequence the pattern in similar but on a different scale. I feel like history acts in this nature as well. For example revolution is the pattern, but every revolution is different and on its own scale.
