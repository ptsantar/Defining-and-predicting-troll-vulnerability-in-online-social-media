{"body":"Mormons believe in a "Heavenly Mother" who is the wife of and an equal partner with God the father, but not often referenced. Not exactly what you're asking for, but it's an example of modern belief in female diety, if not exclusively female.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Matope","name":"t1_cqqm9be","parent_id":"t3_342i4g","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430169443,"created_utc":1430165843}

{"body":"The greek and roman goddesses were not before writing, nor the egyptian ones. The norse ones depending on when the norse developed writing. The summerian and mesopotamian goddesses were very well written about, Enuma Elish for example. 		Shouldn't need to say that the Pagan Goddess was long after writing since Paganism (As it is popular now) was redeveloped in the 1950s.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Historyguy81","name":"t1_cqqxlth","parent_id":"t1_cqqwy45","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430187189,"created_utc":1430183589}

{"body":"I feel like out of the monotheistic religions that Catholicism comes the closest to pray to a woman. I mean, the Hail Mary and all the reverences to the Mother of God are huge components to Catholic dogma. While Mary isn't seen as part of the Holy Trinity, I feel she's "up there". 		At the end of the day, we don't pray *to* Mary like we pray to Jesus... the Hail Mary is us asking Mary to pray *for* us.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Lionstrong","name":"t1_cqqnele","parent_id":"t3_342i4g","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430171154,"created_utc":1430167554}

{"body":"The only example of any religious tradition, contemporary or ancient" with the chief "God" being a female is the Incan goddess of fertility, Pachamama. She represents creation and the earth.

{"body":"So, if you pick up old prints of the bible, and comb through the book of genesis, you will learn that God, Yahweh, was married. :)		Asherah was her name. If you grab some REALLY old (early 1900s) copies of bible and read the early bits of the book of genesis you might pick up on hints of her. 		Because the Catholic church focuses on the patriarchy, as opposed to the fairly equal parity of the masculine and feminine in pagan religions, Asherah was downgraded to a consort of Yaweh and then phased out all together.		As for actual scripture, you might have to consult a Torah for that. I doubt any christian books would make mention of her specifically.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tigerianwinter","name":"t1_cqqy1ny","parent_id":"t3_342i4g","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430187862,"created_utc":1430184262}
{"body":"Your idea of what is REALLY old is ridiculous.  The last one hundred years are only a tiny fraction of the history of the Bible.  Also the changes you blame on the Catholics predate the time of Christ by almost six centuries. If you wish to discuss your theories about the masculine and the feminine and pagan influences within the Torah in more detail I recommend you consult your nearest Chabad house.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"UngerUnder","name":"t1_cqr3b2i","parent_id":"t1_cqqy1ny","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1430196439,"created_utc":1430192839}
