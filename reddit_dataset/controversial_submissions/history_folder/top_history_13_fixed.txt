{"body":"Most costly wars usually somehow involve China as they have high population.By brutality Genghis Khans conquests would be brutal, especially against the Tangut.	But the most carnage in a single day without WW1 or WW2 would be battle of Cannae. 	This is happened in the second Punic war.Punic wars were a series of wars between Rome and Carthage.And the second one is the most famous.	Rome was defeated 2 times before this battle at Trasimine and Trebia.So Rome built the largest army in it's republic history. 12 legions were dispatched to deal with Hannibal of Carthage.When you think rome you usually think of post marian romans but this was before Marian reforms and before professional armies so it was army of fresh recuits. On Hannibals side his army consisted of battle hardened Spanish mercenaries and Gaulic mercenaries.	Romand army at this point had 2 consuls(like leaders) who everyday exchanged office of leading the Roman army.One of the consuls was hot headed looking for victory and glory while the other was advising not to.Hannibal knew this and both armies engaged while Roman army was led by hot headed brash dick.Hannibal still needed to find a way to defeat the Roman army.His army was far smaller than his enemies army.So on the plains of Cannae Hannibal set his army in half moon like formation pointing outwards.Normally Roman army was deployed in triplex acies but it's leader pressed on in this massive square formation.Hannibal put himself and his brother in the center saying "don't run we are here.If you die we die. You are not cannon fodder." As the Romans pushed on the outward half moon shaped army inverted.Then the Hannibals cavalry returned and closed their way out.They were trapped.Chaos spread and romans tried to restore order but it was too late.Hot under the baking sun there are screams everywhere and missles in air hitting your friends and killing them.People in the center bury their heads in the ground because why wait for death in 2 hours when you can just end it know. Some people asked their friend end it.It was so many people in such tight space that soldiers couldn't even raise their swords.They were butchered like cattle.There was no hope as they were trapped. In the end out of 90000 young roman men only 3000 escaped. The human cost of it impacted Rome itself greatly. Hannibal has won the battle bu he hasn't won the war and despite losinf 3 major defeats Rome did not and will not give up. And in the end Rome won the war.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Blastroid976","name":"t1_cspxw3c","parent_id":"t3_3bptz5","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435854995,"created_utc":1435851395}
