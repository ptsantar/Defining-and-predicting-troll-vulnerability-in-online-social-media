{"body":"Who would have thought that a mutiny could be sparked by borscht?		Obviously tensions were high and this had been brewing for some time,  but the first line of the story made me laugh:		"The Potemkin uprising was sparked by a disagreement over food, but it was anything but accidental."","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"madazzahatter","name":"t1_csndm0w","parent_id":"t3_3bm4oq","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1435660655,"created_utc":1435657055}
{"body":"Actually, it seems like most revolutions in history are initially sparked by a food shortage.		1789 French Revolution? Food shortage.		Revolutions of 1848?

{"body":"Your theory is that the British orchestrated the French Revolution and then spent two coalitions fighting against it. Then the British and Americans supposedly put in power the Bolsheviks, who wanted Russia out of the same war which Russia was fighting in alongside the U.S. and Britain. And after WWI, the U.S., Britain, and various Western countries entered the Russian Civil War in the hopes of ousting the Bolsheviks.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bob9999999999999","name":"t1_csryz9z","parent_id":"t1_csry08p","subreddit":"history","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh53","created":1436024794,"created_utc":1436021194}
