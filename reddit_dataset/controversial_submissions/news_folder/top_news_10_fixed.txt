{"body":"I only understand a little from religious education. The core materials are very close to those of Christianity's. They have two books, one is the teachings of Allah and the other is the words of Mohamed (correct me if I'm wrong). Islam holds a lot of tradition, which is why you may see some things that as a non-Muslim appear unusual (like women covering the head - also seen in orthodox Jews). While in some places these traditions are law, in other places Muslims will choose whether or not to observe the culture for their own reasons.Islam also tries to teach about the five pillars, these are fundamental virtues all of the followers must try to embrace. These are fasting in Ramadan, the pilgrimage to Mecca, charity, accepting Allah and ritual prayer.As I don't follow or study Islam I can't tell you much more. I just know that it can be compared in part to other religions that westerners find less confusing and the core teaches love and peace and acceptance as other religions do.
