{"body":"Anyone looking for an expert discussion, with cited sources and in-depth explained methodology, might try here: http://www.skepticalscience.com/kevin-cowtan-debunks-christopher-booker-temp-conspiracy-theory.html		Which does a good job of explaining why and how Christopher Booker is wrong, and why and how these adjustments are normal, expected, why the data still shows a global trend of warming, why it's anthropogenic, and why it isn't a scandal.		TL;DR: each adjustment is specifically and solely to land temperature recordings, which were collected for the purposes of weather reporting (not climate recording), and which showed anomalies which are consistent with failure to properly calibrate equipment.		Example: Paraguay ??? all the adjustments to Paraguayan temperature records were done because each showed statistically dramatic drops to recorded temperatures in the early 1970's and in the 2000's ??? but those same drops did not occur in temperature records kept by stations just outside of Paraguay's borders, nor across the planet. The data suggests that Paraguay's weather-recording equipment was updated or replaced at the same time in the early 1970's and again in the 2000's, and was not calibrated.		This is another example of a non-scientist cherry-picking particular segments of data that, when taken out of context, barely seem to contradict an overarching consensus, and running with them to the public and crying "Look! Look! Science has disproven ??? ".		A lie can run around the world before the truth can get its boots on.","depth":0,"score":41,"ups":41,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bardfinn","name":"t1_cogzolg","parent_id":"t3_2verx6","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1423574599,"created_utc":1423574599}
