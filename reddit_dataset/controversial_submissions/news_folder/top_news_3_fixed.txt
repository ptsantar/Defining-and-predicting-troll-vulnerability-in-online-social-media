{"body":"Keep yourself busy...		I woke up on Oct 3rd and drove to Wawa as I do everyday before work. I had one cig left and smoked it on the way there. I got my Redbull and crappy microwavable breakfast sandwiches and went up to pay and get my pack of smokes. While getting ready to ask for the pack, it went through my mind "Why?"		I've been wanting to quit for a few months and up until that day I would ask myself every cigarette I had "why am I doing this?" I looked at the money I was wasting. I mean REALLY wasting. I had bills to pay and I'm just burning up an extra $150 - $200 a month almost literally. 		Honestly that first day sucked. I knew I had an e-cig at home and kept saying to myself "Just make it through this day and you can hit that when you get home." and that's exactly what I did. The hardest thing is the oral fixation. I chew a lot of Dentine Ice now. Yeah it still costs money but $1.00 a day is a lot cheaper than a pack of smokes.		In the end you have to be pretty active in quitting. You really have to pay attention to yourself and the things that make you want to smoke. Waking up, everytime you get in the car, after meals, every couple of hours at work. Four of them while sitting in traffic on the way home, an argument.		You end up realizing that you smoke only to get rid of the feeling of wanting a cigarette. That's it. That's the only real reason. You want a cigarette and smoke a cigarette to get rid of that want.		I've heard people tell me they like smoking. That's bull crap. I have never liked smoking. It stinks. It screws up my endurance. It makes me cough all the damn time. etc. etc. There is nothing to like. You don't like smoking so why do you still do it? You might think you like it because when you have a cig it takes away the feeling of wanting a cig, but you really don't like it.		The e-cig will help. I only really used it when I had a strong urge or was in my most smokable areas. Like I used to chain smoke when playing my Xbox so I would have the e-cig there. Then I would just slowly tapper off.		It's easy to quit. The tough part is staying quit, and after the first week it gets easier and easier. You just have to pay attention to what your triggers are and fight through the urge. You get that strong urge to have a cig, you stop what is going on at that moment and get away for a couple minutes, that urge will pass.

For example, just the other day a guy at work gave me some passive aggressive smack talk. Now, as someone who has quit smoking the thinking process changes just a little bit. I'm not as quick and calm with my retorts. I had to make a conscious effort to get up and go for a quick walk. If I had a pack of smokes at that time I probably would have grabbed one.		The 'get away for a few minutes' means to allow myself to just drop all my stresses. Allow myself to empty my head and just breath for a couple minutes.

We simply do not know whether or not the dream of a risk-free alternative to smoking cigarettes has been realized.","depth":1,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"karmahawk","name":"t1_cmfcz5l","parent_id":"t1_cmfc8ub","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1417192951,"created_utc":1417192951}
