They need to get actual **doctors** (as in, other ones) to confirm what kind of procedures are going on there. [So the speaker was a doctor and described something that could be interpreted as partial birth, which is very precisely defined by the law; was she just giving general indications of what they were doing or did she define it very precisely and it exactly conforms to the law?] It's just as possible that she unknowingly or mistakenly described the procedure in a way that sounded like partial birth to a general audience, so she freaking erred; those are very bad missteps but not necessarily reality. 		And saying they have an incentive to break the law doesn't equate to them having done it. Innocent until proven guilty, especially in this case because the implications are simply horrendous (especially if she was a doctor performing such procedures) and it's not a good habit to condemn people for the worst just because drama is popular in this culture.		**Edited because I didn't realize she was a doctor herself; if she wasn't paying attention to what she was saying, 	or she didn't realize what she was saying could be misconstrued, doesn't know the law properly or (worst case scenario) she doesn't exactly know what's going on, she pretty much deserves to be burnt at the stake for being an idiot.

True, but BIOLOGICAL factors and knowledged played a strong role in accepting women and blacks as full persons. Blacks and women are homo sapiens just like human fetuses.

{"body":">not necessarily. 		Uhh. Good argument. My answer is yes necessarily. Great discussion. 		>Being a biological human is central to moral worth since without humans there is no such thing as moral worth.		Ok so you're a moral subjectivist? No big deal we just disagree. If an alien species wiped us out and then continued to exterminate other sentient species throughout the universe, that would be morally bad. That's my view. Morality doesn't depend on human existence.	 	>We are not talking about embryos or stem cells. We are talking about fetuses. Learn about basic biology before pretending to know what you are talking about.		Nice condescending tone. I like your style. 	Yes we are talking about stem cells. Fetuses have relatively large quantities of stem cells. That makes them valuable to medical researchers. Not as many as embryos and they're at a different point of maturation but still quite different from infants or adults. That was a secondary point though. I'm fine conceding fetuses are human..like I said I don't think that's morally relevant anyway. 		>So a sleeping human or a human in a coma has no moral worth?		Old argument. No that's not what it means. It's precisely that a sleeping human experienced awareness and a preference to continue living that would make it wrong to kill him. If he never experienced that (if for instance he was born only with a brain stem and the rest of the brain was not developed..as some babies are born) then I don't think it would be wrong to kill him despite biological human-ness. 		>And people who thought fetuses aren't morally equivalent to other people are wrong? Anyone can make silly statements like you.		How is it a silly statement? Also that wasn't a stand-alone statement.. It makes no sense to comment on it without its context. 		>True, but BIOLOGICAL factors and knowledged played a strong role in accepting women and blacks as full persons. 		Sure, but that was in response to scientific racism. Just because racist white people in the 50s needed to see biological evidence of equality doesn't mean that's what was actually morally relevant..who cares what racist white people needed to see? That's purely a social/historical fact, not a moral one. Can I give you a hypothetical? What if it went the other direction. What if scientists in the 40s or 50s discovered that blacks were actually a distinct species. Maybe something close but distinctly and genetically different from homo sapiens. Would that suddenly justify slavery or discrimination? No, because suffering is still suffering. Awareness of one's suffering, personal identity, a preference to live good, pain-free lives..those are all things that would still be true and apparent in black people even if eucenecists in the 40s or whatever discovered they were a distinct species.

"Relatively" large? Medical researchers are interested in embryonic stem cells...		> I'm fine conceding fetuses are human		It's not a matter for you to concede. It's scientific fact. You might as well concede that the earth revolves around the sun.		> It's precisely that a sleeping human experienced awareness and a preference to continue living that would make it wrong to kill him.		The fetus has a preference to continue living as well and has the ability to experience awareness if it is allowed to live. Just like the sleeping person will gain "awareness" sometime in the future when he awakes, the fetus will gain awareness in the future.		> How is it a silly statement?		You are not too bright. You are desperate to appear intelligent because you are as dumb as they come.		> Sure, but that was in response to scientific racism.		Uh no. Racism existed before "scientific" racism.

People tried to use science to justify their racism, but scientific facts are scientific facts.		> Would that suddenly justify slavery or discrimination?		Of course.		> Awareness of one's suffering, personal identity, a preference to live good, pain-free lives		Yes. Morality is solely based on pure selfish self-interest.

I stated that an activity which ends in the death of billions of human cells, using the same logic above ("Ending the life of human cells containing human DNA is ending human life"), would be a level of genocide the Reich could only drool over, as an absurd parodical extension of that logic. If we are to grant the former line of logic, the idea that human cells enjoy the legal protection of "human life", standing as true, then the latter statement, though absurd, is logically sound.		That being said, even in the event we grant a fetus the idea of personhood, speaking from a conservative/small-government standpoint, the fetus would still require the express and ongoing consent of the mother to survive gestation fully to birth. Consider the following argument:		When discussing any surgical/medical procedure, especially in the realm of utilizing organs to sustain another, the person donating the organs must provide express and ongoing consent for the procedure. In the event the organ is removed, and about to be implanted, but the donator changes their mind, the removed organ must then either be reimplanted into the original, or disposed of as medical waste. This means that the recipient of the donated resources is completely at the mercy of the donator, for the organ needed.		Similarly, if we assume that a fetus is a person, this means that they are completely at the mercy of the gestating mother for the donated resources and use of her body to survive. Just as the State cannot coerce a person to give a transplant recipient a kidney, in order to survive, so also is it unable to coerce a woman to use her body to nurture a fetus to full term. To act to the contrary needlessly injects the State into the Patient-Doctor relationship, in a matter best left between the two of them to discuss and decide, complicating it needlessly with bureaucratic red tape.		I think it's pretty clear that under conservative ideology, the right-to-choose is paramount to any governmental system that claims it values freedom and the liberty for citizens to make their own choices for their lifestyles.

{"body":"Here is the part people are scared to admit.......nonprofits are incredibly slimy and very corrupt. This is not just "Planned Parenthood" thing.		You can be near 100% certain that Planned Parenthood will try and squeeze every dollar they can. Does PP maybe find some legal wiggle room to sell tissues and organs for a higher dollar amount?		You can be near certain. It is sad but they need/want money just like everybody else. This shit is in high ass demand. Is is possible PP sells this stuff at an inflated price (A VERY easy thing to do) as to make some 'profit'? Yep. Honestly I would near count on it. It is very, very, very easy to say "In reality it cost about $25 to ship X to Y but we can inflate the cost of labor and handling and charge $30 and make $5."		This is extremely common.		Just because it is nonprofit......it is still run by people. While a charity might be a great thing they still are run by people and people are very corruptible. 		Take for example you are the head of a department that sells tissue from the abortions performed. In theory this is a 'good' thing. The abortions are already going to happen so you might as well sell them to a research institution and make some money off it to provide some other sources..........but there are about 500000 ways for this to go wrong.		Instead of the recovery of the tissues being something that is just a natural result of many abortions..........you can start to see potential. More tissue=more money. More money can not only mean more money for the organization to perform its task (That can be a good thing) but it can also mean more money for you PERSONALLY (nonprofits can offer certain incentive structures but also if a certain department grows .....your importance increase and so can your compensation).		Is it possible this video is a peek inside corruption in PP?		Yep.		It is very possible that nefarious (legal or not) things are going on within PP. It could be fairly isolated but who knows.			Does that mean abortions are wrong?	Nope.	Does that mean PP is pure evil?	Nope.		The problem is the one side (the Right) is ready to jump to massive conclusions and act like every person working at PP is a murder while the other side (the Left) has take up the opposite but equally stupid approach which is to put PP on a pedestal and untouchable. Anybody saying anything bad about PP or questioning it in any way they immediately scream and label you some Tea-Bagging woman hater who lynches gays on the weekend.
