{"body":"For my part, I would like to present a position I refer to as Supportive Apathy.  		I appreciate that Bruce Jenner has had a long, and sometimes painful journey.  For that, I am empathetic.  		However, I have realized that the genitals of Bruce Jenner have almost no direct impact on me, my life, or anyone in my circle of friends and family (unless Bruce and my friends are up to things which are none of my business).		Therefore, I publicly pledge to acknowledge and offer pointless personal support (really, Bruce doesn't know me after all),  AND more importantly, to continue to not give a damn about Bruce Jenner's genitals, or what he may choose to do to/with them.

{"body":"Nitpick: people's gender identity isn't all about whether they have an innie or an outie between their legs.  Many, if not most trans people never get "the surgery" - they may not have access to it, may not want it because they don't think they'll be satisfied with the results, or they may even like their private bits exactly the way they are.  Even for those who get "the surgery", it's after years of therapy and hormone treatments.		Many cis people have the idea that genital surgery is the be-all and end-all of transitioning.
