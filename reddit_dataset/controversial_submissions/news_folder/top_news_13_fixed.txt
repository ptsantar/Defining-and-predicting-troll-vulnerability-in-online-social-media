{"body":"It isn't up to me to define other people's core identities for them; Gay, Straight, Bi, Trans, Poly, Christian, Jew, Muslim, Atheist, liberal, conservative ... whatever, it isn't my decision to make. At some point we're just going to have to learn to accept each other as human beings regardless of the details, if we don't, there isn't much hope for our long term survival.		To accept different beliefs is what it means to be American. Seriously, this is 2015. Let the people live! Let gay people marry, let transgenders in the military, whatever!  I???m big into personal freedoms and equality, so I think libertarians are right on the money on this one.		Drug legalization is another.		Higher taxes, more welfare, and universal health care, on the other hand, should never happen. Paying my health insurance bill ($400/month from BCBS) is a killer! My car insurance is currently only $25/month (from Insurance Panda), but who knows when Obama will try to step in and create socialized car insurance? Keep America Free!!!		Land of the free, home of the brave, right? Equality for everyone. No other way to be.		And as far as I'm concerned, Bruce, God loves each one of us the way we are, and I'm sorry you have had to struggle your entire life with this. If I could, I would give you a big hug and tell you that you are a beautiful human being-just the way you are.","depth":1,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"allychang5307","name":"t1_cqo92wf","parent_id":"t1_cqnz9sz","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1429976768,"created_utc":1429973168}

I'm rather certain he'd *prefer* 'she' or 'her' but, knowing the media is still puzzled over pronouns and the whole gender issue, Jenner was aware many would still call her a 'he' or 'him' and, knowing that did not affect their own self identity, she was cognizant enough to know many in the community seem to be far less stable and could be set off even if it was a comment against Jenner that they took vicariously as an attack on them via Jenner.		It all sounds super crazy insane, but honestly, think about it, all of us are spoiled.  Its like she said, we wake up and go on with life, the majority of us, with little to no discord over whom we are or the person in the mirror.  Its unavoidable that Jenner lived 65 years in the physical body of a male and same goes for many trans people so, when a trans person I used to talk to at the clinic I worked at began to explain the issues surrounding pronouns, I at first felt they were being a brat, but, put into context, its like a white person saying racism is over.		You aren't dealing with their lot of life and all that comes with it.  So to pass judgement on their wishes to be called as they identify when we have no perspective ourselves is kinda out of line.  When it was put into such a context, i realized how unfair I was being and actually gained from those conversations.  I applaud Jenner, however, for doing that so the media did not receive blowback for any pronouns they very well may not have meant to be derogatory or negative.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Binxly","name":"t1_cqugmfy","parent_id":"t1_cqnz8in","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1430442634,"created_utc":1430439034}

There is *supporting, proven SCIENCE that speaks to the fact that gender is more defined in the brain than sexual physical characteristics and genetalia*		I can't make that any more clear.  I agree, some cultures see men in varying lights of 'butch' or 'effeminate.'  The issue is, Jenner isn't one who 'feels girly.'  She feels she is a woman, and felt that way for 65 years.  Let me tell you, AS a woman, not until I began working with transitioning transexuals at a former job I had doing paperwork for a low-income GLBT therapy facility did I realize how good I had it.		Mind you, we all muse about 'how the other side lives' and I'd lie if I said I hadn't ever indulged in fantasizing what I'd do if I woke up a man, but, that said, after a week of it, if THAT was my reality, I'd die inside.		Mind you, I am the most tom-boyish gal I know.  For years people assumed I dated men to hide I was a lesbian (I was not one, nor am now, tho I love my lesbian friends, they rock!) all because I 'acted like a guy.'  I curse like a sailor, I sit with my legs sometimes rather wider than is the stereotype for what society 'expects from women' (mind you when in jeans, not a dress or skirt. I'm a tom boy, not a whore lol) and I prefer the social company of men over that of women and frankly prefer a night at a sports game (preferably soccer or hockey) over a Sex and the City Marathon any day.		Therein lies the issue.  Jenner and other transexuals do not transition because they feel to remain their current gender is incompatible with their personality.  Rather, it is an extreme case of body dysmorphia that, unlike other dysmorphic conditions (anorexia, bulimia, plastic surgery addiction, etc) is actually being found, as mentioned before, as scientifically explainable and attributed to, in simplistic terms, 'the wiring of our brain' and that there is a safe, successful way to help them overcome by allowing surgical transition.

However, there was not a significant elevation of suicide or of other mortality in the post-1989 cohort.		* [Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): "At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P < 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P < 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples."		* [Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): "SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively)."		* [Here](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) is a broad survey conducted in the UK. Unlike the previous links, it's not peer-reviewed, but the large sample size provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): "Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)" (Page 50): " Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353)." (Page 55): "For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206)." (Page 59): "Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316)."		* [de Vries, et al., 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later.

{"body":"While acknowledging the experience is not the same for everyone...		>On a day to day basis, I think about my gender consciously very very rarely		Surprisingly, I can say the same.  However, little things can bring it to the forefront for me at the oddest of times.  Something as simple as seeing a woman walk past me in a loose shirt and suddenly I'm wishing shirts hung like that off me.		For me, I can give some examples of how gender dysphoria can mess with you.		I, since I was a kid, watching the girls start puberty and grow as they did, have not looked in a mirror and not wondered where my curves are, why I don't have them.  Basically since I was about 10 I've lamented the fact I don't have boobs and such, EVERY day.  I very nearly killed myself in my mid teens as I watched my body take the opposite route from the other girls.		During my early 20s I tried to deny it to myself, tried to convince myself that I was male.  Trying to act and think like I saw men around me doing.  This never felt right though, and even during the worst of my denial I still never looked into a mirror without wishing I saw female curves in the reflection.  Then you feel bad about feeling that way when you are trying to be male.  		Another example I can use is dreams.  I've lost count of the number of times I've had to cry myself back to sleep after waking up from a dream of being a mother.  The dreams are wonderful, but once I wake up I'm hit with the realization that no matter what I do, whatever surgery or pills, I can't actually be a mother.  I do imagine this may be something that some ciswomen who are unable to have kids for whatever reason may feel like.  That for some, the inability to *have* children doesn't negate the *need* to do so.		As for things like your 'feminine' things, none of those are in any way specifically female.  If it wasn't for the social stigma of 'sissy' and perceived communal threats to masculinity you would find a lot more men doing 'typical feminine' things.  Social misgivings are a problem all their own, suppressing people cis and trans alike.		There's a quote from an early 90s movie, *The Cement Garden*, that has stuck with me, in this regard.  I may not agree with it 100% but I still think it's interesting.		>[Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots, because it's OK to be a boy, but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading, because you think that being a girl is degrading.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYwgG2oyUbA) ^[link ^goes ^to ^a ^relevent ^Madonna ^video...]		I don't necessarily *want* to change my body but it's... maybe like wearing a tailored outfit... that isn't tailored to you.  Sure, it may fit somewhat, but you'll always be uncomfortable and it won't sit quite right on you until changes are made.  I am me, and no matter what changes I make to my body in the coming years, I'll still be me, but I would like, for the first time in decades, to finally feel comfortable in that outfit.		>When you say that you felt like the gender you wanted to be, what does that mean?

Haha		The part that drove home the idea strongest was the concept of waking up from a dream as a woman. I can honestly say that I've never dreamed that I was a woman, and I've never thought to envy child birth.		still if I'm asked what it feels like to be a man, I really can't answer.

Available evidence suggests you're incorrect. In fact, this has been experimentally tested in the case of [David Reimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). Reimer was born a healthy boy, but his penis was damaged irreparably during a botched circumcision when he was an infant. Under your theory - which was then-current in the psychological community - it was suggested that he be raised as a girl.		Reimer ended up displaying exactly the symptoms we'd expect from a young trans man (that's FTM, to be clear). He wasn't comfortable being seen as a girl, had behavioral issues, and so on. When he found out what'd happened in his early teens, he immediately transitioned back to living as a guy.		The other case of interest is that of [Norah Vincent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Vincent), a lesbian writer who lived as a man for a year to write a book on her experiences. By the end of her time presenting male, she was so depressed that she *checked herself into a mental hospital* because she was worried she'd hurt herself.		> This is a really small example, but for instance if there's anything 'feminine' i want to do, I just do it.		Sure. Male/female and masculine/feminine are separate axes. It's not that if you're feminine you must be a woman; being feminine *can* be (but is not always) an expression of female identity.		The best example I can give you here is by analogy. Think about sexuality: obviously not a social construct, since it predates society, although the ways we categorize it might be. But we have many cultural ways of expressing it. A gay man might buy flowers for a guy he likes. It's not that buying flowers is somehow "inherently gay", it's that flowers are a symbol, an external representation of what he feels internally. Those symbols are meaningful despite their arbitrary nature because they represent something that is *not* arbitrary.		Similarly, when I wore a skirt for the first time, it wasn't that a skirt is somehow inherently linked to womanhood. It's that the skirt was an external expression - the first I'd ever had - of an identity I'd kept chained and beaten in my head for a decade.		> What did you think you couldn't get out of life the gender you were born? When you say that you felt like the gender you wanted to be, what does that mean?		I couldn't be a woman. I know that's a circular answer, but there's not any other way to put it. It's like asking "why did you think you had to eat in order to not feel hungry?" Well, every time I ate food I felt less hungry, and everyone else who reported the same sensation of hunger seems happier with transition.		> Like I said, on a day to day basis I don't consciously feel like any gender, but maybe subconsciously I'm thinking 'awesome I'm a man, awesome I'm a man...."

I wonder though how controlled of an experiment that was though. He must have been treated differently his whole life as most adults in his life must have known what happened to him. Anyway though, I take the point, and the more I think about it, there is a part of me deep down that acknowledges and accepts the fact that I'm a guy. 		I think part of the reason this is way more confusing for me than other social issues is because I just can't relate at all. For instance, although I'm not homosexual, I have a pretty good idea what it's like as I do feel attraction to females. On the other hand, the more I think about it, the more I just don't feel my gender the way you describe. 		I completely understand for instance that you're not a woman because you like flowers or baths, but I think it must show a lot about my paradigm on genders that I think that's a legitimate question.

But it isn't too hard to imagine. Imagine you - unaltered, with the same mind and personality - woke up tomorrow and the world suddenly thought you were a girl. You open your eyes, look down, you've got boobs. When you go to pee, you sit down. Your closet's filled with dresses. Guys are looking at you appreciatively, and girls now see you as one of them. Your ID says "Sarah", and shows your moderately-pretty face. And every month, your body reminds you that it'd like you to get pregnant now.		Your parents call up, and ask when you're finally gonna meet a nice boy and settle down. Strangers assume without comment that you know how to do makeup, and you're seen as quite weird if you don't. If you say you're a guy in this world, the reactions are somewhere between surprise and outright laughter.		> I completely understand for instance that you're not a woman because you like flowers or baths, but I think it must show a lot about my paradigm on genders that I think that's a legitimate question.

We're still raised as our assigned ("it's a boy!") sex, and that's still part of our history and informs who we are. I was a boy scout and had a booming, echoing baritone voice that commanded respect, and while neither of those is still true they still inform who I am today.		Certainly they are people who feel the way you describe, but not all trans folk.

{"body":"> Is it bad to think that somebody transgendered can be viewed as having a mental disorder? If i demand to be viewed as something im not, does that make me that something? 		Well, I would certainly say it's bad, yeah. I've written some pretty big walls of text on the subject, and here's a copypasta of one:		----------		Historically, we were considered one. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards.		But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.		------------------------------		As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A [few](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956%2810%2900158-5/abstract) studies [show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418) patterns [typical](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.		Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are [much more likely](http://books.google.com/books?id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=PCOS+and+transgenderism&source=bl&ots=jDzI2rtV5S&sig=EMQL22TzAMnQ2nNSZV1LfuE2djM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cDd-U_b7I8SXqAaiiIK4CA&ved=0CIYBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&q=PCOS%20and%20transgenderism&f=false) to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that [single cases](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-010-9624-1) merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.		------------------------------		Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.		Compare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to [both therapy and SSRIs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/).		-------------------------------		And finally, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. Here are a few studies, although far from all that exist on the subject:		* [Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): "A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P < 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated."		* [Dhejne, et al.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) is much-cited by those who like to say that we have elevated mortality post-transition, and it does in fact say this...for the cohort who transitioned before 1989, in a far more hostile world and with less effective treatments. However, there was not a significant elevation of suicide or of other mortality in the post-1989 cohort.		* [Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): "At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P < 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P < 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples."		* [Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): "SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively)."		* [Here](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) is a broad survey conducted in the UK. Unlike the previous links, it's not peer-reviewed, but the large sample size provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): "Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)" (Page 50): " Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353)." (Page 55): "For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206)." (Page 59): "Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316)."		* [de Vries, et al., 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than controls.		* [Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: "Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret."		This is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.		----------------------		Setting aside the abstract, for a moment, I am a trans woman. I am:		* Stable: I have never been suicidal or anything more than moderately depressed. I have good control over my emotions (although less now than I once did - adjusting to the return of all the emotional turmoil of puberty takes work!). I can bear my emotional burdens, and I help many others to carry theirs too. I teach students who, in some cases, just go off the plane from countries where people like me are hanged - and I have the strength and stability to look them in the eye and not hide who and what I am.		* Happy: I smile when I look in the mirror. I see a face that, for the first time in my life, feels like a face that is really mine and not a mask I'm looking through. I sing happily as I go through my day. I do my very best to be cheerful and warm to everyone I know.		* Productive: I am financially self-sufficient, about to receive a Master's degree, and hold a fairly qualified position preparing graduate candidates for their entrance exams. I pay my taxes, tip my waiters, and have enough to fill my belly and help a friend in need.		So let me turn this around - in what sense am I mentally ill? I made a choice for my own well-being after 18 months of careful deliberation. That decision, so far, has brought me nothing but joy for its own sake (you can read my story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f27b2/transgender_people_of_reddit_what_was_life_like/ck591nt)). The worst parts are my worries about others and the occasional shitty treatment. I am not distressed, I am not impaired, I pose no threat to others, and I ask nothing but the courtesies already extended to half the human race.

So she???d drive back home to check that the hair dryer was off, then drive back to work, then worry that maybe she hadn???t really checked well enough, then drive back, and so on ten or twenty times a day.		>It???s a pretty typical case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it was really interfering with her life. She worked some high-powered job ??? I think a lawyer ??? and she was constantly late to everything because of this driving back and forth, to the point where her career was in a downspin and she thought she would have to quit and go on disability. She wasn???t able to go out with friends, she wasn???t even able to go to restaurants because she would keep fretting she left the hair dryer on at home and have to rush back. She???d seen countless psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors, she???d done all sorts of therapy, she???d taken every medication in the book, and none of them had helped.		>So she came to my hospital and was seen by a colleague of mine, who told her ???Hey, have you thought about just bringing the hair dryer with you????		>And it worked.		>She would be driving to work in the morning, and she???d start worrying she???d left the hair dryer on and it was going to burn down her house, and so she???d look at the seat next to her, and there would be the hair dryer, right there. And she only had the one hair dryer, which was now accounted for. So she would let out a sigh of relief and keep driving to work.		>And approximately half the psychiatrists at my hospital thought this was absolutely scandalous, and This Is Not How One Treats Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and what if it got out to the broader psychiatric community that instead of giving all of these high-tech medications and sophisticated therapies we were just telling people to put their hair dryers on the front seat of their car?		>I, on the other hand, thought it was the best fricking story I had ever heard and the guy deserved a medal. Here???s someone who was totally untreatable by the normal methods, with a debilitating condition, and a drop-dead simple intervention that nobody else had thought of gave her her life back. If one day I open up my own psychiatric practice, I am half-seriously considering using a picture of a hair dryer as the logo, just to let everyone know where I stand on this issue.		>Miyamoto Musashi is quoted as saying:		>*"The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy???s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him."*		>Likewise, the primary thing in psychiatry is to help the patient, whatever the means. Someone can concern-troll that the hair dryer technique leaves something to be desired in that it might have prevented the patient from seeking a more thorough cure that would prevent her from having to bring the hair dryer with her. But compared to the alternative of ???nothing else works??? it seems clearly superior.		>And that???s the position from which I think a psychiatrist should approach gender dysphoria, too.		>Imagine if we could give depressed people a much higher quality of life merely by giving them cheap natural hormones. I don???t think there???s a psychiatrist in the world who wouldn???t celebrate that as one of the biggest mental health advances in a generation. Imagine if we could ameliorate schizophrenia with one safe simple surgery, just snip snip you???re not schizophrenic anymore.

{"body":">I cannot fathom someone wanting to switch their sex. 		You've got to be very careful with what you mean here. Most of the time, transgender people aren't trying to 'switch' anything about themselves. While a good number might go through surgery and hormone therapy to have their body align with cultural norms about gender expression, there are some who do not.		When you try to understand this, the way to think about it is that they are just trying to be themselves. It might help you to think about yourself, first. Who are you? Try to think specifically about the part of you that you feel is your gender. What is it that makes you feel like a man or a woman? Is it your biology, or is there something else? Maybe a mix of both?		Now try to think about why you *don't* feel like another gender.		Now try to imagine what it feels like to have your feelings about your gender not align with what people would expect from your biology. This is the hardest part, and really you won't know what it feels like if you never experience it yourself. I've never experienced it myself either.

{"body":"> Am I the only one who is having trouble with this?		No. I felt that perhaps such people were mentally unsound. But, I changed my viewpoint.		Each of us, given the chance, would probably modify our bodies in some way or another to be closer to how we have wished we might be. Maybe we want a better nose, or face, or to be taller. Such simple wishes are natural, and recognizable. Does it end there?		How many have wished to be of another ethnicity? Thousands of people around the world have surgeries which are designed to disguise, or otherwise morph their ethnic background. Not for me, but such desires are all too recognizable to be condemned in others just because they were willing to endure some pain, and to make permanent their changes.		Is it truly a great leap to then imagine that some humans may wish to change their sexual external representation? Consider video games: I most certainly have assigned myself to a character of the opposite gender. Unfortunately, I'm sure my maleness oozed through my poor characterizations of female aliens. Then there are those who add tubes and bones and bolts into their bodies, or have fangs created. Tattoos. Body builders. There are people who would gladly become animals if they could. There are people would like to look like their favorite character from a film. 		Thus, I realized that some people want that external visage to be different, in a way that you are I find unexpected, and extreme. But that's like saying the color red is bad, but blue and yellow are alright. Therefore, we must except that human beings have a complex relationship with their external representations.		"But what if they are doing their change because of mental instability?" This was my last redoubt of doubt as well. But, if we accept that the 'healthiness' and 'goodness' of a transformation is entirely individually-based, and not applicable to a category of transformation, then we are in a good place.		Consider Lance Armstrong: He is someone whose drive to transform his external visage was clearly built on a foundation of darkness and loathing, and thus we are rightly critical of the extremity of his desire to be viewed as his imagination foretold. Yet, there are many people who have become another gender, and have quietly found a partner, married, gone one with their careers and been happy, and we have never heard of them. In the end, as it is with most things human-related, each case on its own.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"skytomorrownow","name":"t1_cqocxdm","parent_id":"t1_cqntyy8","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1429984962,"created_utc":1429981362}

{"body":"> I have heard that a lot of post op individuals have regretted their surgery.		That is not the case. Satisfaction from both transition in general and surgery itself is astronomical:		* [Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): "A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P < 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated."		* [Dhejne, et al.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) is much-cited by those who like to say that we have elevated mortality post-transition, and it does in fact say this...for the cohort who transitioned before 1989, in a far more hostile world and with less effective treatments. However, there was not a significant elevation of suicide or of other mortality in the post-1989 cohort.		* [Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): "At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P < 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P < 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples."		* [Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): "SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively)."		* [Here](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) is a broad survey conducted in the UK. Unlike the previous links, it's not peer-reviewed, but the large sample size provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): "Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)" (Page 50): " Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353)." (Page 55): "For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206)." (Page 59): "Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316)."		* [de Vries, et al., 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than controls.		* [Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: "Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives.

Moving on to your claim about brain patterns (one which I find particularly amusing, as your sort is typically rather prone to aversion to the suggestion of differences in brain function between the sexes), I think you'll find that if you read the various studies, the only significant, non-hormonal equivalence between a transsexual and the sex they wish to be is in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which is a region of the brain known to respond to sexual and anxiety related stimuli. Not the whole brain.	 	Furthermore, all the rest of the equivalencies between transsexuals and the sex they wish to be disappear when you control for hormonal influences. In other words, the sex-specific differences in the brain are a result of the influences of gonadal hormones, so it is no surprise that a man who has been castrated and pumped full of female hormones is going to develop a brain similar to a woman.		http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S107","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Capitol18","name":"t1_cqoo1gd","parent_id":"t1_cqon40m","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1430007641,"created_utc":1430004041}

When a child is born, they are (usually but not always) unambiguously male or female.

{"body":"I don't really see how any of that proves that being transgender is a mental illness. Wouldn't it be better defined as a physical affliction in this way? As in, the body not being/doing what the mind dictates. Saying it's a mental illness implies that it's somehow wrong for this to happen, that it's a thing that can be treated with therapy and the right meds. I'll repeat myself when I say that people used to think the same thing about homosexuality (which was why conversion therapy became a thing). Besides all the stuff I said before, for something to be classified as a mental illness, it has to satisfy certain criteria: interfering with a person's ability to function, increasing the risk of harm to oneself, etc., etc. The 'disorder' aspect of this is really the body dysphoria that many trans people experience, stemming from their physical body not matching their mental gender. If you have a trans person who knows their sex doesn't match their gender but they're okay with it, is it still a disorder? How would you define that? 		And if we are going to call it a disorder, wouldn't the treatment then be, y'know, allowing the person to transition to the correct sex? In most cases this relieves the person's dysphoria and greatly reduces the risk of suicide, self harm, etc. I just don't understand why people perceive it as a bad thing when transgender people want to undergo the transition process. How does it harm anyone else that Bruce Jenner has known his whole life that he would be much happier living as a woman, and is taking steps to achieve that goal?","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"my_name_is_not_robin","name":"t1_cqnzowy","parent_id":"t1_cqnzezy","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1429941401,"created_utc":1429937801}
