You seem to be confusing how the news media reports on an event with how the FBI complies their data.  Go back and look at the methodology of the report.  FBI relies not on media reports but on local law enforcement.  Where local law enforcement determine that the motive of the crime is hate of the race (or religion, sexual orientation, national origin/ethnicity, or disability) of the victim they report that as a hate crime.  Where the motive is anything else (rage, greed, thrill-seeking, hate of the individual, drug or alcohol induced stupidity, etc.) it is not reported as a hate crime.  Where the motive is unknown it is also not reported as a hate crime, this (probably) leads to under reporting of hate crimes across the board as many criminals are smart enough not to share their motives with the police (or their victims).

{"body":"You probably should look at the actual statistics rather than trusting a poster going by "young black thugs" to accurately report what they show.		Take this example, it pruports to reflect the FBI Uniform Crime Report.  The broadest count you'll find from that report is for number of charges (as opposed to convictions).  In 2012 the FBI reported 4,512 blacks were charged with rape (each rape counts as a charge, so if the same man was charged with more than one rape he shows up in that count more than one time, so it over counts the individuals but accurately counts the number of charges).  Assuming 100% of those charges were blacks raping whites, probably false but it makes the math easy, that's 12-13 a day - a bit less than the 100 that your source arrives at.  It's still far too many, but it's far less sensational than the number your source suggests.  [Source](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/43tabledatadecoverviewpdf).		Say we give your source the benefit of the doubt.  The FBI estimates 84,376 forcible rapes for the year. [Source](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/violent-crime/rape/rapemain).  Compared to the number of charges, there are a lot of uncharged forcible rapes out there.  Assume that the charged offenders are a representative sample of actual offenders (I suspect blacks are over represented in that sample, but assume they aren't to make the math easy), in that case blacks account for 32.5% of all rapes, or 27,422 rapes.  Assuming again that all of those are black on white you still only get 75 a day.  Again far less than the number your source arrives at (and that's with some very generous assumptions that are almost certainly false).		**TL;DR**: Your source is full of shit, as you might expect from someone who chooses to post on racially charged topics under the handle "young black thugs"","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"law-talkin-guy","name":"t1_cjw7xi8","parent_id":"t1_cjw1snn","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1408596910,"created_utc":1408593310}

So the black community forced you to post a bunch of lies about how black men are raping white women at a prodigious rate.

Nothing in what you said points to "race based crimes" (or more bizarrely a "media blackout of it").  And this is really why I took issue with your initial post.

I'm happy to engage with you, but you have to engage with what I actually said, not some stupid thing you assume I would say (or wish I would say).		>My original post was suggesting that the knock out game could be considered a 'hate' crime. 		Yes, you did say that.  But it's so stunningly stupid that I thought I'd do you a favor and not address it.		But since you insist on bringing it up: hate crimes are those crimes where animus towards a class of people (on the basis of race, ethnicity/national origin, religion, disablity, or sexual orintation) is the motive for the crime.  You can't classify all of any particular types of crime as a hate crime - that's something that is motive dependent.  Since in most cases the victims of the knock out game seem to be targets of opportunity rather than being chosen specifically due to their group membership, most people engaged in the behavior are not committing a hate crime.  Some may be, and in those cases where law enforcement feels it can be proven, it gets reported as one.  But no the knockout game, in and of itself, can't be considered a hate crime because that's not how hate crimes work.		> And the number of black on white rape, which is acceptable by you, how many could be considered a 'hate' crime? I would guess your answer would be none? That was the context of my original post. You don't like the numbers? Fine.		Again.  I never said it was acceptable.  		The answer is very few.  Of the hate crimes reported in 2012 (the most recent year we have data for) 15 were forcible rapes.  Of those 15, 6 were committed by whites, 2 by blacks, 1 by a multiracial group, 4 by people of unknown race, and 2 by unknown offenders.  [Source](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2012/tables-and-data-declarations/3tabledatadecpdf/table_3_offenses_known_offenders_race_by_offense_type_2012.xls).  In terms of the bias that motivated those rapes 1 was motivated by anti-white bias, 3 anti-American Indian/Alaskan native bias, 1 by anti-Hispanic bais, and the remaining 10 by anti-homosexual bias of one sort or another.  [Source](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2012/tables-and-data-declarations/4tabledatadecpdf/table_4_offenses_offense_type_by_bias_motivation_2012.xls).  So given the data, I feel comfortable saying that at most 1 was a hate crime.  Still one too many, but not quite the epidemic you are suggesting.		Most rapes aren't hate crimes for the reasons I lay out about he knockout game.  Most rapes are not motivated by animus to a particular group (as defined by the statute)- they are motivated by animus towards a particular person, animus towards a particular gender (a classification not covered by the relevant laws), general undirected rage, a desire to be powerful, etc.  		You seem to be operating under the assumption that every time a white person is the victim of a crime committed by a black person it is a hate crime.  And that's a false assumption (just as people who assume all crimes committed against black people by white people are hate crimes are wrong).  The simple fact is that the vast majority of crime is motivated by something other than the kind of hate that would make it a hate crime (less than .1% of all crimes in a year are hate crimes). 		>As for the Media blackout of said black on white crimes, Your take on the situation is that it is not worth reporting on as it would be, vile, racist and factually untrue. And merely slanderous. 		No.  my take is that saying there is an epidemic of black people raping white people on the order of 100 a day, as you did would be vile, racist, and factually untrue.  Given the long history of this particular lie levied at the black community I feel very comfortable calling it vile and racist and given that the numbers show that it isn't true I feel even more comfortable calling it factually untrue.		My complaint about your sudden and odd comment about a media blackout was that nothing you said up to that point had anything to do with that and that it was a bizarre and unsupported (and frankly, somewhat paranoid) assertion.  By all means, show me some facts that support this claim and I'll listen.  But you can't just assert it out of the blue and expect to have it take seriously.		>I doubt this is the dream MLK was thinking about. 		The referent is unclear here.  What is "this"?		>During the Vietnam war males between 18 and 50 were pressed into military service by either the VC or South Vietnamese army.

{"body":"I'm a 30-something white guy originally from Canada that has lived in DC for about six years, and the only instances of overt racism I have witnessed have been by African Americans against immigrant Africans and against white people. 		For example, once I was getting gas in Anacostia off the Suitland Parkway. When I went into the store to pay before fueling up (cash only, no pay-at-pump) a large African American man was yelling at the immigrant African clerk because the clerk refused to serve him. This was because the African American guy was talking on his phone when he came to the front of the line and judging by his demeanor, was generally being rude and belligerent to the clerk. The things the African American guy was yelling included "you're not a real black man", "go back to your fucking country we don't need you phony blacks over here stealing our jobs", and "I'm a REAL black man, nigga!", etc. etc. To his credit, the clerk, in accented English, stood his ground and just kept telling the guy to leave without egging him on or escalating things. I am glad the clerk was standing behind protective glass and I don't blame him for a second for refusing to serve that guy. After watching this in amazement for a while (I had never heard someone utter such words in public or private) I turned and left because I was afraid if the guy saw me he might turn his rage upon me. 		Another time I was driving home and stopped at a light when I look out my window to see a few African American people sitting on a step in front of a store. No big deal. But when I briefly made eye contact with a woman she immediately stood up and yelled "what the fuck you want, white trash bitch?" My car isn't fancy and I was wearing a plaid shirt, but I've never been called that before! I sped away without responding and that incident really stuck with me.		One final example: I was parked in NW around Dupont with my window down looking at my phone when I hear some kids in a school bus that had pulled up beside me while waiting for a light to change yell at a white woman walking down the sidewalk. The things that kid said were vile: "get the fuck out of our city you white bitch", "I fucking hate you white sluts!", and other things. I got out of the car just as the bus was pulling away and saw the kid giving the finger out the window. I was pretty shocked, though the woman just kept walking and of course the driver didn't stop though I can't imagine he/she didn't hear the kid yelling out the window. 		I listen to the WPFW "jazz and justice radio" every morning on my way to work and regularly the "community comment" segment features people calling in to complain about how "white people are evil and racist and keeping us down and taking over our neighbourhoods" for one reason or another and how racism underpins all other issues in America. These sentiments are not veiled in any kind of politically correct language. I can only imagine the public response to a radio station that had people calling in to complain "those evil black people". The WPFW radio hosts generally try to calm things down, but they very rarely outright denounce the words of these callers. 		I realize these are just anecdotes, but they sum up my experience with racism in the US while I have been here. I am certainly not saying that white people have it so bad or that racism against people of colour doesn't exist in America - it does. I was also shocked when I came to live here at the fact that most of the people working in jobs requiring business suits are white, most of the maintenance workers and low-end gov't jobs are black, and most of the people doing anything related to food are Hispanic. The divide was just so much clearer than I could have imagined. Surely this indicates underlying social inequalities.","depth":0,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bobgerry78","name":"t1_cjvl897","parent_id":"t3_2e2mx2","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1408551674,"created_utc":1408548074}

And for my own little Southeast anecdote: Back in high school me and a couple of friends (two white guys and a white girl) were leaving a concert at RFK Stadium (in Anacostia) and my friends car died in the middle of the street. We were quite scared since that is a really bad part of town. A white van pulled up behind us with two black guys in their early 30's. They get out of the car and come up to us to ask if we need help. They used their van to push the car onto a side street and let the girl who was with us sit in their van while they gave my friends car a jump. They did not ask for anything in return even though we offered money, all they said to my buddy was "don't bring those speakers into this part of town again, it's not safe." and then drove off.","depth":1,"score":18,"ups":18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Is_this_thing_on","name":"t1_cjvmkzo","parent_id":"t1_cjvl897","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1408554295,"created_utc":1408550695}

{"body":"It's not really 'generally accepted' because that idea actually falls apart when you break it down.  The group that first pushed the idea of 'minority means an oppressed group' or lack of political power as you describe it was feminists because they wanted to call women a minority.  But the idea that political power is somehow on the men's side of things is absurd.  Men don't turn 18 years old and get a privilege card - they get forced to register for the draft or they lose their right to vote (among other things).  Voting is a right for women but it's something that's traded to men in exchange for agreeing to military conscription.  In the 2012 election, 53% of the voters were women.  That statistic completely debunks the idea that women don't have political power.  If you follow the topics during an election, women's issues receive a huge amount of attention while issues surrounding men are completely ignored.  With 99% of workplace deaths, 73% of homeless people, and 95% of prisoners all being one gender, you'd think there would be a discussion about the factors that cause this all to happen to only one gender.

{"body":"Well, just speaking for me - I don't think I do.  I live in a mixed neighborhood, but immediately surrounding me is all black (I'm the only white household in a block of 30+ black homes).  My roommate is a black guy I grew up with, and I work for a construction company that's pretty evenly mixed.  I'm not blaming "all blacks" because, like most of my neighbors and my roommate - there are some really awesome people in the mix and that isn't fair.  I can't deny that I do believe blacks commit a "disproportionate" amount of the crime.  And I think they do because they were raised to believe they were wronged and they don't have to listen to anyone that tells them to do anything.  In short, if the population was a 50/50 mix of white and black (leaving other races out of it), 25 of the black folks would be good and 25 would be bad.  And the 25 bad black folks would commit 75% of the overall crime.  But even mentioning something like this (even when it can be backed up with fact) seems to make someone a racist.  Hell, I'm 1/8 American Indian.  My dad died when I was young, my mom abandoned me and my sisters and we were essentially homeless.  We raised ourselves - and we all ended up graduating from college and having successful careers.  I could play the blame card and the "my people were persecuted"...  But what good is that going to do?  Pulling that shit isn't going to pay my bills - it's not going to get me a job or get me out of a speeding ticket.  I learned early on that I'm the only person responsible for seeing that I succeed.  And sitting around bitching about how someone I read about was wronged by a cop isn't going to get me anywhere.

{"body":"Well, we could spend a week dissecting your statement, and there's a lot of truth in what you write.  Personally (and I'm a mid 30's, white, conservative male from SC - so I'm a little out of touch with the stereotypical youth of today) - but personally, I find twerking and the vernacular appalling.  Also, the fact that the "N word" can both be used as a name of honor, and at the same time, a term of hate by the same group - is especially confusing to me.  In short, the black society has learned they can have their cake and eat it too - and if anyone questions them on it, they're obviously a racist as well.  It's the quickest way to stop or defer an argument if you're backed into a corner and/or unintelligent.  I find all talk like that ghetto and trashy, regardless of who it comes from and what color they are.  "Twerking" (aka bouncing your ass in the face of someone, in the hopes of enticing them into sex, I guess??) is even more grotesque and ghetto, yet sadly has become the cat calls of the the young female - similar to male construction workers of our past.    	Lastly, Michael Brown (like Trayvon) are both "average" and outliers - depending on the argument the person you're speaking with wants to make (not that you'll get anyone to admit either was up to no good).  A yearbook picture from a few years past reminds anyone that this could be their son or neighbor...  And at the same time, let's forget that Brown may have been stealing cigars or whatever. Like I said, "he'd been trampled on by society his entire life" and was finally taking a stand - is what they'd like you to believe, in the event he ever is proven to have been stealing and acting like a thug.    		On a related note - the same group of thugs that live in the projects near me - I caught one of them stealing a bicycle of mine, off my porch a year ago.  Choosing to not start a war in the neighborhood I just moved into, I chose to be quiet about it.  Then, a few months ago, I caught the same kid trying to break into a car of mine.  I confronted him and was cussed out by him and his girlfriend - as they both stood on my porch and told me to "go the fuck back in your house".  I eventually called the cops and had him put on trespass notice (I could have pressed charges, but - trying to do him a favor - didn't).  Later that night, his mom confronted me in the street.  When I admitted that yes, I did call the cops on her son, I was cursed beyond anything I've ever heard (and I grew up in similar projects, in a broken home and raised myself - I've heard it all).  Her son "has ADD", "he don't act right when he don't take his medication", "his girlfriend is a bad influence and made him do it", "he wasn't trying to steal my bike" (I misunderstood what I saw him doing, I guess).  Also I "just moved into (my) house - me and my son been living here for years" (So I have no say, when I see him committing crimes on my property), "all my family live around here" - and after I had rebuked all of her stories and defenses - only then did I hear it.  "You just a fucking racist.  Fuck you and your racist shit."  		Now, I'm the racist on my block.  That same group of kids - they cuss, yell, shoot me birds and continue to call me "that racist".  Let's forget about the money I've given to their neighborhood church, how I take all my neighbor's (all black) trash to the street every Tuesday night and bring those trashcans back to their homes when I get home on Wednesday.  Let's forget how I cut all their grass, run errands for them take them to the store.  Let's forget about the things I've bought from them, when they sell things from their schools, or how I've given them $10-$20 to rake leaves, help me unload groceries or walk the dogs - when I could just have easily done it myself.  Now, I'm suddenly the racist - because I didn't want my car broken into.  		Sorry for the rant.  I'm just tired of blacks playing the race card, only when it suits them best.  You can't always be victimized.  Playing the victimized race card the last 100+ years has only led to their downfall.  Maybe - and only if/when they'd (and not all - I'm referring to those that clog up our projects and prisons) take a good look at their own actions and what put them where they are - then things would finally change.","depth":5,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"wisertime07","name":"t1_cjvlnlu","parent_id":"t1_cjvkv31","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1408552505,"created_utc":1408548905}

In response, I want to point out a couple things you said which I think could help you (and everyone in the US) figure out this whole race thing.		>I hope I am wrong too about what I am seeing and hearing in white communities.		It sounds like your perception that racial issues are getting worse comes from what you call white communities and I imagine that, in that context, you are right. When people group together as one race they are far more likely to perceive and perpetrate stereotypes.		The key here would be to get out in the world and talk to **everyone** about this issue (if they want to talk, that is - don't force it). I live in a very homogeneous area now (haven't/won't always do so) and I find that people tend to say stuff that they probably don't believe in, just because they feel safe saying it, knowing that no one around them is offended.		If everyone who is troubled by racial issues actually went out and met people from what they think of as "the other side" they would realize, corny as it sounds, that we are all humans and we are all subject to the same experiences, just from different angles.		**TL;DR**: If you are really worried about racial tension and how it seems like everyone hates each other, try to engage in a reasoned, calm discussion with someone about it and do your best to keep it civil.

It does not say that MB was shot from 35 feet away, it says that his body was 35 feet away from the vehicle. 		In either case your argument is weak. The officer's main arguement is going to be that he feared for his safety. So theres only two plausible stories. Either the officer stayed near the vehicle and shot, which doesnt help his case because it will be near impossible to claim your life is being endangered by an unarmed man(who has already been shot), who was 35 ft away. OR the police officer was chasing after brown and shot him at closer range as he chased him. Which would also mean that he had no reason to fear for his life, because once you give chase, you are the aggressor. People who are in fear for their lives, dont chase after the person of whom they are fearful. 		The medical examiner said that according to the autopsy report, that the Brown's condition was not consistent with a shooting from close range. Brown didnt even have gun powder residue on his body, which corroborates a shooting from some distance. The examiner said that the shots couldve been fired from anywhere between 6 and 35ft. Which can confirm the police chief's statement that brown was shot 35ft feet away from the vehicle. So in the end, all of the evidence up to this point, should lead one to conclude that brown was not at all close to the officer when he was killed. 			>I did stumble onto a video that was posted on YouTube by user Black Canseco which has since been made private.

Judging based on skin color is of course wrong, but preconceived notions have been pounded into our heads, not by our own innate racism, but as a response based on personal experience and observation. You can claim systematic racism is the plight of black communities, however some think the people inflict this on themselves.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheConnections","name":"t1_cjvpe77","parent_id":"t1_cjvov2r","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1408559471,"created_utc":1408555871}
