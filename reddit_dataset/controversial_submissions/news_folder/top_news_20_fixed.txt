{"body":"Wow - could we get something even more blatantly anti-gun?  Please? /s		Cars and guns are both tools where careless use can result in death or serious injury.  That's not news.  The fact that cars are getting safer isn't news either.  Nor is the fact that accidental gun deaths and suicides are relatively stable as a percentage of the population news, or even that murders committed by guns are actually down again.		Only how the death statistics are being manipulated to create a narrative and push an agenda is newsworthy, apparently.		If we really wanted to, we could eliminate ~ 99% of vehicular related deaths in the US starting tomorrow if we limited speeds to 10 miles per hour.  Of course, that would mean we'd spend much more time going places.  Such a heavy restriction on our freedom of movement would be decried by all.  It would also be an unacceptable price for our economy to pay in lost productivity, even though 35,000 people would be "spared".		Similarly, our society must understand and learn to accept that accidental and suicidal deaths by people using guns (to say nothing of the murders) are a price of maintaining our fundamental and natural right to self-defense.  Not all of us can effectively defend ourselves with simple brawn.  Guns are, and have been for nearly three centuries, a great equalizer in society.  Guns are also the only effective means for a populace to keep their governments from carrying out mass executions and imprisonments.  Despite a few millennia of civilization, we're still aggressive and violent critters by nature, and some are more willing than others to abuse the trust we place in everyone.  Self defense is our most important right.		And we would be continuing to give up that right, by inches and yards, if even more restrictions are placed on gun and ammo purchases.		The next time someone tells you we should give up guns, tell them "Cars, first."","depth":0,"score":29,"ups":29,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"floridawhiteguy","name":"t1_cnwvjba","parent_id":"t3_2t90wp","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1421899953,"created_utc":1421899953}

{"body":"But we are.		Yes, guns are tools specifically designed to kill people.  So what?  You only use a tool for its intended purpose when you really need to.  Only an idiot wanders around firing a gun in random directions - sooner or later someone else will shoot back and kill the idiot.		I am disgusted by the hubris of people like you who presume to know better what's good for me, than what I know to be good for me.		Frankly, if I use my gun in my home to kill an intruder, or end my own life, it's really none of your goddamned business.  If I accidentally kill myself because I did something really stupid in handling it loaded while drunk, well it's nobody's fault but my own.  Society can't and shouldn't bother trying to protect me from myself in my own home.  Not to say any of that is likely to happen; just as a point of reference to the commonly trotted out excuses to take away guns.		People do all sorts of horrific things to each other with all kinds of tools and implements.  Things which aren't designed or intended to kill.  Does that mean we should ban all things which might harm someone if misused, too?  Look at the gun and knife bans in the UK and tell us just how well that's working out.		No law will ever stop a criminal from doing anything.  No ban on any item will prevent a motivated person from obtaining it.  And no amount of hand-wringing by people like you will succeed in taking away my rights and responsibilities, much less my guns.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"floridawhiteguy","name":"t1_cnxwaw0","parent_id":"t1_cnxvg91","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1421980379,"created_utc":1421980379}
