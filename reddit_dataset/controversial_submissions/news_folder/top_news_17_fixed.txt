For a small glimpse of the great love and respect he inspired in his colleagues and friends, watch [his acceptance speech](https://youtu.be/y3B3DbvttI4?t=288) at the 2011 Baftas, when he was presented with the Bafta Fellowship.		His accomplishments make the average person feel like a total slouch: he saw service in WWII, did intelligence work, tracked down Nazi war criminals, spoke nine languages, was an actor and a musician.

In North Africa he was attached to the Long Range Desert Patrol, the forerunner of the SAS, where he would jump in a badass fucking four-wheel-drive jeep with a gigantic machine gun mounted in the back, drive hundreds of miles behind enemy lines, survive the scorching heat of the Sahara Desert, then sneak-attack Luftwaffe airfields by rolling up on them at sixty miles an hour with his .50-caliber machine guns blazing out curtains of white-hot Nazi-smiting justice, planting dynamite on their airplanes, then peeling ass out of there leaving nothing but bullet-riddled corpses and gigantic explosions in his wake. After working with the LRDP, Lee was assigned to the Special Operations Executive ??? better known as Winston Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare ??? a group that did shit like lead a twelve-man assault that destroyed the German top secret nuclear weapons development facility in Norway and assist brave Eastern European partisans and rebels sabotage Nazi supply lines to prevent them from bringing reinforcements up to fight the Soviets. His service records are sealed and Lee doesn't talk much about his service (when pressed on the subject, he reportedly asks his interviewer, "Can you keep a secret?". When they excitedly say yes, he leans in close and says, "So can I."), but we do know that by the time he retired as a Flight Lieutenant in 1945 he'd been personally decorated for battlefield bravery by the Czech, Yugoslavian, English, and Polish governments and was good friends with Josip Broz Tito, so draw your own conclusions.

It got to the point where one of the producers had to constantly remind them to film the movie and not get sidetracked by Christopher Lee.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Death_Star_","name":"t1_cs36pii","parent_id":"t1_cs31yp4","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434044286,"created_utc":1434040686}

{"body":"That's a nice way to put it, but sadly, life never completes. It just ends, painfully or not. That being said, Christopher Lee lived one of the more accomplished lives, for sure. He even had love, being married for more than 50 years, at the same time as being a very successful actor. Marriage expectancy isn't exactly 50 years in Hollywood. 		Considering Lee's passion for acting, and other interests, like music, I highly doubt that he felt that life was complete. Had he lived to become a 120 years old, and stayed healthy, I think he would have continued acting. 		It's a sad thing that we grow old so fast, and even sadder watching the people we look up to growing old and passing away. But let's learn from Lee to keep doing what we love, and keep loving the ones we hold dear. 		> I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo.

{"body":">I highly doubt that he felt that life was complete. 		What a grossly presumptive thing to say. You're heavily reflecting your own beliefs, rather then the actual reality of the situation. 		Based on what I've read, heard, and experienced, many of the elderly and terminally ill find some kind of peace with their death and life. Before he died, my grandpa repeatedly said, "If this is my time, it's my time. I lived a good life" and this kind of sentiment is very, very common in the terminal.  		And, as humans, we generally see death as the 'end' of life (at the very least our lives in these bodies), and we see our lives as 'our story'. So anyone who dies 'completes' their life story. The people who remember you may not feel like you had a complete life (fulfilling, successful, spiritually, what have you), but you still 'complete' your life when you die.		Don't get pedantic over this kind of stuff. There is nothing wrong with what they said. It was benign and reflective, so there's no need to talk like that. Death is a big part of life, and there are just as many different ways to view it as there are people. There's no need to 'highly doubt' something you can't possibly know, and there's no need to get picky about someone using the word 'complete' to describe something that, by definition, is a type of 'completion'.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"saztak","name":"t1_cs3og53","parent_id":"t1_cs2yk27","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1434070958,"created_utc":1434067358}
{"body":"First of all, I meant no offence by my comment. I was just giving my point of view, like you are doing with your reply to me. 		What you are describing is people *coming to terms* with their imminent death. 		What I replied to:          	*"I'm not sure if he died or he just completed life. RIP to a legend."*         	This seemed to me to imply that did so many cool things in his life, and was so successful, that he might have "completed" life instead of just dying, (like normal people do.)        	I saw "completed" in this sense to be comparable to the full completion of a game. This usually includes doing all the side quests, and mini-games. And in that sense, there's no "completing life" because no one gets to do everything. 		A few weeks back there was a radio program (here in Norway) about age, and why we age, and what scientists are studying now. Some people believe that we  are not so far away from a breakthrough that perhaps let us live 300 - 500 years longer. So they asked a question on FB some days before the program aired: "IF you could choose to get a treatment that adds 300 - 500 years to you life as a healthy person, would you take it?"		Most people would. Some wouldn't because they had an idea that life would be boring, and others figured that they needed to die to make place for the next generations. But mostly, people want to live. 		I also strongly believe, that if you ask (healthy) people if they want to die next week, most people, whatever age, would probably not like that. People still have things they want to do, they still have plans, they still want to be around their family, watch their grandchildren grow up, etc. 		That is what I meant my my comment. And that's a completely different things that coming to terms with death, and be pleased about the life you've lived so far.

{"body":"Fair enough, I agree you can never 'complete life', there's just too much going on. Then again, most people don't experience half the amount of things he did in his life, it's not too nutty to have the sentiment that you 'can't live much more then this guy has'. But there's a difference between completing life and completing *your* life. My issue was mostly with how you made it sound like Lee wouldn't have felt his life was complete (considering that's impossible to know, unless maybe you were close to him). It's important to keep in mind that there are lots of philosophies/outlooks that influence whether people might see their life as 'completed' at death (as well as influence how people see your death, like the commenter above). If you believe in fate, for instance, you might believe that your death is set in stone, so while you may try to survive with treatments, being safe etc, when it does happen, you're still likely to see it as the 'completion' of your life story, because you've done all you were meant to, and that's how it is meant to end. 		And yes, most people want to live, of course haha, no need to believe that, it's instinctual and safe to assume. But health is a key factor, there. It gets to a point (constant pain, limited mobility, decreased social involvement, future looking darker every year etcetc) for many people where they really don't have much to live for, so while they might not necessarily *want* to die, they are often relieved when their time finally comes. I'd say that's the case for a huge chunk of people who are terminally ill and/or elderly (ie; most of the people who know they're dying and have to think seriously about it), and that's the group that tends to see their life as having been lived to completion at death (even when they might not have accomplished much in the eyes of society).		Coming to terms with death and the idea of 'completing' your life, while not identical, are pretty similar to one another. How you handle your mortality has a lot to do with your perspective. The 'completed life' is an idea based on perspective, and how we chose to view the life-death cycle isn't really something that can be 'wrong'. If someone views it as a 'completion', you can't know they're wrong.		Interesting stuff to chew over, and I like to see how other people see this stuff.

{"body":"> it's not too nutty to have the sentiment that you 'can't live much more then this guy has'.		Yes. I agree. The most awesome thing is that he did it for so long. I just watched the last Hobbit film (concluding a disappointing trilogy) and there Lee was again, as Saruman. I've been thinking "Wow, this guy is still going!" for more than a decade! 		About you *issue,* I never met him, (though I wish I had,) so I can't really know how he felt about life and death. Maybe he talked about it in interviews? Idk. I was just making assumptions based on my outlook on life. 		But I think, perhaps, that we agree. We're really just talking about various definitions of "complete". One can also say that everyone sort of completes their lives when they die. (Just didn't do all the side quests and mini-games.) 		Btw, I don't believe in fate. Fate is a lazy way to justify everything. It takes away free will, and the point of thinking. You could even argue that a killer wasn't to blame because *fate.* I'm not buying into that. It's too incomprehensible. 		But, I DO believe that there a reason that we die from age. It's been a mystery for a long time, but they are getting closer to understanding about it. Something to do with [telomeres.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere) So when I fantasize about the future of human kind where people might live for many times as long as today, (if they figure stuff out,) I assume that people will stay "young" for a lot longer, and not being "old" for 300 years.        	I definitely understand that people who are old and suffering from sickness or other old people issues, can get fed up with living. So when I complain that life is too short, and when I say that I think most people would want to keep living, that's presuming that they could live a healthy life longer, and getting old (much) later. It's just wishful thinking really, but it's based on the human desire to keep on living. Why do you think many people find fiction about vampires so interesting? We allow the suspension of disbelief, and we get sucked into a fantasy with a human sub species of immortal people. Wanting immortality is probably also *part of* how religions came about. (Most of them promise immortal life, don't they?)		Btw, the accomplishments of Lee is impressive, at least in the eyes of the public, but really, to be fair, it's just different. He got to know some other legendary people, he had a long career as an actor, and even made music. Even so, other people might "complete" their lives just as well by living more typical lives. For my part, when old and dying, I would like to look back at my life remembering happy experiences and  happy feelings. I would like to remember journeys, wonderful people, and maybe believe that I was a positive energy in others lives.  This, to me, would be a "complete life" in the sense that I think you and the other redditor that I replied to mean.  I probably won't be remembered by future generations, but that's not important to me.		Sorry.

He brought a clever sophistication to those characters and brought a lot of joy to his fans. 93 is a good age for anyone to hope for, and no one could ask for a better way to cap off a career, and yet we will still miss him terribly.
