{"body":"I think it's fair to judge a person by what they voluntarily put out to the public. I've listened to most of his songs, and ive watched a good number of interviews etc. His unrestrained arrogance and egotism is one of the most unattractive qualities a person can have. He seems to be completely selfish, and at least if he is not, he has made no real effort to attempt to redeem his reputation.		2Pac said "I refuse to be a role model", but in fact anyone who gets big *is* a role model whether they like it or not. As a role model Kanye as a duty to exhibit positive character traits and show people how to live. Kanye's character is cancer though. Egotism and arrogance are the cause of pretty much every single problem in the world today.		He wants to appear like he "keeps it real", but yet he spends all his money on himself and his own luxury rather than trying to fix the broken system and support those in dire situations. Kanye is about as real as Bigfoot. He has skills as a rapper; really better seen in his earlier work tbh, but he is a shitty person. Anyone who is anywhere near that egotistical, self-centred and arrogant is a shitty person.		This world needs more good role models; even more desperately- poor black people in America need good role models. When Kanye blabs about how superhuman he is and spends his money on gold shoes or whatever the fuck he is betraying the people he was once a part of, and actually supporting the cannibalistic capitalist system that oppresses them.		If down underneath all that shit the 'real' Kanye is actually a good guy, well then he should try to show it and do things to redeem his rep. He doesn't though, and he keeps on doing hurtful and selfish things, so as a member of the public I feel I can accurately judge him from what he *allows* to represent himself in the public eye. I don't need to know him as a person. Who you are is shown by what you do.		I mean the Taylor Swift thing can't have just been a misstep, an unfortunate misjudgment. That shit is so incredibly severely wrong that only someone who was *hugely* out of step with correct ethical behaviour would ever get close to doing it. Really try to imagine what kind of person you would have to be in order to think that was a good idea. He's not just a bit of a dick.

Then asks, "he's in a wheelchair right there?" People say yes, and the song continues. 		Would it have been nice of him to apologize? Sure. He didn't "make" the crowd do anything though.

For example, I'm going to a concert next Sunday night. These tickets were extremely hard to come by, the concert sold out in like 9 minutes, so the artist added more shows. All of them sold out as quickly, he went from one show to five shows over that weekend. But leading up to the concert, my father has now had two surgeries. Yes, I'm still going because I love this artist and it's been 20 years since I've seen him. But I may spend the morning at the hospital with my father and then go to the show. I may be in the mood to listen and enjoy, but maybe not in the mood to party it up. 		That's just one example. You literally never know what's going on in someone's life. Some ppl can turn off their worries and abandon themselves, others can't.

I went to see a guy I'd seen twice before and loved. Now he's trying to make a comeback so he played a small gig in a bar. His voice was horrible. It was all I could do to sit through the show without walking out. There was no way I was inspired to get up and dance. That's what I mean when I say the artist should inspire me to dance, not tell me to dance. Be good and I'll respond accordingly.		I guess I should also explain that I don't get high or drunk at concerts. I don't need that to get me to dance.

{"body":"I say this to a lot to people. Kanye isn't in-and-out of rehab or jail. He doesn't carry a gun or associate with gang members. His songs don't promote crime or violence. He's not flashing his balls as he climbs in and out of his sports car for free press... he's not even a man whore. He's had like 2 girlfriends in 12 years, one of which became his wife and the other, he loved so much, that when she left him he wrote an entire album dealing with his broken heart. The lyric "I want to fuck you hard over the sink" might not be the most romantic sounding thing anyone has ever heard, but it's pretty sweet when you consider, in context, he's singing about how he wants to make love to his wife, whom he's very open about loving, as opposed to all of the other rappers who talk about they want to fuck everyone elses wive because all women are whores who don't deserve respect. Writing a song about how much you love your wife isn't something that should get you persecuted in the media. He writes about working hard and following your dreams. He sings about love for his family, falling in love, and starting a family of his own. He doesn't sport colors or sag his pants so his underwear shows... he wears high fashion, and tries to look good. He's confident in his ability as a musician and artist and he's open to the world about his innermost thoughts. You can't ever say Kanye isn't 'real'. ...and yet, the world hates him. Rothesburger raped a woman in the bathroom and people everywhere root for him to win the Superbowl. Kanye says "be yourself, follow your dreams", and people want him and his family burned alive.

{"body":"You don't even have to ask me. Rick Rubin and other musicians will tell you. Kanye brought the soul sound back to rap through his production and then his albums, most specifically through his work on Blueprint which was the foundation of the album and its direction. The direction of his albums becomes imitated not only by hip hop artists but by other artists. He popularized auto-tune, yes I'm aware of T-Pain's use of it, but it's Kanye's use of it that made other people step up who can't sing really and use it to make albums. His direction of where he's steered rap is why people like Drake and J Cole are allowed to exist. Kanye took rap back from gangster rap. "Pink ass polo and a fuckin' backpack, but everybody know he brought real rap back." And it's the truth. Many non hip-hop artists cite Kanye as an influence for musical style of production. His crossing over of hip-hop with electronic and his work with Yeezus has been and are continuing to already influence the course of music. Other musicians and producers will say this as well. You can even see Kanye's influence on Jay-Z's solo projects and Jay is one of the most influential hip hop figures ever.
