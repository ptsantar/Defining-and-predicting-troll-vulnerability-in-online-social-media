It's actually -	>Three leading preventable causes of not being able to join the military include being	overweight, lacking adequate education and having a history of crime or drug use.		To summarize a couple key points from the study that hopefully answer some questions you may have, although I recommend you read the whole thing its not that long and has some really good infographics that you should read.		From the report - "Mission: Readiness is the nonprofit, nonpartisan national security organization of more than 450 retired generals, admirals and other senior retired military leaders"	* WHAT HAS HAPPENED?		>What has changed dramatically is	our nutritional and exercise environment. Things that	would have been considered absurd in the 1960s are	now commonplace in American society, such as drinking	sugary drinks daily instead of milk or water, or watching	television and playing video games all afternoon instead	of riding bikes and playing outside with friends.		* MILITARY IS NOT IMMUNE		>Each year, thousands of recruits lose 20 pounds or	more to join the military, and they are at a higher	risk of gaining that weight back once they leave	basic training.","depth":0,"score":1940,"ups":1940,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GreyMatt3rs","name":"t1_cm9j26g","parent_id":"t3_2n0rir","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1416623616,"created_utc":1416623616}

There are all kinds of other factors that would then contribute to more people getting rejected (poor health in other areas, low IQ, flat feet, etc.). So the total percent of people unfit for military service is probably going to be upwards of 35-40% when everything is accounted for. That's pretty bad.		What I find worse, however, is the epidemic of obesity *within* the military itself. Luckily these budget and personnel cuts means they can start cutting out the fatties just for being fat. But the military really needs to address the cultural problem that's causing the obesity in the first place, and it ain't because they don't PT enough. It's highly processed food with tons of sugar in them, rampant alcohol abuse, and lax standards that is causing active duty personnel to become fat. One would think that military service would instill in those people enough self discipline to where they can control themselves around food and drink, but obviously that isn't something that's automatic.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"VampireKillBot","name":"t1_cm9l9yw","parent_id":"t1_cm9j26g","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1416629572,"created_utc":1416629572}

{"body":"But humans have effectively removed themselves from natural selection. We no longer have to have superior traits to survive because we can just correct them or rely on somebody who *does* have superior traits to do whatever it is that the person with the inferior traits needs fixed. 			EDIT: Because people are getting pissed off over this statement, allow me to clarify. I don't mean to say that humans won't continue to progress positively and that superior genes won't appear and prevail. I'm saying that we don't need to have those genes to survive any longer. People with inferior genes are able to live a full life in this world because of our advancements, and, as a result, natural selection does not operate the same way it does *actually in* nature. I'm not an expert on evolution, but I am quite well educated on the matter. I have a great love for biology and took AP Bio just last year, my sophomore year, along with passing the AP exam for it. Now, does taking AP Bio mean I have amazing experience with it? No, but it does mean I have pretty good experience with it, and not only this, but my teacher had said the exact same thing that I'd said, and it stuck with me: "Humans have effectively removed themselves from natural selection." Granted, I'm only a junior in high school, and I very well could take even more advanced classes on the subject of evolution/biology in the future, but AP Bio is already a damn good, credible experience, as it actually is a college course. Feel free to disagree with my statement, but you can't deny that it does have some amount of truth to it.			EDIT 2: Maybe if I give an example, like bad eyesight, people will see what I mean. In the very earliest of days, humans with bad eyesight wouldn't be able to hunt for food. As a result, they wouldn't get food, they would die, they wouldn't pass on these genes for bad eyesight, good eyesight prevails. Eventually, we start farming and domesticating animals. Now, in these societies, bad eyesight isn't detrimental to one's survival because they won't have a hard time hunting to get food because they can buy it.

I'm saying that natural selection acts on what genes are best for survival, as those genes belong to those who are able to survive long enough to pass them on.

No offense, but I'm not sure why that wasn't obvious to you.			>I'd be interested to hear more about your concept of "natural" and how you imagine that humans above other beings are separate from it.			Already told you that's not what I was saying. Humans are a part of nature. We've been undergoing natural selection just as every single other species has. I'm not saying, "HUMAnzzz r speshul so we arnt a part o naychur." I'm saying that natural selection operates very differently for us **now** because we have made enumerable advancements as a result of our intelligence that allow genes that would be detrimental to our survival, previously, to exist. This is no longer an issue, so any natural selection that *does* occur has very little to do with survival because we don't need to have the best genes to live. We just need to have something that can fix or deal with the problems we have. 			When I say, "natural selection," I'm strictly speaking of the principle of "survival of the fittest," which is the main idea of natural selection and the main, I suppose, "form" of natural selection that affects every single other species on Earth apart from humans. We do undergo natural selection, but no longer for survival. Most forms of natural selection we undergo revolve around what we find to be sexually appealing, but that's not even a reliable gauge of natural selection as people generally found unattractive don't have any real difficulty in carrying on their genes; in other words, ugly people still reproduce as much as pretty people. 			I understand that natural selection isn't just "survival of the fittest," but when speaking of natural selection weeding out the stupid from the intelligent, that *would* be representative of "survival of the fittest," and that just isn't happening to us anymore. So, when I said we've "effectively removed ourselves," I'm not saying that we don't change as a result of what genes are preferred; I'm saying that we don't change as a result of what is beneficial in terms of survivability because survival is no longer an issue for the majority of humans.			I hope I was descriptive enough and cleared up any confusion, but at this point, I really don't care because I'm getting so annoyed by all the people I keep having to reply to. If it still sounds like I'm saying what you're thinking I'm saying, then just know that I still wasn't descriptive enough and that you're misinterpreting me.

{"body":"Awesome you're thinking about these things! 		Interesting fact for you to chew on: Survival of the fittest is actually social theorist Herbert Spencer's term which he suggested to Darwin, who added it to a later version of his book. Spencer is also known as the grandfather of what we call 'social darwinism.' 		>that natural selection acts on what genes are best for survival		I mean, yes (er...kind of) ...but that's not the whole story. Goodness, where do I start?		First, you have to think on a much, much different time scale, for humans. Sure, different species of mosquito can (and have!) developed in underground subway spaces over 20 or so years, but for humans, natural selection happens on a time scale that anything that one many code as "intelligence" doesn't particularly act on. 		Second, the 'best genes for survival' is a very very relative term. Example A: What is good for survival in one environment, may not be best in another environment - yet the difference may not be great enough for the formation of separate species. Example B: A mechanism that allows you to survive Threat X in your life may actually put you at greater risk for Threat Y. This is the simplest way I can think of to demonstrate that evolution (ie: natural + artificial selection) is not about making the most indestructible, most-likely to survive organism. It's contingent on environment & ecosystem & climate, and so many other things. 		Third, there is no gene for intelligence or stupidity. So natural selection could never work on these things in the first place, even if they did objectively exist. Like your judgements about beauty and ugliness - these are largely subjective (especially at the time scale we are speaking of), and 'natural selection' doesn't really give much of a shit about them. 		Lastly, look up 'artificial selection' and the link between the two. This maybe will get you thinking more about what you mean by natural!		Also - it's interesting to think about climate change and natural selection.

The only other thing I'd have to say, though, is that this would probably only be a good example if the present-day conditions of these regions were very harsh and if the present-day people in these regions didn't generally do things to combat it because, if they did, natural selection would have less of a reason to act upon these people for certain conditions if they've already been combatting it outside of whose genes are more adept to deal with it.			>Third, there is no gene for intelligence or stupidity.			Well, of course, there's no "gene," but I do believe that one's temperament is very much inherited. Stupid people have a very different temperament compared to intelligent people. I think this is because one's behavior and outlook shapes what one is interested in, and stupid people's temperament simply doesn't value intelligence the same way intelligent people's temperament does.

Interesting point, though I think again, we have to think about time scale. I don't think it's particularly good practice think of natural selection "acting upon people" as this allows us to slip into the overwhelmingly common thinking that evolution is 'guided' by some force. (The vestiges of religion are deep and strong in our common consciousness.) Also, people are immensely mobile.

Were there any studies to back you up, I may consider this. However I don't believe temperament is "inherited." I would argue that it is overwhelmingly learned. Sure, levels of certain hormones may be somewhat genetically moderated. Yet how we (re)act in various situations is, I would argue, overwhelmingly socially determined. Also, you are assuming there are blanket measures for 'stupidity' and 'intelligence,' and that people are either 'stupid' or 'intelligent.' Humans just do not exist in these binaries, which are subjective, and any venture into philosophy, psychology, etc will bear out this statement.

{"body":"I regret not having pursued football. I tried in high school my sophomore year when some of the football team's staff approached me. Started training in the off-season as O-line, but the issue was that since I was considered JV, the coaches directed all of their attention to the Varsity team.		 What really stuck out was that I got little to no "real" help. They assumed I'd have come onto the field knowing their plays. I had no real playable knowledge of football outside watching it and flag-football as a kid. They taught basics and such but much of that was incorporated into the physical/cardio aspect. Anything else, the knowledge needed to be an effective Offensive lineman was "assumed," or I was largely ignored when asking for help. If it wasn't that, I was getting treated like I was at basic...so lose lose.		I was 6'5" about 290lbs at the time but I was the 2nd biggest guy, where at the time, the biggest guy was 7'2" and had been playing since he was born it seemed. The first day of actual pad-training, they put me up against him (tackling the cylindrical pad at the same time, but coming from opposite sides). Mind you, for proper tackling, you're suppose to keep your head up to avoid injury. The pads they had given me were too small/narrow, so they sat higher on my shoulders than they should have. I advised the coaches that I could not keep my head up between the helmet and the shoulders meeting and preventing my head from going up any further. They essentially told me in a very expletive manner to "deal with it," so I went and did what I could.		What happened? Exactly what I thought would. Head first against the big guy and felt/heard a cracking sensation/noise, my head went the way of a turtle and I blacked out for maybe 2-3 seconds right during the impact. Coaches gave me shit for "not keeping my head up." I determined that it was not worth my personal safety doing this, especially with these coaches who didn't really care all that much about it, so I quit after that incident. That was the first time the coach actually expressed any concern, was when I was done dealing with him.","depth":2,"score":39,"ups":39,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"tubachris85x","name":"t1_cm9hmcy","parent_id":"t1_cm9h3mb","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1416619944,"created_utc":1416619944}

Our recruiter has made it clear that if we show up and can't at least make minimum on day one, we will already be behind.		To answer the original question, yes, there is definitely some room to get in better shape during training, but not enough to go from obese to service ready.

Most people only think of the military, they imagine most of the jobs are akin to infantry stuff; but the military has plenty of need for roles identical to what you'd find in the civilian sector. 		Working in supply/logistics is (to a very loose point) no different than working in the backroom of a store or a distribution center. You're storing stuff, or moving stuff; only difference is the nature of the "stuff." Most of the time your ass is going to be sitting on a forklift, while the supervisor is in an office. Military still needs people tracking finances at a desk, or someone to run through all the paperwork and take your photo for your Military ID card. There are *tons* of "low exertion" jobs that are demanded by the military, and are required to be performed *by* Military personnel. There is a reason why other branches of the military jokingly call the USAF the "Chair Force." 		So many people relapse into bad habits after basic, too. Big problems like never leaving your past behind (still contacting that one problem "friend" in that previous gang life), to stupid shit like not being able to manage finances or getting warnings/reprimands for being a general P.O.S. slob (you know, landlord's worst nightmare).		A bad diet is a habit no different than the stuff mentioned before. 		Also doesn't help that there are fast food places on base as well.

{"body":"EDIT: This isn't a ready made excuse for soldiers to be overweight. Rather, a scenario of how it may have gotten this way.		In terms of the active service, I have a lot of concern that some leadership decisions are making matters worse. How can it not just be the soldiers' poor eating habits you ask? I'll give you my example of how it can be difficult to maintain weight by using our units situation:		As a maintenance soldier, it is my purpose to keep our combat vehicles FMC, fully mission capable. We're allotted a total of 12 soldiers to maintain our battery's vehicles, but we only have 7, even though a unit was shut down that shared soldiers with our same MOS, they were shipped to another post. 		Now, what does this have to do with Physical Fitness? Well, being understaffed has caused us to be backlogged with dead-lining faults, and parts are usually put on deferred maintenance, until the new fiscal year. So when the budget is opened up, all the parts we've been requesting for months come in, in bursts. Because leadership doesn't like to report any parts received/not installed, we work on vehicles at 0600 instead of doing pt. We also work through breakfast, and most of the time through lunch. 		So instead of going home and eating healthy meals, or at the DFAC, we send a soldier with our money to scrap up food from the PX or shoppette, which are generally not loaded with many healthy choices, and the food quality of the healthier choices provided by AAFES is piss poor. This doesn't include soldiers who live on post, which have to be given time to eat chow as expected. The only way to really know you're getting a decent meal is to pack one yourself, which is fine, but that still doesn't negate the fact we work through PT roughly 2-3 times a week, plus no PT on Thursday as it is SGT Time Training.		Now your compounding missing PT on a regular basis, with having to order food out due to workload. Because we're low on soldiers, our team cannot keep up with working off the old faults as new faults show up, and the cycle continues.		So, after working approximately a 10-11 hour day, we're expected to do pt on our own to make up for what we miss in the AM. But, this all falls back on the leadership focusing on one aspect of their mission; maintenance. Most commanders and 1SG's of combat arms MOS's take pride in their soldiers' fitness, but could give a flying fuck about support roles, and this is where the obesity issue continues to be perpetuated.		Just to be clear, none of our soldiers are complaining about the workload we face daily, we understand with missions coming up, that these vehicles need to be fixed. We take pride that we work as hard as we do at our jobs, and have been recognized multiple times for our hard work by our leadership, all the way up to the Brigade level. 		I've fortunately have been able to keep my weight within standards, but especially for soldiers with children, this type of stress does make it very difficult to maintain standards.		TL;DR - Many troops work through PT a lot and the shoppette food sucks. PX has nothing but fast food in it as well.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TJ_Longfellow","name":"t1_cm9vbjs","parent_id":"t3_2n0rir","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1416672888,"created_utc":1416672888}

{"body":"This "obesity" in the military is BULLSHIT. It's a great excuse to slim down the military though. Let me explain:		I was once in the Navy. I was 180 lbs and 6'2". I could barely run the 1.5 miles within the allotted time and pass the push-ups part of our semiannual physical readiness test (PFT). My shipmate could run his 1.5 three minutes faster, but weighed around 230 lbs. This guy was mostly muscle, but still had a lot of fat. Now since he didn't pass his "rope and choke" (body fat measurement test) he would automatically FAIL his PFT!		So I guess you can run fast, pass your sit-ups and push-ups, but fail overall because of measurements. I've seen pure muscle buff types fail because of this too. Now they used to just give a waiver, but after so many waivers (and the need to cut enlisted numbers) the military just decided to not let you reenlist. That's tough on a guy who would want to stay in the full 20 years.		Anyways...rant over.

{"body":"EDIT:  TLDR; The Navy is horrible at getting fatties in shape		I was fat my last few years in the military.  My own fault.  I was placed onto a fitness enhancement program (FEP) three times.  All three times it was for having body fat >22%.  The third time could have resulted in being administratively separated, but since I was only 3 months from the end of my enlistment, I was able to finish out my time.  		Anyways, the way the Navy handled fitness was retarded.  In order to determine body fat percentage, a "rope and choke" was performed.  The circumference of your stomach at your belly button was measured and then your neck.  Subtract your neck measurement from your stomach and that gives your true body fat, according to the Navy!		Being a fatty, I knew I had to lose 15 pounds in order to avoid being rope and choked.  Unfortunately, I only lost 12 pounds before the weigh in, so I had to get taped.  At 5'9", 193 pounds,  with a 39 inch belly and a 15.5 inch neck equals 23.5% body fat. Alright, fare is fare.  I was overweight.  BUT, the very next guy in line had to get taped too because he weighed more that his height would allow.  He was actually an inch shorter than me, but weighed 210 pounds.  He measured 38 inches around the waist, and had an 18 inch neck.  Therefor, at 20% body fat, he wasn't obese according to the Navy.  		On top of that, FEP was horribly managed and misguided.  All three times I was on FEP, I didn't lose weight, since all it was exercise.  In fact one time I gained 3 pounds of muscle, but since my measurements didn't change, I was still fat.  I was stronger though!  I can understand putting someone on the FEP program who couldn't do the run, push ups, or sit ups.  But it didn't make any sense to me to put people on the program who were overweight, since it didn't solve the obesity problem in the first place.  Instead, they should have simply ordered me and the other fatties to lose weight.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mclumber1","name":"t1_cm9gxfx","parent_id":"t3_2n0rir","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1416618244,"created_utc":1416618244}
