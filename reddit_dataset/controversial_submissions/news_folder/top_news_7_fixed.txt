It has always escalated it, enhanced it, improved it, expanded it, made it more devious and cunning. Every failure, is a reason to make it stronger, better, faster.		And you might say "yeah but they shouldn't spy on 'us'"... Who is "us"? You say you are innocent and shouldn't be spied upon, but how can the government know that without first spying on you? Is there a lack of home-grown terrorists? Lone wolves? The government looks at anyone that is suspicious. That's always been true in every nation in the world. They detect suspicious people by first looking at the bigger dataset: pretty much everyone of the right age, traveled to certain places, and mostly males.		This is how powerful and effective the spies are: The FBI even interviewed the Boston Marathon attackers. They flagged their citizenship request, marked them in terrorist databases. They just couldn't arrest them for their free speech. They simply had no criminal record. A victory for free speech, but many innocent people died. You think government will give up that power? (It's irrelevant if they stopped it, failed to stop it, or almost stopped it. It's about detecting it, they succeeded in that and those two guys weren't even connected to a terror group).		Just think about it. You don't have to believe their justifications, believe their effectiveness, or believe their methods are right or moral or legal. You can reject it outright. But the government will never give up this power. They'll just reword it so that you won't get angry about it. 		This is a reality you have to accept and adapt to.

What if they do work, and you just don't believe it due to the hype and anti-government hatred on reddit?		They (privacy advocates) argue it's ineffective because it is in their interest to remove any spying, no matter what. So lying about its effectiveness helps them get donations to their privacy organizations. It helps them try to convince congressmen to attack these programs. In the end, privacy organizations don't care about security, surveillance effectiveness, or spying's effectiveness. They care about bashing government because that is the only way privacy can be violated. 		They don't really know how effective any of this is, nor do they care about its effectiveness. If you care about it's effectiveness, then you clearly are not in the same boat as privacy advocates. Because all the experts that know about NSA programs say it is effective. Many of them testified under oath in congress that it is effective.

Ahh, well yes. Legalese is *intentionally* written like that, for several reasons. It is hard for passion and emotions to get out of hand when even "radical" legislation is read like a bureaucratic instruction manual, and the dense verbiage allows the law to be extremely specific and deliberate. Unfortunately, there is the negative side effect (or primary malicious intention) of the law turning into a tomb of unreadable nonsense. This alienates and disempowers the average citizen who finds it difficult to keep up with the law. This is also why some bills for seemingly simple matters are thousands and thousands of pages.

{"body":"I respect your take on it, at that's an honest reaction. I myself come from a somewhat privileged background, and knowing I had it easier than a lot of people bothers me but life isn't fair and that's not my fault. To eliminate poverty Americans have to decide that's what we want. It's gong to take people accepting that this country is inherently unfair to some. There's no quick fix for sure, and if you want me to name some policies I could try but it's really much broader than that. 		When my parents came to this country in the late 70s, this country was set up to reward people who worked hard with a middle class lifestyle. Education was cheap and world class, and working in a factory would pay enough to buy a house and put the kids through college. The reality of the global economy has changed the situation so we're never going to be able to go back to that exactly. Yet there are so many things we could do to make it less punishing to be poor and allow people to work their way up, instead of trapping them there. Our poor don't have it really good compared to the poor of other developed countries. We are the richest country in the world, so comparing us to third world countries isn't right. 		All the wealth is being concentrated at the top, so the average American isn't getting richer but everything is costing more.

I'm not sure what rich majority there is to blame. The rich are a small percentage of this country. The super rich, who are the ones who do the influencing on the highest levels, are even smaller. Rich and poor have always existed but in today's world it doesn't have to be that extreme. It's the extreme wealth and poverty that ruins any country, and balancing it out creates a more equal and prosperous society. Greed is as natural as love, those with the most have always wanted to keep it that way. The fact that today in America they have bought out our government and effectively control the media, it has become harder to see what's been going on. 		The facts don't lie though. Our country has been hijacked by those with the most. The same problem is spreading to the rest of the world, and it's really on us as everyday Americans to say enough is enough.

{"body":"Heres the basic rundown.		NSA currently collects bulk metadata on basically every American citizen as well as huge amounts of foreigners. They collect internet metadata (what websites you visit, when, how long, data you transfer, what you buy), phone metadata (who you call, when, how long, sometimes what you say), and they link these datapoints to a profile, kinda like facebook which they can then link to people you know. All in all it gives them a fairly comprehensive story of your life.		The phone bulk metadata program was a part of this whole system, not small necessarily, but one of the smaller parts seeing as the internet metadata program is so much more complex and intrusive. 		The USA Freedom act that they just passed DOES NOT stop even the NSA's collection of phone metadata. Instead it forces the phone companies to store your metadata and they must make it available to the NSA with an order from the FISA court, the secret court who has rarely ever declined a request to spy since the NSA started the program.

{"body":"After 9/11 the American government decided that there were things that the American public didn't need to know about. This extended to things like the rationale for invading Iraq, the undertaking of massive spying programs, and even photos of dead servicemen returning to the States.		The justification for this was that it would compromise American security. It was seen by those who disagreed with this action as a convenient way to cover up the bad actions undertaken by the government. It seemed (and seems) clear that all of this secrecy - which includes secret courts, secret laws, and secret legal documents that explain how/why the executive branch can disregard laws it doesn't like - wouldn't survive public scrutiny. And according to the vote, you'd be right.		What Edward Snowden did was shine a flashlight on programs that were greenlit by this secret infrastructure. And you'll notice, those in our government who disagree with Snowden eat from the trough of deceit that he exposed. To my knowledge there are no good-faith actors that are calling for his head.		Anyway, TL;DR - that secret infrastructure is being used to circumvent the will of the people by disregarding laws that the executive branch deems worthy of disregarding.		This started under the George W. Bush administration and is one of the primary reasons that his detractors hate him so much. He wrapped himself in the American flag and proceeded to do very un-American things (namely, all of those secret things).		Now, Obama, who campaigned under the (now cynical) banner of HOPE has codified, entrenched, and has extended this secret legal infrastructure rather than tear it down.		And that, in a nutshell, is why Obama can disregard this particular voting outcome.		To be fair, attorneys for the executive branch have to make their case to a judge, but to anyone's knowledge, these judges have never said no and there are no voices opposing it on the other side. So it's theoretically possible that Obama would be denied but since it's in secret, even if this were to be the case, it's Classified.","depth":2,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EntropyFighter","name":"t1_cs21yyr","parent_id":"t1_cs1udiy","subreddit":"news","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","created":1433964820,"created_utc":1433961220}

Even if you think positively about him. We can all fully agree that his intentions are to damage the US, not to protect liberty. When he revealed information to China about cyberwarfare, or to Germany about spying on Merkel. This doesn't help the American public. This helps foreigners. But the NSA is hired to spy on foreigners, so it is ridiculous for you to blame them for doing their job. It's very clear that Snowden wanted to damage the US, to spite it, hurt its relationships with other countries, and hurt its reputation. It's not about his care for civil liberties and everyone knows that. He admitted to John Oliver in interview, that he didn't even read everything he gave to foreigners. That is espionage 101. There is no way around it: any jury in the country would sentence him for espionage. He admits he didn't read all the documents that he gave out to literally foreigners.

It's a lot less daunting for people to campaign their city/county/even state government than federal. I think we should start pushing to become more involved in our local communities and solving these problems in our localized groups. Then other locales see the change and they feel more motivated after seeing that it can work. Then it becomes a domino effect. Maybe it's idealistic, but I think it's more pragmatic than expecting our federal government to ever get its head out of its ass and work for the people instead of the corporations. 		We need to invest in schools, turn from prisons being 'time-outs' to being rehabilitation, and changing the culture of the police force and making them be active in our communities and seen as protectors and friends, rather than power-drunk gestapo. 		The only way any of this will happen is if we figure out how to get the average citizen involved. I think the first thing is to shift the focus to local communities rather than country-wide communities.
