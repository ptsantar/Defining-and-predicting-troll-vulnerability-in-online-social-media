This is typical bullshit that we ALWAYS see out of the corporate news networks during an election cycle.  		On a side note... we need livable wages based of local cost of living instead of nationwide, kick the can, minimum wage increases.  		15 dollars an hour is barely enough to support a family in seattle.

If you are trying to support family of four on a single income working forty hours a week at minimum wage then you are an idiot and a small minority of cases. I worked plenty of shitty jobs before I started my career. My senior year of highschool minimum wage was around $7/h. I only had two summers of work experience but I nabbed a job for Home Depot paying $9.50. After that I never had another minimum wage job. Now I make less than $15 dollars an hour. So you know what I do? I DONT GET ANYONE PREGNANT. Im no Brad Pitt but I still get laid enough to satisfy me. So I am very careful. Because I can't afford a baby right now. This shit is not rocket science and I am sick of people acting like you must be able to make a career out of being a cashier. minimum wage jobs are not meant to support families.

Well honestly you shouldnt be having children while you have a shit paycheck. But unfortunately we have stupid ass abstinence only sex ed in many parts of the US. Huge percentages of the population are incredibly ignorant about the risks of having sex and how to mitigate those risks.

Or are you going to try to use one of the Nordic countries where the unemployment rate among millennials is about as high as Greece's? 	Really you are using a bunch of rules to complicate the situation above and beyond what minimum wage does. You want to dramatically increase how much an employer has to pay an employee regardless of their skill or effort. Unless you are talking about universal income which would come from the gov. 	The problem with all you central planners is that you never take into account the sheer cost and the effect of stagnation. Providing universal income to every American is obscenely expensive. I used to be a big fan of the idea in order to replace broken hand out systems but the staggering cost would require an extreme tax increase which would dramatically reduce spending and business. 	If you are talking about forcing employers to pay more then you are simply going to get far far far fewer jobs. 		I hate how when people see a problem their immediate response is to spend a shit ton of money on it in order to make and enforce a huge ton of new rules. Your big fancy new system will cost a ton and in 20 years it will be so tied up on itself and its own rules that its efficiency will decrease dramatically overtime (see medicare, medicaid, ss, ACA). How about instead we focus on increasing freedom. People love the idea of freedom until they realize it is directly linked to responsibility.

This sounds like you are talking about businesses with the pockets getting lined and the corruption, I know the head engineer for the orange county water district, he gave me a tour, and he showed me a really interesting map. 		There are 4 different chemical blooms in the Orange County portion of California's water table, mostly degreasers, with one that was a detergent of another kind (for textiles). The OC water district knows what companies caused these blooms, and has asked them to pay for the cleaning of them (the water district is willing to do all the work to ensure they get cleaned properly), of course the companies are refusing to pay, and the only way to get them to pay, is to ask the EPA to step in and sue them, and of course the companies drag out the legalities for years, and pull every trick they can to not pay. 		The fact that you can manage to convince yourself that the EPA is corrupt is both really scary, and a little sad. Its scary because if you had your way, California would very quickly have no drinkable water, and the companies would be long gone. 		>The unelected Bureaucrats affecting peoples livelihoods is wrong and I will always vote for people having the ability to provide a living for their families over the over regulation any day! 		I cant decide if I should laugh or cry, if you want to protect peoples ability to make a living, try raising minimum wage and stop letting businesses destroy the economy (and environment) for profit. 		>Until the world gets China, Braa and Indonesia to consider the effects I do not believe the U.S. changes are going to do squat, buying carbons is crap! I assume you ride a horse everywhere as to not harm the environment? The U.S. is the most environment conscience Country that takes steps to be friendly to the environment and I believe it is right but I believe there are limits! 		Given how wrong this is, I can only assume you got this from fox news, America is awful when it comes to environmental protection, yes buying carbon is a bad idea, but its the only limit that had any chance of getting past Republicans, any real attempt to protect the economy gets shot down. 		>I live in the County of CA that has had the cleanest air for years and it is in the works to try to ban fireplaces although for many residents it the only heat source, Government overstepping once again, I believe Government is out of control on ALL levels! 		Once again, I can only assume you just saw this on fox and blindly believed in it. Yes our air is getting cleaner, mostly because of the restrictions put in place to prevent businesses from destroying the environment. 		Yes the government is out of control, when a business can leave chemical waste everywhere, pay people far less than a livable wage and pay no taxes. destroy the economy for profit and get away with it. 		Its people like you, who can somehow manage to convince yourself that America is super strict on business (thats a laugh), that we are some really green country, that the EPA is corrupt, and who get all this bullshit from fox news and never question anything. You are making America an embarrassment to the world, and letting companies destroy the country that we are supposedly leaving to our kids.
