I've been a Niners fan since I was a 6 year old in 1991. Also I have done this largely in part because i live in Louisville, KY. We dont have a proteam so it makes it a little easier becausse I don;t have to deal with living in say St.Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and NAshville fans.

{"body":"Eh, there's been a lot of bad news, but it's not *as* bad as it seems. Willis was already out a lot last season and Borland stepped up for him. Honestly even with all of the losses, I don't think the defense will be much worse than last year. As I said Willis is a big loss, but he was already gone a lot of the season. Aldon having a (hopefully) full healthy season will help him get back to the Aldon of 2 seasons ago, and if Bowman can come back they'll still have a great line. The secondary's not great but honestly was probably one of the only positions that may have imroved last year. 		What I'm worried about is the offense. The RB position isn't a huge loss physically, but the biggest imo emotionally. Gore's been amazing but he's old, Hyde's not a huge downgrade and has more of a future, and Kendall Hunter will be back. But losing guys like Gore, Willis, and Smith all at once takes away a lot of the veterans and changes the team dynamic. The O-Line was weak last year and lost Iupati, the only one who's really great at his position. That's what has me the most worried. 		Basically the Niners have obviously downgraded. They could potentially be good if Kaepernick really steps up, the team does something about their offense, and the defense doesn't devolve too much. The Torrey Smith and Anquan Boldin combo seems like a silver lining in all this fog. But realistically they will probably decline this season. I still think they will be a semi-competitive team though. Not a playoff team, but not bottom 3 team.","depth":3,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BoredomHeights","name":"t1_cpb7f6x","parent_id":"t1_cpb57vq","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1426060744,"created_utc":1426057144}
{"body":"I'll forever be faithful to the 49ers, I hate Jed York, he got way too greedy after he brought Jim Harbaugh, who completely changed the organization.	I hope they let Kaepernick be Kaepernick this year, hes been crap lately but they dont let him do what he does and thats run the ball. O-line was weak last year because of injuries, our center was on IR and Anthony Davis kept missing games, losing Iupati sucks but he kept getting injured throughout the year.	All the cornerbacks that played last year and were healthy like Chris Culliver and Perrish Cox are free agents but I'm sure theyll pick up one in the draft.	Torrey Smith is a good addition but I was banking on them picking up DGB in the draft, hes got size and speed, and is perfect for a deep threat.	This season is a big one and a lot is on the line, I don't think they'll decline, last year the team was really banged up and the locker room was in shambles with the harbaugh conspiracy of him leaving and they still pulled an 8-8 record. I think this year will be different.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"babbumaan","name":"t1_cpbcto5","parent_id":"t1_cpb7f6x","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1426082873,"created_utc":1426079273}
