And part of moderating means developing and moulding the community we want to see. The e-sports post yesterday was an example of the community we don't want: people arguing and directing vitrol at anyone and everyone who doesn't agree with them (this was happening on both sides.)		It's much easier for us to just step back and say, "Okay, this is only leading to argument after argument, maybe it would be better if we just removed the content and try this again some other time."		I promise that as mods we'll keep this debate open at least between ourselves (since we're the ones who have to make the rules), and in the future we might allow e-sports to be posted here.

If I were a moderator, I'd have created another space for the topic and, well, moderated that discussion.		Posters in the thread seemed to have four main categories: sports, motorsports, mental sports, and esports. By simply expanding the first category into "physical sports" (a term many used in that thread), they'd be able to create an all-inclusive category. 		It's undeniable that the mainstream definition of a sport falls under the definition of a "physical sport". If you gave a ten year old crayons and asked them to draw a sport, they wouldn't draw a computer, but likewise, they probably wouldn't draw a car or a chess piece. I think that's a manifestation of norms, but I don't think the social norm of a sport should define the definition of a sport, and I honestly believe those norms will evolve over the upcoming generation or two.","depth":0,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ItzWarty","name":"t1_cle1qgm","parent_id":"t3_2jq3vy","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1413758725,"created_utc":1413755125}

{"body":"Hey, sorry I haven't replied to this yet. I had work, I was lazy, I didn't really feel like it, etc. But, now I have time and nothing better to do, so I'll try to explain our (read: my) opinion on all of this.		First of all, it was my idea to allow e-sports here. When a user messaged us last week, asking us if we'd allow him to post about the LoL tournament, I was the one who gave him the go-ahead. Yesterday, the other mods followed that precedent by allowing the photo to be posted, but only because it fell into a grey area which we hadn't really dealt with too much before.		So, the thread went up and up and up, until it was at the top of our front page. And there it stayed for much of the afternoon. At the time I removed it, it was sitting at a few thousand points and had around a thousand comments. People liked it, and were talking about it. The community was in support!		But, then you look at the comments. When you look at a post and the top comment has one of the 'controversial' markings, you know you're in for a bad time. And holy crap, was that thread bad. If you haven't seen it yet, look at the /r/subredditdrama post about it; it cherrypicks some of the worst examples. But even that was far from everything, probably about 85-90% of the comments were debating the sportiness of e-sports. Going by our sidebar rules, all of those comments should have been removed. (The "comparison Posts" guideline is poorly phrased, but it was originally meant to prevent people arguing over whether things like NASCAR or bowling counted as sports).		So we almost unanimously decided, as mods, to pull the thread, and put up a sticky post explaining why it was removed. This was mostly to buy us time to have a debate of our own as to whether e-sports should be allowed here or not. So for the time being, we won't allow those posts. We are however having the debate between ourselves, since it is after all up to us as to which content is allowed to be posted here.","depth":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AdvocateForLucifer","name":"t1_clf3ql2","parent_id":"t1_cle1qgm","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1413853684,"created_utc":1413850084}
