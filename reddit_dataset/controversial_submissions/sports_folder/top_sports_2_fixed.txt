Not only are members of the military the most respected, lionized class of American citizens, wounded veterans are even more so (not that I'm saying it's wrong that they are, simply pointing). Yes, it takes bravery to fight against people who want to kill you, and yes it takes bravery to stand up from something that has crippled you - but at the same time anybody in that position would find themselves with so much universal support and acceptance that it boggles the mind.		On the other hand, Jenner, while he didn't risk his life or lose any limbs took a decision that could have, and amongst many circles did, make him very unpopular and even criminal. Jenner risked widespread public contempt, which he actually did get from many places, in a society that is...hardly known for being all that great with LGBT issues - but *especially* bad with Transgender issues.		In other words, one guy risked life and limb but had all the support in the world. The other guy didn't risk life and limb, but had tons of contempt directed towards him because of a decision that is otherwise inconsequential for anyone but him.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"paulatreides0","name":"t1_ct52kjd","parent_id":"t1_ct4uuo9","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437028912,"created_utc":1437025312}

On the other hand, in the Hollywood/LA circles that Caitlyn Jenner runs around in, what she did isn't that controversial at all. You can see that by the widespread support and acclaim she received in the celebrity world and by many Americans at large. (It's not as though she came out as a transgender woman in a rural conservative area where that would be unheard of.) I think more controversy came about her receiving the award since she's been largely inactive in the athletic world.

Some sexual theorists would say that gender identity is fluid and that Caitlyn actively chose hers (I honestly don't know where exactly I stand in the whole sexuality is socialized/genetic debate). She is a biological male who has actively chosen to express herself as a woman in probably about as accepting an environment as you could ask for in terms of her direct social circles. So we must acknowledge that there's an element of choice there as well.		And I don't think that the physical and spiritual toll of being handicapped should be shrugged off because he "knew the risk when joining" an "unjust war." I'm not a servicewoman, but I agree with your sentiments that vets are lauded. However, beyond the initial "Hey man, thanks for your service," injured vets have to individually contend with and the deep, dark realities of PTSD and psycho-physical trauma from battle.

It's not accepted. If it were, he wouldn't need to put up with all the shit he does, including people attacking or belittling him or telling him to go die.
