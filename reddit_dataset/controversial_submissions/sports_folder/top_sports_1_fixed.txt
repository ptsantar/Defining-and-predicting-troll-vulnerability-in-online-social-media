{"body":"It looks like the player has never tried to catch a dog. Every time I've grabbed one by the hips to get a better grasp, it got aggressive and "toothy", more so when there is overwhelming external stimuli. I'm sure he'd have gotten bit if he managed a better grip, and then kicked it or punched it without thinking, so in a way the ball boy did save the dog (but only from an asswhooping).  	  	Still, I do think the title is misleading and over the top.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DocWhirlyBird","name":"t1_ck80emn","parent_id":"t1_ck7zvfh","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1409757781,"created_utc":1409754181}
