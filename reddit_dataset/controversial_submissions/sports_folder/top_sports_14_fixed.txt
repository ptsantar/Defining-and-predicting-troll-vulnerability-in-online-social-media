I grew up in the Jordan era. These motherfucking people are crazy.

{"body":"I wish victim blaming was all a misunderstanding.  I really do.  There are many men, who see a young woman in a vulnerable position such as passed out drunk at a party and believe that it's her fault for putting herself into such a vulnerable position.  And many people of both genders would say she was at least a little bit to blame for putting herself there.  		There are many women who see a man in a similar position and think nothing of taking advantage of him.  		Now obviously there is a pretty big difference between a picture of genitalia and rape, but I believe that the kind of logic used to blame a rape victim for their own rape is strikingly similar to the logic used to blame a star for their own embarassing photos.  And maybe that kind of thinking is a problem that we as a culture should address.

Abusing blacked out or barely standing people is obviously ridiculous attitude, but I don't think I have to babysit every girl at a party while drunk myself either. We can't confuse "victim blaming" with calling people out on acting irresponsibly. Drinking makes we do things we wouldn't do while sober and might regret. That's no secret, if you decide to drink you should be responsible about it or at least guarantee there will be someone there to take care of you if you loose control.

{"body":"should be 10, but it's actually like 50. some fancy rave party. we do speaker placement/wiring, but there is decorrrr so the lowhang regression is what takes up the time as we tag team.	can't complain, the whole shebang is what gets me paid and my main thing is being an accounting intern. 		i did make an ass out of myself in this thread. i like lebron. i was at the MSG game when he did that triple double. i remember it well because there was a deal at the time...somthing about david lee and "you get 2 hotdogs and 2 beers with your tickets... it was even like $22/ticket" i dunno... (ridiculous deal, not sure of the specs, but close to it)		anyways, lebron is fascinating to watch play live. at least from my one experience. i am a fan of his he can clap his balls in that chalk for all i care.		the thing with lamar has to do with the pedo scandal that went on in my high school. the guy who ran the basketball program ended up pleading guilty. same timing when lamar got into crack began his tumble.		i don't believe lamar was a victim himself, but i do know some of our friends were, and i swore to keep them anonymous, it's complex, but perverse if you can handle it.	it's catholic school so it wasn't exactly on tmz or espn. it is a rehashed story, but definitely troublesome for our alma mater. pretty hush hugh. forget girl rape, but guy rape? yeah right... who talks about that?	http://nymag.com/news/sports/bob-oliva-2011-3/			that's the juice, but he plead guilty and it's curious how he scouted lamar, got him out of our HS bc he was getting into trouble (my outh is shut), and through this whole shit. it was sad to see lamar fall during this time. how he wasn't associated with the media is beyond me. maybe i am biased bc i knew 2 of the guys. but erick barkley made an NBA stint and he is coaching the same HS again trying to fix it.		there is something broken here. it's male rape in sports in a HS league. it cost 2 NBA players their futures and i guess that is why i am bitter.		TL:DR 		google: "bob oliva" who scouted and coached lamar odom.  look at the dates of his conviction, and match them with lamar's downfall. trust me. you should be able to put it together. yes, it is that disturbing.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SteakMarsala","name":"t1_cs41xr1","parent_id":"t1_cs3xo83","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1434103381,"created_utc":1434099781}
