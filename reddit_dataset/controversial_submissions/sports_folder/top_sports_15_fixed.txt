{"body":"And the black background could represent the willfully ignorant hypocrisy of the edgy, holier than thou redditors that whinge about working conditions in Quatar when conditions in Asian countries, where most of the components that their electronics are made from originate, are as bad or worse.		>Nearly a third of some 350,000 workers in Malaysia's electronics industry - a crucial link in the international consumer supply chain - suffer from conditions of modern-day slavery such as debt bondage, according to a study funded by the U.S. Department of Labor.	>The survey by Verite, an international labor rights group, found that abuse of workers' rights - particularly the tens of thousands from low-wage countries like Nepal, Myanmar and Indonesia - was rife in a $75 billion sector that is a mainstay of the Southeast Asian country's export-driven economy.	>Several U.S., European, Japanese and South Korean multinationals have operations in Malaysia, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Sony Corp (6758.T), Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N, Intel (INTC.O), and Bosch Ltd BOSH.NE.		http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/17/us-malaysia-labour-report-idUSKBN0HC08E20140917		>A new report released this week has found that of the big electronic firms like Apple, Microsoft, Sony and Samsung, only Nokia can prove that it pays its factory workers a living wage. The report, compiled by Not For Sale in the U.S. and Baptist World Aid in Australia, looked at the supplier working conditions at 39 of the world's biggest tech companies and found that, with the exception of Nokia, all were unable to prove that their factory workers are paid a livable wage. Only half of the companies could identify all their suppliers at the final stage of production and less than one fifth of the companies could accurately confirm the source of their raw materials.	>Apple, for its part, released its eighth annual supply chain report this year that found 23 underage workers at its suppliers' facilities. In 2013, Apple's audit uncovered 74 underage workers at a single supplier. The latest report also found that Apple's suppliers achieved an average of 95 percent compliance with its standard maximum 60 hour work week.		http://www.idigitaltimes.com/your-smartphone-created-slave-labor-among-major-tech-companies-only-nokia-can-prove-its-factory		>Child slave labor is a tremendous problem in the world; and the largest country in the world, in terms of population, is one of the places that are guilty of this horrific practice. The country being referred to is China. As a matter of fact there are several industries in China that use child slave laborers. Some of the industries that use child slave labor are: the brick industry, the toy industry, the coal industry, the cotton industry, the tile industry, the electronic industry, the foundry industry, the grape industry, and the fireworks industry. Many children in China are forced to work in sweatshops for these industries; where they are exploited by money hungry business owners. They are treated horribly by the managers of the factories and are never given the respect they deserve.		http://ihscslnews.org/view_article.php?id=337		>The day after Apple announced that it had doubled its profits last quarter on the strength of iPhone 4s sales, the New York Times has published a bombshell of a report on the conditions inside the Chinese factories that produce all the gadgets Apple fanatics crave, and it???s not pretty. In short, your iPhones, iPads, iPods, etc., are essentially being produced in slave labor camps.		http://uproxx.com/technology/2012/01/ny-times-investigation-confirms-that-apples-factories-in-china-are-basically-slave-labor-camps/","depth":2,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"quaellaos","name":"t1_cro9vej","parent_id":"t1_crnrgqh","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432862099,"created_utc":1432858499}

{"body":"Yeah, OK, new reddit posts piggybacking off the logo parodies is really going to do something too, right? 		Yes, sponsoring human rights abuses is WRONG in every way. But, if you are going to name and shame a couple companies for it, you might as well name and shame every company that knowingly and systematically abuses their own workers in sweatshops and factories in other nations. But no, let's give more power to our already crappy media by circlejerking around reports of bribery and human rights abuses. Is this shocking to people? If it is, you're out of touch with reality. That's what corporations do: bribe, steal, kill, and just about anything else to get better earnings reports. They are not charities, they are not people, they don't care unless it affects their business, and with some companies like Comcast, even if it affects their business, they still don't give a shit.		Nike sees no reason to do anything about this because it will blow over, just like literally every other circlejerked issue on reddit. A month or two from now, nobody will remember this. If people actually followed through with actions, it would have an effect, but let's face it, it is nearly impossible to boycott companies like Nike when half the nation doesn't even know or care about abuses, and in order to boycott any companies that abuse workers, you lose fashion, or you become a hermit. I don't think many people are up to the challenge.		And you know what's really disturbing? The sponsors get more recognition for their wrongdoing here than FIFA. FIFA is the Nazi Germany of sports organizations. Corrupt, greedy, and doesn't care about who dies. The sponsors just want to advertise their product to a huge audience, since football/soccer is the largest sport in the world. You can't blame them, you'd probably do the same. They're there to promote their product, whether or not they support the ethics of FIFA. FIFAs Qatar situation is their own fault, and the fact that people watch these games gives them more support, so they see no reason to stop. Until FIFA is reorganized or disbanded, none of the sponsors will stop. It should be widely known by now that FIFA is an unethical and evil organization, but it seems to only be coming out now.","depth":3,"score":-12,"ups":-12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Inaspectuss","name":"t1_cro1sv7","parent_id":"t1_crnz1ni","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1432848600,"created_utc":1432845000}
