{"body":"ESPY is defined as "Excellence in Sports Yearly". As in, the past year. Caitlyn did NOTHING in sports. Her choice was an elective one, and although courageous and inspiring to a lot of people, it had NOTHING to do with sports. She is not an athlete. Bruce was. 40 years ago. 	The award should have gone to either Lauren Hill, Noah Galloway, or, in a stretch, Leah Still. All of them define courage, because they were not given a choice. They dealt with circumstances beyond their control, with a strength that most humans could never understand. But, in all fairness to what ESPY's stand for, my vote went to Lauren.	Lauren lived with brain cancer for over a year, and yet still fought not only for her life, but to continue to play basketball, and to raise money for cancer awareness. She stuck with her team until the very end. Her story is one deserving of being immortalized forever, even if its in the tarnished halls of ESPN and their "award" show.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"towers43","name":"t1_ct5jajg","parent_id":"t3_3dgrry","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437069722,"created_utc":1437066122}

{"body":"Let me get this out of the way, right off the rip: I'm a former Corpsman. FMF. Spent a lot of my time treating wounded Sailors, Marines, Soldiers, Airman and civilians. My older brother was Army, and was KIA overseas after I left the Fleet.		With that said, Caitlyn Jenner has shown immeasurable courage with her personal life being placed in the public eye as it has been. This country, and indeed the world, is filled with hateful people. So yeah, she's shown some courage.		On the flip side, and this is the major thing why I disagree with her receiving the award, is that as courageous she has been, the issues she faces are nothing compared to what, in my opinion, the rightful honoree has to deal with.		Noah Galloway is an Iraqi War Veteran. A double amputee. In an era where **22 Veterans take their own lives *EVERY DAY*,** Noah has refused to play the hand he's been dealt, and continues to show immeasurable strength, courage, and commitment to his Brothers and Sisters. 		While both serve as inspirations to their respective communities, the issues facing the transgender community are slowly but surely getting better. I'm in no way diminishing the hatred, misogyny, and general shitty treatment the transgender (as well as the entire LGBT community) receive. I am, however, saying that the overall culture is shifting to be more and more accepting of them. 		On the other hand, we Veterans are still treated as lepers. When people find out you're a Vet, they instantly ask if you've ever killed anyone. Or if you saw any of your friends die. Or if you have PTSD. When you say yes to any of those questions, people tend to shy away from you. They think you're dangerous. And speaking of PTSD, the help available to the Veteran community is woefully lacking. Take it from someone that the VA could not get to. The system is over-taxed, under-funded, and (no offense intended to the quality providers at the VA) inadequately staffed to handle the numbers of men and women coming home with issues from their time in service to their country.		Regardless, I'm happy for Caitlyn Jenner. She's a brave woman. In the end, though, Noah knows he's got courage. We all know it. And just like a true Soldier, he doesn't seek recognition for his deeds. He's a humble man, who will continue to serve as a motivator for those of us dealing with our own struggles. And he'll do it tirelessly, until his last breath.		Godspeed, Noah.

{"body":"> On the other hand, we Veterans are still treated as lepers.		Come on.		I agree with you on issues with the VA and all that. I think it's deeply wrong to send people to war and to give them less than the best care afterward. It's embarrassing. But how long has it been since a soldier got an award for being courageous? Has it been 24 hours? On the other hand from the shitty care from Veterans, you've got a huge war hero fetish in the US. Yeah, the same people who "honor" the troops will shrug at PTSD, but at least you're getting *some* recognition. At least you can bring up your problems without being ridiculed and told you've made it all up.		If left up to a public vote, a transgender person would never be recognized for their courage. It would be a soldier every time. Even if we went a generation without war (yeah, haha) as long as a soldier is still alive somewhere, that man or woman would be seen to be inherently more deserving of recognition. Is it possible that acknowledging the courage of trans people in general (beyond Jenner herself) is worthy of one award? It's just one (crappy ESPY) award in the history of awards. Is that too much? They should ALL go to soldiers? Noah Galloway isn't the first veteran amputee. He's just one that has also become a reality TV darling. He's a pop-culture commodity. Giving an award to him would be like honoring a stand in for all veterans.

{"body":"It's not that Galloway is a Veteran, or a double amputee, but that he has continued to thrive in the face of both physical and mental tragedy.		Noah had to learn how to walk all over again. How to dress himself. How to do day to day tasks that you, and I, and even Caitlyn Jenner take for granted. It's hard enough for a completely healthy Veteran to come home and deal with PTSD, let alone when that struggle is complicated with physical disability.		If I really wanted to be a dick and throw a Veteran out there who did nothing more than become a woman, just to compare evenly to Jenner, I'd throw out Kristin Beck. Former Navy SEAL. Best of the best, kind of guy, becomes best of the best kind of woman. She happens to be an awesome woman, and it was my pleasure to know her both before and after her gender reassignment. But the thing with that comparro is that neither of them should be eligible for the Arthur Ashe. Neither of them have any relevance to sports. Sure, Jenner was a ridiculously talented athlete in her time, but her relevance to sports is non-existent. Same with Beck. She's a hell of a warrior, but she's not exactly a sports figure in modern times.		All in all, I am not supporting Noah Galloway simply because he's a Vet. I'm supporting him because, even as a non-Veteran double amputee, he would be more deserving than Caitlyn Jenner. That's all.

I think he does receive plenty of deserving acknowledgement for his persistence, as do many other people like him. 		>Sure, Jenner was a ridiculously talented athlete in her time, but her relevance to sports is non-existent.		So Galloway runs marathons now and that makes him more related to sports than the star of the 1976 Olympic Games - the person hailed as the greatest athlete on earth for a time? They gave this same award to Nelson Mandela. They gave it to Muhammad Ali and Billie Jean King decades after they retired.		>All in all, I am not supporting Noah Galloway simply because he's a Vet. I'm supporting him because, even as a non-Veteran double amputee, he would be more deserving than Caitlyn Jenner. That's all.		The only reason most people are talking about Noah Galloway is that some right-wing blogger dude wrote a post that went viral ranting about this. Galloway was not a "runner up". He's the same as the other 7 billion people who did not win the award. Some right wing dude was just salty about an LGBT person receiving a mainstream honor. I am quite sure that Noah Galloway is not literally the most courageous person in the world. The point of this award is not to choose the bravest person, objectively, each year. The point is to honor someone who is courageous. ESPN shone a spotlight on not just a person, but on people who are *never* honored for their courage. There is still plenty of acknowledgement to go around for Galloway and men and women like him who have thrived in the face of great difficulty. Those guys are routinely honored and respected. 		You see, if this thing didn't have such a virulent backlash to it, this could have a real positive effect. Trans people are often fucking terrified to come out. Transitioning is trading an internal struggle for an external one and many people suffer for years smothering themselves in private turmoil in order to not to make that trade. Making that trade, though, has a measurable positive effect on mental health despite the rocky road of public opinion. Having a mainstream acknowledgement of the courage it takes could do so much good. If it makes some people feel like maybe *not the entire* world will be against them, then giving this award to Jenner will have done some good. Coming out and being yourself shouldn't have to be courageous. But right now it takes courage for people to help themselves, and closeted trans people *only* ever receive signals from mainstream culture that they should stay in the closet. 		Is it not OK to take this *one* moment to say that trans people can be courageous, too? Is that too much to ask? We have to go back to honoring the only type of person that is already steeped in praise and adoration, because trans people don't live up to mainstream standards of bravery? Hell, the fact that this is deeply unpopular is kind of the point. This chorus of voices is showing exactly why it's a good thing that someone mainstream took 30 minutes of one night to acknowledge transgender struggles. It's not the magnitude of their courage. It's the complete deficit of acknowledgement of the courage many trans people do have (and desperately need).","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IsupportLGBT_nohomo","name":"t1_ct5li1v","parent_id":"t1_ct5fsbo","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437072873,"created_utc":1437069273}
{"body":"At what point, in any of my posts, have I not said that Caitlyn is courageous? Or Kristin Beck. For fuck's sake. I'm not taking anything away from Caitlyn at all, only saying that Noah is far more deserving, given the struggles he has to overcome on a daily basis.		Caitlyn has no physical impairments. Has been supported by the vast majority of people (save for the bitter, hateful assholes that will exist no matter how far we progress). Has a ridiculous amount of financial gain coming over the next several years. Is the decision to get gender reassignment surgery after coming out as a transgender individual a courageous one? Yes. Is her decision to put her whole life on display for public consumption a courageous one? Meh. That's up for interpretation. Exploiting it for financial gain cheapens it for me (but, that's just my opinion).		On the flip, despite ridiculous physical disability brought on by the traumatic amputation of two limbs, Noah Galloway has excelled in some of the most grueling athletic challenges. Hell, the dude competed in the 58 hour long Death Race. A race so grueling and challenging, that most ABLE BODIED athletes couldn't hack it. He consistently surpasses able bodied athletes in the Crossfit Games. He's finished marathons. All while dealing with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. You know, the cause of 22 suicides per day.		Noah has risen above both the physical and mental handicaps that fate dealt him. Rather than allowing himself to wallow in the bottom of a bottle, letting his mind and body falter, watching his family fall apart, he's chosen to continue as a fighter. Adversity is what we do. We're taught to embrace the suck. Noah's avenue for dealing with his challenge was to seek outlet in sports, and to not just be better than other amputees, but to put able bodied athletes to shame as well.		While I fully support Caitlyn, and (I say it YET A-fucking-GAIN) I applaud her courage, I do not feel she is more deserving than Noah Galloway. Jenner was a brilliant athlete 40 years ago. Noah is not just a brilliant athlete now, but has shown immeasurable strength and courage as he continues to rise to any and all challenges put before him. I'm also pretty sure that it's a bit easier to put a very personal decision and situation in the public view when you stand to make millions of dollars.		You want a true hero for the transgender men and women out there? Kristin Beck. Former Navy SEAL with literally the best of the best of the Special Operations world. She was a SEAL for 20 years, including time with DEVGRU (Team Six, for those who don't know). Kristin is an awesome woman, was an amazing SEAL, and is an all around hero for all, not just the transgender community. If it weren't for the pressing of a psychologist from Georgetown for an interview, Kristin may have never had her story told outside of the the Special Warfare community. Coming out to a group of the roughest, hardest-fighting, trigger-pullers on the planet takes some serious chutzpah. And no one even batted an eyelash. Kristin is still a badass.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hotelcharlie22","name":"t1_ct5mxf6","parent_id":"t1_ct5li1v","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1437074909,"created_utc":1437071309}

I'd rather her not be the one trans person that gets all sorts of attention. She isn't representative. Though, she does have enough money to have moved to any country in the world and transitioned in private, probably without anyone knowing where she went. So she has, at least, chosen a harder path and I could give her the benefit of the doubt that it's not for selfish reasons and that it will benefit others.		>While I fully support Caitlyn, and (I say it YET A-fucking-GAIN) I applaud her courage, I do not feel she is more deserving than Noah Galloway.		You're completely missing the point. I'm trying to point out that this isn't "Caitlyn Jenner v Noah Galloway COURAGE death match!!!!11!!1". It's not even trans people vs amputees. If society decides what type of person is courageous above all others, and then only give awards to those people, there will *never* ever be acknowledgement of the courage that some transgender people have, or any other type of courage. This is about honoring all kinds of people and all kinds of courage, not just picking amputee/cancer survivor of the year. Physical struggle isn't the only struggle. Mortality isn't the only fear that takes courage to overcome. By your standard, nobody would EVER acknowledge any other type of courage.		>I'm also pretty sure that it's a bit easier to put a very personal decision and situation in the public view when you stand to make millions of dollars.		I wouldn't be so sure. I wouldn't trade places with her. You know how many people I'd like to know about my transition? None. I'd like for it to not be a thing I'm known for at all. It's in my past and I've never ever experienced anything good from someone knowing about it. Being paid more millions when I already have millions wouldn't factor into it. I'd have disappeared with the money I had if I were her.		[This](http://imgur.com/DSFooRU) is the kind of shit that's all over social media every time she is brought up. Right now my local newspaper's facebook page is 50 comments deep into ranting about mental illness, trans-species, perverts, genital mutilation, and whatever the fuck else comes to these people's minds when this subject is brought up. This happens over and over again. it's a 10-1 the ratio of haters to supporters at least. I don't think many people would take money in exchange for their gender transition being the subject of mass national ridicule. It's really easy for you to say that it's worth it for the money. It doesn't look like it to me.		>You want a true hero for the transgender men and women out there? Kristin Beck.		Yeah, well, neither Jenner nor Beck are my "heroes". I honestly don't care that much that a person was courageous and then transitioned. Good for them. But that doesn't make me want them in the spotlight. I think the people who are the best examples of us are people who have a broad knowledge of other people's experiences with gender and can communicate really effectively about it with the masses of ignorant people. Jenner and Beck aren't that. I especially don't like that Beck has a lot of criticism for people who are trans and don't live exactly as she thinks they should. Also, both are conservatives and come across as a bit selfish. I'll have a hero when someone comes along that makes my trans status not a fucking detriment to my career, or even having a job, or makes it so that I could be out and treated like a normal person.

Merriam-Webster definition of Courage:		*noun; mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty.*		Caitlyn Jenner has turned her gender reassignment into a multi-million dollar media circus. She has profited both financially as well as in regards to publicity. While I do applaud her for bringing the issues facing the transgender community to the forefront of the public eye, her profiting by it is in poor taste.		This is all aside from the implications that the Arthur Ashe was promised to her in return for giving the exclusive interview to the same network that happens to run the ESPYs. However, this is still America and I am a duly sworn agent of the law, and as such, we presume innocent until proven guilty. Despite that, the taint of impropriety is enough to put a bad taste in a MAJORITY of people's mouths.		During the preceding 40 years (you know, since Caitlyn was an Olympic Athlete), Miss Jenner has maintained a life that was counter to her identity. That is difficult. I'm not cheapening that. But her decision to undergo this procedure has had NO IMPACT ON THE WORLD OF SPORTS.		Michael Sam, being the first openly homosexual player in the NFL, was a monumental event in sports. Abby Wombach running over to plant a kiss on her wife at the World Cup was huge, because the impact was felt far beyond the United States. Caitlyn Jenner's gender reassignment surgery has absolutely nothing to do with sports. It has as much to do with sports as anything I do now (former high school athlete, oh them glory days). Let me ask you this way: If Oppenheimer came out as a transgender woman 40 years after the Manhattan Project, would that be a momentous occasion in the world of physics that deserved an award? No. It'd be brave, no doubt, but it isn't something that should have been compared to athletes whose bravery had more recent impacts on the sporting world. Hell, between Noah Galloway (lost two limbs; still kicks ass), and Lauren Hill (19 years old when she lost her battle with cancer; raised over a million dollars for pediatric cancer research), Caitlyn Jenner's struggles seem kind of paltry.		But hell, it's easier to make an attack on the way I'm phrasing my argument (which it was never meant to be, just a statement of opinion, but hell, since you asked...) than it is to counter it.

What courage is there in up and deciding you are now a woman and making boat loads of money from magazine deals, awards, TV show appearances and interviews?

As we may have all noticed trans issues have been for the past couple months at the forefront of media outlets, and for good reason. 		There are a few threads through out this subreddit discussing the recipient of this award, the majority of them highlighting the lack of courage that Caitlyn Jenner is demonstrating by simply "dressing like a woman" and stating that trans issues are dated and no longer an issue within our community. The simple fact that the title of this thread refers to Caitlyn by her former name along with the plethora of  negative feed back present in the comments throughout this forum are enough to justify her award and speech. Yes there are some if not many people who heard Caitlyn's speech and empathized with her and are aware of the trials and tribulations the LGBTQ community face, but then there are the people on reddit, people within the crowd of the ESPY Awards such as Chris Culliver and Garrison Hearst (both publicly homophobic professional athletes) as well as those athletes who have smartly kept their personal opinions to themselves that validate the timing and reasoning behind the recipient of this award.		Yes, Caitlyn comes from a highly publicized family run by PR teams and television appearances but that is all the more reason why she is such an opportune candidate to be spreading awareness of trans issues amongst a broad cross section of the public. 		Have we forgotten that Bruce Jenner was a star athlete, an American icon bursting with masculinity and testosterone. It is hard to understand her turmoil of living 65 years under an umbrella of heroism knowing that her gender identity could easily ruin her reputation. But now as trans issues become more pressing, Caitlyn is no longer being just a beacon of hope for those striving for atheletic excellence but also a beacon of courage for those struggling to make sense of themselves and the sometimes incredibly spiteful community that surrounds them.
