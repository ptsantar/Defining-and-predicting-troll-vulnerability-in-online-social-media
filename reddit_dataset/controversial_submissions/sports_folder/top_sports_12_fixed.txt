{"body":"To give some context, Hawthorn (the brown and gold team) are the reigning champions two years running, and last week they absolutely made mincemeat out of one of their recent rivals, so much so that they were labelled "scary" and "terrifying".		 Essendon (the red and black team) have been embroiled in a performance enhancing drug scandal for the last two years, which they were acquitted of two weeks ago. Not only did this put a lot of stress on the club, but the coach was suspended for a year and just returned late last year, and the players were provisionally suspended over the off-season, preventing them from playing in practice matches. As such the players have lacked a lot of match fitness when it comes to the final quarter of the game. 		Because of this, to come out and defeat the best side in the competition in such a way is nothing short of miraculous.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ComradeSomo","name":"t1_cqab6hz","parent_id":"t3_32bk2u","subreddit":"sports","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzy","created":1428888099,"created_utc":1428884499}
