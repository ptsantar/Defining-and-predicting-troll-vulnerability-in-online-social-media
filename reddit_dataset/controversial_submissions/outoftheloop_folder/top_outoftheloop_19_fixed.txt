{"body":"The show is about the people in a prison.  It's hard to summarize because the show focuses on being a "slice of life" in the prison.  The show has some conventional plotlines of various kinds---for instance the second season has a long arc concerning one prisoner attempting to organize some prisoners into a gang and the first season spends a lot of time on the romantic life of one prisoner, but the real focus is on the lives of the individual people in the prison: who they are, how they ended up in prison, how it's affecting them and their lives.","depth":0,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elseifian","name":"t1_css6x48","parent_id":"t3_3c4co2","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436041400,"created_utc":1436037800}
{"body":"It is a show about prison, although being in a women's prison, there are lesbian relationships. There are a wide range of characters on all parts of the spectrum. Some are butch lesbians, some are other types of lesbians, some are bisexual, some are straight and some are Christian and hate lesbians etc. etc.		As for grit? It doesn't shy away from some of the terrible stuff of prison, but there's also a lot of comedy to the show (as weird as that is to say).		In total, I would characterize more as a drama/comedy about women's prison life.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"johnadreams","name":"t1_css71e5","parent_id":"t3_3c4co2","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436041661,"created_utc":1436038061}
{"body":"I'd say there's a ton more grit than say, Oz.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Shiranaru","name":"t1_cstg86d","parent_id":"t1_css71e5","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436155964,"created_utc":1436152364}
{"body":"It's not about lesbians relationships.  That is a part of the show, but that is because the show is about a women's prison and lesbian relationships occur in such settings.  The Lesbian story lines makes up maybe 5% of the show besides a couple characters who have a lot because they are predominantly lesbian.		The show is really about a woman who gets ripped out of her upper-class lifestyle and thrown in to prison.  It's about her and her fellow prison mates.  What they did to wind up there, as well as story lines happening in the prison during her stay there.","depth":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GldRush98","name":"t1_css9953","parent_id":"t3_3c4co2","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436046418,"created_utc":1436042818}
{"body":"As being a straight male, I get flack for watching the show.  It has the label of being a lesbian show but I don't think it is.  Like the previous poster stated it's about 5% lesbian relationships.  The character development in the show is phenomenal, especially in the third season.   The show has gotten away from being mainly about Piper and more ensemble.   I heartily recommend watching it.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"boogeyman270","name":"t1_csslc9d","parent_id":"t3_3c4co2","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1436076328,"created_utc":1436072728}
