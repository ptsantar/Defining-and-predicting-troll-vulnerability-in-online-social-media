{"body":"As of November 2014, there were 174 million accounts on Reddit. Obviously that number includes alts & banned users, but that still makes Reddit probably the largest web forum to have ever existed. You're going to find everyone from unabashed & self-described racists, to anti-racists, and everything in between. Some people will upvote anything that's not politically correct just for the sake of doing it. So, it's hard to say that Reddit is all one way or the other. It's just too huge of a population.","depth":0,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BeforeTheRobots","name":"t1_conaybo","parent_id":"t3_2w1muj","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1424113712,"created_utc":1424113712}
