{"body":"The biggest impact besides the casual violence was likely how everything was shown out of continuation. The end of the film wasn't the end of the story for the characters involved, and piecing bits of that together kept the audience focused and engaged. Also, along the same vein the contents of the briefcase chauffeured around for part of the film was never revealed to us, causing widespread speculation as to what it really was, the most popular theory being that it was the soul of the crime boss played by Ving Rhames. It makes you think deeper about seemingly nonsense scenarios.		Additionally, dark humor wasn't as common as it is nowadays from what I can recall. Offhandedly blowing someone's brains out and passing it off as a my bad was, and still is pretty hilarious. Combine this with the unexpected conversations between the main characters often discussing trivial events/occurrences/items with enthused zeal makes for interesting situations. What's more, amidst a seemingly ridiculous assortment of scenes with no more apparent value that what we take as an attempt in shock, awe, and humor-- there is more to the story. it's about birthright, loyalty, cowardice/bravery. Perhaps most prominently, redemption.","depth":0,"score":33,"ups":33,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rainyday156","name":"t1_cjf6ess","parent_id":"t3_2cgb4k","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1407019636,"created_utc":1407016036}
{"body":"Best dialogue I've ever seen in a movie. Badass characters, TONS of one liners and quotable scenes, the revival of John Travolta's career, amazing cast, a perfect mix of humor and action and an overall great storyline.		Personally it's the best movie I've ever scene. I've watched it a dozen or so times. 				But that's just what i like about it. To answer you're question, I think people like it for different reasons, and if you don't like it, then that's ok too. I'm that way with Scott pilgrim, everyone I've talked too loves it and I find it insufferable.","depth":0,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Clamwizard","name":"t1_cjf6spl","parent_id":"t3_2cgb4k","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1407020578,"created_utc":1407016978}
{"body":"I agree on Scott Pilgrim, but it helps if you watch it assuming Scott is a delusional, murderous stalker suffering from hallucinations. I liked Pulp Fiction, too, for more-or-less the same reasons as you, but not as much as you do.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"almillarskovich","name":"t1_cjfagqt","parent_id":"t1_cjf6spl","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1407029549,"created_utc":1407025949}

{"body":"I rented the DVD about 2 yrs. or so after the film was released.  Many of my friends were nearly rhapsodic about it, yet a few didn't think it would be my cup of tea.  I should have listened to the few who knew me best.  The movie was jagged, without plot, and aside from a few clever tidbits, the dialogue was banal.  I "got" the movie - but it left me "oh hum" and wondering why it took so little for many to be entertained that much.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Barry_the_Hirsch","name":"t1_cjhaavn","parent_id":"t3_2cgb4k","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1407218672,"created_utc":1407215072}
