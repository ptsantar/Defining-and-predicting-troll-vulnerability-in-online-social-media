{"body":"One thing that I do think is worth mentioning is that Paul Walker wasn't one of those celebs that do crazy amounts of drugs and end up in the news after getting arrested every other weekend. He did a lot of charity work (I believe he was actually leaving a charity event when he got into that accident) and was pretty much an all around nice guy so the whole thing is looked at as a bit of a tragedy.","depth":1,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"originaljackster","name":"t1_cql6lh1","parent_id":"t1_cql46nw","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1429736595,"created_utc":1429732995}
