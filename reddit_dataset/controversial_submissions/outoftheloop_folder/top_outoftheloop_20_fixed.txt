{"body":"TLC, a TV network in the US that does a lot of "reality tv" about families with something special (lots of kids, family of dwarfs, etc.), has a show called ~~13 Kids and Counting~~ (Edit: Holy shit it's 19 Kids now. [19 Kids and Counting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_Kids_and_Counting)) about a family by the last name of Duggar who have a ton of kids because their religion tells them they should just keep having kids.		One of the sons, Josh Duggar, was recently found to have molested several girls, including a few of his sisters, when he was a teenager. There's quite a bit of debate about whether or not he committed a crime, whether he was responsible for his actions (he was 15ish at the time), whether the family covered it up vs did everything they should have, etc.		[Here's a section of wikipedia specifically about the controversy around the molestation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Duggar#Molestation_controversy)","depth":0,"score":10,"ups":10,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AtomikRadio","name":"t1_cs0phfn","parent_id":"t3_396a0x","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433870124,"created_utc":1433866524}

{"body":"He did do it, he confessed. There are two reasons the parents never reported it. 1: their religion teaches if a girl or woman is molested or raped it is their fault for the way they dress. 2: they were raking in millions with their show and didn't want to loose their money.","depth":1,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Trtlman","name":"t1_cs0wx7s","parent_id":"t1_cs0phfn","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1433881280,"created_utc":1433877680}
