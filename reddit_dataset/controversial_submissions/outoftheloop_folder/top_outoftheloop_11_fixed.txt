{"body":"She is a feminist SJW on youtube (called Feminist Frequency) who who is best known for her series discussing female gaming tropes (stereotypes essentially). In those videos she criticizes women's role in video games as damsels in distress, objects with no agency, who are serialized to appease male teens. She goes through many examples in her videos. She also did a TEDx talk on the subject iirc (Which is not a TED talk apparently)		She is loathed by many gamers for several reasons. One is that she at best is severely exaggerating the sexism in video games, at worse lying and doing terrible research to find examples. People did not like her referring to Zelda as a mere damsel in distress. There was also the fact she talks about violence against women in games when men are just as likely be targets of said violence (An example is in Hitman of all games, where she accuses it of encouraging men to attack strippers...even though the game penalizes you for attacking civilians). 		Then there is the fact that she took other gamers footage of games and used it for her own videos without giving credit (not illegal but looked down upon). And the fact that she asked donations to do this project in the first place. Only for her to use other people's work and do terrible research. 		Last is how she's reacted to criticism. She's complained of death threats and being attacked on twitter and such and disabled comments on her videos as a result. While some have accused her of faking the death threats. For the cherry on top she has contradicted herself on whether or not she is a gamer. At one point she said she was not a gamer and at another she claimed she is. 		Basically many people find her to be a lying SJW who made her videos for profit, disabled discussion on her videos, and portrays herself as a victim.		While supporters claim everyone else is just butthurt misogynists","depth":0,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ProN00b","name":"t1_cl33k4g","parent_id":"t3_2il543","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1412714778,"created_utc":1412711178}
{"body":"I don't have much to argue about your post, but it should be noted that, to my knowledge, she never did a TED talk. She did a TEDx talk. There is a very big difference. TED talks are not independently organized and have fairly high standards. TEDx talks are independent of TED and can be run by anyone about anything with no standards. Hell, some TEDx talks I've seen push pseudoscience akin to the Secret or are nothing more than people doing poetry jams.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Derrythe","name":"t1_cl4v75r","parent_id":"t1_cl33k4g","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1412878459,"created_utc":1412874859}

In short, Internet people reacted the way they always react to feminism. A lot of people started harassing her and posting really, *really* horrible things on the Kickstarter page. The initial goal was for a few thousand dollars, but after the harassment started, a lot of attention poured in, and the Kickstarter raised over $100,000.","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RoarShock","name":"t1_cl36mvn","parent_id":"t3_2il543","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1412720337,"created_utc":1412716737}
{"body":"I saw a youtube video that talked about that. Apparently she had said some rude things that angered a lot of gamers in her past few videos, disabled commenting on the videos, so all the angry people went to her kickstarter to comment about it. 		Then she did an 'experiment' and she allowed votes for a few minutes after the video was posted, received several dislikes on the video before the video could even be finished by someone watching it, and disabled voting, unable to comprehend why that would be the case. 		Those are the two main things I remember from the videos I watched. Plus her lack of sources she uses.

{"body":"She's a feminist who ran a successful Kickstarter to make videos about women and sexism in video games. The major reason that she is unpopular online is because she misrepresents things in games to make them appear to be sexist when they aren't. For example, she said that Hitman: Absolution is sexist because you can kill female civilians, drag their bodies around, and then hide them in dumpsters. However, she fails to say that you can do the exact same to male civilians, and that the game punishes you for killing any non-targets at all. She has also used gameplay videos without the permission of the uploaders, and she doesn't credit them. Apparently she is also behind schedule for making the videos, despite receiving much more money than she originally asked for.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"megadog14","name":"t1_cl33t89","parent_id":"t3_2il543","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1412715222,"created_utc":1412711622}
