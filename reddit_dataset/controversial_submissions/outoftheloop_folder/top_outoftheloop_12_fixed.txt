{"body":"Because you are apart of it. In gaming, I'm proud to see my friends beat a game I told them about. Being born in the U.S; you are apart of a whole and could possibly change the country.","depth":0,"score":16,"ups":16,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Predatormagnet","name":"t1_ct8rf33","parent_id":"t3_3dugcy","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437329054,"created_utc":1437325454}
{"body":"I understand it with friends, but why should I be happy if anyone I've never met, but is born in the same country, is famous? I have nothing to do with him. The only connection I have with him is that we are born in the same country.	It is obvious that I would be happy if one of my friends is that famous, but not a stranger.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Zeigerful","name":"t1_ct8sd38","parent_id":"t1_ct8rf33","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437330894,"created_utc":1437327294}
{"body":"You don't. Back in the day when modern countries were developing, a sense of nationalism occurred due to being more advanced, larger, and smarter than other countries. If Einstein came from Germany, Germans must be pretty smart right? Today nationalism is reserved for extremists and HARDCORE2THEMAXX Americans.      You don't have to feel pride about Olympians or Marines just because they were born in your countries.","depth":2,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Predatormagnet","name":"t1_ct8sok1","parent_id":"t1_ct8sd38","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437331504,"created_utc":1437327904}
{"body":"You are assuming that people should behave in logical, explicable, consistent ways at all times.   They do not.  One of the areas where people are least likley to behave logically, is where nationality or other group identities are concerned.","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spiregrain","name":"t1_ct8spkt","parent_id":"t3_3dugcy","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437331559,"created_utc":1437327959}

{"body":"Not exactly. I know people who are proud to be Hungarians because Hungary, a small nation, was, is and will be the birth place of lots of geniuses. Many of them will have Nobel prizes. We are proud of our nation because the potential is in us. We are a nation in a position in the world, where lots of people get the option to become this educated.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KorianHUN","name":"t1_ct8x7mm","parent_id":"t1_ct8swgp","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437339991,"created_utc":1437336391}
{"body":"I think it's having pride on behalf of your group. Take sports, for example. If I were to say that I'm proud of my hometeam, it's less me personally being proud, and more I'm part of my hometown, and I strongly identify as a member of my hometown. Then if my hometown should feel proud of the team representing hometown, then I'm proud of the team, even if I'm not directly involved.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"princeyuuri","name":"t1_ct8xiv3","parent_id":"t3_3dugcy","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1437340588,"created_utc":1437336988}

{"body":"Your proud because you a part of the people that won.		For instance, Chicago Blackhawk fans didn't win the Stanely Cup, but they are proud to be Chicagoans and Hawks. It's because you feel like you helped make it happen (and this is only about sports).		You watched every game.		You know every player and his dog's name.		You know the history of the organization.		You know important moments in the team's history, it's best players, and it's greatest victories.
