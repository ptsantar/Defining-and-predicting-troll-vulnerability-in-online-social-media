{"body":"This is a tough question to answer without being down voted to oblivion or causing a flamewar. 		Anita is a youtuber who makes videos called "Tropes versus women" on her channel "feminist frequency" where she discusses negative portrayal of women in fiction, and how media can, in her view, serve to re-enforce gender bias. The controversy covers multiple fronts related to that series. At the core of it is the idea that her successes with the show are undeserved and that her beliefs are wrong.		Many people view that the examples she gives are delivered as out of context, or without proper support for her arguments against. Others feel that she, a self-confessed non-gamer, is missing the point by not playing the games, or that her criticisms are unjustified for it. Others object to the way she funded the show, claiming the kickstarter for the show was a sham and that the money she made has not been used for her show, but rather gone into her own pocket. Others still feel that her criticisms are an attack on their favorite pastime, and that by drawing attention to such issues, she is trying to ruin their games by forcing them to become something different. 		The other thing you need to remember is that, in certain circles online, the term "Feminism" is a toxic and loaded word. For some, the term is just inherently offensive because they feel that women are actually inferior and they don't want feminism at all. For others, actual feminism (as in women being equal to men) isn't an issue, but that most self-identified feminists are "social justice warriors" (SJW's). SJW's are seen in a negative light as easily offended crusaders who are making things worse by trying to force unnecessary changes to society, as they feel they are being oppressed by "the patriarchy" (i.e. the current, rich white male led, status quo). 		The big problem is within her show itself. She not only points out examples of sexism in these games, but on more than one occasion has said that the problem is not only with the creators for making such content, but that the audience wants this type of content. She routinely calls videogames a "male power fantasy" and the implication can be made that the audience who plays them are as much to blame as content creators. To some people, this can be seen as a personal insult; the idea that a label which they identify with, is actually a horrible thing to be.		For all these reasons (and probably more to be honest) Anita Sarkeesian is hated.","depth":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Nambot","name":"t1_crfl4sz","parent_id":"t3_36kj8o","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432156372,"created_utc":1432152772}
{"body":"Don't forget her hit man "review" where she stole footage without consent, and lied, saying that the game encourages you to kill the strippers and doesn't punish you (it clearly shows in the footage, that the game does indeed punish you for killing anyone who's not a target.

{"body":"She is a feminist who focuses in video games but MRA bigots thought "video games were a male only club" and began a harrassment campaign. Ironically, the campaign only made more people (even ones who were against her) get behind and support her. A similar thing is happening with Mad Max: Fury Road as we speak.		EDIT: God, the bigots are downvoting.","depth":0,"score":-18,"ups":-18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Quantum_Dranger","name":"t1_creunxk","parent_id":"t3_36kj8o","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432096285,"created_utc":1432092685}

{"body":"A very twisted and dumb comeback. Even if it is not an MRA site, MRAs support and follow it. Also, I do not keep on with feminist frequency but Anita has a right to hate the movie for different reasons. Even in the most progressive movies their is still some Status Quo and setbacks that can be pointed out as to help future movies avoid those.","depth":2,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Quantum_Dranger","name":"t1_crfttqv","parent_id":"t1_crfa8oi","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432171275,"created_utc":1432167675}
{"body":"Return of kings actively denounces mras . Even if you think it's an extension of the mra mindset then they are akin to the kill all men type "feminists". Anita and mcintosh are anti depictions of violence and think violence is inherently masculine. She said it's actively not feminist which is hilarious because before those comments feminists were saying that people who denied it was feminist are retarded. Despite her followers worshipping her she is actually nuts.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rbace","name":"t1_crfwx7p","parent_id":"t1_crfttqv","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432176603,"created_utc":1432173003}
{"body":"People don't like being told that the things they like contribute to bad stuff like misogyny. Anita Sarkeesian started a Kickstarter to fund a series about sexism in the video game industry and it got successfully funded. Lots of people like video games.		The idea of "it's okay to enjoy this stuff but you should acknowledge the problematic parts of it and encourage the creators to change their direction" is very foreign to most people.","depth":0,"score":-18,"ups":-18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"johnadreams","name":"t1_crewn2w","parent_id":"t3_36kj8o","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1432100416,"created_utc":1432096816}
