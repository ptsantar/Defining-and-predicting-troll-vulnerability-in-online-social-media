{"body":"This is very subjective, and you'll get different answers, some arguments, and probably a lot of downvoting.		He's gone through some stylistic changes from his old material/albums to his present stuff.  		There's generally his old material, which most regard as quite good, then 808's and Heartbreak (which people will either say was a masterpiece or auto-tune trash), then My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (which people will either say was a beautiful concept album, or shit) and then Yeezus (which people will either say was a masterpiece, or guttural sounding shit).","depth":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Weedwacker","name":"t1_cr3dr6h","parent_id":"t3_35dalr","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1431156210,"created_utc":1431152610}
{"body":"Depends on who you ask. If you are still stuck in his early College Dropout time, you could consider him falling off after his third album. He always changed his style and evolved and had a different sound on each album. Sometimes you get the old College Dropout time Kanye back, sometimes he is in Yeezus mode. I don't think people generally consider him to be fallen off at all.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"dasautomobil","name":"t1_cr3ggti","parent_id":"t3_35dalr","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1431168894,"created_utc":1431165294}
