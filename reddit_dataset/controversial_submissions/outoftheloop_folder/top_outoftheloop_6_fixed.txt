{"body":"> Sony pulls movie.		English must be your third language or your comprehension level of it is that of a baboon: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview_%282014_film%29#Cancellation_and_response		> The National Association of Theater Owners then stated that they would not object to cinema owners "delaying" the film, "so that our guests may enjoy a safe holiday movie season experiencing the many other exciting films we have to offer."		> On December 17, Sony canceled the film's New York City premiere, and later that day, other major chains, including AMC, Carmike Cinemas, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal, and Southern Theatres announced that they would either delay or drop the film altogether from their lineups.[36] Reportedly, the mass cancellations came under pressure from the malls where many of the theaters are located, out of fear that a terror threat could wreck their sales near the end of the holiday shopping season. Additionally, theater chains feared being exposed to potentially crippling lawsuits in the event of an attack. Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes???a defense that would not have been valid had an attack taken place at a screening of The Interview.[37]		>Later that day, Sony announced that it would cancel the theatrical release of The Interview that was scheduled for December 25, 2014, stating, "We respect and understand our partners??? decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers"","depth":1,"score":-15,"ups":-15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"uogix0nhse","name":"t1_cmzsuqy","parent_id":"t1_cmzlh91","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1419015567,"created_utc":1419015567}

{"body":"It's a comedy movie where to guys go to North Korea to interview Kim Jong Un and kill him. North Korea of course did  not like it, Sony Pictures were hacked a few weeks ago presumably by North Korea and now Theatres around the US decided not to show the movie because there were threats of terrorist attacks on theatres that would show it. For now Sony pulled the movie but they might release it one day.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ShowtimeCA","name":"t1_cmznusn","parent_id":"t3_2psc3r","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1419006438,"created_utc":1419006438}
