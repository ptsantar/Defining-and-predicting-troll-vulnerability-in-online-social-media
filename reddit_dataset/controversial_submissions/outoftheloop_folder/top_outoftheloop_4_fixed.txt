{"body":"It's also gender neutral by which I mean either gender can say SO.	If you are pro maintaining your privacy, saying I have a BF suggests you are female (or homosexual or bi ext ext). BF GF husband all these tell people more than some would like. SO protects that.  I personally don't mind and I imagine many are in the same boat. But I think that's why SO floats around more.","depth":0,"score":26,"ups":26,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jonny9744","name":"t1_cjt5d7q","parent_id":"t3_2dub7g","subreddit":"OutOfTheLoop","subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","created":1408326344,"created_utc":1408322744}
