{"body":"Think about it this way. Gamers tend to be very, very tiring people when they talk about games. It's a never ending streak of insider knowledge, inside jokes, and information about stuff that lots of people don't know about, can't relate to, and frankly don't care about. The same way people think about people who collect pop culture knowledge about Star Trek or whatever else. This is not to insult gamers, necessarily, but to point out that in general people won't find it very cool that you made your controller look different.		On my part, I think it's good that these people are so creative and have done something like that with their controllers. Kind of unfortunately, they use it to pretty much obsessively play games. I don't think that playing games is bad. I think playing them too much is pretty bad, but that's on me and not on you. People do what they do and that's their thing. And I get that people are just having fun and showing other like-minded people how they paid tribute to their favourite games or characters. In my books, that's cool. 		But I do see the other side of that. Generally, people really don't care and you can't really be surprised when people say "I don't care that you made your game controller have a picture of Link on it". Inside jokes/inside knowledge/niche stuff does not do well with the general public. Are you surprised about that? That this is creativity is great. I've seen a lot of modded controllers here in my very short time here and it does get a bit boring (and no, now I don't really tend to look).
