{"body":"Affirmative. Someone posted it below, but I'll post it here as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_optical_disc		The president of Nintendo said "Everyone's already got a Blu-Ray player, we don't need to make this thing play Blu-Rays."		EDIT: Here's the direct quote.		>Wii U does not have DVD or Blu-ray playback capabilities. The reason for that is that we feel that enough people already have devices that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray, such that it didn't warrant the cost involved to build that functionality into the Wii U console because of the patents related to those technologies.","depth":1,"score":240,"ups":240,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"okcodex","name":"t1_c6z9mf2","parent_id":"t1_c6z941b","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1352590261,"created_utc":1352561461}
{"body":"More information:		The style of disc that Nintendo uses is a specialized format called CAV optical discs. CAV, or Constant Angular Velocity, is a special format co-developed by Nintendo and Panasonic (the reason the Panasonic Q, DVD playing Gamecube exists).		Normally, optical discs slow down their rotation speed as the laser reaches the outside of the disc and the information becomes more dense. CAV discs do not slow down as the outside is reached, they stay spinning at the same rate from the inside most track to the outside most track. Advantages to this include better access speeds, and because it is not a standard optical disc, they can avoid having to pay licensing fees to the DVD forum and the Blu Ray forum.		The Gamecube used Mini-CAV-DVDs.	The Wii used full sized CAV-DVDs.	The Wii U uses full sized CAV-BDRs.		That is why, even in the jailbreaking community, trying to get DVD playback on the Wii working was very difficult, because the drive is not designed to slowdown to read the more densely packed data.		Overall though, the technology used in the CAV discs and non CAV discs is nearly identical. The same wavelength of laser is used in the Wii and Gamecube as a DVD, and the Wii U uses the same wavelength as a Blu Ray Player.		http://i.imgur.com/886BV.jpg","depth":2,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LHoT10820","name":"t1_c6zdp5w","parent_id":"t1_c6z9mf2","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1352609679,"created_utc":1352580879}
