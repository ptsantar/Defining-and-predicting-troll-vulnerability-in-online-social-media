submission: { t3_p1ssv	Queen-of-Hobo-Jungle	Dear internet, I'm a 26 year old lady who's been developing a science-based, 100% dragon MMO for the last two years. I'm finally making my beta-website now, and using my 3D work as a base to create my 50+ concept images. Wish me luck, Reddit; You'll be the first to see the site when it's finished.	1327855982.0	1327884782.0	0	78	78	0	t5_2qh03	gaming	 }
{"body":"About twelve years ago, I had a professional level designer at a big studio mock me on a major game-development forum for posting about my team's upcoming project, because I'd posted that I needed programmers, modellers, level designers, sound, etc., and had therefore revealed that all I had was a good-sounding idea and a website.  The conversation got ugly, particularly when he started dropping vulgarities at various people in the thread who came to my defense, and I remember how I felt a bit curb-stomped by the whole thing.		I'd rather walk away from this thread than do something like that.  But as someone working on their third MMO production credit, I'd like to make an honest, non-judgmental attempt to give you some perspective on the road ahead of you.		I'm assuming a few things here:		* I assume you have not completed development of a video game before.	* Since you haven't mentioned anyone but yourself, I assume you are not currently working with anyone else.	* I assume the talents you're bringing to the table, based on your comments, are art-related (and the game design, naturally).	* I specifically assume you have no programming experience.	* I assume you haven't selected an engine ([here's a great writeup](http://www.eldergame.com/2010/05/unity-2-6-for-indie-mmos-yes-but/) on the strengths and weaknesses of Unity, by the way).	* I'm assuming most of the last two years has been spent writing down details of the world, along with cool gameplay ideas.		If I'm wrong on any of that, correct me as needed.  But (and this is important) still take the rest of this into consideration.		So, with that in mind, here are a few of the pitfalls I foresee in the road ahead:		* If this is the first game you've ever made, I'm begging you, don't go straight for the MMO.  Take a little sub-section of your game, a minigame if you will, and build just that, as a single player game.  You'll learn so much you didn't even know you needed to know.  Even the big guys do this: [take Spore, for example](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10033443-52.html).  I have a grand MMO design that I'm splintering into small-game sub-designs and fleshing out in my spare time, because I understand how detailed the design needs to be and I recognize that I can't design it properly as one giant whole.	* No one has successfully made an MMO alone.  A game that persists online and builds a community simply requires too many features, too much art, too complex a server infrastructure, too much community oversight, for even a genius master-of-all-trades to do it alone.  One person (and honestly, even a half-dozen) doesn't have enough time to create a full MMO's worth of content in a short period of time.  "Well, we'll just take a few years" doesn't work, because you have the same problem Duke Nukem Forever had:  After three years or so, the bar for "acceptable"-quality art has been raised so high that your work from three years ago needs to be scrapped and started over to get back to "acceptable" quality.  (This applies no matter how low you set the bar, unless you drop it to Minecraft levels and don't care at all.)	* With a team, you have a different problem: Unless you pay them, you don't have an effective way to control what they produce or how quickly they produce it.  If your team is online, there's an added danger: they can disappear at any time, without a trace.  If you didn't make them store their work on a server you control, then they can vanish and take their part of the project with them.  If the person who disappears is your programmer, it doesn't matter that you have a working build; you no longer have the code needed to make any changes.	* Speaking of programmers: an MMO is ludicrously programming-intensive.  If your programmer hasn't made an MMO before, your game's top risk (and most likely cause for failure) is that you're building an MMO engine with no experience.  Conversely, a programmer with MMO experience is likely working on an MMO (with a lot of unpaid overtime) and isn't available for a side project (or at least not an MMO-sized one).  Unity, by the way, is a client-side engine; you still need the server infrastructure and code, and mixing and matching client and server engines has led to at least one MMO failure that I've witnessed first-hand.  Full MMO engines exist, but the ones that have actually shipped a working title are priced at least in the six digits.	* Art is one of the biggest expenses in a commercially-produced MMO.  There's a LOT of it, it's time intensive to create, and it has to be turned around fast (see above DNF comments).  One person might be able to turn around mid-grade art for a small multiplayer game that reused content constantly, but you're generally looking at a team... which means you're looking at an art director to keep all the art in the same style and help manage who needs to make what and when.	* World-building is great, and I love doing that for games of all types, online and offline.  But again, to do this with other people, you'll need a full-fledged [design document](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3384/the_anatomy_of_a_design_document_.php): a bible detailing every little detail about the game.  If you can draw parts of the game on paper and play them out at your table using the design document's rules, then you've typically got the correct level of detail.  If your notes talk about a feature with the level of detail of the typical IGN interview, you need to design in more detail.  (Your comments here suggest this, if only because they they're vague enough to hide the possibility that specific implementations don't yet exist; I obviously don't know the truth, so I only provide what warning I can.)		So, to drive this home: Fully half of all MMOs commercially developed never release; half the survivors immediately fail.  If I was building an MMO "on a budget", and I had what I considered a ridiculously good design, and I wanted to ensure that it had a greater than 50/50 odds of success, I'd plan to use a minimum of 10-20 people and $1-2 million.  If that makes you spittake ... if you look at that and think "that's absolutely impossible" ... then I can't stress it enough: don't try to make an MMO.  Start small.		(And if you choose to proceed, [go to this blog](http://www.eldergame.com/) and start from the beginning.  He's walked the path you must follow.)		I hope this ridiculously long diatribe is accepted in the spirit in which it was offered.","depth":0,"score":2141,"ups":2141,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"RukiTanuki","name":"t1_c3lup2l","parent_id":"t3_p1ssv","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1327898364,"created_utc":1327869564}

I've got 10-20 friends that I'm working with on an epic game. We all work in feature film VFX (generally $100M+ budgets which is great since we all know the trade well and can keep on task/budgets) and are sort of piecing things together.		I had a thought which was to block out the game perhaps using either the War3 or SC2 map editor...just to get the basics flushed out along with the game's flow and things along those lines.		I haven't taken that idea any further, but Blizzard certainly made a very playable "MMO" or at least RPG type game for their Orc campaign...I figure it can't be too hard for 10+ guys with computer engineering degrees and the ability to churn out feature film level artwork to tackle something like that and see how things shape up.

{"body":"Isn't the "original post" of this thread a part of the thread? It's true that the comment that chase02 was immediately replying to said nothing about its writer's age or sex, but it seems to me that chase's comment is implicitly addressed to the OP as well: after all, its main purpose is to endorse the advice that RukiTanuki gives to the OP and to add the support of another person's experience.		In that context, it makes good sense to me that chase02 would mention her age and sex, given that the OP mentioned both, and given her similarity to the OP in those areas. As basedinspace says [below](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lxdhf), that shows that 'she can relate even more to the original poster than if she wasn't' female or was of a different age. Whether or not these details seem relevant to others, they clearly did to the OP, as she went to the trouble of mentioning them herself.	***	My question is, "Why is everybody picking on chase02's mention of her sex and not her mention of her age?" To me, those two details seem to fall into the same category: both are personal details that have no apparent direct bearing on the subject at hand, but could conceivably have an indirect bearing on it, and in any case were first mentioned by the OP in her own post.		That people seize on the one detail and not the other speaks to me--I won't say of sexism--but of a certain knee-jerk reaction to the whole subject of gender and its relation or lack thereof to people's occupations.

The longer you are in the public eye without delivering a tangible product, the more likely it will turn on you, *especially* if you take people's money.","depth":6,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"A-Type","name":"t1_c3lumq1","parent_id":"t1_c3lujj7","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1327897676,"created_utc":1327868876}

{"body":"Hate to burst your bubble...  but this whole thing reeks of amateur style art institute talent.  At 26, you are far behind the talent that is coming straight out of High-school. 	I highly suggest that if you are serious about being a game developer, you should join onto some mod's for MMO's to get some real world experience and to learn from other people who know what they are doing.  		It seems to me the last two years were spent fantasizing about this idea and then creating some very low detail and low quality environments, so essentially it's .000001 percent complete and that's being generous.  Don't waste your time making a game on your own, your much better off learning and gaining experience by joining an indie studio or a mod team...  and I hate to be harsh about it but you probably have very little chance at even being recruited by an indie developer or even a mod team based on the quality of artwork displayed here and in your additional screenshots within the comments.		Don't be discouraged by all the comments, just understand that you have a very long road ahead of you to get a job in the game industry...  if you dedicate a lot of your time and effort into learning more and gaining experience, and couple that with any experience you can gain working for a mod team, you may be able to get somewhere within the industry, but for now I would drop this project all together as it will consume all of your time, and your time is best spent working with people that actually have experience producing a game.		I've worked on huge mod teams and multiple indie games, and the mod "Point of Existence 2" for Battlefield 2 took us 3 years of development with a team totaling 25 developers and 60+ testers...  And we didn't even scratch the surface of the programming and animations systems.  We just made new vehicles, weapons and maps, so 75% of the game was already there for us, we primarily just made new art for the game and it still took us several years to complete.

{"body":"**Do you have any experience making games?** From what I'm gathering from your posting, you have a "great idea that you think could be made into an MMO game." These ideas are a dime a dozen and 99% end in complete failure and wasted time. Please don't take my criticisms too hard, I am only trying to save you from inevitable frustration. 		If you are serious about this, I would recommend starting off with a single-player experience using an established game engine like UDK or Unity. You need to focus on your core mechanic and IGNORE any thoughts of secondary features until this mechanic is refined enough to build an entire game around. Feature creep is a very serious thing and from what I'm gathering from your posting, it may become very prevalent in this project.

{"body":"My favorite would be a game with indefinite progress, where the combat model still makes it possible for new players (2 days to 1 week kinda new) to take on the really entrenched old players and win.			Not easy to pull off, but it can be done with perks that don't grant pure combat power/defense, and non-leveling progression (think capturing land, amassing wealth, etc).			So you'd want an Elder dragon to beat a younger one 9 times out of 10, but you'd want 3-5 new dragons against a single elder to have at least a 50/50 chance.				As opposed to games like Darkfall, or world of warcraft(more severe) where it would be unlikely that even dozens of new players could kill someone who'd been playing for months; usually because the older players can take two dozen hits without dying, and the new ones drop in a single strike.				My favorite progression system so far in an actual game has been Shadowbane; because you can hit the level cap and get maxed gear in a single weekend if you're in a decent guild, but there are many many different class/specialized class/race/rune/perk/stat combo's to try, you'll practically never build them all.		It let newb's jump right into the action while still giving more knowledgeable players an advantage, as well as the primary method of progression being the success of your guild, not your own success necessarily.			I play with a 5 man group of friends, and we all think about the same, although they of course have their own favorite ideal systems.				I hope this helps, and wish you good luck getting your game out there.				**Edit:** Reading more into this thread, evolution which involves trade offs to make your dragon more 'your own,' and more powerful would be an awesome method of progression. If you want semi-fair indefinite progression. You could just work the whole perks/special traits that aren't "iwin" buttons into it.		I.e. Player X evolves from the base dragon type, eventually, into a frost wyrm, or some other such, with unique abilities giving them an advantage, rather than just giving them 50 times more health and damage like most leveling based MMOs.		Just my two cents.				**edit2:** I don't think I said it before, but if this turns out well, I will play the shit out of this game.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yakri","name":"t1_c3ltieq","parent_id":"t1_c3lt5ai","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1327889471,"created_utc":1327860671}

The Unreal Engine isn't just a physics engine, but a fully fledged game engine - even including stock graphics for HUDs.		What makes a game is the creativity: The art, the storyline, the mechanics. Regardless of if you like her attempt, her use of an engine certainly doesn't degrade her ability to create a game.		Bonus Point: Are you aware that the *vast* majority of coding in today's MMORPGs is done on tools and not the actual game?

{"body":"Digital Artist for video games here,  I see a lot of dragons made in zbrush zsphere which is a terrible way to go about making your base model for a game.  If you want to do it right, you should be building your base models in Maya (no more than 4k polys for a main char dragon each) and then importing to Zbrush to build your normal maps.  I'm going to take a wild guess and say that those dragons you have were built in those positions they are in, nothing is rigged with a bone structure correct?  Your models should be built in a default position and rigged before you try and move them into positions that look lifelike for screen shots.		Also concept images are what should come first, then the 3d models, not many people do the 3d first then the concept.  You should start by designing the environments for which your dragons will live.  This will determine how your dragons should look. 		Have you thought about which game engine you are going to use?  You know that most cost a ridiculous amount of money correct?  Unity is free but those models you have will never work in Unity.

{"body":"If you wanna be pro about this, here are the Steps needed to build a Dragon for a game.		1.  Decide on its environment.  Where your characters live is going to determine how they are going to look strait up.  		2.  Concept the creature out, draw draw draw.  Get a feel for what its going to look like and map it out on paper.  If your an artist draw it in whats called an orthographic veiw, front and side, and make sure they match up.		3. Import the images onto plains in a program called Maya, and use them as templates to model a low (correct topology)poly dragon thats based around your drawings (the orthos).  At this point your engine should be decided on, and you should know what kind of poly count your dragon shoot shoot for.  Probably 4-5k polys.		4. Once the creature is built your going to have to lay out its UVs to add texture.  Textures is painted in Photoshop and imported in, once the creature is layed out and fit across the model.		5. FINALLY step five is where you imported your layed out and textured creature into a program that this woman used to start her whole process called Zbrush.  It's here that you add the gritty detail and texures and you import them into photoshop as a normal map.  This is later added onto the model to give its gritty detailed feel.		6. The creature needs to be rigged with a bone structure that allows it to move by an animator.		7. Animation sequences are shot with the character, these are recorded into "scripts" and its actually the scripts you see in game engines that are dictating how your character moves.		This lady pretty much skipped everyone of these steps and just modeled some stuff in Zbrush, and I don't want to discourage her, but at the same time this stuff is easy to learn in the right places and should be planned out much better if its going to work.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Balikokho","name":"t1_c3lw2bb","parent_id":"t1_c3lvtv3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1327909198,"created_utc":1327880398}

{"body":"Don’t get excited, reddit. I guess it’s my turn to be the disillusioned stooge.		What has Queen-of-Hobo-Jungle shown us? Some basic Z-sphere sketchings posed on a background that certainly isn’t an in-game screencap. I’m not even certain if they’re her environments.	Yes, it’s a cool idea, but the scope is massively out of control – especially for a single person working on an MMO. Evolution, lineage, breeding? An ecosystem? Uniquely altered dragon meshes reflecting traits belonging to the original dragon (and species before it evolved)? Advanced interaction with AI (training mythical and non-mythical creatures)? This has all the classic symptoms of, ‘and and you’ll be really powerful, and you’ll be able to fly, and and and shoot bullets – no, LASERS – out of your eyes, and then the lasers can also be shaped like torpedos, and and and you can fly so good that you can even go to space!’ This is an absolutely insane undertaking. From what I’ve gathered, Queen-of-Hobo-Jungle has some art skills (although I haven’t had much to base that on), but makes no mention of programming abilities. Honestly, programming a complex game like this – programming *evolution*, not to mention the nightmare of building an MMO from the ground up - will be a cruelly punishing affair for any brave codemonkey. 		Additionally, this isn’t a game that has been under development for ‘two years’. She hasn’t even chosen an engine yet. The concept may have originated two years ago, but if that counted, I could lay claim to some projects that have been under ‘development’ since I was ten. 		I can understand why Queen-of-Hobo-Jungle posted this to reddit. It’s a cool idea, she’s probably been harbouring it for a couple of years, and she finally got around to producing some minor art for it. In a paroxysm of excitement and motivation, she posted this with the intent of generating buzz and publicity. Honestly, I think she blew her wad too early – when publically announcing a game, it helps to have at least a partly constructed game, a trailer, a website, or at least a name! What are the would-be fans going to do with this information, when they have nowhere to go and no way of tracking the project?		I probably come across as a big, mean grinch stomping on a bright young upstart’s dreams. If you’re reading this, Queen-of-Hobo-Jungle, I don’t mean to discourage you. People have undertaken insane projects in the past and beaten the odds, for sure. Problem is, now you have a whole bunch of excited, directionless would-be fans that are going to forget about this idea in less than a week. You’ve also made a lot of promises as the sole developer for a non-existent, scope-intensive MMO. You've even brought up possibly accepting donations at some point. Honestly, I’d recommend keeping on the DL until you have some actual content (at least a somewhat playable pre-alpha game) – that way, if the idea fizzles out, it won’t come back to bite you on the arse.

Well, that's your opinion.  I've certainly seen female Redditors correcting people who referred to them as "he" in contexts where it wasn't relevant.

The reason people view this topic's title as attention-grabbing is because the poster unnecessarily pointed out the she was a lady, which is a commodity on Reddit, because female Redditors are the minority. 		But, you're right, it shouldn't matter if it's a guy or a girl. However, that's easily solved by excluding that kind of unnecessary information in a topic's title.

{"body":"Yes, I do admit to discriminating. We all discriminate in different ways, though some ways are most dominant in particular cultures. Some groups are discriminated against almost globally, like women. 		The gender of a game-maker matters because games are made by, and predominantly marketed towards, white males. This last point of course depends on the game and the marketing strategy of the particular companyat that particular time, but it is a market-wide trend. In a climate that is predicated, propagated, and filled with male expectation, a difference in demographic is rarely looked on as a good thing. Therefor you get Reddit entries about a female gamer with about a third of the comments (last time I checked, I'm typing this from my inbox) dedicated to the fact that she is a female.		You've said something interesting here. That the term "dude" is "never meant as specifying a gender, even if it's mostly used to refer to men." I contest that it is nearly always used to refer to men, and therefor the term is meant to indicate a male. Language is created in a societal context, and only holds up in that sense. It is up to an individual, not to interpret the literal meaning of the word, which has already been done by society, but only to use the language they know how to use within the context they are given to the best of their ability.. Or to not do that, which is up to the individual. Since the term "dude" is almost always used to refer to males, and is then, on a societal scale, used to indicate men, then your interpretation of the already defined term doesn't hold up. It's a flawed interpretation. Just as if I told you that I believed "canary" to be the term, not for a yellow songbird, but for a yellow leaf. Can you see the flaw there?		Men often go around touting their gender as a defining characteristic. That's why we have terms like "dude," "bro," and "cunt" as gender-defining labels. Women do the same exact thing. 		I honestly don't know if her saying "I am a 26 year old lady" deserves the scrutiny it is getting. If she is appealing to people who feel as if they're alone, and feel that they would be more likely to upvote or support her, that is her right, she can identify herself however she likes. If she were though, don't you think she wouldn't have been touting her university education and maybe have been a little more vague with her age? And really.. Who says "I'm a lady" when they're trying to garner sexual attention? I think that a more appropriate definition for someone seeking to appeal to lonely men would be more along the line of, "I'm a young redhead, a girl who made a game." Her language leads me to believe that she's not actually trying to garner that kind of attention. So all the friction in this entry, which you say is not about her gender, but is about her attention-whoring (another mainly gender-specific term) is based entirely on a false pretense.		It's not really like those YouTube vlogs at all and there are a couple very good reasons. 1. I don't know what she looks like. There is no video, picture, or description of her body, so men (with our mainly visual and tactile sexuality) aren't generally going to be turned on by what she's written. And 2. She has created something of debatable value but non-debatable relevance to the subreddit it was posted in. Most of the YouTube vlog girls that you're talking about don't really add anything of substance to the community. 		TLDR; I'm discriminating in opposition of a male-centered industry, yes. The term "dude" is, indeed, a term that specifies a gender.","depth":9,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Nelwyn","name":"t1_c3lwpw3","parent_id":"t1_c3lvmu1","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1327913004,"created_utc":1327884204}

{"body":">100% dragon and show intelligence like a human		form follows function: the reason *humans* have human intelligence is because we are such a shitty design. We *needed* tools, and the tools shaped us, and in turn we create better tools.		I'm not saying it's totally impossible for a draconian form to be intelligent, but their form would indicate no need for human-like intelligence: large sturdy bodies, wings, large jaws, teeth, and claws, tails... and if we want to get silly, fire breath, water breathing etc.		Spore was so brilliant because it abides by the law that form follows function, and at certain points it made you trade in certain things for other more advantageous traits.		I could envision a species that once looked like dragons, but has now evolved diminished wings and tails, thinner skin to facilitate better tactile senses, diminished jaws to facilitate speech, no silly flame-breath, bells or whistles. I wager that if we ever meet extra-terrestrials, they will be full of "vestigal organs/structures" or that they have been engineered out. They will likely be relatively shitty designs, like us... Matter of fact, knowing how prone to environmental upset *we* are, we'd likely only meet their heralds: robotic probes, etc.		While there is nothing wrong with saying "I want to play a game as a species of intelligent dragon", it's silly to bring science into the mix.
