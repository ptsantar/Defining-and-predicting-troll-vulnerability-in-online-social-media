{"body":"It's certainly possible. While I have my disagreements with SRS's methods and sometimes their opinions on issues, generally, I leave SRS alone, and SRS leaves me alone, at least in the sense of being targeted for any wrongdoing. Same with MRAs, though I tend to disagree with their methods and sentiments with greater frequency. 		Not to say I've not had some absolutely roaring arguments with SRSters, or MRAs, but I generally try to get on with people from either group, I tend to concern myself more about if they're reasonable and have a legitimate concern or not, rather than which set of team colours they're wearing.		I'm admittedly more of an egalitarian than a pure Feminist or Masculist, but as far as I see it, we're all generally on the same side, in the end. 		Sure, a Feminist focuses on equality, working from the side of making sure women are equal to men in all things possible, and a Masculist will focus on men being equal to women in all things possible, but at it's core, both sides are working towards the same goal - since fighting for equality means putting everybody on the same level, as you well know. Feminisim isn't(and shouldn't be) about pushing down men and creating a matriarchy, nor is Masculisim about pushing women down and perpetuating the patriarchy, nor should it be.		I find it most unfortunate that both sides have been stained by the actions of a small few over the years, and that both sides will have their reputations and actions coloured and pre-judged because of the actions of those small few for years to come.		I think it would be a most excellent turn of events for SRS and MRA to both become bastions of the social justice movement, and for both to make big strides forward for the over-arching cause shared by both, and it frankly saddens me somewhat that it doesn't appear to be possible right now.		I suppose I have a lot more to say on these sorts of topics - For example, why Feminisim should consider cutting off the continuing influence of many hard-core second wavers like Greer and Dworkin for various reasons(for example, Greer supporting female Genital Mutilation on Australian TV and Dworkin's rather violence-and-hate focused ideals and rhetoric), and why Masculisim should get it's shit together, and work on important issues rather than attacking feminism or blaming women rather than the system for many problems, along with it's lack of driving figures.

{"body":"Pretty much. I like to think my view on it was pretty unbiased. At least, compared to the articles on it, which I feel are all pretty one-sided.		More or less, she had a show on YouTube where she pointed out sexist tropes in stuff. She wanted to get into doing Games, but apparently this required several thousand dollars to start doing. She claims she needed it for the games themselves and to pay expenses while playing them. I'd judge, based on her entire lack of games, that she probably wouldn't self-identify as a gamer. She had a list of many major titles for consoles that she wanted to purchase.		After that, most people heard about her campaign because she was allegedly threatened. According to her, several people threatened her for saying games are sexist by sending her comments about how women are terrible. I don't believe she ever released the comments, supposedly e-mailed to her. She simply alluded to them being offensive and menacing. I'm fairly suspicious about whether or not she actually received many angry comments, how menacing they were, etc.		Basically, the thing blew up. A ton of people donated and rushed to her defense. Plenty of people wrote articles about how it was proof games were sexist and gamers treated women poorly, making her videos more necessary and encouraging more donations. The campaign blew up and everyone started feeling like gamers were sexist and misogynistic.		If you want my opinion, the entire thing just made the whole "girl gamers" issue worse by raising tensions and making people take polarizing sides. Anyone not saying sexism is prominent in gaming communities is called a sexist, and anyone saying it is will be considered a fanatic and not a real gamer. Things were getting better, and now almost everyone is on some kind of side on this issue and trying to paint the opposing side as monsters.

I don't know if you are a guy or gal, but try making a clearly girl username saying what she said in her initial campaign, before she came out saying about the abuse, in various subreddits etc. I'm sure you will get some shit.		tl;dr there are some shitty people on the internet and women can be targets.

{"body":"He can disagree with anyone he wants, but he should probably avoid doing it in a totally lazy and intellectually dishonest way that relies heavily on passive-aggressive personal attacks and unfounded assumptions. 		Let's look at the vid, shall we?		- <1:00 The first minute is spent blithely dismissing her entire thesis, with particular scorned heaped upon Sarkeesian actually quoting other academics. Already, I know the person behind this video has no idea how academia works, or they'd know that no paper -- particularly in social theory -- gets written without extensive quotations used for the author to react to or to bolster a point.		- ~1:00-2:00 The second minute dwells on "contradictions" and says that Sarkeesian's major point is that "strong empowered female characters still aren't feminist, because they're only pretending to be men." Sarkeesian's actual thesis for the paper can be found in the introduction and even verbatim in the abstract: "Female roles in science fiction and fantasy television that are viewed as strong and empowered embody many masculine identified traits, maintaining a patriarchal division of gender roles." Basically saying that many of the "strong" female roles in fiction are seen that way not because of their adoption or forceful expression of traditional female roles, but because they assume typically male traits, leading to the question of what "strong" female-typical traits there are for the purpose of creating heroines that are not simply gender-swapped male characters. The video then muddles about with some charts, trying to portray them as nonsensical, while not realizing that those charts are referencing back to a list on p.22 of Gender-Specific Values and they are explained in the paragraph above them.		- ~2:00-2:20 Is Sarkeesian's "2nd Contradiction" wherein she uses the terms "masculine" and "feminine" despite acknowledging them as problematic. This is not a contradiction, this is Foucault & Discourse 101; we cannot speak about those things we have no terms for. (If that sounds confusing, I suggest Foucault 100: What the Fuck Did I Just Read?)		- ~2:30-2:50 Apparently the video's author is mad that someone who explictly says they want to write and create feminist material for a wider audience actually uses clear and accessible language.		- ~2:50-3:30 A series of personal attacks culminating an unfounded accusation of narcissism. Makes a bunch of unbacked-up assertions about her media diet.		- ~3:30-3:50 An anti-intellectual attack that manages to be more snobbish than quoting a poet.		- ~3:50-4:05 Another personal attack/unfounded claim of narcissism.		- ~4:05-4:45 A painfully extended metaphor with a completely unremarked upon visual derailment about boy's participation in K-12, which culminates in yet another anti-intellectual attack about Sarkeesian having been in a "classroom her entire life." This is claim is made without any specific reference to Sarkeesian's biography or any other aspect of her life. In short, the author of the video is doing exactly what he accuses Sarkeesian of doing: making unfounded assertions.		- ~4:45-5:10 Even more of the painful "schoolroom" metaphor with more coy accusations of narcissism, this time passive-aggressively directed towards her moderation of her youtube channel comments, because the video is apparently mad that she started her own channel.		Then the vid goes on to criticize her criticism of the imagery used in a Kanye video, conveniently skipping any mention that many many other groups and individuals were also critical of the video. Then mentions Kanye won album of the year, which, dude, was not the point.		In fact, the whole video, when it's not making sneering ad hominems, is one giant exercise in missing point","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"400-Rabbits","name":"t1_c7sbp9j","parent_id":"t1_c7sajs4","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1357550405,"created_utc":1357521605}

{"body":""The hatred of women" in the gaming industry is a delusion. A delusion that is largely projected by extremists or people on the outside looking in.  Men in gaming do not hate women, nor do they hate women who legitimately share in their particular passion. There are far more men in gaming trying to include and seek out female gamers then there are women doing the same for men. If anything, male gamers are desperate to actually find more women who game and misandry, as well as women excluding themselves from, insulting or belittling male gamers, is far more common place.  There is nothing misogynistic about male developers creating content that reflect their own personal fantasies, desires and preferences. 		 There is nothing misogonystic about heterosexual men being attracted to, or appealed by, sexualized female characters(calling their interest misogynistic is nothing more than sheer heterophobia).  There is nothing misogynistic about women being hazed in the same manner men haze each other in a competitive environment(giving women special preferential treatment, as is often expected from women despite the misandric implications, would be a better example of sexism).  There is nothing misogynistic with men(or women) calling out certain women for abusing their gender, sex appeal or scarcity to manipulate other men(who are already in a  desperate/vulnerable enough position because of the sexual/romantic position they are in as a result of misandric cultural factors against gaming and male gamers). There is nothing misogynistic with calling out women who call themselves gamers despite not having any real interest, appreciation or passion towards gaming, supporting the industry or the men within it who have, so far, made it what it is.		  The problem with the gaming industry is not misogyny, the music industry is far more misogynistic than the gaming industry could ever hope to be and yet it is consumed, supported and propelled by countless women. The problem with the gaming industry is, and has always been, misandry.

Clearly, its just us big, bad MRA's coming in and downvoting anything we don't like :)		>Men, white men in particular, have done their fair share of shitting all over everyone on this website, and in real life: women, blacks, Muslims, etc...		You're a typical SRS-er that is playing the same "oppression olympics" game over and over again. You justify "oppressing" others because you choose to look at nearly anything as "oppression". You blame men (yes, HALF of the population) for all of your problems and you're too stupid to see how this is not "oppression" and "sexism" in of itself. Ironically enough, SRSters have done more "shitting on others" on reddit than anybody else. Hell, your entire shithole subreddit does nothing but "shit on" any smidgeon of supposed "sexism" you choose to consider "offensive". 		>? Certainly not, but as soon as someone turns the mirror back onto those in this group who think that their maleness and/or whiteness gives them the authority to criticize other groups, pointing out their own hypocrisies and shortcomings, all of a sudden you and your ilk come out, guns ablazing, screaming foul. Give me a break. 		There is literally nobody here that thinks that their "maleness and/or whiteness" gives them authority to do anything. Maybe it's time for you and your cronies to understand that anybody with more than a few braincells left can see through your bogus "oppression" hypocrisy and only makes people hate you and your filthy subreddit even more.		>And then you have the nerve to essentially imply that I am overreacting to "people saying mean things over the internet to women," when the whole reason you replied to me is because you're all butthurt I dared criticized, or as you so dramatically put "spreading feminist bigotry," about white men.		No, you nitwit. I don't give a shit if you say "mean things" to anybody. What I, and everybody else, is sick of is you idiotic crusadors going around pretending you're fighting some mythical "oppression" because some idiots called a woman names and retailate by slandering (white) men. Maybe if you grew enough skin, you'd realize that someone saying some comments to a woman is not the worst thing on the planet and that you should stop pretending that insulting men (as a WHOLE) is not the way to get people to respect you.		>Aww, did the big bad feminist SRSer say mean things over the internet to white men? ::insert passive aggressive smiley here::		I have seen A LOT (and I mean, A LOT) of stupidity on the internet and SRSters have to be the most stupid.","depth":5,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AryoBarzan","name":"t1_c7u98o6","parent_id":"t1_c7t18hf","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1357821170,"created_utc":1357792370}

Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.

Gender-policing bullshit like claims of "white-knighting" hurt men by reinforcing archaic assumptions of masculinity and reiterating the idea that games and the Internet are areas where male and macho is the default.  And guys get abused all the time, because people on the Internet are dicks.		That said, women get harassed *for being women*.  Not as jostling or camaraderie, not anonymous dickery, but targeting and judging and being hurt.  And all of that not based on some of their actions or because of their in-game performance or out-of-game words, but because they don't have penises.		Is is reinforced by a gaming culture which uses women as sexualized plot points - be it tits-on-stick side characters or women who are kidnapped or killed to advance the male's plot line.  		Yes, male characters suffer from unrealistic body images too -- but you as a player get to be them and that's part of the escapist fantasy.

There's a difference between not wanting to be associated with the asshats of gaming whose outward attitude (and the resulting games which cater to said attitudes) ruin it for those around them, and resenting games which require (or even just allow for) more than a casual, passing interest.

But the thing is, games aimed at this stereotype don't manifest in the way you've described. They differ in subject matter primarily.		"Girl's games" are things like Animal Crossing. They're not "boy's games" with the approach changed. Girls who just want to play games, rather than "girl's games" are just left with a smaller pool of games which appeal to their sensibilities. Not a non-existent pool as some would have you believe, and it's certainly a situation which is improving (the image of scantily clad, buxom female characters is far from dead, but not as ubiquitous as it once was, and actually western gaming is doing better at getting rid of it than, say, the Japanese fighter market), but I can still see their point.","depth":1,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThePegasi","name":"t1_c7s6bem","parent_id":"t1_c7s32fx","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1357534126,"created_utc":1357505326}

{"body":"Thanks for the reply. Fair points, to be sure.		>On your second point, I don't really know the answer. To begin with we need to stop talking about there being a single group of girl gamers.		That's kinda my point. "Girl gamers" almost means two separate things now. There are those who adhere to the Facebook/recent Nintendo generation of games. This generation in't just OK, it's great! It's expanding what "gaming" means and extending the reach of the medium in to parts of society that have no interest in shooters, traditional RPGs etc. I mean sure, this sector of gaming is more readily associated with girls, but I don't think the stigma of a guy playing such games is as great as it is for girls trying to get in to, say, mainstream shooters.		The other sector is what people on reddit generally mean when they say "girl gamers." Ie. girls who want to play established genres. This is where your point:		>Aren't there just many groups of gamers who like different things?	Yes, some groups will be mainly one gender or the other, and some will be mixed. Design the game for the market, not the gender.		Comes in to play. The issue with this is that "designing for the market" in a group which is primarily (albeit, as you say, not totally) populated by one gender means potentially alienating the other. If your market is skewed towards teenage boys, "designing for the market" is exactly what they're doing when they put in scantily clad women as characters. Crass perhaps, but true as anything.		And honestly people need to stop acting as if this phenomenon is confined or even dominated by games. Look at films. You get similar gender politics there too. How much do action movies attempt to appeal to female viewers? More, perhaps, but there's still clearly a huge factor of gender politics at play here.		Even if you look at *books* for god's sake. Read plenty of sci fi, Asimov for example, and even though it's great writing, he can spend half a fucking page talking about the curve of a woman's breasts and two sentences describing a male character.		The differences with these mediums is that they're established enough for the "other half" to get their fair share too. You get chick flicks and girly books as well, and there's that wonderful middle ground of *genuinely good, intellectual material.* Girls who enjoy action movies are still, to a certain extent, gonna be left out in the cold, as are guys who enjoy chick flicks. I feel that girls who identify primarily with typically "boyish" genres like shooters and fighters are going to suffer in the same way for a long time to come, perhaps indefinitely. If there's a resolution here, it's society wide, and not something that gaming can solve internally.		That's not to say we should just keep quiet. I think that, as with any issue like this, consistent but reasonable pressure, and (importantly) reward for positive change, are the way forward. People who act as if there can be any kind of revolution here are, to my mind, missing the point in both gaming and social terms. And in terms of what we can actually look forward to, I go back to my point about the middle ground in books and films. *That's* what we should be embracing, rather than expecting Japanese fighter developers to stop putting buxom women in their games. Hell, keep trying if you want, but also appreciate where the most beneficial effort can be directed, and encourage genuinely progressive gaming, just like we do with great film and literature. Gaming can be art, but it's young. We need to help it grow up, and also have at least some patience in letting it do so.		>I found it a bit too grindy (*farm loadouts?*)		Lol. Beautiful.

Grew up with an Atari, moved on to NES in 86, pretty much got a new console every four or so years after that. 		I played video games with all of my neighbors, half of whom were girls. Played video games with my best friend, also a girl, up until we grew apart (beat Dragon Quest together). Was the only girl in a four-person Nintendo club in 1989. Wrote articles (poor ones!) about video games for the high school news paper. Currently own every modern system (and handheld) aside from WiiU. 		I've known girls who play games all my life. I'm sure there are less of us than guys, but we're here. Always have been. And if guys can't accept that then I don't want to play with them.		I never ever thought that there was this gender bracket of gamers until I started reading Reddit and 4chan. I never came across anyone who had any kind of issue or surprise or any adverse reaction to me being a girl who plays games. I never even knew this kind of thing was an issue. I've just always played them, with friends, and didn't give a fuck.		Now granted, I don't play online VS. games like CoD, because I don't like shooters. So I guess I'm kind of sheltered? It really shocks me to know that girls get picked on that much, but knowing what these idiot kids are saying to even other dudes it doesn't surprise me much. I think they're just idiots, not really sexist, just trying to grasp at the easiest thing to insult a person with.		As far as the influx of girl gamers and gaming becoming "cool"? I don't really care either. I'm glad more girls are playing games here. Maybe they'll make some more female-oriented games that don't have to do with raising animals or playing dress-up. And as far as the "girls are posers and don't play games" thing? Fuck those guys. I don't let it bother me. I feel like the people who do are just insecure. I know who I am and what I like to do. 		Posts like these make me laugh, because I just feel like these people are really sheltered and wrapped up in their own heads. Real life doesn't really work like this outside of high school, but if they want to keep believing it is, then go right ahead.

I kind of stopped for about two years because I was too busy socializing and playing sports, but in 97 I picked back up again big time with Street Fighter, FFVII, Tactics, Saiyuki, Puzzle Fighter, Parappa, pretty much played a lot of those kinds of games through college.

I quit ffxi when I was 25 and I'm really picky about what I play now, but my husband and I play a lot of games and we have lots of friends, guys and girls, that do.

They're more wired to lose themselves as a character rather than in the spectacle of cool explosions and violence. Thing is, devs already make plenty of these games and my current girlfriend has been raiding my library for new and old games just like this. I see the history of girls and video games as, initially girls were discouraged from them because of them not being feminine etc. and over time it has become more socially acceptable for them to play and we've seen an increase in girl gamers as a result and I think that's great.

I am angry at all the women who demand that an established community (such as xbox live) make changes in its system just because they don't like an aspect of it. 		The most egregious example is women who often whine about how they  receive so much **verbal (and sometimes textual)) harassment** from men online. Guess what? FUCKING EVERYONE gets harassed online. You're black? get called a nigger. You're asian? Get called a chink. You're latino? get called a spick. You're white? get called a honkey or gringo or what have you. You've got a high pitched voice? get called a fag. You suck at the game? get called a bitch. You are good at the game? they fucked your mom. 		That's just the god damn way it is. If you can't handle people being mean to you over the internet, than either grow thicker skin or fuck off somewhere else. Equal treatment means not having to make special rules (see halo 4's multiplayer sexism bans) to cater to you		virginal. Why is this the go-to insult for those who claim to be in support of women's rights? It implies that, not only is a mans worth inherently tied to how much sex he has, but it also places sex in some sort of twisted place where it is a marker to measure who is worth listening to (those who fuck girls) and who can be ignored and ridiculed (those who do not) that is some seriously fucked up logic. And seems like it goes against everything that sex-positive feminists stand for.		On that note, I can assure you that I am very much not a virgin, and (not that I like to gloat, but you brought it up) I am extremely certain that my "number" (read: women banged) is higher than yours. 		Moving on: neckbeard. Wrong again; I actually take care to shave my face (and neck, even though that part is more bothersome) on the daily. Otherwise I would have a very scratchy face.

{"body":"Indeed, it's so horrible that developers are being **pressured** by *feminists* to developing games that keep such a /tiny/ number of people in mind. It's not like females were found to make up about 47% of all gamers in 2012.		Why should they get what they want? 		Sarcasm aside. This is dumb, guys. There have always been females playing video games, and the numbers climb every year.		Personally, I get offended when I'm being pandered to by devs with oversexualized men and women. It's hard to take an idea of developers including and changing these characters because I have a cock, and they think their product will sell better if they can convince me to think with it.		I'm not against sexuality as a device in gaming (sultry seductresses and assassins who use their sexuality as a weapon stand out for appropriate places), but there are characters that have no reason to be sexualized. 		An example of sexuality done right would have to be Catherine, although I hated the end, and the general mechanics left a lot to be desired, they did characters well.		Some good examples of sexuality done wrong is Never Dead (the boss is quite simply tits on a stick), and half the female champions in League of Legends (There is an Arctic themed champion, Sejuani, who is basically in a fur bikini).	______________	**Edit:** I've gotten a lot of questions on my source for the 47% statistic: [Here](http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2012.pdf) is my source. 		They got their information from NPD, a company based around finding consumer information for companies to utilize when planning future products. They use 2 million surveyors with varied demographics for one portion of their information gathering. The other portion is done directly from retailers, when applicable. 		I'd also like to address the most frequent argument that was given towards this: 		"These women only play casual games, because of this other statistic that says 33% of people play games on cell phones." 		This is a flawed thought in multiple ways:		* Not all people who play "casually" are female. I play casual games. And while I play other games too,  I have a buddy that ONLY has time to play "casual", and he does so buses and such. Using the very small sample-size of my personal life isn't quite sound, but it gives reasonable doubt to the idea of "all  "casuals" are female".		* Not all iPhone games are strictly "casual", utilizing that vague concept of a time of game with limited mechanics and lacking story. Yes, there are a lot of shitty games for the iOS, but there are a lot of shitty games for the 360 and PC. Bad Rats. Those cheap hunting and shooter games that you find laying in a pile at a Dollar store, 3/4ths of the kinect line-up.  These are all crappy games. And to show a counter to this: Angry Birds sold really well on the 360, and I don't believe the idea that "casual" gamers would buy a 360 just for more Angry Birds. Good, entertaining iPhone games? Sword and Sworcery, the Capcom DS games that were ported over (Ghost Detective, etc.), Space Team. 		* As above shown by my own gaming habits, people can play multiple types of games.

But next time you look at some scantily clad female figure and cry "objectification!" take a gander at male figures as well.

As videogames have become more mainstream and focus has turned towards things like character depth and plot, I will say that female characters are often less developed than male counterparts.

I'm not saying that power objectification is not itself an issue.

See I disagree with this statement, and have rarely seen people compare video games and other media in a sensible way.

{"body":">You can't use Twilight as a method of saying "Oh, well, someone liked this, it's okay for this to be dominate in gaming." That's a stupid argument.		The argument is that if female oriented media are allowed to portray women a certain way, male oriented media should be allowed to portray them the same way, without accusations of sexism.		>And women do consume video games and comics, it's just idiots who think "girls need girl things and boys need boy things" that screws up everything.

I am totally for this, and if you want to do this, more power too you.

I've played sports from the time I could walk and began university as a music major (i.e. I've always been heavily involved in music). Video games are only ever brought up *after* the fact.		>Do you know how many guilds or servers tear themselves apart on a daily basis over girl gamers?

I don't play MMORPG's, or for that matter, really any online multiplayer unless I'm playing with friends. TF2 is honestly the only game I play where I end up playing with randoms, and my steam username is gender non-specific. So no, I don't know about this dynamic, but I hardly think it's fair for you to attack me for it. Honestly, if I were playing those games though, why would I taunt people playing the same game? It makes no sense. Some people are attention whores. Some *PEOPLE*. Yes this means some women are.

This world CAN exist, and honestly has been getting better, in my opinion. Instead of getting mad at a girl that expresses interest in gaming (calling her a fake geek, not a real gamer, etc), cultivate that interest. You want more chill girl gamers? Stop isolating them, stop attacking them (NOTE: I only very rarely encounter sexist guys while playing games, so I'm not trying to say this is how most guys are. It's a small, vocal minority.). And how am I exacerbating the situation? I still don't see it. 	>The only way to fix the problem would be by getting these guys girlfriends, and that's not gonna happen.		Seriously? Have some pride, and some respect. 		I'm not responding to you if you respond again. I think there are some respect issues on both sides of this larger issue. My original comment was meant to be in jest, but I apologize that you saw it as a desperate cry for attention. I promise you that was not the intent.

{"body":"Haha! This isn't incredibly relevant... It totally just reminded me of this though. My older sister has been my gaming sibling since for longer than I can remember (We played LoZ:OoT when it came out, and I don't remember that far back.) And after a while, she kinda just stopped playing games with me (I live in a house with 3 sisters and no brothers, so I really didn't have any other people to play with, as my neighborhood was pretty deserted at the time). I always wanted to play with her again.		But when Halo 3 came out, I played it night and day - Constantly. I didn't think she'd ever really get dedicated to playing again, so I came to terms with that. However, one day she asked if she could play with me, so I was more than happy to (Yay, friendship!) So we play Team Doubles as her first Matchmaking game (She didn't want to play with other/alot of people yet. The first game type to come? Team Snipers on Valhalla - which is basically Hell on Earth for a nooby. So when the match comes, we're getting DOMINATED - It's 30 kills to 10. I've been playing for a really long time, so I'm a pretty decent shot with the sniper. So the enemy team is always hanging back, and taking shots from the bushes/trees, and we don't see them until it's too late. (I stay close to my sister, because I have to help her out with the basics -which in turn, gets us both killed)		So I realized something - If we wanted to win, we'd have to be creative. Thus began Operation: "Retard Magnet". I'd have her sprint out into the open field in the most drunkard way possible, zig-zagging, ducking, jumping, ext. The enemies would see her, and try to shoot her, but they couldn't predict where she was moving! I sat back and took them out as quick as I could. We kept that up for the remainder of the match, and we won 36-50. They barely got any kills after she ran out. So we were hysterically happy and laughing after that.

See, recently there has been an explosion of people that weren't normally gamers into the gaming community. I would chalk this up to the recent harness of the casual market through things like the Nintendo Wii, and mobile phone games. The most noticeable growth has been more females in games. 		Why did we notice the female growth more? Well, probably because we never noticed them before and there's a lot of dudes in gaming. But I really can't say for sure.		Now, since the female growth in games is what we're really noticed we end up blaming them for all of the big issues coming to gaming recently threatening change: sexism, a pandering to male audiences, violence in games- wait a minute. That doesn't sound like something solely female driven ... hmm ....		Like I said before, it's all about the whatever: the hot issues coming to gaming and asking for changes. But these really have nothing to do, solely, with a growing female audience. It has to do with growing audiences of all sorts of people, and a growing attention in the media.		So just remember this.

I wouldn't mind more of a "balance" but I think society overall is just wedged to always lean masculine. I like things to be fair, though.	* I think things have gotten better over the past 10 years for the female gaming population.

Gaming was the only thing in my childhood that got me out of my shell. As a kid I was bullied for my race and quirky (nerdy) habits. The only thing that really was a positive influence in my self-esteem growth was, in fact, video games (sadly). I remember watching my grandpa play Diablo 1 and 2 for HOURS while I ignored the leg numbness and back cramps I felt from sitting in one position for long periods of time. As I got older he started teaching me how to play the games I watched him play. I graduated from The Ultimate Haunted House to Dungeon Keepers 2, Diablo and Throne of Darkness. I felt that at least in this world I could be someone that mattered and no one was there to tell me how horrible I was for simply being different. What gets me about this pictures is that it acts as if us women gamers are attention seeking whores who only start playing games to be apart of what is new and cool.

{"body":"I've made comments in response to this gamer chick sexism stuff before. Given my age (early 30's) I remember playing games (tabletop RPG's) before these guys were born, and yet somehow, as a geek woman, I'm somehow reliant upon men gamers, no matter what generation, to validate my interests in gaming. Why do I need geek-cred from sexist gamer dudes at all?		Given my somewhat outsider perspective as an older geek, I can see the sexism from both an insider and outsider perspective. I spent 15 years with a male gaming group (they grew up in the 80's playing D&D 1st ed) who at one time were like my extended family and the sexism was the same as it is now--only more rampant now: I had to constantly prove my ability/interest in gaming, whereas they just didn't because they were guys. I was told I was cool because I was a 'gamer chick,' but really that meant I was 'cool even though I was a girl.' Note the difference. It was almost as if I was FORGIVEN for having a vagina. 		My brain did psychological cartwheels trying to be accepted. It was like they gave me an honorary spot at the big kids table, even though I was old enough to be a big kid and that alone should have given me access to the table. It took me a long time to realize that no matter how hard I tried, I would never truly convince them that it wasn't necessary for me to constantly prove my worth; they had already decided the moment I wanted to be accepted. 		I'm convinced the men in the group started from a place of power, knowing I wanted to be accepted because I liked games and they played them and that I had to be dependent upon them to play those games. There weren't a lot of women who played games back then, so I was somewhat of a rarity (also, I wasn't 300 pounds and married into the SCA). A metaphorical chair was pulled out for me, but any new or old male member in the group were GIVEN a chair.  It was an easy power to both exercise and keep, kind of like a game (pun intended). All they had to do was remind me that my title was honorary but immediately accept all men to the group, which is what they did. This is exactly what the sexist geek dudes are doing right now.		It's easy to keep this kind of power. All they have to do is realize they have it and make comments reminding you of it. The very fact that you had to prove your worth just validated their status. 		Now that I'm a bit older and I no longer hang out with those people (also, I found a wonderful gaming group), I realize that the next generation of women are doing the same thing I did or have to put up with the same shit I did, only now there's more gamer women than there were when I was playing those games. 		You're not an outcast because you're a geek and you're not a geek because you're an outcast anymore. Women have more access to the culture now and find they enjoy it. Given our sex, we are usually slow to jump on these trends because we are traditionally more social, have more access to sexual partners, and don't have the amount of time afforded tragically anti-social boys who had to trade sexual relationships and the social commitment that goes with them. They couldn't get a GF so they gamed when games were obscure, rare, and for extreme geeks doing extremely geeky things. They hated girls because they couldn't get a GF. Then girls wanted to play games too when the two social worlds collided. I think they see women as having and withholding the sexual power, and so it's only fair that they have and withhold the gaming power. 		Men were there first, like they seem to be for everything. I think the only way to beat this kind of sexism is to not demand acceptance--that would mean we have to somehow rely on their acceptance, but assume it. Don't demand a seat because that just tells them they have the power to grant or deny the seat in the first place. If you're a woman who wants to game and you find a group and your gender somehow takes center stage, just walk away until you find a group that just accepts you--not despite or because of your gender, but because of your interests. 		Sexist jerks are sexist because they get their jollies making women constantly validate their existence. (Historically, they made women prove they were merely women by assuming the power over the definition of what it meant to be a woman at all; this is just another way of exercising control over our gender) You aren't going to convinced them that you're worthy. There's no cred point counter that, after you prove yourself enough, tallies your score and adds up to acceptance. Sexist gamer dudes enjoy exercising a power that takes next to nothing to maintain but almost your whole being to fight against. It's not your fault they can't get a GF, you are not the spokesperson or apology for your entire gender. To them, you represent all the girls that shunned them and they're just returning the favor.

{"body":"But what if I'm not witholding gaming power? What if I just don't mind girls playing video games so long as they're not actively trying to ruin games I enjoy? 'cause that's how it is for me. I'm not going to go and watch Twilight and complain about how there are no shirtless women. Oh, is that sexist for me to say that only women enjoy Twilight? Just like how it's sexist to say only men enjoy video games, right? It's always women playing the victim, fucking always.		Withholding sexual power? Why is it wrong for us to think that yet right to think that men are withholding gaming power, whatever the hell that means? We're not preventing you from playing video games. Go, buy a game, play it. However, you definitely are withholding sexual power. I can't just go up and get sex like you can go up and get a video game. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. I'd love to be able to get sex whenever, but I understand that's how it is. That's part of the reason I play video games: So I can get away from social situations and having to deal with women I know I'll never be able to get with. It's why I enjoy girls looking slutty and being more submissive in video games. It's nice that I can wrap myself in a fantasy realm different from reality.
