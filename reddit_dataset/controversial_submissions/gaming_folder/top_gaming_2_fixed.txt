{"body":"I have been playing both systems (can provide proof with a pic if necesary) and I have to say I'm more impressed with the improvement of the Dualshock 4 over the Xbox One Controller. The R2 on the PS4 is so much sleeker with the slight curvature, feels more like a trigger than the XBOX. The Analogs are better because of the indenture, and it really gives the Xbox a run for it's money, but as I have been playing Xbox far longer than PS4, I still think I'll do better with shooters on Microsoft's console. Doesn't mean I won't be buying Killzone though ;). 		 One of the main selling points on the Xbox One controller to me was the weighted triggers, but I have learned it doesn't actually work as well as Microsoft described. It's more of a rumble control, as opposed to giving you resistance, which was disappointing, because I was looking to have weapons like Bows feeling more authentic. But overall the controller feels better than the 360, just not as big of a leap that I felt with the Dualshock 4. 		As far as graphically, on the games I've played, there isn't much of a difference. The framerate is more fluid at 1080 on the PS4, but it hasn't really been that noticeable. From the Dev guys I hear that PS4 is alot easier to develop for, but a big reason that is the case is because Xbox One is being developed from the ground up, as opposed to PS4, which is using alot of the same tools from the PS3. So the development for Xbox One should get easier as time goes on.

{"body":"In his defense, I had a Razer Onza that had what looked like very similar sticky soft rubber material over the sticks which did exactly the same thing, and even had exactly the same scratch marks. 		I was perplexed because I seldom used it.  My guess was maybe the scratches / gouges were from my nails based on the way I had a tendency to use the stick.  (actually it was during my playthough of dark souls that the left stick died a death like this.  So that was like 100 hours of play alone.  I should do a picture of my onza with the YOU DIED screen...)		Soft rubber like this is not a good choice for the sticks though, based on my razer onza experience, and the fact razer totally changed this to a way more durable stick on the sabertooth.  Sony will probably change this on future production runs of controllers.		In the meantime I'm going to be putting silicone caps on mine as soon as I get it, like the ones that come with the razer sabertooth.  Or the ones I have on my dualshock 3.  Actually if they fit, I'll probably just borrow the ones right off of my sabertooth.		EDIT:  Heres why I think this happens.  I have small hands, and when I play with an xbox controller I put my left thumb against the edge of the stick right where you see the half moon of wear in the picture.  And when you pull down on the stick with your thumb like this, your nail gouges into the top of the stick.  I don't really play with my DS3 this way because the sticks are lower and my thumb reaches them easier.  This MAY be symptomatic of being used to Xbox controllers because of the positioning of the left stick training you to put your thumb in that position because of the offset stick.

{"body":"I'm going to dispel this right now.		The PS3 controller fits any hand when used properly. If you use it like an X-box controller, with your palm high up on the sides near the bumpers, of course it's going to seem small. The trick is to cradle the handles with your middle, ring and pinky finger of both hands. This pulls anyone's hands back to the proper distance from the analog sticks and shoulder buttons. If you have exceptionally large hands, only use the ring and pinky because you obviously have thicker than normal fingers.		Make two finger guns. Turn them slightly inward and open the middle ring and pinky finger where the handles go. This curls your index finger to curl around the shoulder buttons. Bam, proper PS3 grip.		It might not be as natural as Xbox's grip, but I prefer cradling my controller rather than having to maintain a solid grip on it.		edit: Prove me wrong if your so sure the controller could never fit your hand. I knew a guy who could bend his fingers over the average person's down to the middle knuckle in their fingers and he never once said it was too small.

This is the prefered method.  It's harder but it has a higher success rate because the main reason the console got the RROD in the first place is because of the cheap, low quality thermal paste they used.		Also the fans in the back are 12 volt but they wired them to a 6 volt power supply to make them run quieter.  If you don't mind a bit of extra noise while playing, you should re wire the fans to the 12 volt DVD drive power supply so they're running at max speed the whole time.

{"body":"To be sure, you're definitely right in that the solder was the point of failure. The system overheated and the solder melted/broke. However I think it's important to look at the poor heatsink design too. If the heatsink wasn't so bad it would never have gotten so hot that the solder failed. I tried to fix my orignial xbox for months over and over again with different kinds of solutions and was appalled how poor the original xbox cooling solution was. 		The heatsink they used for the GPU on the original was just one small plate about 3x5x1 inches for a GPU at 90nm. The heatsink was cooled by a pair of tiny fans about 4 inches away with a plastic shroud duct with really poor/loose insulation. It looked like this:		http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/8/8/1/9/7/7/webimg/380294580_o.jpg		After you got yours replaced/repaired they decided to use a heatsink with an added heatpipe and mini heat sink. They made this new heatsink the standard with new revision models.		http://benheck.com/Articles/elite/open_7.jpg		When you compare this to the PS3 which had chips that were also built on 90nm at the time, the PS3 heatsink was MASSIVE!

{"body":"I still have my Ps3 controller from 4 years ago, played thousands of hours on it and it's as new. I already hate every change they have made to the Ps4 controller. The sticks are lower down and convex making them much less precise for competitive gaming, though I'll have to try it out to see if they've improved the electronics/software to account for this. 		The touch pad is a stupid gimmick like sixaxis that has no business in a competitive game, and isn't even in comfortable touching distance. They have removed the analogue responsiveness from the face and bumper buttons. Most games didn't make use of them due to the 360 controller also removing them, but this is inarguably a step backwards for console gaming. Analogue buttons are extremely useful when considered as a 2 stage button. For example in metal gear solid 4 you can press softly to lob a grenade, or hard to overarm it. No other game I know allows you to throw grenades in a different arc, and it is a really great feature. They're also extremely useful in sports games. Many Gran Turismo players still prefer to use X to accelerate due to the back buttons on the Ps3 controller being uncomfortable to press in for extended periods of time (causing cramp).		I hate using triggers for shooters, L1/R1 is much better for competitive gaming. A gun is a binary input, there's no reason for it to have a deep analogue trigger. A mouse button is binary too and it's perfect for shooting. The 360 controller may feel more comfortable to casuals, but it is much worse as an actual input device in every way (and there are about a dozen ways).		I feel this is another case of pleasing the vocal minority like with GTAV. GTAIV is the greatest game of all time, but a minority of players complained about it being too serious and were annoyed at the dating mechanics, so they removed those from GTAV and made the game over the top and ridiculous, which makes it less memorable or engaging as an adult player. There is just less social interaction and thus the world feels much less alive. A minority of players complained about the Ps3 controller and preferred the 360 controller, so they've changed everything to be more like the 360 controller ignoring that not everyone shared that preference.","depth":0,"score":-19,"ups":-19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"valleyshrew","name":"t1_cd9m4r5","parent_id":"t3_1q68ek","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1383946352,"created_utc":1383917552}
