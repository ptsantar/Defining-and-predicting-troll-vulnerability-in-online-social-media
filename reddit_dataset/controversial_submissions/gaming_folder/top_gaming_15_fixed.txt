{"body":"Yup.		- It's remarkable that the Sega Genesis was able to compete from 1988-1997. It was the only system to overthrow Nintendo in market share then. The SNES was more capable except for a slower CPU, but Sega developers used programming tricks to keep the games on par near the end of the system's lifecycle. (Mostly with the stock Genesis' limited color palette.)		- While seen as flops, the Sega CD and 32X were both technically impressive, even more so when the entire system was combined. [32X Tech Demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOWZbydnlZE) Also, Virtua Racing (featuring the Sega Virtua co-processor) on Genesis pushed more polygons and ran at a considerably better framerate than the similar Star Fox on SNES		- The Sega Saturn is actually more powerful than the Playstation. It originally was positioned as the "ultimate 2-D system" for things like fighting games and platformers, but when news was that Sony and Nintendo were focusing on 3D, they overhauled the Saturn's design and added a second 28.6 MHz CPU and second VDP (one controlled polygons, the other sprites/background movement). Though, this caused the launch price to increase to it's RIDICULOUSLY high amount. Saturn suffered the same thing as the PS3 and it's Cell architecture, nobody really knew how to take full advantage of the dual processor architecture, and documentation for Saturn dev kits was poor. ALSO, the Saturn rendered polygons with quadrilaterals...not the industry standard triangles. Made cross-platform development difficult.		- The Dreamcast speaks for itself. I'll try not to get into fanboy shit, but I remember watching the PS2  game demoes and being amazed, but then the actual quality of the launch games was far less than what had been shown. Dreamcast games were at least on par with PS2 games (probably because of the earlier development time and debs had longer to hone the craft) at that time. Games like Soul Calibur, Shenmue, and Jet Grind Radio still look and play amazingly. Obviously it got bested in the end, I'm always glad to see it's remembered so fondly.		The downfall of Sega was due to a few things. There was a bad relationship between Sega of America and Sega of Japan, even a limited agreement on strategy for the company. The failures of the Sega CD, 32X, and arguably Saturn put them in a financial hole. The Dreamcast actually had a lot of momentum in the US, but it just wasn't enough to cash that check. EA and other 3rd party developers had abandoned Sega after the Saturn era, and the Dreamcast was built without a DVD drive to reduce costs because of the negative reaction to Saturn's $600 price tag and DC being at an attractive $199...which unfortunately was probably a mistake. Also, Dreamcast games were notoriously easy to pirate. (You can literally just burn them to a regular CD-RW and they'll play in an unmodified stock Dreamcast. It's history!

Most everyone does some form innovation, others find ways to do it better.  That is still innovation.  NEC was not successful, but it was first.  		Nintendo did shoulder buttons first, Sony did 4, which was a step forward, as it allowd for two more easily accessible buttons (4 by one thumb, 2 by 1 finger (2x), as opposed to 6 by one thumb, 1 by 1 finger (2x) step, MS made the back two more usable by changing them to triggers with more ease to control pressure, all were innovative, as they all made it possible for gamers to easily access more buttons, which meant that game designers could push games further, and add more fine control as fewer buttons per finger = easier control & more buttons = more control.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fnut","name":"t1_cgsztx0","parent_id":"t1_cgs7nxi","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1397600128,"created_utc":1397571328}

{"body":"The first conceptions of the PlayStation date back to 1986. Nintendo had been attempting to work with disc-based technology since the Famicom, but the medium had problems. The Famicom Disk System's rewritable magnetic discs could be easily erased (thus leading to a lack of durability), and they lacked any sort of copy protection, thus were vulnerable to piracy. Consequently, when details of CD-ROM XA (which had neither of those problems) were released to the public, Nintendo was interested. Simultaneously developed by Sony and Philips, CD-ROM/XA was an extension of the CD-ROM format that combines compressed audio, visual, and computer data, allowing all to be accessed simultaneously. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the "SNES-CD". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed "The Father of the PlayStation", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.[10]		Ironically, Kutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognized the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo decided to not move forward with the project that Sony decided to develop its own console[11]		Sony also planned to develop a Super Nintendo-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super Nintendo cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.			Because of the risk, Nintendo broke the deal and Sony made the Playstation.","depth":2,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"louiscool","name":"t1_cgs6hgu","parent_id":"t1_cgs68u3","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1397521367,"created_utc":1397492567}

This is the perfect example of Nintendo creating something and Sony taking it up a notch adding HD graphics and better console specifications.		Also, it never hurts to copy the thing that sells well.

It sold well, even though the actual time spent playing the console was about 3-4 hours a week in comparison to the average 20 for PS3 and 360 players. But since the Wii was cheap, parents bought it and gave PS3 and Xbox a reason to follow the motion controller fad. 		Nobody succeeded. The wii, kinect and move are all terrible peripherals. But at least the PS3 and 360 weren't shoving motion controls down your throat. They will stand the test of time as great consoles, where the Wii  is typically shelved and a dust collector after 2-3 months of owning it.		So the game companies work together.

I'm in spain, and the lowest bundle I've gotten is 469€ for knack, the ps4 and 2 controllers. Considering the ps4 does not also have a screen, you can build a pretty damm good PC for 500€ and upgrade it mid-console cycle, and get your games from steam. Can you really do this with the Wii U? Not trying to sound like a fanboy here, but let's be honest: their exclusives really seem like exclusives. I've yet to play a mario, zelda, mario kart, or metroid clone that is as good as the original offerings. 		It seems to me that sony and ms are not doing a good enough job to make their consoles more than just powerful pcs for a slightly lower price that have hook up and play funcitonality on games.
