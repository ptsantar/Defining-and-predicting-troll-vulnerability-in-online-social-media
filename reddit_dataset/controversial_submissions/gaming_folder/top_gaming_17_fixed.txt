Halo 3: ODST has halo 3 in the title, its more like a DLC campaign with multiplayer.  Wars wasn't bungie, but it was much different. Reach vastly improved forge and armor customization, and added armor abilities and changed vehicles again. Its also worth mentioning that it added invasion, because invasion is awesome.

This on top of bringing one of the few unreal esque shooters on console it has itself in a unique position. Those are the things that change drastically(aside from its unreal gameplay as that is static), the lesser but still relevant change is to the weapons. From re-balancing to full out retcons of design and use (like the plasma rife to repeater) but things like this overshadow the fact that the guns are SUPER generic. Right now you have a assult rifle, the storm rifle, and the suppreser, they all have their own niches actually and are very well ballanced, but then you see they are indeed all the "same" gun with small-large tweeks, however I don't think that's a bad thing.

{"body":"You really don't know what you are talking about. I've owned and played all the Halo titles and most COD titles developed by Infinity Ward so I have a decent understanding of the game play and mechanics of each released title and what changes were made. Everything, and I mean the tiniest details ranging from the pace of your stride to the height of your jumps, to the explosion radius of grenades, targeting reticules and weapon recoil, changes from one Halo game to another. You get new weapons every time (even if they share a similar name from previous games, they are different models of the same weapon and they behave differently). The fundamentals are the same, but that's about as far as a comparison that you can derive. 		COD on the other hand is literally the same game over and over. Same engine, same graphics, same mechanics... same game play. Only thing new each time is the run of perks, which in my opinion is just another roster of them trying to figure out an even balance with perks (and always failing since there is always a perk combo set that allows players to dominate the playing field).		Both games are fun to play regardless, which is the reason for their popularity. But you can't just come in and say, "Oi, look at le irony here" because there is none. Halo (not including 4) was made by one team each time, and took roughly 3 years to make, where as COD has two development teams pumping out a game every year with literally nothing different minus the perks.

A Warning will also display in case your squad mate is receiving fire, leaving the option to you wether you should spawn quickly and help or not spawn. You can spawn directly on vehicles that are on different points across the map, even in boats / ATVs so you don't need to spawn at the base in order to get a vehicle		* The map design. All the maps are very well executed and fun to play in. I couldn't stand conquest in BF3 because the maps were basically open areas with some buildings and hills in them. You would be left in the middle of nowhere as the other point you need to capture as 500m away, and by the time you got there your teammates had capped it already. Now all the maps seem to flow very well, maybe because of the abundance of vehicles, but it may be the added depth when it comes to verticallity, naval warfare, underground parts of the map, as well as the destruction. The points are spread out, but they aren't so far away that it is useless to walk to said point, but taking a vehicle is more effective. Paracel Storm is an absolut blast, SoS has lots of little passages and "hidden" ways you can take to the objectives, and most importantly, it feels like every point is different. Defending the top of the tower is different from defending the C point in Rogue transmission , or defending a point outside of Op Locker because of the blizzard. The levolution events may be gimmicky, but they add an extra layer of tactic. Maybe the SoS tower is a great point if you are in control of it, how about defending it?

No more jumping desperatly infront of supports to get the damn ammo, no more getting lost in the middle of nowhere because the guy ran off with the jeep. This is one of the small but very important changes, and it is extremelly effective at having some more teamplay in the game. 		* The class balance. Now, assaults don't rape everything there is, and Recon and Support are a lot more useful at different tasks, but can also have the same stopping power of the Assault since the carbines are now all class weapons. The Support is incredibly useful at breaking cover and killing enemies in tall buildings / behind cover with the mortar and the airburst. The engineer now has a sort of C4 too ( the M2 SLAMS ) as well as support and recon. The amount of gagdets is overwhelming and means that you can have multiple people using the same class, but having completly different rolls. A Recon can have an AK5C and C4 as well as motion sensors and be a very effective anti tank / anti personel machine, while another recon can be a sniper and a laser designator. Sure, this was possible in BF3 too, but not to such an extent.		* The gunplay. The weapons feel and sound a lot better. A PDW feels like it is shooting pistol rounds, while the M82 AMR feels really fucking heavy and hard hitting. As I said, the assault rifles aren't the go to weapons anymore with carbines being all class, while all the machine guns get added accuracy and extended mag by default (most of them anyways). The shotguns seem to have better range, the snipers are no longer rendered useless by the supression, which still works very well but will no longer stop you from taking a perfect shot. There are also new sorts of grenades which can be useful in different kinds of situations. You can have smoke in any class now, the incendiary grenade is great at making a barrier and the mini nades are just awesome. The new attachaments also add to the customization and there are lots of combinations to play and choose from. No longer is the HBAR and foregrip the go to choice. The FLIR and thermal scopes are once again useful but not OP and specially good with smoke, since you can now use these scopes to see through it.		* The destruction. Well this is the most obvious point, but destruction has been greatly improved, even better than BC2. Now there will be snobs everywhere saying that you cant blow every single building but that is for a reason. Specially in SoS, if you could make all those skyscrapers accesible, the map would be a chaos. On Golmud rail for instance, the little village can be rendered to dust. As well as houses and even very long sleeping chambers or whatever they are can be brought down completly ( like in Langang and Zavod). Also, the microdestruction is at its best. Shoot through wooden planks, break those concrete barriers with bullets, etc. 		* The graphics and sound. Holy crap does this game look amazing. And it sounds even better too. Your aim shakes as a building nearby tumbles, guns sound and echo differently depending on where you are (outside or inside), explosions leave a giant cratter in soft ground, the sound of the jets rushing by you, holy crap. God dammit, even the particles have shadows!		These are the things I find the most relevant, but there are also many other things I didnt mention, such as the commander ( can use some improvement, but the tablet implementation is great ), the battle pickups, domination in every map which is actually quite nice, the new mode obliteration, attack jets in conquest which are very effective, different weapons for vehicles, etc etc		Seriously, just play the game more, it is the most fun I have had in recent times and it is a tremendous improvement to BF3, I don't know it really feels much better.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vIKz2","name":"t1_cdf4znz","parent_id":"t1_cdekedu","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1384571823,"created_utc":1384543023}

All the maps are very well executed and fun to play in. I couldn't stand conquest in BF3 because the maps were basically open areas with some buildings and hills in them. You would be left in the middle of nowhere as the other point you need to capture as 500m away, and by the time you got there your teammates had capped it already. Now all the maps seem to flow very well, maybe because of the abundance of vehicles, but it may be the added depth when it comes to verticallity, naval warfare, underground parts of the map, as well as the destruction.

{"body":"In ghosts, you get 8 perk points, and certain perks cost more or less points. i personally think that there are quite a few very good perks that only cost 1 or two points, so you could have, say 6 perks that are all very good. the perks that cost more are also good, mind you, but i feel like many people are choosing to have several low cost perks because they are all so good. you can trade in your secondary or primary weapons for more perk points too. i have traded in my secondary on some of my classes for 2 more points, which lets you have 1 or 2 MORE perks. Also, the unlock system is bullshit. for leveling up, and completing operations you get what are called squad points, which are used to buy every equip-able thing in the game.(weapons, grenades, tacticals etc.) they are also used to unlock more classes. You can buy ANY of these things at ANY level providing you have enough squad points. I hate this to no end, because it takes away all incentive to level up. For example, i got the "best" (meaning highest level) assault rifle at level 5, and i could have bought any sniper, shotgun, lmg if wanted to. there are two main problems with this. The first is that anyone can start right off the bat with anything they want as soon as they get the points for it. eventually, for example people will decide on what guns are OP, and such, and by level 7 or 8, everyone can have their favorite things without having to earn it like every other previous cod. the second problem with this is somewhat related, and it is the fact that squad points are fairly slow to earn, especially at later levels because leveling up in this game is extremely slow compared to previous games. Because we aren't unlocking things via levels, and have to spend our points instead, we lost the ability to experiment with classes. lets say i was brand new to the game, and i get to level 15. normally i would have unlocked a few guns, some perks and different pieces of equipment by now. In ghosts, i have to spend the points i earned, which at this point would be about 30 + a few more if i completed some operations. Scenario one will be that I decide i will unlock a new gun, so i pick the highest level AR to try. i spend 9 points (this is actually what it costs) and try it out, and i don't like it so i buy another one that i do end up enjoying. i now have 12 points left. using this gun, i realize i get a lot of 9 kill streaks so i buy the attack helicopter killstreak, and i now have 3 points left that i may be able to use to buy a perk i like. level 15, and i have 4 things unlocked, and no attachments for my gun because you have to buy those too.. Scenario two is that i am level 15 and i have buying things along the way, and i pick up a gun off the ground, and i really like it. however, because of the new system while i could technically buy it now, i dont have enough points to do so, so i start a new soldier to earn some quick points (squad points are cumulative across all soldiers you create) i get to level 6 on the new one, get 12 squad points which is enough for the gun and one attachment for it. now though, i don't have any points left for that soldier, so he gets left hanging until i can earn enough points to get him something decent as well. I hope this kind of shows the problems this new system has, if you have any questions let me know because this may be a bit confusing.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Connor149","name":"t1_cdeg7wt","parent_id":"t1_cdef592","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1384492692,"created_utc":1384463892}

I fucking HATE the level up to get stuff system because it just makes the issue of overpowered equipment even worse. All it means is that instead of everyone having the OP equipment, only people who have played longer get the OP equipment. This ruins the difficulty for newer players who will find the game a lot harder to play solely because of the equipment.		On top of this, there is some stuff that people just find fun to use. Why should I have to wait until I'm level X to be able to use C4 when my favourite method of playing is CQ C4 suicide bombing?

You are right about gta, and how the high level items are significantly more powerful but i think its different in cod in that getting higher levels is, for the most part, just giving you more options, because the guns are mostly balanced. i guess i can see both sides, but what i really want is rewards for getting max prestige, or the prestiges along the way. i Just like being rewarded for putting more effort in than others. for example, in ghosts, i could see a lot of people maxing out just one soldier, and only playing around with the other ones once they have one guy maxed, so there should be rewards for prestiging multiple guys.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Connor149","name":"t1_cdenso8","parent_id":"t1_cdekaab","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1384510855,"created_utc":1384482055}

Since the dawn of Call of Duty, when our teenagers first discovered the killing power of FG42s and M1A1 Carbines, blood has been spilled in the name of everything: from Boredom to Enterainment to simple, teenage rage.		In the year 2013, after millennia of armed conflict, the destructive nature of man could sustain itself no longer. The world was plunged into an abyss of Call of Duty: Ghosts.		But it was not, as the haters had predicted, the end of the Call of Duty. Instead, Ghosts was simply the prologue to another bloody chapter of Call of Duty. For teens had succeeded in destroying the noobs - but Call of Duty, Call of Duty never changes.		In the early days, thousands were spared the horrors of the holocaust by taking refuge in enormous underground forums, known as Reddit. But when they emerged, they had only the hell of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 to greet them - all except those in /r/Gaming. For on that fateful day, when Call of Duty rained from the sky, the giant steel door of Gaming slid closed... and never reopened. It was here you were born. It is here you will die.

{"body":"How is this getting downvoted?  It's not a circlejerk, it's the truth.  Here's my problems with Ghosts:		1. Impossible to see from a distance.  Muted dark colors make it hard to identify things.		2. Lag.  You can't see connections for opponents.		3. Maps are huge for 6v6.  It's mostly camping.  If you do move around your thumbs hurt because you have to sprint.  You will die in under a minute anyways.		4. Point system is terrible.  You need to log serious hours to unlock something.  If you buy something you don't like you are screwed.		5. New perks are cool but again it takes so long to rank up people that play 10 hours a day have a massive advantage.		6. Lag (again).  You get killed and don't even see the person or see them shoot once.  Lag with the dog is insane.  You can't react and it's almost a guaranteed death.		7. Guns have a bad balance.  People generally use five different guns.  Since they moved to the point system there's no incentive to use different guns to unlock attachments or gold camo.  You can only unlock other camo's for random tasks.		8. More maps.  No choke points so people are spread out everywhere.  This makes for no battles.  Buildings have so many entries you can't play strategy and lock a building down.		9. Spawn.  WTF!
