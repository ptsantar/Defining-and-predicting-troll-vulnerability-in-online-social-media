{"body":"Point for point:		1. Android's power management is configurable and irrelevant. A plugged-in device doesn't need power management; you just turn the service off.	2. You don't use hardware or software to support "AA" titles; you get agreements.	3. The 1.5 GHzq Tegra3 is significantly more powerful than the Wii's 729MHz single core CPU / 243 MHz GPU	4. "Optimized for gaming" just means the OS is deprioritized with a high kernel clock, input processing is prioritized, and the audio and video buses are given priority.  These are easily configured in any linux system.	5. While Android is easy to emulate on a computer, you will not get anything approaching the console's clock speeds.  You're obviously not a programmer, or you'd know this from some level of experience.	6. The claim that OUYA will be unable to emulate PC games from 1998 is, let's be honest, plain fucking stupidity.  Why would you *emulate* those games when they should be *ported*?  Do you expect to emulate 1998 games on any other console?	7. Your phone doesn't have a 1.5 GHz quad core RISC and a gig of RAM.  Your phone doesn't have a controller standard.  Sure, there may be a lot of phone -> OUYA ports, since the barrier is low - but with 13838 backers with reserved consoles _1 day into the kickstarter_, there's a good bet that there will be an audience for OUYA ports of PC and console games, as well as original-on-OUYA games from indie developers.

Wrong.  x86 processors are, flop for flop, more expensive and hotter-running devices than the kind of RISC architectured things Tegra falls under.  That's why these things are used in phones and tablets.		It's largely to do with the congealed complexity that comes from being a mainstream standard; you can't deprecate anything.  Assembly code that runs on an 8086 will still run on the most modern PC -worse, some of the terrible design decisions from the early Pentium era still live on in modern hardware - not as generalized instructions, but implemented in hardware.  x86s are awesome - but their complexity gives them inherent expense.		Eventually ARM and other RISC-style chipsets will get to this point - but they're not there yet, and that lets them be simple, small and fast.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fordiman","name":"t1_c5ctoi4","parent_id":"t1_c5cs6t2","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1342096469,"created_utc":1342067669}
{"body":">Wrong. x86 processors are, flop for flop, more expensive and hotter-running devices than the kind of RISC architectured things Tegra falls under.		I'm aware of the efficiencies of RISC.

Even taking into account the advantages of a RISC CPU, is the Tegra3 more powerful than your average x86 cpu these days? I doubt it. Sure, it may have a better price/power ratio, or a better heat/power ratio, but none of those things matter because just about everyone already owns an x86 cpu with its own fan/heatsink. You don't gain anything by buying a Tegra if you already own an x86 chip, even if the Tegra is more efficient.		I can understand using Tegra in a phone or tablet. Power consumption / heat production in those devices is paramount. But why buy a whole new console with one? Why not just keep using a PC?

My power company, Consumers Energy, charges $0.079797 per kWh, so [plugging that into W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.92+*+%240.079797), it tells me that a more realistic estimate of monthly power cost is- wait for it- 23 cents.		When I make up bullshit to use in arguments, I make sure they're ridiculous overestimates so that if my estimate is wrong, my point still stands even with the revised numbers.","depth":9,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lx45803","name":"t1_c5c9jdj","parent_id":"t1_c5c97fl","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1341999792,"created_utc":1341970992}

{"body":"The small company I manage has been developing with OpenGL ES 2.0 on the Android platform for the last two years.  Prior to that myself and other folks here worked on five Call of Duty games, three Rock Band titles, Wolfenstein, Bomberman, Heretic II, Halo 2, and others.  I have a ton of experience with exactly this platform and console titles in general.		1) Power Management		This is basically irrelevant here, for a couple reasons.  Firstly is that this is a plugged in device and battery life isn't an issue.  Second is that this device is using a Tegra3, and even when it's running flat-out the power usage of a Tegra device is a tiny fraction of that a PS3 or a 360 uses.  That said, I suspect you're just using your terminology wrong.		The impression I get is that you're talking about Android's prioritization, meaning you think the OS is going to be using a bunch of CPU time in the background, thus taking it away from the game.  Compared to a 360 this may be true, but my experience so far is that it's not a meaningful issue, certainly not any more than a Windows title.  The foreground process gets plenty of priority on Android, and if anything this device would have a lot of the usual background cruft stripped out as it doesn't need to deal with telephony or widgets or anything.		2) Games		This console is NOT a beast compared to the Xbox360 or PS3, at least not in the CPU department (8 gig of ram is pretty spectacular, actually).  However, you are underselling the performance of the Tegra3.  Looking at the raw numbers it's comparable in speed to what you'd get out of an XBox 360, and it will absolutely spank a Wii.		The biggest issues here (compared to a 360) aren't actually due to the chipset so much as the fact it'll likely be using OpenGL ES, which is missing some very useful functionality (such as the ability to scale a lower-res buffer inexpensively to screen res).  There are some nVidia specific extensions that can help ameliorate these issues however, and due to the fact a game for this platform can count on them being there they'll probably even be worth supporting.		Things like this matter because the Tegra3's fillrate is pretty much the same as on the 360, a device that struggles to run well at 1080p.  If you can't upscale cheaply that's going to make adequate performance at that resolution fairly difficult.  I view this as the device's biggest problem given customer expectation.		Your point about making something like Uncharted is just naive.  The hardware here is not night and day different, speed wise, to a PS3 or 360.  You could definitely make something comparable on this device from a technical standpoint, just like you could on a Tegra3 based tablet (though you'd be taking a big risk, since you can't count on the hardware being there yet).  Regardless, the big thing is the art -- it would cost twenty million dollars in development to match Uncharted's production quality, but that isn't the hardware's problem.		3) Emulation		Most people, and I use 'most' as a severe understatement, do not have a PC attached to their television, and so far as I can tell don't want one.  The fact a PC can do the same things doesn't really seem like the point here.  Whatever floats your boat, though.		4) Your Device Already Does it		This is a completely valid point and is basically the same as my attitude towards the device -- it's interesting, and I'd consider developing for it, but I'd have to see something more compelling to take the risk of making something exclusive for it.  If one of those guys sent me an e-mail saying they'd pay for development then sure, but independently and self-funded I'd be hedging my bets all over the place.  The biggest risk of this thing is that it's not coming from a major player, and that hasn't worked well historically in this segment.  Random dude at Wal-Mart will mostly ignore it.		Still, I can think of worse things than an inexpensive, reasonably easy to support device that allows you to play Android titles in a proper living room environment without dealing with the somewhat-touchy-in-my-experience HDMI/bluetooth support of whatever tablet you own.","depth":0,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Terazilla","name":"t1_c5cakcw","parent_id":"t3_wco0r","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1342003941,"created_utc":1341975141}

{"body":"There is so much hate in this post that it's just insulting to the end goal the OUYA is trying to create here.		Think of it this way. When I saw the kickstarter video, the one thing that struck in their end goal was to bring more people together in front of the TV to play an open-source console game. Of course the hardware wasn't going to be top notch, but it's to be expected.		Think of the long run in all of this. Since Android is a very accessible platform to develop on, game devs can design games with more interactive multiplayer support for TV console based systems, opening the market to casual players who may not really understand all the underlying ways to try and run emulators. It opens the market of open-source games to the casual console market, in which recent times, feel shafted for some of the limitations going on in the console world, what with all the DRM going on and the decline of the console age from what it used to be (Kinect anyone. Usher in E3?)		Even with hardware that feels a bit limited, there are ways to design with those limitations. Have people all lost hope, that because you don't have good hardware that great games can't be developed for the system?		OUYA can be a trend setter here, the price is well worth it for bringing more casual friendly gaming into the market. Yes there are issues like hacking and whatnot, but for its end goal, it's pretty promising. Don't think that the games it has now will be the only things there.		**TL:DR** - OUYA's end goal to broaden open-source gaming from the developers to the casual console market, who could very well not know how to utilize their PC to emulate themselves (too much hassle) at an inexpensive price is very promising, albet some issues, and devs can develop easy for the system to fight the sort of decline the console market is going through right now.

{"body":"I see a lot of cynical users not really understanding the approach Ouya is taking. It's the Snapple approach.. Wii didn't try to go head on with XBOX360 or PS3 because it knew it would lose so it became content with being #3. This to the next level of that type of strategy as far as I can see it. This allows smaller studios or even big studios to experiment with innovative ideas that even if they fall flat it's still a lower risk of loss than doing it on the XBOX or PS3.		We are entering era with gaming similar to 90s indie film movement with the help of New Line Cinema and Miramax Films. In this particular case the indie gaming space has already has had their own TMNT with Angry Birds, allowing this console to just be a place to go develop games cheaply, while acknowledging no AAA or AA titles. And using Angry Bird as an example is bad considering the HUGE FUCKING SUCCESS IT IS! It's like the is no different than what Hollywood does now. You have your summer blockbusters (Transformers), more serious or interesting movies (Fargo comes to mind) and True indie studios just making the games THEY want (think of Clerks).		There is no real downside to this and this is something that is really needed in the gaming industry. Only real people bitching about this are "THE PC MASTER RACE!"		And they aren't the market this is meant to target. When people, aka the masses, think video games; they don't think of the PC. They think XBOX, Wii, Playstation. Power PC users are right that PCs can already do this but those aren't the average user. If the average user was competent then Best Buy would be able to pull horseshit like this: http://imgur.com/fMJhA		The idea of having to install a service like steam, installing a game by going to a site to download it or inserting discs can be VERY intimidating to some because most people don't use their system to JUST game. They have photos, documents, taxes, records, etc and having to do something that you may not know how to do is scary to some. I know, it's not rocket science but neither is changing your car's oil but Jiffy Lube exists. that's what this is, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.

I on the other hand have a wait an see approach, I see potential, they have reached their goal without my help and I expect this to usher in a new era showing off games to people that otherwise wouldn't see it. 		 If you feel it's a scam, then don't put money into it. The idea is sound and keep in mind every feature added to phones were met with same resistance. Camera, Video, games, internet, Messaging are all done a device that is ultimately is supposed to just to make a fucking phone call. So lets not act like we are above being wrong about an idea that maybe good because we may not see it's merits immediately.		TLDR: Let it happen! It's not your money to worry about and it's no way going to hurt the gaming industry but rather allow for independent growth.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mabans","name":"t1_c5cb2qm","parent_id":"t3_wco0r","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1342005953,"created_utc":1341977153}

A cursory examination of the text makes it appear that this was written by a knowledgeable author but a more careful inspection reveals that this is a deception, like it has been written by a clever marketdroid that has learned to ape a human, or perhaps some form of slime mold.		Note the use of "push button" marketing talking points, strung together in a disconnected manner to create the impression of a connected narrative. It falls apart easily when you ask the question: "What does Android's power usage on mobile phones have to do with a console."		The phrase which stood most for me was "XBox with 3.2 GHz optimized for gaming." This is not how people who know what a CPU is write. This is how people who write copy write after being handed a bunch of phrases to crowbar in to the copy.		The final section reads like a moment of self awareness, that marketing is nothing but pushing people to buy the same things over and over.

Power management isnt an issue because of AC outlets and power supplies.  The OS was built to run on minimal hardware, so resource management isnt a problem either.		There are no games yet because the console doesnt exist yet.

It isnt meant to replace AAA gaming consoles, it's supposed to target a different segment of the market: it's for people who want to make and play free/cheap games for purely the enjoyment of playing/developing.  All games on the Ouya will be optimized for its hardware, so that isnt a concern either.  Nobody is pretending that you can just load Crysis 2 onto it and start playing.		I'm not buying the Ouya for the magical exclusive crazy incredible games it wont be getting, I'm buying it because I like the idea of an open source console and I'm interested in learning some new skills.		I know I dont NEED it, I dont NEED a laptop computer or a smartphone or a fancy digital camera or a video game console or anything like that.

{"body":"There's a lot wrong with this. For example, you can expect this device (and any recent android device, yes) to put out about what you'd see from a PS2, Gamecube or Xbox. They all render graphics through OpenGL. There are several very nice looking games for android already, full 3D games, of course they look like games from 8 years ago but you can't expect much more than that for $100. But since most of the greatest games of all time were from the 16 and 32bit eras, that's not really an issue.		As for the 'android is not optimized for gaming and sucks at resource management', that's not entirely true and certainly, the OS of this device (As every android device generally has its own unique or semi-unique ROM) will be modified to enhance that, obviously. This isn't gonna be a stock android 2.2 rom, its going to be whatever the latest release is with optimized code for graphics and media on top of that (since power and mobile communications will be much less a priority). Oh yeah, and there are already other TV boxes/consoles, and smart TVs, doing similar things that work well. Samsung smart TVs are gorgeous.		And yes, a PC will do everything better. But that's true with consoles, too. If you're savvy enough, then fuck it - set up a sick gaming rig in your living room with all the nice wireless peripherals and go to town. I stopped buying real consoles a long time ago personally. The key here is that this is a hundred dollar console on an open source platform, meaning the production of games is no longer located in an ivory tower which requires big corporate money to enter.

{"body":"Remember the price tag folks. It's a low end console, it's not going to compete with all the other high-end consoles out there no. It's not marketed for that. It's marketed for people who want a cheap console to play all their latest mobile and social games on the big screen.		However, there are way more mobile games out there than just Angry Birds, there are plenty of high quality 2D and 3D Titles, there are even popular developers such as Mojang, EA, SEGA and Rockstar that all support the Android platform. Then there are smaller devs such as Kairosoft and Silvertree Media who make fantastic titles too who have only become "who there are" down to their support for mobile platforms such as Android.		As an amateur games developer myself, I think this product is fantastic news since it means I can reach a new market yet still only needing to develop one version for the same old Android platform. Keeps the cost down yet gives me the ability to be able to develop games for gamers who want to play my games on the big screen.		Also, Android isn't THAT "power" hungry. Assuming you mean resources-wise. In fact, it's done wonders for my netbook and x86 tablet compared to a fully-fledged desktop such as Windows or Ubuntu. Remember, "unused memory is wasted memory". It's being used to keep Android in the background, like it would for any desktop OS. This means that you can multitask and assess your home screen without having to fully reload it since it is sitting in very fast memory. 		Anyway, I think that their choice for Android is the best possible choice right now. It's a popular platform for both consumers and developers. There is already a games market right now on the Google Play Store so it shouldn't be much trouble in getting developers to use whatever market OUYA is using. (Assuming it's their own + their own TV/Gaming UX). This means that consumers don't have to wait around for developers to even CONSIDER porting their titles to a new platform.

{"body":"It's not that this has bad tech and stuff.	The sums don't add up.	Their original goal of $950,000 would not cover enough for the console.	Okay, so they have 13,000 backers at the time they reached this.	Costs would be about $50 - $60 to make this console. So that's $650,000 to $780,000 to produce 13,000 of these. Now. Cool. Not bad right? Well, that leaves them with less than $300,000 to market, pay staff, contract producers, contracts with third party sellers and such. 	Google will have to be paid royalties for each sale they make, not to mention they must first purchase the rights to use Android in their systems. 		None of this is cheap. The Business world is not cheap. This is massive market that will be so costly to get into. There business plan sucks. Take this to Alan Sugar and he'll just say "Where's the profit?" You can't do things without showing that it will be profitable. They've not got a plan for all this extra money that's come in. They'll most likely spend it on just manufacturing more. This is the big problem with Kickstarter, it's just not plausible anymore.		You can't say "This is for all the indie developers out there." Steam just announced Greenlight. That's a fantastic idea. And what better software to use than what the majority have? A PC that runs Windows. I'm very sure a lot of you have Emulators on your computers. I have an Android Emulator on mine myself. 			It's too late now, but wait a few months and you'll see the failure of OUYA.		TL:DR - Badly drawn up plans. Not knowing costings. Too big a market to jump into.

{"body":"The issue with your maths is you are looking at it as if all 13,067(when I did my math) backers are getting the console and are all paying the same price. When sold out, there will be 21950 devices sold. For that money, the minimum they would get is $2,944,700. The lowest amount of money they could get with 13,067 people all buying the console each is $1,289,633. With a cost of $784,020 to make 13067, that would leave them with $505,613. As of me writing this post, the actual number of backers that are getting the console makes the total cost $755,480 with a total amount raised of $1,649,796, leaving them $894,316. 		So to summarise, using your senario as a base(where all 13000 backers are getting a console), they would have just over $500k to market, pay staff and other overheads and thats it. Right now they are not highing people to make them content, and any contracts with third parties to create games costs them nothing as they simply take a cut of the profits.

{"body":">Tegra3 has a 1.5ghz quad-core which doesn't even touch the processing power of the PS3 or Xbox360 with 3.2ghz optimized for gaming		Someone doesn't know how multicore processing works. Unless these games are single threaded, a 1.5 quad is much more powerful than a 3.2ghz single core. I can test this because my old 3.2ghz single core couldn't even run Oblivion while my 1.2 (not even 1.5) quad core can run skyrim just fine. note: I used the same graphics card and ram between both processors.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Darkblitz9","name":"t1_c5ca73p","parent_id":"t3_wco0r","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1342002467,"created_utc":1341973667}
{"body":"The XBOX360 is a triple core system and the PS3 uses cell architecture which means it has one CPU core and eight SPUs.  In terms of CPU power both consoles still have the tegra beat.  It's only when you consider the fact that the tegra is an APU and the GPU portion is as good or better than what's in the XBOX or PS3 that it starts to be more comparable.  Though when you consider that a PS3 developer can still use the SPUs in the PS3 to assist in the rendering as well as overpower it in number crunching the PS3 can still beat the tegra3.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_c5cd4cp","parent_id":"t1_c5ca73p","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1342015126,"created_utc":1341986326}
