Realize for a moment corporations have entire teams dedicated to browsing various site, from Reddit to PC gamer to look at the general public opinion and relay back to the company, and so far... Nothing. They've tried no extra gimmicks, and they continue the same direction. It's pretty obvious most people approve of what they have been doing. If not, their stock would fall and investors would run. If you know anything about corporations, it's about making investors happy, and as long as the prime consumer is happy, the investors are happy.		I realize this was probably posted because of the Valve-EA talks. These things happen all the time between companies. Companies try to purchase smaller ones all the time as well. Why would Valve agree to a talk? Maybe they were hoping to get some support from EA without being bought. Maybe EA offered something that really made Valve want to at least go a little deeper.		But no. Because it's EA. The Scapegoat, everyone's favorite company to hate. Why? Because of bad service you can find anywhere? Because your favorite games are being re-imagined in an attempt to stay modern or fresh? But because EA published it, you can blame them. 		If you don't like EA. Don't buy their games.

That's a loaded statement, because most of the consumers aren't aware of what EA is doing.  They're simply consumers, and consumers who would love to hear this information, unless said information is being drowned out (by EA and people with your mindset).		You might get annoyed by this. You might even start calling gamers "entitled" ala IGN.  But the fact is that if done right, "whining" will get attention.

{"body":"Heh, the only response I get is a well thought out one =)		I will agree with you about spreading awareness. I do not mind when someone posts about how they were actually wronged and provides proof. I also agree with you about "Consumers being happy is a loaded statement", and thus retract that opinion. But this, "Anyone else sick of EA" or "Lulzor, EA is the Nazi's of Publishers" crap *is* annoying. They seem liked tired attempts at rallying people, because they do get some form of support. It often feels like it's actually more *popular* than it is a form of disapproval. Hatred becomes a common ground, because it is easy to hate, it is easy to look the other way despite whatever the subject of hatred is doing. And I don't like that.		Which is a huge reason I made that comment. I dislike it when people blindly hate, when people put up posts that are designed only to function on that hate. What I do like is when people post intelligent posts with proper evidence (Which now I feel silly about having that attitude in /r/gaming), people who discuss the problem, it's source, and how to fix it. 		A notable example is the recent post where someone needed technical support, and the operator connected long enough to type a random string and then leave. People offered that it was a problem from outsourcing tech support, other people offered it was a problem with how tech support centers are run these days. There, I was able to provide a clear example following that same point. People were angry, but they were generally being somewhat rational.		But Come On!! This post wasn't designed to challenge EA, to analyze a problem and Certainly not offer solutions! Heck, I looked through the comments and OP seemed to be saying he posted this to mock those who hate EA and somehow Steam for their Big Picture project. It's stupid and gets us nowhere.		Lastly, most of that comment was frustration and just challenging the message that OP was passing along. I am not a fanatic of EA, but I don't hate them. I try to be neutral and conservative unless I am royally pissed off at a comany for what they stand for, al a Zynga.","depth":2,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alorty","name":"t1_c66corz","parent_id":"t1_c66bswb","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1347348983,"created_utc":1347320183}

{"body":"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, "See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to." For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said "Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all." As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier.
