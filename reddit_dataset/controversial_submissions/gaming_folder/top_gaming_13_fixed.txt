{"body":"Skyrim was great, but at the end of the day it's still heavily derivative of Norse mythology. That kind of impacts the world due to it not being quite as original and the brutality of the setting make it slightly more difficult to insert a really accessible, original tone into the series.		Fallout doesn't have this problem. It's bleak, but it has great self-awareness. It's sad and it's hilarious. The characters are incredibly diverse and make the world feel populated in the face of an unimaginable tragedy. The story, while itself derivative of countless works of sci-fi, still finds a way to be original, completely its own story. The foresight of the writers to cast the Chinese as the nation that America went to nuclear war with was incredible genius (or just a lucky/educated guess that could resonate with a modern political climate).		Plus, the combination of 1960s art aesthetics with the futuristic setting just make the Fallout universe unlike any other gaming experience.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cbbxhle","parent_id":"t1_cbbx36o","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1375045388,"created_utc":1375016588}

If you see a place in those games you don't know what will be inside, but it is usually a fun building to explore and look at, rather than a linear tunnel filled with draugr like skyrim. Also the quests in the fallout games, and oblivion were a lot better. In skyrim 90% of the quests are basically go find something at the end of a linear cave full of draugr. Whereas In oblivion it could be something like figure out how to get to the bottom of a well, or escape from a boat you are held captive on, or in fallout you might have to get through a town full of mines, or maybe unravel a mystery behind cannibals at a casino.

{"body":"I'm not OP but this is why I like Fallout more than Skyrim. My biggest problem with Skyrim is how dull it can actually be, I even thought the fight against Alduin was pathetic along with other big battles looking like kitty fights. The only fights I saw that were fast-paced and fun were either taking over Windhelm as the Imperials or taking over Solitude as the Stormcloaks. Fallout's battle of Hoover Dam or Fallout 3's battle for Project Purity seem very war like Bullets flying, people dying, Explosions mostly everywhere you look or somebody charging at you with a Super Sledge. Also I never really have been into this Potions, Dragons, Enchantment stuff it makes me feel like I'm playing a remake of a kid's bed time story book. I also just feel like Skyrim can get more boring very easily. It's either a sword or Magic as your weapon. In fallout you get much more variety plus the Guns in Fallout add to the pleasure of the game. Plus I feel that the overall storyline to all the Fallout games is superior to the Elder Scroll games, The Elder Scrolls is always OH NO! There is trouble in this province help save it! I feel that Fallout's Great War which resulted to the stage of Humanity Fallout takes in is more Dramatic and also comes with some very interesting backstories. My last reason is I feel that Fallout has much better Factions than any Elder Scroll. To me things like the Dark Brotherhood or the Thieves Guild are repeated dull factions. The Dark Brotherhood=Murder, The Theives Guild Equals=steal. Fallout has many more interesting Factions For example The New California Republic (or NCR) Who's purposes are to try and preserve Democracy and the Rule of Law in California and the Mohave Wasteland (Nevada) or Ceasar's Legion who's purposes are to conquer and grow stronger crushing anybody who opposes them, Also the Brotherhood of Steel who's purposes are to preserve the Technology of the past so that the World can avoid more destruction or even another Armaggedon. There are also the minor Factions like The Followers of the Apocalypse who's purposes are to treat the wounded, and bring knowledge and Intelligence back to the land. Also the Powder Gangers who's purposes are to use dynamite to destroy inocent caravans or people. Doesn't it all sound so much more interesting than the factions of the Elder Scrolls. So now I ask you the same question, why do you like Skyrim more than Fallout? (not looking for an argument here please just conversation)","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"godlyapple12345","name":"t1_cbc0piw","parent_id":"t1_cbbrj68","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1375059280,"created_utc":1375030480}
{"body":"They way you felt about Skryim is almost how I felt about Fallout. It felt dull. Now I understand it the landscape was the victim of a nuclear blast and what not but it just didn't immerse me like the landscape in Skyrim.		Now keep in mind I have yet to play Fallout: New Vegas which is what I'll be picking up in a few days so before I get any further I just wanted to inform you on that. I heard wonders about it so I must play it!		Skyrim's lore literally dates back the very first game "Arena" and pretty much all the others ones. The lore is rich. From the first Uriel Septim to the Daedric Princes meddling in peoples affairs for their benefit. It's all somehow linked together if you really take the time to dig through the lore from the books. Again, not for everyone.		You said it yourself that "Also I never really have been into this Potions, Dragons, Enchantment". I have lol. From Lord of the Rings to The Legend of Drizzt series, I've loved fantasy games/books. Killing a dragon the way you can in Skyrim was my inner childs dream come true. Over time it kind of could get tedious but I suppose that just comes from the eventual lack of interest in the game, and maybe it's time for a few month break. *shrug*		The shooting in Fallout 3 always felt wonky unless you used the V.A.T.S. Which was fun for only so long. I wanted to immerse myself in a tense gunfight but couldn't seeing how I had to slow down time to make a perfect shot. This gripe is also for Skryim......pausing game and stuffing 48 potatoes in my mouth to gain some health. Stupid.		I guess it just comes down to me liking fantasy more and you in Sci-Fi more. Both games are amazing and I'll continue to play them. And I hope this was the reply you were looking for. If I left anything out feel free to ask. :]			Edit: Oh thought I'd add that the factions were hit and miss. Thieves guild. Amazing. The Fighters guild (Companions..) Meh. The College of Winterhold. Not bad. Dark Brotherhood. Amazing. The stories in those factions kind of shows what they put effort into the most.

{"body":"I guess the unpopular opinion is that Skyrim is better than Fallout now. I'll make that case. Keep in mind I'm a post-apocalyptic nut, was blown away by Fallout 3, and generally don't like fantasy settings.		I think it's pretty clear the mechanics in Skyrim are better- the leveling system is robust and innovative, melee is horrible in Fallout, serviceable in Skyrim, more depth, more branches.		So it comes down to world-building. Fallout 3 has such an incredible premise- and for the most part, follows through on it- that it seems a lock to win this, especially since I find fantasy worlds derivative. Not the case! Skyrim overcame the handicap and is easily more immersive- more fleshed out cities, heavily atmospheric world, quests about on par with each other (no humor in Skyrim, no sense of presentation in Fallout,) larger, denser map, has an interesting take on the fantasy genre.	I'll always love Fallout more than Oblivion, but it simply couldn't hold up against the almost generational advances of Skyrim.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rickjuice","name":"t1_cbbwqfz","parent_id":"t3_1j7466","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1375039688,"created_utc":1375010888}
