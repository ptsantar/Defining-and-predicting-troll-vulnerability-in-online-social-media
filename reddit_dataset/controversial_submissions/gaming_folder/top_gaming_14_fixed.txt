{"body":"The thief is probably legally responsible. Something does not violate IP laws until you attempt to distribute it or profit from it. You are perfectly legally allowed to make something using someone else's IP so long as it is soley for yourself and without profit. For example, you can draw your favorite characters on a canvas and hang it in your house. You don't have to pay royalty to Nintendo to draw Zelda fan art. You do have to pay to mass produce such posters and sell them on your website, or sell even the one, though I doubt you'd be prosecuted for such a small offense.		If someone distributes your creation/someone else's IP, they are breaking the IP law, not you.		>If you're not, and you did it deliberately, it could be a huge way to freely distribute something, while saying fuck you to copyright, and without any chance of repecussion.		Depends on what it is. If your name is all over it, they will probably consider that evidence enough that you're the one who distributed it.

I.E: Average Joe Filmmaker thinks of a great, say, Sherlock Holmes movie, and gets going with production, his actors, though unknown, happen to be very good and the production value is huge even though the budget is low. He can attribute this is his gift to his brother which is a fan of the franchise and claim it stolen.
