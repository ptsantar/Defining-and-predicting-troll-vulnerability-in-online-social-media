In this instance, it's really harmless, but if they had taken a moment to think, "Hm, that doesn't look quite right," and simply clicked the comments, they'd have left the thread knowing that what they had just seen was inaccurate, and likely intended to deliberately confuse them.		When it happens with graphics in a video game, it's no big deal, but that mentality translates easily into other topics of discussion as well, and the only way to hone it is to apply the bullshit filters to most of what you read.		Anyway, I'm probably taking this too seriously. It just bugs me, because I know at some point in the future, I'm going to have to correct other people who use this as an example and try to make a point. That, in and of itself, is not a problem. The problem is that when people can't tell the difference between bullshit and reality on the internet, everything starts to be labeled as bullshit, even when it's accurate (or vice versa).

{"body":"I'm about an hour and a half into the campaign and so far I really like it. Now to be fair, I went in with low expectations and I mainly got it because I want a smooth control game to get better at FPS games on PC, but the graphics are a much better jump than MW2 to MW3, a lot textures are super high res, there is a lot more detail to destruction, there are some cool, but somewhat gimmicky tools such as a remote sniper turret that you use to protect your squad, combat feels more real (I think this is mainly due to animations being less over-the-top and enemies don't flail around when they get shot), the dual-render sniping is really cool, and the story is original enough so that it doesn't just seem like the past games where its 'MERICA YEAH GO USA vs RUSSIA BAD GUYS NUKES. 		On the downside, the game is much more taxing than I expected. I have a 6770 and when I had everything maxed out I only got around 15 FPS. I guess this is more of a plus since it means graphics are improving. I lowered the settings so that I get 70+ frames, but there will be times where it drops below 30 like when moving into an area with a lot of enemies.		Overall, progress has been made as far as the campaign is concerned and I'm excited to see how multiplayer is. If you are expecting something new, you are going to have a bad time. If you are expecting a cinematic explosion fest, tight controls, and the classic Call of Duty formula with graphics updated for next gen, then this is the game for you.

That means that with a 1280x768 screen resolution, you're only looking at 320 pixels horizontally, which means it takes 4 pixels on your screen to represent each pixel in the texture.

{"body":"Shader model is highly tied with Direct 3D feature level. And D3D feature level is highly tied to graphics hardware. Higher feature levels unlock more possibilities, including but not limited to specific shader semantics, tesselation, etc.		When you create a D3D device, you can choose which feature level you're going to go with. You can use Direct3D 9, if you want to support Windows XP, or you can use Direct3D 11, with feature level 9_1, if you want to support graphics cards that don't have 10_0+ feature level support but you don't care about Windows XP. All graphics cards since GeForce 8 series support feature level 10_0 and cards since GeForce 400 series support feature level 11_0.		Some new games have an option to select DirectX version. What they really aren't telling you, is most likely you aren't choosing Direct3D version, but rather its feature level. On games that don't explicitly say that, most likely higher feature levels are reserved for higher settings. Hence running highest settings means you're running highest feature level the game supports.		So, what happens if you try to use feature level that your graphics card doesn't support? Well, it's pretty simple: creating D3D device will just fail - the game won't be able to display anything on the screen. Windows will never silently just ignore what code is telling the graphics card to do if it doesn't support it. It will just return an error code. That's why running the game on the highest settings will look the same no matter what the card that the game is running on supports. If it can draw even a single pixel - it will be able to draw it all.

{"body":"The game is developed on a multiplatform engine, which precludes it from being a port. The definition of a port would be a game whose code was written for one or more platforms, and then that code was rewritten to work on different platforms than were originally supported.		When a game is developed to release with support for 5 platforms, there are decisions that have to be made about the production process. Do they want to make 5 versions of each texture? 5 versions of each model? Different draw distances, different LOD distances? How much content can they fit into the game media and still have it work properly on every platform? Given finite manpower to develop the game, how much time can be spent optimizing each platform's versions? What generally happens in these situations is that decisions are made that are the most efficient. "We can use just two texture sets, one set for Xbox 360 and PS3, the other set for everything else.", "We will use higher poly models in some cases on certain platforms.". 		Decisions about multiple asset sets is easy, but do have a cost, and this cost is why you won't always see high-res versions of every single texture on the more powerful platform. Game design decisions are more difficult though. If the design team wants massive levels to play in, those massive levels have to run on the slowest hardware that the company wants the game to support. Things like that can hamstring designers into making decisions that are not ideal, giving the player smaller maps, or multiplayer with fewer players, or fewer AI units loaded at any one time. This is the biggest reason why next-gen consoles will be great for the entire industry. Companies will soon stop supporting the Xbox 360 and PS3, and be able to design entire games around more powerful hardware, this will be a huge boost to the quality of PC games.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LeCrushinator","name":"t1_cd7c6g2","parent_id":"t1_cd7a6of","subreddit":"gaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","created":1383698773,"created_utc":1383669973}

Most people would say the one with the higher minimum requirements.  And that is why they artificially inflated the numbers.
