{"body":"I went from a Iphone 4s to a galaxy note 3. I hate this steaming pile of dog shit. Android phones are designed with a fraction of the thought that iPhones are and it shows in the user experience, which is fucking terrible by comparison.  The phone forgets presets, randomly re-arranges icons, the GPS is crap, the touch recognition is worse its buttons are poorly thought out and the software in general is complete shit. It came loaded with bloatware. I could spend hours unfucking all of this I'm sure by rooting it and installing custom launchers but no... I don't have the time and there is no reason to have to jerry rig my own experience so that I can have a theme that looks like fallout 4 when in reality i just want a functional phone. the iphone simply works and works beautifully. I can't wait to go back.","depth":1,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sprakisnolo","name":"t1_cs20m47","parent_id":"t1_cs0e2mj","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1433962937,"created_utc":1433959337}
