Technically hovering, technically controllable, but still not what I'd consider a hoverboard.  		This magnetic one is close, but needing a special surface is what holds it back, along with not being controllable.  That's not a hoverboard.  It's just some magical magnetic raft thing.

{"body":"I think you mean flux pinning and liquid nitrogen, not quantum locking and dry ice.		Specifically, you're referring to type-II (ceramic) superconductors, which can operate at the blistering hot temperature of -195 Celsius.		High temp superconductors have a number of limitations. First, they need to be cold, or they fail. Second, to translate across a surface, the surface has to be magnetically uniform (like a road surface). Any boundary condition will cause friction, which will generate heat, which will cause the superconduction to fail. Third, high temp superconductors fail in the presence of very strong magnetic fields, limiting the load that they can support.  Finally, HTSC flux pinning requires an external magnetic field, because the flux pinning occurs inside the HTSC. That means you either need permanent magnets for rails, or you need electromagnets for rails.
