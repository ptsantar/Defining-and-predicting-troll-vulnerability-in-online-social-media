{"body":"That review made my brain hurt. Couldn't connect from the device straight to the modem, wait, what? Had to connect to pc and then WiFi, huh?		I think saying that the review was written by a teenager whom was technologically illiterate is being generous. Saying it was written by a illiterate technophobe is likely much closer to the mark.		 It was less a review than a brain dump of ill thought out "clever puns" in an attempt to make their rants about something they don't understand seem a bit "cleverer".","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"smoike","name":"t1_cjdsxvy","parent_id":"t1_cjcx6yj","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406883523,"created_utc":1406879923}

{"body":"Why wouldn't you let the WD player index your media and then test it out? It sounds like it would have had your entire collection indexed in maybe a day or so.

{"body":"Terrible website, terrible review.		I actually own one of these, and yeah, it was slow copying 1TB of data to it, but then I started the job on wifi , then realised I had a spare port to connect it over the LAN and things got better.		It indexed everything (mainly movies and TV shows) very quickly, and the smart TV picked it up straight away and I could watch anything and everything on it without issues.		I also connect to it from work, and recently away on holiday to watch content on my iPad. Flawless, included subtitles.		A recent update improved some stability issues when copying files, and improved the speed that it indexes and creates thumbnails.		I think the reviewer had expectations that were slightly out of whack, or didn't really understand the product.		Also, you can TOTALLY ditch the software and mount it as a network drive/resource.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chrisgunton","name":"t1_cjcxh3w","parent_id":"t3_2c88pg","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406813473,"created_utc":1406809873}

{"body":"I am sorry to say that, but the reviewer is a poor ignorant user.		Long story short: The wd mycloud is a really cheap affordable nas with some nice specs to meet up your sharing needs.		You don't need to be an hacker from the nineties movies, you just need to know how BASIC networking works.		This guy is an ape trying to drive a city car. 	It's not that hard to drive a city car, but you will not be able to do that if you are an actual ape.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"3rt41","name":"t1_cjd274n","parent_id":"t3_2c88pg","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406824503,"created_utc":1406820903}

{"body":"All the complaints are around indexing/compression - which is a processor hog, but is a finite process that will eventually end. Any software worth it's salt does this. This guy just added TBs of data, so he should probably give it a few days to create its thumbnails and encode the media.  The vendor should also probably patch the software so it uses less processor to do the indexing/compression. Obviously, the unit shouldn't hang, but it should eventually become responsive again once it completes the initial run.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"medfordjared","name":"t1_cjcz6cn","parent_id":"t3_2c88pg","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1406818253,"created_utc":1406814653}
