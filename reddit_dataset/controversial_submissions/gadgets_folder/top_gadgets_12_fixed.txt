{"body":"I read the article and my '2 cents' is as follows.... I have an android because I like to constantly adjust stuff on the phone. + getting apk's of apps side loaded helps keep costs down. My misses on the hand has an iPhone due to it 'just working' In that I mean it's not difficult to do what she wants. No in depth menus and settings. It's just click an app and it starts up. Simples. You can agree or disagree   with me... Ive ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.","depth":0,"score":18,"ups":18,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"100bigmacs","name":"t1_ct3g09q","parent_id":"t3_3dapmc","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1436914554,"created_utc":1436910954}
{"body":"Yep. I've been on all major platforms now (iOS, Android and WindowsPhone). All have their pros and cons and I wouldn't as a whole recommend one over the other.

{"body":">and its an incredibly responsive animation		Main reason I prefer iPhones, the UI and animations just feel so responsive, the framerate of everything is fluid and nothing feels laggy.
