{"body":"How does it do in very low light settings? Went to karaoke recently, and I have a Samsung 5s. Picture quality was total shit for low light. My other friends with their phones (LG, Nexus, Nokia, etc) also shit quality. My friends iPhone 6 was taking great pics. Some shots were almost in darkness.		Low light pictures are one reason why I am most likely going to get a iPhone 6.
