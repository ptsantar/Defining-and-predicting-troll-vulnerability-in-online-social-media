{"body":"He clearly states that it requires a lot more force to produce a much smaller bend ( than the iPhone 6 ).		Another Notable difference is that he was easily able to bend it right back. On the iPhone 6 when he tried to bend it back it resulted in a cracked screen.		The real issue here is that iPhone 6's are bending in people's pockets. I somehow doubt that will be the case for the Note 4.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Whipit","name":"t1_cl5c3xd","parent_id":"t3_2ion1w","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1412911639,"created_utc":1412908039}
{"body":"Disclaimer. I own an (unbend) iPhone 6, sorry if i am biased. Trying not to be (: 		It just blows up cause it's an Apple phone. I agree that it shouldn't happen, but the problem is quite limited and i think most of the cases are from people having them in their back pocket. People talk about the iPhone 6 like it's made of butter and bends if you walk 5 feet with it in your pocket. Apple made a statement early on the bending: "Through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus," In the same time more then 10 million phones were sold. So it's a very limited problem it seems. But of cause we can't tell for the future and i agree Apple may have went too thin even though it feels really good in the hand.

{"body":"This is one reason why I DID NOT want a metal phone.   I will keep my Note 3 unless I get a Note 4 just cause.  The hardware is good, the chassis is lacking some structure the Note 3 has.
