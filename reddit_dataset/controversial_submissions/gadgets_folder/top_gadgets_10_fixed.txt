You may be right there, I was under the impression earlier pods were smaller.		> Not sure how this matters. Models numbers from shucked rives are identical to internal drives. Are "shucked" drives some how inferior or superior to internal ones?		Many people believe drive manufacturers purposely sabotage shucked drives through the drive's firmware to stop the practice. They can tell when they're being used in an enclosure or been ripped out. On top of that taking out the drive isn't always easy (they glue connectors sometimes), and there's a decent chance of damaging the drive while doing so.		> I've never met a single person who upgrades their firmware on drives. Yes, it's best practice. I still don't know many people who do it. I'll take the correlation.		True, I don't update mine either. But you definitely can't rule out that more recently purchased drives with a newer firmware may perform better/last longer than older drives, and there have been non-minor drive issues corrected by firmware updates in the last few years. Not only that, but there have been case of bad batches from certain factories so it's possible even though the drives appear identical in revision and model number one batch will die a lot sooner than another.		> I don't think I've ever seen anyone discuss this or attempt to draw some information upon it. It's kind of a moot point. Sure some disk might last longer, but if you are running 10 disk, you will only keep them until your storage is full. Then you'll replace. So while there's a chance Drive X might last longer than Drive Y in a <12 disk chassis, no one builds a ZZ byte enclosure and plans on never replacing it (nor do they go back to find a 4 year old drive to add on if they want to do raid expansion.)		A lot of drive manufacturer's are now making a point of emphasising how many drives in an enclosure their drives are suited for. Some drives cannot handle the vibrations of large/poorly dampened enclosures, and a 45 drive bay is on the extreme end. Not everyone is running 10/15/20/.. drive servers, I'd bet the vast majority have less than 5 drives in a server. So taking drives meant for these consumer, putting them in an unusual and unusual set up and making comparisons seems misguided to me.		But like you said, scientific numbers are going to be practically impossible to get and I think there's way too many variables here to take account to draw a confident conclusion imo.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Moussekateer","name":"t1_crmyrkw","parent_id":"t1_crmxf94","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1432767128,"created_utc":1432763528}

That's about 16.5 cents per GB. That would put a 256GB drive at $42.24. That would be awesome. But nobody is going to stock a 32GB SSD for $5.28, because nobody would buy it.		So yeah, their idea of meeting the cost per GB of traditional HDD might be mathematically accurate, for a very, very, very, small subset of traditional drive sizes.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"notwhoithink","name":"t1_crmqay0","parent_id":"t1_crml0qv","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1432753950,"created_utc":1432750350}

{"body":"The press release says they're comparing it to a 5400 RPM 2.5" drive at the same capacities.		2.5" HDDs are more expensive than 3.5" drives, and since pretty much nobody wants them at those capacities, they're surprisingly not much cheaper than higher capacity drives. I'm not sure why, maybe there's a floor on manufacturing costs, or it's just supply and demand. They also vary widely in price. [HDDs that match those specs range from $35 to $140.](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&IsNodeId=1&N=100007605%20600484468%20600030591%20600003490) But 1TB 2.5" drives of the same form factor [can be as low as $60](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007605%20600030600&IsNodeId=1&bop=And&Order=PRICE&PageSize=30), so comparing to 250GB HDDs is very misleading since they're unusually expensive, and nobody wants them anyways.		But their claim can be true. The cheapest 256GB SSDs I've seen are $90, and there are 250GB HDDs that are $90 as well, so it is technically true right now. We don't know if they're comparing to the cheapest 256GB HDDs, or the most expensive. If they're comparing to the cheapest, which are $35, that's actually a huge price drop, but otherwise, it means nothing because SSDs at that price point already exist.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Fidodo","name":"t1_crmtmzb","parent_id":"t1_crmk9ry","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1432759107,"created_utc":1432755507}

{"body":"tl;dr: Read the bold bits.		> And what does fsync accomplish for a database?		Writes almost always go into what's called write-back cache.  This means they actually only happen in memory - they're then written out to disk periodically.  This is *great* for performance - RAM's really fast, and batching up groups of writes lets you combine and reorder them so they can be written to disk more efficiently.		The catch is that writes don't get written at any particular time or in any particular order.  Write 3 may well complete before write 1 and 2.  If something interrupts you in the middle, you can end up with situations where write 3 completed, but write 1 and 2 didn't.  That's pretty bad if, say, write 3 was updating a database index, while write 1 and 2 actually contained the data it references.		fsync gives you the ability to say "make sure everything I just wrote is actually on disk".  So, you can do write 1 and 2, fsync, then you know they're safe and can do write 3.		> What's the purpose of a write ahead log?		It helps provide two of the big four "[ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)" properties:		* **Atomicity**: Writes happen in single all-or-nothing units called transactions. If part of a write fails, the entire transaction fails and the database remains unchanged.	* **Durability**: If a transaction is committed, it remains that way even if you yank the power immediately afterwards.		Consider the case where you're updating a record.  You reach into the table and write out the updated record on top of the old one, when someone yanks the power - the table ends up with a record that's half the new one, half the old one, and is inconsistent.		There's no way to reverse the change because you've overwritten the original data, but there's also no way to complete it because it was only stored on RAM and that was lost.  At this point any honest database will hold up its hands and tell you to restore from a backup.		Write-ahead logs are one way to resolve this.  Instead of overwriting the data immediately, you append what you're about to do to a log file.  You `fsync` that to guarantee it's actually saved to disk, and can then mark the transaction as "committed" - it's safely on disk.  Updating the actual data can happen at leisure.		In the event of a power failure or a crash, the database can read the write-ahead log and complete any committed-but-not-written-back transactions.  Any partial transactions will show as incomplete records in the write-ahead log, if at all, and can be ignored - preserving the original database state.		This is also good for **performance**.  Writing sequentially to a log file is fast, especially for platters.  Also thanks to no longer being in a hurry to write back updated data to the database, you can batch them up, bringing us back to the first point - write-back caches are awesome.		They can also be used as the basis for **high-availability** and **scaling** - by streaming a copy of the write-ahead log to another machine, you can maintain a copy of the database there.  It can then serve read queries, serve as a failover machine in the event of a failure, or it can maintain a backup of the database.  e.g. instead of actually applying updates to the database, it can just store a fixed snapshot - you can then restore the database to any point in time since then just by selectively applying the logfile to it.		Filesystems themselves can be considered specialised databases, and typically use similar techniques, usually referred to as [journaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system).","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Freeky","name":"t1_crmygei","parent_id":"t1_crmmqdd","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1432766614,"created_utc":1432763014}

{"body":"> Can you explain why appending to a log file is faster than simply storing the data		It's a matter of converting random writes to sequential ones, and batching things up into fewer operations.  Consider a transaction where you're updating a bunch of records, if you're using a write-ahead log you can just do:		    WRITE "$record2, $record4, $record52, $record6453", at: $end_of_logfile		And then consider the transaction safely committed, since it's in the log.  Compare this with updating the same records directly:		    WRITE "$record2", at: $position_of_record2	    WRITE "$record4", at: $position_of_record4	    WRITE "$record52", at: $position_of_record52	    WRITE "$record6453", at: $position_of_record6453		Of course you'll still want to do these eventually, but thanks to being able to put them off, you can merge them with later transactions.  Consider two more transactions hitting the log:		    WRITE "$record1, $record2, $record54, $record55", at: $end_of_logfile	    WRITE "$record3, $record53", at: $end_of_logfile		Now, when you want to clear the log and physically update the table with all three transactions, you can just do:		    WRITE "$record1, $record2, $record3, $record4", at: $position_of_record1	    WRITE "$record53, $record54, $record55", at: $position_of_record53	    WRITE "$record6453", at: $position_of_record6453		For a total of 6 write operations - 3 sequential log writes, 3 random table writes.  Without the log and the batching you'd have done 8 random table writes, and have no means to undo or complete them if you were interrupted.		> What happens when power is cut during the process or writing the log?		Depends - it's kind of "undefined behaviour" - anything in the process of being written prior to an `fsync` could be truncated, corrupted, or not written at all.  Log entries need to be structured in a way that makes this detectable - e.g. by a checksum.		> I don't see why the same process couldn't be used without the log.		Because if you're in the middle of a WRITE over the top of an existing record, if you get interrupted, you risk losing the data that was there originally.  Without a log entry telling you what should have been written, you can't retry the write later and you're just left with the corrupt record.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Freeky","name":"t1_crn1ncp","parent_id":"t1_crmzqq8","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1432772197,"created_utc":1432768597}

{"body":"Alright, so I'm just gonna explain everything related because I don't know what you do and don't know about computers.		Computers historically stored their information on a hard disk - otherwise known as an HDD. Regular HDDs read all of their data off a magnetic disk, and the faster it spins the faster they can read (which is why you hear of 5400RPM, 7200RPM, etc. Hard Drives). However, since the reading and writing is limited by this speed, another option had to be implemented.		SSDs use what's called flash memory - if you've used a flash drive, SD card, phone storage, etc. you've used flash memory. It's got no moving parts, so improved design is the only limiter on how fast your data can be read and written. They implement it on a much larger scale, though, and use capacities more similar to what an HDD can hold.		By being able to read data so much faster, SSDs can improve the function of many things. Installing Windows, or whatever other operating system you use, onto it means that the computer can boot up in about ten seconds, programs that are installed on it can open up faster, and load times for pretty much anything on it are extremely low. They won't make a bad computer good, but they can make an alright computer good, and they can make a good computer great. The only downside is price, because they cost roughly 6-7x as much as HDDs do.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goodnames679","name":"t1_crmtqhq","parent_id":"t1_crmnep0","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1432759255,"created_utc":1432755655}
{"body":"Basically a hard drive with no moving parts. It's storage is similar to flash memory (like a SD card or USB flash drive), except much faster. 		Traditional hard drives (HDD) store memory on discs. The discs spin extremely fast while a hypersensitive needle hovers a few microns above the disc reading the information on the disc. Magnetism is used to read and write from and to the disc. 		Because information is stored on the disc and must be read by the needle, it takes time for the needle to move to the appropriate spot and for the disc to spin and read the data. With flash storage, any piece of data can be pull from any physical location in the drive near instantaneously. 		This speed is a huge advantage. When you see a HDD that says 7200 on it, that means that the disc can spin at up to 7200 rotations per minute. Generally, higher rpm means faster read/write speeds, but it suffers from steep diminishing returns. 		Because a HDD spins several discs at very high speeds, HDDs are more prone to failure. They vibrate. They're noisy. They get warm. And they use a lot of power to spin those discs. 		SSDs have no moving parts, make no noise, use very little power, but they still can get warm under heavy workloads.

A downside is they can't read/write data as many times as a Hard Drive until things start going wrong - though for most uses the number of times they can access data before things start breaking is more than enough for any consumer.
