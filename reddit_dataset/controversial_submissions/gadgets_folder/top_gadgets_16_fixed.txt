{"body":"I strongly suggest talking with the speech/language, occupational therapy or assistive technology people at your daughter's school about this. Depending on the nature of her disability, you could make a case for the school providing a device for her use at home. I don't know about Ireland, but in the states this is not an unusual accommodation if there is an educational or developmental need. 		And if not, these people would at least be able to steer you in the direction of a tablet and apps that would best suit her needs within your price range.","depth":0,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"psuedonymously","name":"t1_cjfsj3i","parent_id":"t3_2cidj2","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1407089585,"created_utc":1407085985}

So while I'd recommend Android to a technologically clued family (my friend's daughter has a Nexus 7 and it's made her a whiz that can do anything (as Android encourages)), for the most part iOS is easier for kids and their parents.

{"body":"Hi there, I'm an Assistive Technology Consultant so have some experience with this. There are a huge amount of variables to consider here...		Firstly, access. What's your daughter's disability? Does she have any physical impairments, or learning difficulties? Can she isolate a finger, hold a tablet, understand how to navigate a menu system? Is she in a wheelchair (therefore it can be mounted) and is she prone to dropping it / damaging it in any way?		Secondly; what do you want to achieve? Independent control of leisure activities or as a communication aid? Or any other purpose like environmental control? Or just the use of a tablet for generic IT functions?		If she has communication difficulties (as you've mentioned the other pupils use there's for Speech and Language) then the *first thing* to consider even before access methods (touch, switch scanning, eyegaze etc.) is the language package - which a Speech and Language Therapist / Pathologist will guide you with. 		Purchasing a cheap tablet and sticking on a cheap app to support communication might be a false economy if it's not suitable for your daughter and if the therapists, teachers and support staff are not familiar with it. 		I know of no reputable Android apps for communication (as Android is likely your cheaper option) - where as the iPad now has a fair few (Proloquo2Go, GridPlayer) which are commonly used.
