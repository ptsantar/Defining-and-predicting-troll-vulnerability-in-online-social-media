{"body":"It will depend a lot on the outlet itself. A lot of them are really loose (especially older ones), and yeah, I wouldn't trust them either. But, some certainly are quite snug. I still wouldn't triple them out, but one would be fine. Even then, I'd only use it for a phone.		What they should do is include some strips of those double-sided sticky things that electronic retail stores use to secure display items. (The rubbery type, not the foam type!!!) I'd even be willing to double it and use a tablet on the inner one and phone on the outer one. That stuff is really strong.		Of course the downside is that the alternative plugs cannot be easily accessed from the back. That's a strange thing to do anyway... What they should do is have them come out of the side. They could even have them use push-to-toggle latched-inside to loose-poking-out mechanism (like is often used for SD cards).","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"incompleteness_theor","name":"t1_cl62h2o","parent_id":"t1_cl60cam","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1412981808,"created_utc":1412978208}

{"body":"I've always known that about Reddit, but felt it clouded the actuality in this case. I'm always the first to admit that I was wrong, but then again everything I do is a test and the lesson here was most certainly learned.		I found the product, loved it, and connected with them to see how I could help (the same thing I do for any product that enchants me). Hell, I just wrote a [4850 word post about my pants](http://mysocialsherpa.com/a-customer-for-life-how-one-company-earned-the-keys-to-my-bank-account/) and had no direct contact with the company prior to posting it (they've since found the piece and are pinging me for marketing advice - which I'm more than happy to give as I love the brand).		It's always a gray area and people (especially on Reddit) assume the worst, but the reality is that full disclosure is best. My problem has always been that people never believe my full disclosure as they can't conceptualize someone might love something so much that they call and offer to help. Regardless, while it could have been done better ... it was done with the best of intentions and no malicious intent. Not only am I still excited to use mine, but I'm also passing all the feedback shared here to their team. Many of the concerns were things they had already acted on, but there was certainly some new ones raised.		So yea, lesson learned - but no malicious intent nor was there any intent to "sell it to everyone regardless of if they needed it just to make money". Any look at my sites and you'll see that's not how I operate.
