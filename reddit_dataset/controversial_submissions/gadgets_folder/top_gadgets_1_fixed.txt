At the moment I set timers on it so I remember to grab my washing before some dumbass throws it on the floor. I also use it to control the music on my phone, get notifications and an alarm clock.		It's also virtually indestructible. I've crashed it into walls, poles and other hard surfaces accidentally and the watch face hasn't got a scratch. I've gone swimming in the sea in fairly turbulent conditions (understatement) wearing the watch and it held up brilliantly. I've been known to go days without taking it off, simply because I can have a shower without worrying about it dying on me.		One drawback though: Get ready to be constantly connected to the outside world. Every single email, text message, facebook notification and phone call will cause the watch to vibrate (though you can turn it off somewhere I think).

{"body":"My reasoning of why the apple watch might fail is well, because it's nothing but an apple accessory. You have to have an iPhone to use it, and the cost doesn't justify the things it's capable of. With an iPhone, you go ahead and buy one, and now, you're an apple user. You can't do that with the Apple Watch. You need to already be a part of the apple family which means it has a significant lower target audience.   		Now, the cost and the overall design. It starts at around six hundred bucks which is overpriced, even for Apple. You're basically saying that an iPhone and the Apple Watch are evenly priced when the Apple Watch does literally nothing compared the a full fledged iPhone. This is the failing point of the Watch. The price. The thing is, its not something that's never been done before. Take the twelve inch Macbook. Now, I'm not telling you it's a good product, I'm telling you it's something new, and its pretty fucking awesome. So I can see why Apple priced it that high, regardless of whether they should have or not. But the Watch? There are plenty of other smart watches out there, unlike that razor thin Macbook. So other than looking gorgeous, Apple doesn't offer much on the table.  		The same problem flows over to the UI. It's cool and looks really good, but doesn't make a whole lot of practical sense. Another problem is the battery life. A smart watch is supposed to replace your regular watch, but when you have a day's worth of battery, you kinda go, "meh."
