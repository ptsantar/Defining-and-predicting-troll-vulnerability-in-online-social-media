{"body":"Support that opinion please, rather than just spouting it.  Linking to marketing material that doesn't even mention the product you are comparing it to is not an argument, just sound and fury signifying nothing.		It also seems functionally identically to the Samsung Gear Fit, with the notable exception of being compatible with Android, iOS and whatever they're calling Windows Mobile these days.  However, given MS's terrible track record with keeping their software up to date on other platforms (no Office for Mac for a long time, no IE for Mac since v5, lack of feature parity in Skype for Linux) I'd be rather leery of using it outside of the MS ecosystem...","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"samandiriel","name":"t1_cmyt260","parent_id":"t3_2pnex6","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1418929059,"created_utc":1418929059}
{"body":"Cortana integration is windows phone only, and I have no intention of ever buying one of those.   It also lacks features I'd want on a fitness tracker (such as heartbeat), it doesn't have apps you can install on the watch and the wristband isn't replaceable / small enough to fit me.  	  	It's a decent product, but the iWatch is vastly more capable (as it should be because it's twice as expensive).","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"lordmycal","name":"t1_cmyt9lo","parent_id":"t3_2pnex6","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1418929422,"created_utc":1418929422}

Used to pull the phone out of my pocket dozens of times per day to check calendar, weather, email, texts, etc. Now they are on my wrist, at least seeing what's new.
