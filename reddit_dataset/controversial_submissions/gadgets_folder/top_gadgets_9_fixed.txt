It sounds like you are young enough that your baseline for computers is during the x86 dominance era. Many other processor architectures exist, and the variations between them is quite extreme at times.		Those variations dictate at a very low level how software is to be coded and run on the processor.  If you've heard the term Assembly Language, this is that low level.  Assembly code is what runs on the processor do do all the basics. Everything is then built on top of that.  You have compilers that translate C++, or Pascal into assembly.  This allows a coder to know less about the exact processor architecture, and the compiler handles that for them.  This is the code level that the iPhone works at.  Objective-C compiled down to assembly for the ARM processor in the iPhone.  Actually a handful of ARM architectures even, as ARM doesn't maintain the same level of backwards/forwards compatibility x86 tends to.  Android apps can also be written in C++ and be at this level, but it's not as common.		A key strength for Apple right now is they jumped first to 64 bit ARM.  A new architecture compared to 32 bit, and it gave them an opportunity to optimize even more of their compiler.		A level above C++ like languages is Java.  It's goal is to try and abstract away from the processor even more.  "Write once run everywhere" was the mantra for Java.  To do so though usually means less optimized code.  It's a mix between lowest common denominator situation and the need for a translation layer somewhere. There have been some amazing advances at making this translation layer be less impactful to the speed, and not have as much overhead, but it's not at full C++ levels yet. Android started with Java, and is still mostly at this level.  The goal was to not tie Android to one processor family, and it's a worthwhile goal.  Not slamming it in any way here. 		If you want to study some interesting history in this area, go look up the differences between Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS, x86 and Sparc.  They were all different processor architectures battling for dominance in the early to mid 90s.  Versions of Windows NT exists for all of them, as Microsoft felt the workstation and server markets may not be all 100% x86.  Even Intel believed x86 was going to eventually die, thus they made their own new entry into the space called Itanium.  Had it not been for AMD making the Athlon 64 and keeping x86 alive even longer, your Windows PC today would have likely been an Itanium machine.

The iPhone was just an improvement over something that already existed. Yes, they improved by A LOT, but it wasn't as if they started from scratch. Apple continues with this 'magical' marketing, which works very well, but continues to annoy those a little more informed about what's really in those devices.		I'm not petty, and at worst it irks me. Sometimes makes me chuckle. And I still buy/recommend Apple products.

Only thing is that hyperthreading was not really utilized by anything except for specialized software, which cost a whole lot. Hyperthreading is also not as good as you think. 		The data comes into and out of the 2 cores on a street, if you will. There is only one lane. When the data gets to the CPU, it gets split up between the two cores and then leaves it on this same one-lane street. 		On a dual core CPU, each core has it's own street for the data. With a dual core, 2 streets, a 4 core has 4 streets and is much more efficient with data. 		Hyperthreading is a nice thing to have but it's also a bottleneck and even now, many programs don't take advantage of multiple cores or hyperthreading.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"CaptSkunk","name":"t1_ckuvmd6","parent_id":"t1_ckutlkz","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1411933392,"created_utc":1411929792}

For example, one processor may take two [clock cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_cycles) to add two numbers and another clock cycle to multiply by a third number, whereas another processor may do the same calculation in two clock cycles.

FLOPS is also flawed because a GPU gets insane benchmarks on tests, but can't do these really nice things like "branching" very elegantly, so any "if" statement in your code will strangle your performance.

{"body":"> Come on, how expensive is 1g of additional ram??		In pure $ cost, not much.  In energy cost, a lot. When talking about a computer with wall power or even a laptop with a large battery, it's not that noticeable.  On a phone/tablet, it becomes a major concern.		RAM has to have a constant power supply refreshing it.  Any power loss leads to memory loss.  Attempts to hibernate like a laptop would result in much slower wake from sleep times on the phone, and remove the actual phone part of the device.		Though (typing thoughts at this stage), a new phone with essentially two phones built in would be interesting. A very power efficient and low RAM phone part to handle the always on aspect of cellular connectivity and phone calls/texts.  A less power efficient but lots of RAM part of the phone for the "smartphone" side.		We kinda have this today, with the baseband part of the phone, but it lacks the ability to interact with the screen and other hardware to allow a complete call.

Following mobile technology has been very interesting to me, due to all these efficiency designs across the board. It's a much deeper technical challenge then just speeding everything up.

So you could set things up to power down half the RAM when you don't need it (say the phone is suspended) to cut power usage, but without somewhere else to put that data you're not getting all the benefit of that extra RAM to keep apps in memory.		Writing it to flash would be slow, take lots of power, and use up write cycles.

{"body":"I remember reading an AnandTech article explaining why Apple has stuck to the 1.4 ghz dual-core setup for so long, and another one saying (when it came out) that the iPhone 5S A7 processor practically blew every other phone out of the water.		The point was that even when the software optimizations weren't considered, benchmarks seemed to show that their processors have been able to keep up with all the monsters Qualcomm, nVidia and Samsung have been making. They just have focused on improving chip design to improve performance rather than increasing clock rates and number of cores. Different approaches to the same problem.		The difference here is that bigger numbers are more marketable, because numbers are the easiest way to compare things at a glance. If I told you that processor A was 1.4 ghz and processor B was 2.4 ghz, then you know for certain that processor B is faster in at least one way. It might be faster or it might be slower and until you test both there's no way to find out. But at least you have the knowledge that one has a higher clock rate.		Apple isn't exactly in it for the numbers. They are in it for the brand and the ecosystem, so they don't care how about how marketable their numbers are as much as other manufacturers.

{"body":"So everyone and their mother are jumping on the "clockspeed doesn't mean squat" bandwagon. And they are right.		But you are all downplaying the other specs that are comparable. Apple themselves are making such a huge noise about the screen. The 2 year old Galaxy S3 screen is 4.8" 720p AMOLED and it is amazing. Took Apple 2 years to catch up to the size and resolution.		So when Apple was ahead of the curve everyone talked about how Apple is killing it with the hardware. Now when they are way behind it's suddenly all about the software and the 'experience'. The fanboys have been saying that ever since the iPhone 4S that did nothing but to introduce Siri which we now all know is practically useless.		Oh and let's not forget. Whether you like the new design or not you'd better get used to it because you're stuck with it for the next 2 years.
