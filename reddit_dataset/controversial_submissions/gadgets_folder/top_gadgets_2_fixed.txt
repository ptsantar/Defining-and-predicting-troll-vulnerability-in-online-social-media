But, if you mean under the hood they are the same underlying OS with a different shell on top, well that has been iOS from day one, and that is the direction that Microsoft is moving with Windows 10--the same Windows kernel from the phone all the way to the Xbox, but a different UI on top.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mixduptransistor","name":"t1_cl7vf18","parent_id":"t1_cl7uejh","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1413169374,"created_utc":1413165774}

{"body":"Eh, just because everybody else is doing it doesn't necessarily make it right. I think Windows 10 aiming to be an all-in-one OS (IIRC) is a bad idea. Whenever something tries to accomplish more goals that they ought to with a single product, it usually finds itself stretched too thin and lacks in areas where keeping the two separate would have excelled.		Maybe I'm just too strongly of the opinion that mobile and desktop operating systems should remain separated (at least for the time being), but until there is a fully unified system that would make it *necessary* for the OS to handle both, I don't think it needs to be done. If, for example, I could have an iOS device that, when put on a docking station hooked up to a couple monitors and peripherals, optimized itself to run on desktop (read: not be a clickable iOS, but a real desktop-oriented environment) then I absolutely would think it necessary. Having such a device is most likely the next big step in mobile technology, but we're not fully there yet. If and when that time comes, integrating the operating systems together will be the first step in a new level of responsive design.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"roboguy12","name":"t1_cl69plm","parent_id":"t1_cl69b3e","subreddit":"gadgets","subreddit_id":"t5_2qgzt","created":1412999733,"created_utc":1412996133}
