{"body":"So let me analyze this situation.  One of two things happened:		1) Some janky pet food delivery company sent their delivery person out in a penguin suit, on the off chance that you might be a Redditor who can bump the pic to the front page, or maybe on the off chance that you have some other traditional publicity "connections."  So they bought or rented a penguin suit at some expense to them, hoping you would get them some publicity.  Then they sent their delivery person to your place, dressed him up in a penguin suit - and he forgot his shoes.  He walked across the parking lot at work, went to his car, got in, drove to your place, walked across another parking lot, and to your place - all the while forgetting to put on shoes.  Also, your "apartment" looks an awful lot like an office.		**or**		2) You work for a failing pet food delivery company (or are buddies with the owner), so out of desperation you had a worker put on a penguin suit and pose for a fake-assed photo, to manipulate "those Reddit idiots" into giving you some publicity (since a lot of lazy TV "news" shows just rehash Reddit).		I'm going with "2)".		/r/hailcorporate is a pretty fun concept as a subreddit, but seriously Reddit needs to rebuke this kind of bullshit.  I don't want Reddit to become a big spew of "forwards from grandma", mixed with "look at my asperger's kid's amazing drawing!", mixed with "hailcorporate" manipulation.  This sort of stupid shit harms the way Reddit works, and it insults the users.		If any of you feel the same, you might consider the downvote button.

{"body":"If they had been careful when generating their phony viral marketing campaign, they would have simulated reality more closely.  It isn't hard to do.  Just go through the actual steps involved, instead of aping the whole event clumsily:		Step 1:  Have a friend of an employee send in the order.  Do not do stupid things like screen capturing the order, because a regular customer would be somewhat unlikely to do such a thing.		Step 2:  Have your employees **improvise** a penguin suit.  Give them construction paper, markers, aluminum foil, whatever.  Nobody is going to rent a penguin suit for ??15, over an order that is worth probably ??2 in profits.		Step 3:  Deliver to an actual house, the house of the person in "Step 1".  Do not try to pass off your office space's cubicle farm as a residence.		Step 4:  Do not have your delivery person hold the bags awkwardly sideways to show your logos.  Find a less ham-handed way of getting the logos to show.		Step 5:  If you've done all of these steps, congratulations!  You just did much better than these people were able to accomplish.		Step 6:  Get a time machine.		Step 7:  Go back in time to "Step 1".		Step 8:  Talk your past out of going through with any of this.  It is just dumb.  Tell your past self to just stop it.  If your past self doesn't comply, kill them.  Kill them ruthlessly.

They have a sort of "cool" corporate culture a bit like a British Google or Apple. There are beanbags and video games in the staff rooms, all of the meeting rooms have cool "themes" like "outdoor" or whatever, it's a fun place to work for sure.		Their corporate ethos is pretty great too, they pride themselves on great service and honesty, and doing the right thing by their customers. And not in a snidey, false, masking contempt for the customer, US company kind of way either, they genuinely believe in what they're doing from the bottom all the way to the top. I've spent a little time with the founders and they're really nice guys, ex-investment bankers from the city who decided they didn't want to be involved in the murky world of finance any more and decided to set up an online delivery company.

{"body":"The UK is a really different place to the US. People often don't have cars here (pretty crazy concept I know), they use public transport to get to work so don't really *go* to "the store" very often, and actually specialist stuff like organic kitten food that Fetch stocks doesn't tend to be stocked in places other than the big out-of-town malls and retail parks, that are tough to get to if you are car-less.		Looking at the pic, it's an apartment block that OP lives in, and these sometimes have parking spaces, sometimes not. For those that don't have any provisioned parking, it can be a real effort to find a space. Lots of people simply don't have cars, but those that do and don't have allocated parking tend to try and avoid using their cars so that someone else doesn't nab their space.		OP was at work, and his wife was home, so even if they do have a car, it's likely he took it to work leaving her at home on foot.		Even if they have 2 cars *and* allocated parking, "gas" or rather, "petrol", is very very expensive here and we tend to try and avoid using the car whenever possible.		Also we're a tiny island nation with very poor infrastructure. Our roads are congested as fuck, so if you live in a major city, just "popping out to the shops" can be a real chore.		As a result of all that, home delivery is much, much more popular here than over in the states. ??3 is a very reasonable delivery charge. The other big supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsburies etc all charge about ??5-6 for a delivery, and people pay it galdly.
