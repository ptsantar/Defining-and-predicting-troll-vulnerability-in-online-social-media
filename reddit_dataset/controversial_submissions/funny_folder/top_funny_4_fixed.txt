Considering that at the end of the day a map is more about the location of places and how to get there and not the size of the place I'll go with a projection that favors preserving location over a projection that favors preserving size. I'll reiterate that I might not be thinking of the Mercator projection. I remember learning that in a video and most projections having to choose some aspect the preserve at the cost of others and one of the main projections chose size while another chose location (paths). If I'm wrong and you know which projection I'm actually thinking feel free to correct me.		And at the end of the day it really doesn't matter all that much as it's not being used for anything other than displaying all the countries together in one image, so I don't really see the point in complaining about which projection is being used.

If it matters 10 stone is near enough 64 kg.	* Inches are easier to estimate in a lot of cases than centimetres (I find, anyway). For most everyday objects, measuring in inches again comes with an implicit accuracy of "to the nearest inch" which is more likely than to the nearest centimetre.	* Pints are just the right size for a glass of beer/cider.

The US actually fought the British and were heavily outnumbered by the end of the war. Though the British army did burn down the white house, they were stopped quickly in their advancement south. It is also interesting to not that the US burned down much of what is modern day toronto. The war quickly became a burden to both sides after massive casualties were lost, and they signed the treaty of Ghent. In this treaty, the US promised to not annex what is now Canada, and the British vowed to stop hindering Americas westward expansion by aiding the indians. The Brits also agreed to stop interfering with the America's trade routes into France.		There was no clear winner, the war sucked and everybody hated it.

{"body":"The Internet provides the infrastructure for computer programs to communicate. Some of that infrastructure is obviously physical. Some of that infrastructure is software, such as TCP invented by Bob Kahn.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn		TCP is one of the fundamental components that many computer programs depend on to communicate across a network. Such things probably predate TCP. However it was TCP that the Internet was *actually* built upon, probably because TCP is able to handle transmission of data across inter-connected networks very well. You couldn't have a large internet otherwise. For this reason, TCP is one of the early critical inventions that contributed to the development of the Internet.		Because TCP (and some related protocols) are available to to handle the rather difficult and complicated tasks to reliably deliver information across large inter connected networks, programmers (such as myself) can easily write computer programs to communicate around the world. In a few lines of code (in a language such as Python), I could write a program to read data from a specialized piece of laboratory equipment and transmit that data to another program anywhere else on the Internet.		WWW servers and clients are such computer programs. They rely on software such as TCP to communicate. Tim Berners-Lee had a **very** clever idea to extend the notion of hypertext (linked text) so that the links could refer to resources across a network. It was an **inspired** leap, for sure. But once conceived, it was not terribly difficult to implement. The first prototypes probably didn't take him very long. By comparison the Internet protocols (software) that his web clients and servers depended upon to work had been refined over years and were much harder to implement. 		To be sure, I'm not minimizing what TBL did. His epiphany came after years of hard work looking for better ways to share information. Looking back it seems like a fairly obvious thing to do, but it wasn't obvious to any one else. So TBL deservers all the credit he gets for the WWW.

{"body":"The WWW was invented at CERN to *share* data. The WWW consists of computer programs (clients and servers) that use the Internet to communicate.		The Internet was developed over time and consists of physical hardware (obviously) and software routines (often called protocols) that allow computer programs to communicate over large interconnected networks. One of the most important of these protocols is called TCP.		Computer networks probably predate TCP, but it was TCP that was designed to be robust enough to support large interconnected networks. And it was TCP that was used by the people who made the effort (a technical and bureaucratic challenge) and had the vision to create the Internet. Therefor it is creation of TCP (along with other things) that is credited with the origins of the the Internet.		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol		TCP was invented by Bob Kahn about 15 years before the WWW. Most of the early work was indeed carried out in the U.S.		http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet#Origins		The WWW and the Internet are often mistakenly equated with one another. But they are actually two different kinds of things. One (the WWW) depends on the other (the Internet). This is perhaps a poor analogy, but I'll try it out anyway...

On Farenheit you often run into the 32-100 range, and 212 is there (which you never *measure*). Celsius uses 0-32 and 100 (which you still never measure). So 33-99 are useless.		To me it's just odd to scale the entire spectrum to make boiling a nice number, and then you never actually measure boiling. In our daily lives the utility of being able to more accurately adjust temperate or utilize the overall spectrum far outweighs whatever benefit we get from having water boil at 100.		For day to day life, the scale Farenheit uses is just more practical.		I think Kelvin makes celsius redundant though. The arbitrary decision to use water isn't as good as the concept behind absolute zero.		Don't get me wrong, the metric system is where it's at, but Celsius is as arbitrary as Farenheit, less precise, and utilizes less of the overall spectrum.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Backfjre","name":"t1_cmsmxt0","parent_id":"t3_2p1he9","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1418367472,"created_utc":1418367472}
