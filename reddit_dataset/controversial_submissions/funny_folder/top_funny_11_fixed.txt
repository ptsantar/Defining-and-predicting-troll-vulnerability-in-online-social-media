A partner who isn't contributing isn't a good partner.		>Or even if both parties are students, therefore not working, but one is having a very much heavier load than the other. Is that a justified reason for infidelity?		Well, I don't agree with the infidelity part in general. I think the appropriate response is to break up and get a new partner, not stay together and get a side partner.		>The head giving is another thing. I have accepted that my partners don't do that, there are other ways to satisfy me.		To each their own, I suppose. Personally, I wouldn't be happy with that, and wouldn't stay. The point isn't giving head specifically, but rather sexual satisfaction in general (which can include oral sex specifically, if that's your preference).","depth":4,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpbsxe6","parent_id":"t1_cpbs2z9","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1426109310,"created_utc":1426105710}

I like promiscuous women. I don't like manipulative liars. Then again I'm not interested in marriage so I'm not really invested into finding a partner with a low sexual partner count.		The reason why men are interested in women with low counts, is because as women sleep with more people the risk of divorce skyrockets. This is also the reason why I'm not getting married. I have no problem with women sleeping around, in fact I love how often I get laid from it. I'd just never marry one that did it.

Yep, here we have the type of /r/funny user who made shitposts like this get to the front page		And here we witness a tumblr cunt out in the wild away from their territory. The tumblr cunt exhibits pathetic form of behaviour, even though she origanly made a stupid comment because she was offended by a post in /r/funny, that kind of made fun of women, even though it can be applied to men as well. 		Now since she has been outed she will attempt to gain sympathy from the group by accusing another user for making shitposts get to the frontpage, while she continues to make shitty comments. Unfortunately the tumblr cunt creature is oblivious to this irony, as they lack the mental mind set to see anything from a different perspective.		And now this vile creature will roam the lands of reddit making sure to let everyone know when she is offended, hopefully one day she will hibernate back to her natural environment at tumblr.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Just_pass_it_to_Will","name":"t1_cpbnnyy","parent_id":"t1_cpbnd8e","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1426101390,"created_utc":1426097790}
