{"body":"I experienced this double standard two weeks ago. I was sitting at a bar with my girlfriend (in a club) and she became very intoxicated and irate after about an hour. She started arguing with me and it progressed to her yelling at me. I told her she had to calm down or we needed to leave. 		She got even angrier and people started looking at us so I stood up and said we needed to go outside and we can talk there. She grabbed my arm and told me "you aren't fucking going anywhere". I tried to pull away and she put her other arm around my neck and scratched my face (leaving a huge gash on my cheek). 		I looked at the barback and noticed he was smiling. I called out to him and our convo went like this:		Me: "hey man can you get her out of her she is wasted". 	Him: "you can go get security if you want"	Me: "dude shes literally hitting me can you please get security"	Him (with a smile): "not my job"		Nobody intervened or said anything. I noticed several people looking, but nothing. I am in a headlock in a public place with blood on my face being screamed at and I was actually laughed at by an employee.		I could have EASILY threw her off me or got away. I don't think that would have been a smart thing to do in a room full of 100 testosterone fueled men though.

{"body":"Sounds like my ex too...don't walk...run away.		I guess the time I knew she was crazy was when she got really wasted with her housemates and was talking about Sex & The City. When I expressed my disappointment that all her friends said she was just like the slutty one, she pretty much went bonkers. Started threatening me and put a cigarette out on my leg while looking me right in the face. It's the closest I've ever been to hitting a girl. I picked her up and almost pile-drove her head first into the ground. But I came to my senses, set her down very carefully, and as calmly as possible said "I'm going to my room, I would really appreciate it if you would leave."		Long story short, she followed me to my room and threw her arm in the door when it was closing shut.

{"body":"My point here is not necessarily that evangelical Christianity is wrong, or that smoking weed is all right. My point is you can't say Reddit doesn't have a distinct demographic.

Overall though, there are certain trends Reddit supports (Weird Al, Atheism, Weed is good, Neil deGrasse Tyson quotes, Emma Watson) and trends that it does not support. So yeah, you do get a variety of opinions, but those opinions do not carry equal weight in the community. That's why when you see "I hate feminists" at +476 and "I like feminists" at -13, you can't say Reddit equally hates and likes feminists.		Yeah I think it's disgusting that this guy's suffering was laughed about on a TV show. But we aren't discussing that show right now, we're discussing Reddit. Barring any concrete proof to the contrary, Reddit will always support the side of a conflict that is most like it's userbase, which tends to be liberal White male American atheists in their early to mid-twenties. That means that when it comes to gender issues (Rape, violence, health care) Reddit will marginalize the female viewpoint and support the male viewpoint, except in cases of women vs. conservatives or women vs. brown people.

{"body":"I saw this post first, and I found it kind of funny. I think if I explain the humor, you won't feel so bad about laughing at the other picture, because the humor doesn't really rely on the gender of the person in the picture.		First, you see the picture, of a person smiling happily. Then, you read the text, and the explanation of the picture is not what you're expecting. So, it's funny. You're not as in control about what you find funny as you think you are.		Now, the humor is explained, I'll make a few more points that will hopefully make you feel better about yourself.		First, it's not like there's long term abuse going on. If you see your SO in the middle of cheating on you, you'll probably feel rage and go a little crazy. Personally, I've been in similar situations, and I don't react with violence, but it's not hard to envision a slightly different me who reacts differently.		Second, the violent person was caught after one incident and will be going to jail. The picture, were it truthful, is proof that the person is being dealt with seriously, because it's a mug shot. The violence is exposed.		Third, were I to hit somebody who was hurting me emotionally, I would most likely get super depressed. But, I can't say for sure because I don't have that crazy adrenaline and whatever flowing through me. You probably shouldn't judge a person for how they look right after they've been in such an emotional and stressful situation.

Suffice it to say that I would rather both sexes appreciate those differences.		More to the point; the reaction of that audience, and how it relates to feminism, if at all. The purpose of that video, as I see it, is to point out that the audience in question exhibits a reaction that often seems to be representative.

It is all well and good to subscribe to an ideology whose goals are stated to be (X), but it amounts to lip service when a significant number of said subscribers do (Y). Alternatively, actions speak louder than words, and public opinion on ideologies is swayed as such.		Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but your argument seems to be that while the people in that video may consider themselves feminists, they were not representing feminists at that time. Thus, that video has nothing to do with feminism. I try to imagine what the responses might be if you asked those people, on that day, if that particular show was dealing with a feminist issue. Then I try to imagine the hypothetical scenario in which they were talking about a mutilated woman instead of a man, and how they would answer the same question in that instance.

{"body":"I had an experience like user/throwm1313 once in terms of not being able to do anything about a female attacking me.		I was in Houston and we went out, a group of about 6 girls and 6 guys.  Among the 6 girls was my older sister and her friends (who one of them was a complete, rude piece of shit).		Anyways at the after party at a friend's loft my sister was being a female equivalent of a douchebag to my female friends that I had brought and her POS friend was adding to the situation.  My sister then made the serious comment about how she could beat me up (she's 4'11" and barely a pound over 100) and I basically rolled my eyes at the comment.  Soon after her POS friend snuck up behind me and put me in a choke hold, like a serious choke hold, and my immediate response was to lift her up and slam her on the ground sandwiching her body with mine and the floor (I had been put in chokeholds before in my college days so knew how to get out of it).  		BUT as soon as I picked her up my male instincts kicked in and simply put her back down, knowing that if I had slammed her on the ground it would only make a terrible situation for ME more so than for her.  So I basically stood there as this girl continued to tighten her choke hold on me and I looked at my sister with a "Are you going to do anything look" before passing out upon which the girl dropped me and I nailed my eye on SOMETHING and had to pay $3K to get it fixed/better later on (which I won't even go into that whole thing). 		But basically the few other people around (most of the party didn't even witness or was aware all this happened) who saw it were all kind of speechless at the whole thing and it wasn't till I laughed it off -- despite being insanely infuriated -- that the other people laughed it off too.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cjngbvw","parent_id":"t3_2d8och","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1407795876,"created_utc":1407792276}

I don't really care what the men's rights activiists or feminists have to say, objectively I'm more likely to take male violence against women more seriously (especially in the case of a beating and just as I would against anyone who is less capable of defending themselves; children, the disabled, or the elderly) because men are physically stronger (if you deny this your just living in a fantasy land) on average and women are statistically far more likely to be killed by their partners than men. What is most important to consider in these cases is context and intent. We can't just throw a blanket condemnation against male on female/female to male domestic violence of one being worse than the other, because all cases are different and no case should ever overlooked.

{"body":"The double standard isn't that strange if you consider that humans have sexual dimorphism and males on average have much greater physical strength and size.  A male hitting a female should ordinarily be more concerning to our society.  The absurdity of it comes from trying to treat men and women as though they're exactly the same.  		I realize that the point certain redditors like to make is that certain feminists seem to want to be treated as though they same in areas where it's beneficial to them (like pay) while not focusing on other areas (like physical or sexual abuse).  I think that's petty, and it simply extends the absurdity of assuming that men and women are exactly the same.  It's fighting one absurdity with another.  Instead, I think the proper response is to reject the absurdity.  We should -- while acknowledging that individuals should be judged as individuals -- realize that men and women differ and it's not always a bad thing (although it can be) when we recognize that difference or when it is reflected in our society.
