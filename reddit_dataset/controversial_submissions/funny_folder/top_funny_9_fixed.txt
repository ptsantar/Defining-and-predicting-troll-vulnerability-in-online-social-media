{"body":"As someone who's done stuff like this for DC-area government offices in the past, here's what I notice in addition to that:	 	- The seal used on the top of the page is clearly from a laserjet printer, not official White House letterhead, and the lack of a watermark on the paper drives that point home further.	 	- The font is wrong and the print quality is bad, since it's likely from a laserjet printer.	 	- The writer would be referred to as Mr./Mrs. <lastname>, not "Max".	 	- The PS wouldn't go below the signature, and that huge gap between the last paragraph and the PS wouldn't exist except to have the signature there.	 	- The fact that there's a phrase in the originating letter like "conservative dinosaur" would guarantee that the letter wouldn't be taken seriously or responded to in the first place. Such a comment is critical of members of Congress, and the White House can't be responding to such statements that aren't made in an official/public/political-in-some-nature capacity.	 	- "your passion for Barack Obama" is wrong. It would say "President Obama" or "the President".	 	- It still wouldn't just say "the White House" in the signature, it'd likely be the director of whichever office issued the response, likely the director of the White House's correspondence office.	 	- A VCR tape wouldn't survive the very-invasive inspection process that all presidential mail goes to before even getting to DC, let alone the White House's correspondence team, so they wouldn't even be able to view the tape if they wanted to.	 	- The signature block is wrong. The "Sincerely," etc. would be in the center of the page.	 	- Overlooking all of this, the White House would still likely not respond to this because of the questionable nature of the writer's intentions.

{"body":"Take everything I just said above, and do it 200 times a day, 5 days a week, and then add on these things: 	 	- Watch out for people making threats and report them to Secret Service.	 	- Pore through hundreds of letters from inmates in prison begging for a pardon and each of them telling you basically the same sad story.	 	- Pore through letters from family members begging the president to pardon their son, a war hero who returned from Iraq a year ago and got into drugs due to PTSD, then crime, and is now looking at jail time.	 	- Read a lot of really, really, really hateful things Americans say about presidents and politicians for very stupid reasons. Or, read a lot of opinions that agree with your own political views, but make such slanted, biased, or flawed arguments that you question your position on everything.	 	- Get in big trouble if some celebrity you've never heard of wrote a letter to the President and no one spotted it and pulled it out. Or, spend an entire day digging through the letters that have already been read & responded to, just so you can look for one letter that may have been sent by a celebrity, only to learn that the celebrity said in public that they already mailed it, but it turns out they hadn't yet.	 	-  Get phone calls from prosecutors months after you've handled a letter asking you to testify in court because the person who sent it was actually a wanted criminal and their letter is now evidence.	 	- The propaganda campaigns. Good sweet mercy the propaganda you read, makes 1984 look like child's play.	 	- And worst of all. 100% the absolute worst thing: Christmas cards covered in glitter. When mail is inspected before being sent to DC, it goes through intense heat in order to eliminate any and all possible toxins. That heat weakens the glue holding the glitter onto Christmas cards. You'd better not wear good clothes to work if you're dealing with those that day.	 	-  Oh, and the White House interns. Goodness, what a bunch.	 	Edit: Pore, not pour.

{"body":"Well, I had a couple that were hard workers and I'm still in touch with them on LinkedIn and watching their careers. Others were only there because of their family's political connections and... yeah, they didn't do anything, and partied down, and got in trouble a lot- with cops, with doctors. Or with me, just because of their attitudes.	 	But there was a ton of gossip too. I remember one girl in particular was the best of the bunch, very hard worker, got to give her some responsibilities that look good on a resume and stuff. Months later, her internship is over, and I'm hanging out with coworkers and apparently there was gossip about her being with a lot of the boys in her program and being up late partying many nights. I'd've never known, but apparently everyone else did, if it's even true.	 	There was one other kid who drank himself silly, so bad that my boss sent a couple of my coworkers over to his house once and make sure he was ok. He had some health problems from it, if I recall. Also remember that these are interns, in their young 20's, and this well-connected kid is drinking himself into medical problems.	 	I remember this one other girl came from a workshop the intern program hosted on writing your resumes and cover letters to apply for jobs. Well, she asks me to look at her resume for her, and it's just the worst thing I've ever seen. Littered with factoids about being captain of the high school volleyball team and useless stuff. Every margin crammed with this stuff. I try telling her that this will guarantee she's never hired, and she just got mad. Never heard from her again.	 	I'd say it was about 50/50 between the good kids and the useless ones. I try telling people that there are hundreds of fine places across DC to intern and have a great time, but people keep applying for the White House, and think their career is over when they don't get in. 	 	That attitude really gets me. I did 2 internships before finishing undergrad, then the company that promised me a job went bankrupt, so I temped after I graduated and lived with my folks, then got another internship in DC where I networked into this White House gig. It's all luck, and I'll be the first to admit it, but you still have to put yourself in the right position and make the most of it.

I once saw a thousand letters from this Korean dry cleaner owner's lobbying firm that disputed the rising price of certain metals, since it would make closet hangers more expensive.	 	The campaigns are similar to Reddit's "flood the FCC" campaigns, except it's some lobbyist using a mail-merged Excel document with the names of all their contributors and each one sends you the same little letter/card/flyer with the same language on it.

Basically if you belong to, like, the Sierra Club or some similar organization, chances are you'll get a call or email or letter from that organization saying "Washington wants to change XYZ law! That's terrible and you need to help stop it! Mail this card to the White House!" and in a month we'll have thousands of them.	 	And again, this sort of thing happens literally from every lobbying firm, every issue on the radar, every conceivable hash mark on the political spectrum.
