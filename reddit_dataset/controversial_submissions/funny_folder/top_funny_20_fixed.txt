The way it works is you would work in the field under a Journeyman for 1500 hours (about 10 months), and then go to college for 8 weeks to learn the textbook stuff and take exams. At the end of 4 years you take your final exam and your "Red Seal" exam (in Canada, this means you can work inter-provincially). Plumbers also receive a Class B Gasfitter ticket allowing them to work on natural gas and propane piping systems, and heating appliances up to 399,999 BTU.		Plumbing can be pretty intellectual work, it's a lot more than setting toilets and fixing drips. You need to be able to install and maintain appropriate fixtures and appliances and do so within building safety codes.
