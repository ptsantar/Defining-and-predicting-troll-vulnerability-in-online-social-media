Even the popular Robinson Projection, now used in many schools, still contains a large amount of area distortion with Greenland appearing 60 percent larger than its relative globe size.		> Fuller's view was that given a way to visualize the whole planet with greater accuracy, we humans will be better equipped to address challenges as we face our common future aboard Spaceship Earth.","depth":3,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"serious_sarcasm","name":"t1_cjul65v","parent_id":"t1_cjukim4","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1408464437,"created_utc":1408460837}
