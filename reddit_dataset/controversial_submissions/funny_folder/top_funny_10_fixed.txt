If you do think this then you are incorrect. Yes, race and racism is a social construct that is often times pretty arbitrary and is not based on any real amount of science or reality. Despite being a social construct it is still a hugely impactful and real phenomena that affects many people and is often times built into the code of law or social codes like many other social constructs like marriage or religion or for that matter pretty much every law and social code.

{"body":"There are slight genetic variations between groups of people. The vast majority of this variation is not so much between groups but within groups. However when a group of people has been living in a similar area for a long period of time that is somewhat isolated from other groups of people and there is a natural selecting factor for certain traits then yes, there do arise variations that are present in much higher concentrations in people from those regions. The farther away from Africa you go the less variation you will find within a population yet there will still be variation. That is why there is a much higher amount of genetic variation in Africa as well as Europe and India (at least historically). That is also why people in Polynesia and East Asia tend to be much more similar in looks and appearances. Despite this the level of genetic variation is still quite large since we've had thousands of years to both intermingle (especially in recent millennia) as well as to produce mutations.		Some of these variations have been quite visible and drastically affected the phenotype of the populations they arose in. Mutations like those for lighter skin (yes, white people are the mutants) beneficial because of differences in UV concentrations at higher latitudes, as well as ones selected for sexually such as blue eyes and blonde or red hair. Some of these mutations may have also been borrowed from Neanderthals, the only legitimate (although barely) argument for racism but counter to what you normally see, this would make everyone on earth Homosapians and then select populations in Europe (and their ancestors) as Homosapian/Homoneanderthalis mutts or mixes. Within Africa is is very possible that the evolution of even darker skin was selected for because, once again, due to higher UV concentrations and the benefit of not burning and getting skin cancer as easily. In Nepal they developed hemoglobin that was especially efficient at transferring oxygen at high altitudes. Northern European populations, due to our love of sucking cow tits, developed mutations that allowed for the consumption of cows milk while different mutations that yielded the same results became prominent in the Steppe tribes of central Asia. The consumption of alcohol led to the rise of mutations to break down what is essentially a poison across the world although not completely uniformly with both Indians and American Indians (or Native Americans) notably not developing these mutations which may have contributed to how they got so fucked by imperialism. Of course blue eyes also mutated in certain regions in China and red hair was also mutated in Neanderthals but apparently due to a different set of genes than in humans.		None of these make humans any less interrelated. Humanity went through what is called a genetic bottleneck approximately 70 000 years ago that resulted in humans being reduced to about 10 000 individuals. This severely reduced genetic diversity in humans which is why we all are pretty much the same. This bottleneck occurs roughly at the same time as when humans were migrating out of Africa and the Western half of Eurasia which is also likely contributes to the reduced genetic diversity of cultures in Eastern Asia, Polynesia, and the Natives of North and South America. Compared to Cheetah's which went through a similar event during the last Ice Age (ending approximately 12 000 years ago) that results in every cheetah today being so genetically similar to each other that they can all be used as donors to transplants for each other, as if they were all immediate family. On the other hand there are species of fish, birds, and other species that we didn't even realize were the same species until we genetically tested them and even then there are still hundreds of species with sub classes because there is such a large genetic diversity in their populations.		The only situation where "races" as we have defined them have any use is in Medicine where it is often found that genetic diseases and abnormalities are much more common (but not contained) within a group of similar cultural and geographical origins. But hey, you still can tell a black guy from a white guy so they must be different races. So tell me, is that white guy from Norway and is genetically descendant from Jutes? Or maybe from the Angles? Or perhaps he is from the UK and he is decendent from Picts, Angles, Saxons, with a bit of Norman? Or is that too long ago? Should we be talking about 1000 years ago or only 100 years ago? If you say white do you mean the white skinned guy in South Africa or the one in America or the one in German or the one in New Zealand? I can guarantee you that although some of their cultural heritage might be the same the chances of that cultural heritage mixing with dozens of others is not only possible but highly likely. Even that German may have some French from the various wars they used to fight, or Russian/British/Canadian/America from the mass rapes after WWII. There may be a little bit bit of Italian or really any nearby nationality. There could even be quite a bit of Middle Eastern or African from the Roman days of colonization. The same is even more true for nations that did the whole Imperialism thing such as Spain, the UK, and France. And when I say middle Eastern do I mean Kurd? Or Yemeni, Egyptian, Syrian, Bedouin, Persian, or what? Or you could go farther back and identify people based on their nationalities of that time period. Or a more recent time period. What do you call the race of someone in the US who has one parent who had both British and Chinese parents and the other parent having Kenyan and Indian parents? This person has slightly tanned skin but not really dark. They have brown eyes and brunette hair. Does this make them Asian? Or Black? White? None of them fit or work. This is because people do not fit into nice little boxes like that. They would if we all lived in a separated and distinct populations over a long period of time, enough time for mutations to build up to the point that the groups could no longer mate and reproduce. The whole process of speciation. However, seeing that despite humans were still able to mate and mix with Neanderthals long after they had genetically diverged into a distinct species, this is because speciation can occur not only because reproduction is impossible, but because it just doesn't happen for social or behavioral reasons. Seeing as even splitting humans up onto completely separate continents for the last 12000 years wasn't enough to cause much speciation I don' think this will ever be possible on our globalized world. Even if we sent humans to Mars there would have to be no connection for thousands of years for it to lead to any form of speciation. There are no other races of humanity in existence. The concept is unhelpful and only leads to discrimination and hate. We have genetic variation, something that should be celebrated because without it we would be wiped out by disease pretty easily.And just in case you are wondering, no, reproduction between "races" will not turn us into some blended uniform species because all of those genes are still in the population and they will not just disappear. Just become more intermingled which will finally put an end to the idea of race once and for all as well as strengthening our species as a whole by allowing for new genetic combinations and greater variation in immunity.			TLDR: Racism exists. Races do not. There are so many reasons why race is a terrible concept and past some very limited uses (that are not even related to social issues) it has absolutely no use or credence.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BiPoLaRadiation","name":"t1_csnd2dd","parent_id":"t1_csnc2st","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1435658252,"created_utc":1435654652}

{"body":"Depends on definition. The no true Scotsman fallacy is an informal fallacy and, as such, does not deal with the *form* of the argument. Simply calling out "no true scotsman" whenver someone says something kinda like "foo is not a real bar" does not follow. As an example:		    A: No vegetarian eats meat	    B: But I'm a vegetarian and I eat meat	    A: then you are not a true vegetarian	    B: No true scotsman! Boo! Hiss!		B is wrong as any reasonable definition of vegetarian will include an avoidance of meat-eating. This is why it's important to define terms before a discussion or use commonly accepted (ie. dictionary defined) terms from the beginning.		Also, and possibly more importantly, the no true Scotsman fallacy does not apply unless an ad hoc qualifier is introduced to *move the goalposts* in mid-discussion to save the original assertion.

{"body":"To /u/Wowtcg12, who deleted their comment...I had written up a reply, so here is is:		The comments you see about the platform will be heavily influenced by the sites you visit, and your interests.		I'm 32. I've been on the net since 2000. I work in IT.  I'm a sci-fi/fantasy fan--a reader, and a writer. SF&F fandom has iterated through several social platforms. You heard the same complaints about drama on Livejournal that you heard about Tumblr. You'll hear the same about whatever platform comes after Tumblr. When people are passionate about a topic, you get the fanatics, and fanatics make for good popcorn to tear apart to outsiders. (Hell, to insiders too.)		Tumblr/Livejournal/etc tends towards a female demographic. But I can tell you that when I venture onto gaming websites (male demographic) I've seen immature shit coming out of mouths there just as terrible as anything you see on Tumblr. I've seen some epic stupid rants about gaming mechanics or what-have-you where people completely lose their shit over an online GAME. (Blizzard forums--looking at you!)  But, there's also a certain tolerance/excuse for the rampant stupidity on social sites catering to dudes as compared to social sites catering to females. Or at least, the ways they're torn apart seem to differ in presentation in my experience.		But the fact is, a certain percentage of humanity, male or female, is just rampantly stupid, cringey, and Darwin-award-worthy.  And if you don't use a site because your interests don't take you there, you'll only see the worst of the worst, because that's the sort of "disaster rubbernecking" that will make people look beyond their normal circle of sites/influences and pass those links on.  Sites that have minimal moderation (Reddit, Tumblr, etc.) can get some really terrible stuff popping up.		But, you know, this holds true of pretty much every facet in life. You can choose to listen to gossip and rumors that make it to your ears just because they're so epically bad, or you can investigate first-hand and take in with you an understanding that, frankly, a certain segment of humanity is terrible, but a certain segment is also pretty terrific.  You get both on the internet, although the latter tends to be more quiet. You don't usually get "OMG THIS SOCIAL SITE IS SOOOOO GOOD" unless it saves you money or time or something directly practical like that.		Reddit, for example, gets a lot of shit for many things.

Those issues are just as important as rights to abortion or justice for female rape victims, but whenever that's pointed out the discussion gets shut down by the cries of accusations of sexism. 		The fact of the matter is that modern western society is extremely complex, and doesn't blindly give benefits to one gender over the other. Even if the end result is that people of one gender end up benefiting more, that's still a very complex sum, and more of a coincidence in the outcome than a result from how the system is set up. It's just too big and uncontrollable to be forced to give benefits to categories as wide as genders. Women's issues are not caused by men, and men's issues are not caused by women. Likewise, men don't benefit from women's issues being unsolved, and women don't benefit from men's issues being unsolved. Both of those are unfortunate outcomes of how the society ended up working. Prioritizing issues by gender assumes that one gender is systematically stacked against and deliberately kept in lower position, and needs more immediate help than the other, and in modern western world that's just untrue. Gender issues should instead be prioritized based on how much negative utility they bring to the entire society.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"C0DASOON","name":"t1_csn8xtx","parent_id":"t1_csn8doe","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1435644469,"created_utc":1435640869}

Pretty much any feminist you talk to will tell you that those problems that men face are awful and that a society that views men as too powerful to become susceptible to mental illness, rape, and the like is one that is perpetuating these problems.		And yet, I always hear people around these parts say that "whenever that's pointed out the discussion gets shut down by the cries of accusations of sexism".

That said feminism is called feminism because, as i said previously, the movement focuses on and is about empowering those who lack power. It is called feminism because, yes, the problems females face are that much worse. Because, women are still killed for being raped in some parts of the world. Because statistics like [this one](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/01/rape_infographic.jpg) can exist and yet people still fervently blame the victims of rape cases.

{"body":"> the problems that both women and men face can be tied to the fact that more power is placed in males.		That's just not true, though. The fact that the sum of all power men hold is bigger than the sum of all the power women hold does not automatically shift the blame for all the gender issues onto the male group. Men having more power than women is not the cause of gender issues, but one more gender issue, all of which are caused by the accidental turn-out of the structure of the society, which was not decided by people, as no people, men or women, have ever had enough power to exert control over something as complex as the modern western world.		Discussions being shut down is a very real thing, and academia is usually either silent or encouraging it. Some examples that come to mind are disruptions of Anne Cool speeches and the recent CHS speech at Oberlin. It's not limited to speeches, though. It wasn't a group of "crazies" that advocated shutting down male-only spaces, and it wasn't extremist that pushed the Duluth model. Nor is it just limited to gender sciences and feminist theorists. As an example, academics in many fields of social sciences have been trying to shut down discussions on basis of unproven claims of power structures in sciences (in the so-called Science Wars) and many sociologist are still trying to, to this day. Politicized academia is not a new thing.		The problems women face *are* much worse than men's in many places, but not in the modern day US or Europe. I mean, they might or might not be worse, but at no realistic scale of how better or worse it is would justify putting all women's issues in one bag and focusing on solving all of them before we focus on any male issues at all. There's no real downside in deciding priorities issue by issue irrelevant of gender, other than problems usually associated with movements that establish new public conscience.		On a related note, the graph you've linked to is very misleading. [The problems have been outlined here.](https://i.imgur.com/PC0Ogup.jpg) It was likely meant as a joke from the beginning, though - the stick figures on the left are bigger than ones on the right.

They assume that my life is just great based off of my skin color.

He could be the hardest working guy there and pull more than his weight. But if constant insults, teasing, ragging and bagging are going on it abhors a vacuum (in other words: silent breaks in the conversation), and many guys will pick on the guy who is "weakest" at the verbal jousting because he is such an easy target.		I can just imagine how much worse it is for women if you have a bunch of guys who do not respect women very much in the first place who are programmed to see women as weaker and less capable. There is going to be a big red target on the woman in that group.		I am not saying all guys are like this, but it only takes one or two guys in a group to make life hell for the woman.

I would chalk this up to gender roles forced on women by society where women are expected to never be confrontational (leading to passive aggression) and to never reveal how they really feel about a person or if they have problems with a person (leading women to act two-faced).

It is no coincidence that "bitch" and "bitching" are pejoratives derived from the female of the species (the make equivalent is a *positive* thing!) and are almost always applied to women and then applied to men as a pejorative that implies they are feminine or are acting like a woman.","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SirHumpy","name":"t1_csnab6y","parent_id":"t1_csn9vg5","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1435648205,"created_utc":1435644605}

Based on their data, for the 32/100 rapes that are reported, 2 are successfully prosecuted. I just referenced 2 out of 32 for the 6% figure. Technically it's 6.25%.		This isn't the same as trial conviction rate, btw! The conviction rate for a rape case that does go to trial is only a little lower than that of other violent crimes (according to the Bureau of Justice, though the most recent numbers they have are from a relatively small 2006 survey so I don't know how authoritative that is). The cause of this disparity is the fact that of the 32 rapes reported, only 7 result in an arrest and only 3 of those referrals result in prosecution. To me these numbers say that rape is sometimes hard to prove, the police are not particularly motivated to prove it, and the prosecution only moves forward with cases they're very sure they can win.

This isn't to say that false accusations aren't a problem, but to put it in perspective, a man is more likely to be sexually assaulted himself than he is to be falsely accused of sexual assault, and for every false accusation made, somewhere between 5 and 8 actual rapes go unreported.		Incidentally:		>We all hear about women lying that they were raped after they regret having sex with a guy, or just to be vindictive for some reason		This is one of the reasons so many rapes go unreported.

{"body":"Literally just read this now - sorry for not replying until now. 		I am puzzled that you seem to think I have contempt for homeless people because they are men. Theories around intersectionality tell us that people's various identities place them at a particular position in society and that each identity may confer an advantage or disadvantage (e.g. male [privileged], middle/upper class [privileged], African American [in the US, disadvantaged], transgender [disadvantaged]). 		I appreciate that white, straight males don't want to feel like they benefit from a system that they argue they are not actively participating in (for example, by not keeping slaves like white men did centuries ago). However, this doesn't mean that patriarchy doesn't operate and that men in general do not benefit from it simply by being men (though they do not all benefit from it equally). Connell, in his 2005 book *Masculinities* has an interesting discussion on the hierarchies among men. It's actually a nice read even for people who aren't interested in gender theory or don't have a background in Sociology. Maybe check it out if you get a chance. 		I would say though that it is not enough to argue that we don't benefit from the way in which society is organised just because we aren't taking an active part in oppression. For example, it may be true that none of us use child labour in the home or in our businesses. But that does not mean that we don't benefit massively from buying cheap consumer goods or food products that often employ child labour. People who are exploited in far off parts of the world make our Western lifestyle possible. We don't actively exploit children but we benefit from it, must take our share of the blame, and must also try to challenge it (at the very least by trying to purchase only ethical goods). Patriarchy and racism are like that. Just because I don't go around hurling racial insults at everyone I meet who isn't white, doesn't mean that I have not benefited from being white in a society that is unfortunately still very racist. The same goes for men. 		Patriarchy operates in a mainly covert way. Which is why you feel justified in telling me that I am trying to blame the actions of a few bad apples on an entire sex/gender. Anyway, it might be worth it for you to give it a bit more thought.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"armchairdetective","name":"t1_csrcokg","parent_id":"t1_csnwx6s","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1435960490,"created_utc":1435956890}
