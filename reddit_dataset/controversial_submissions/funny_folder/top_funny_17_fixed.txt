Selling it at 105% of cost (rather than retail which can be as much as 500% cost or more on some items) would make so much more sense, and employees would feel valued and appreciated.

{"body":"People do eat a lot more beef than almonds, but beef comes from all over the nation. The problem is 82% of the **worlds** almond supply come from California's Central Valley. We can produce beef in areas where there is plenty of water and ship elsewhere. However, the Almonds need to still come from California for it was the main place for them to grow. 		Edit: The book you linked also is about 20 years old. Our drought increases the amount of evaporation from plants. This means that those same plants need more water than they traditionally did in order to produce the same amount of food. 		Second Edit: I've been reading from as many different sources as I can find. It turns out the number quoted from Huffpo was based on all Almonds use of water averaged world wide. Almonds are preferred to grow in california as they use less water in our environment. Californian almonds average 550-600 gallons per pound, not 100% sure if that is shelled or de-shelled numbers though pretty certain it is for shelled as the US exports 70% of our almonds shelled. Seems a bit misleading in numbers. 		An issue that is arising though, the number of Almond orchards are actually growing in the drought. Most other high water maintenance crops have been slowly cutting back production and producing other less water thirsty plants. However, the demand for almonds are at an all time high, and consumers don't appear to have any issues offsetting the farmers cost of the higher water.

The fact is much of our water is used so the rest of the country can eat seasonable foods year round.		2) figure out how to open/construct additional  desalination plants without putting CO2 in the air and without disturbing local coastlines. 		3) end bottled water from aquifers in the state 		4) end excessive use of water in places like the coachella valley. A vast majority of their residents are snow birds from Canada, the Midwest and East Coast. They are the older generation and a lot of them simply don't care. I know first hand.

{"body":"The major cause of the near constant debt in California comes down to fucked property tax laws, the root of which can be traced to Proposition 13, a Republican authored and sponsored bill that severely cut property taxes, which companies take advantage of to bilk us out of billions a year in property taxes.  How do they do this?  	  	Property tax rates are frozen as long as you don't sell your property.  Corporations figured out that if they want to sell property but keep the rate locked in they simply create a shell corporation that "owns" the property, and then they sell that shell, so that technically the property ownership never changes, thus much of our commercial real estate is locked into property tax rates from the 70 and 80's.  	  	Republican governor Pete Wilson deregulated the electricity market which opened the door for Republican mega donor run Enron to bilk us out of $30 billion.  	  	Democrats have also done some stupid shit, Jerry Brown needs to do something about corporate agriculture using up all our water, but that doesn't really cause much debt, at least not yet.  	  	As for your question about restrictive laws, I assume you're using the common coded language of Republicans to try and claim California's Democrats make way too many laws, but you would be wrong, the final say on any new laws is the governor who signs them, and in the past 50 years we've had 31 years of Republican Governors, versus 19 years with a Dem.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"djlewt","name":"t1_cq2j52g","parent_id":"t1_cq2ht3p","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1428288943,"created_utc":1428285343}
