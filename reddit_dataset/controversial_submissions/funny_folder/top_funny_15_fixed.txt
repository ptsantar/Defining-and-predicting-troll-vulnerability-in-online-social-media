{"body":"You sir, deserve metals. Like war metals, you know? Only for combating the evil Coka-Cola industry and saving the lives and minds of the obese. You have won the argument. I shall congratulate you with an up-voting via the internet point called "karma".		Anyways, tell me more how this Coka-Cola product (which I lavishly drink) violates Reddit's Terms of Service by group up-voting ads to the front page, how it causes the obesity "epidemic" in America, and why I am I loser by telling you to get over it, also how much you don't like it.		Elementary, sir!		However, I don't quite know Reddit's Terms of Service, nor do I study it to know it (because I am not a loser) just to combat obesity in America, I am fully aware that if Reddit found out this was happening, I am sure they would do something about it. Why not report it? Isn't that in the reddiquette (which I do know because I am an avid user of reddit). Complaining about this in a comments section is likely down vote material and won't be seen by as many people (unlike my curious mind), however, being a sensible person, just reporting this would do it's job quite nicely.		The obesity "epidemic" (why do people call it an epidemic? I have yet to catch the fat from another person) is simply people buying fattening things and not eating healthy by choice. No one is forcing coke or any of it's products on anyone. Especially on a post on the internet for that matter.		I have serious doubts of truth coming from you. Especially when you use the word epidemic like you do. It's quite sad how extremists use words that actually mean something serious for subjects they overly self-advocate. Get over it man. Have a life or something. Try an actually viral disease like Ebola, or Flu when you use that word. Might be taken way more seriously next time.		Another thing, just because you don't like it doesn't mean other people don't either. I enjoy a coke. I drink it quite often. However I keep a pretty regimented diet and eat healthy as well. I am 5 11 at 165. Quite healthy for a guy like me. I have less than 8 percent body fat. My teeth could be whiter, but they aren't rotting out of my mouth. I think I'm good for a coke drinker. Can't help that others can't control themselves nor keep a hygiene habit.		Edit: One last thing, I use Reddit enough to know for a fact that Coke products posts are likely people just looking for points and not Coke trying to reach like .08% of the worlds population on one internet site by dedicating so much effort into it. Again, go find something better to do for the obese.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ThisTwoFace","name":"t1_cjp36y9","parent_id":"t1_cjp24ew","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1407945976,"created_utc":1407942376}
{"body":"Well, to be honest, I don't really care that much about Coke. It's a terrible nutritionless calorie dense sugar water but I don't care if people want to drink it. That's their choice. It took me about 5 minutes to shop it. What really bothers me is how companies think they can come advertise here and no one is the wiser. Yes, you could report them but there is no way to prove they are working for coke so nothing will happen. Every day we are bombarded by advertisements begging for our dollars. Everywhere we go, everywhere we look, billboards, commercials, radio jingles. I am so sick of having advertisements shoved in my face it makes me want to scream. Reddit is one of the ONLY places you can go on the internet without having banner ads and popups cover your screen. Coke needs to respect the fact that this is not a place for them to get free advertising by cheating the voting system to get their 	product shown. If  Tobacco companies were using the same tactics there would be more outrage but I digress. Also, I dont give a shit about karma, which is why I wont delete this.
