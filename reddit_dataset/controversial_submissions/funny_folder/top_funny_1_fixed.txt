{"body":"> It's clear that you misrepresent the actual violence women are capable of. It's not all just slaps.		I don't see how you construed a single hypothetical scenario in which a woman slaps a man to sweeping generalization about the violence women are capable of.  		>And who are these people exactly?	Where are they?		Unfortunately I didn't save that topic for this scenario.  It's not that hard to believe some people believe in disproportionate retribution.  One trip to TRP or Return Of Kings (assuming that site is even real) indicates that there are some people with very extreme views on gender.		>And if it was a guy and SOMEBODY (not guys of reddit) said that dickhead should be punched you would not bat an eyelid.		Actually, what you just said goes against everything I have said thus far in this topic.  In every post (barring a few in this thread), I have pointed out the double standard of reciprocating violence.  In fact, there was a video a long time back in which a girl hit a man in the face and he pushed her away.  It so happened that she fell into some brittle plate glass, breaking the entry way to the facility.  Given no other context, I don't see anything wrong with his actions.  His shove is a relatively passive reaction to getting hit in the face, and he could not have foreseen the results of his actions with the plate glass.  A shove is also a fairly non-aggressive de-escalation move since it separates the parties physically.		I find it odd though that you selected a post in which I indirectly point out how wrong it was of this woman to beat her boyfriend with a golf club to begin a crusade against some imagined threat.","depth":13,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jokul","name":"t1_cjn9z5j","parent_id":"t1_cjn9840","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1407784319,"created_utc":1407780719}

Much of the reason for the sentencing disparities is damage done. For example, if you look at domestic violence statistics, the amount of actual assaults by men and women aren't drastically different, but the amount of serious injuries is- men tend to cause serious injuries in assaults against women far more than vice versa. 		Intent to do serious harm doesn't hold much weight in court if the means to do that harm aren't present, even in an attack situation, so even if a woman says "I'm going to kill you!" to her male partner, if she's 120 lbs with no real weapons, and he's 250, she wouldn't get as much time for an assault as he would on her.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AG3287","name":"t1_cjn50za","parent_id":"t1_cjn26ir","subreddit":"funny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","created":1407774857,"created_utc":1407771257}

{"body":"War Machine has been involved in multiple domestic violence situations. He is NOTORIOUS for being aggressive and physical with women, including his ex gf Christy. It shouldn't be a surprise because women like bad boys and, regardless of all the obvious signs that he might be dangerous, they still don't learn. This instance was different because he attacked her and an unnamed friend in her home. When she first met him, do you think it was the testosterone injections or the fact that he's paid to fight people that attracted her? This shit happens a lot with women, they think that for some reason they are magical enough to change the bad ass. When it happens, they cannot fathom why it didn't work out. I don't condone either side, but there has to be a true disconnect with rationalizing "nah, it's cool, my lady gets split in half by dudes who are half Clydesdale below the belt." On the flip side, she's thinking "yeah sure, he's been trained as a fighter, has a temper, knows how to break bones, but I'm sure I can change him. I'm just that good."			Porn stars can be faithful, but there's a reason most of those women aren't married. A normal guy doesn't want to see his woman get fucked.
