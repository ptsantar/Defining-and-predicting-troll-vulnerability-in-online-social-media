Then, frankly, you are delusional. Businesses have been doing this ever sense before Latin was a spoken language, spawning the phrase "Caveat emptor" (Let the buyer beware.).		This doesn't even begin to consider the closed source nature of the beast (Windows) and the fact that they have already been proven to be working with the NSA on data collection of the masses.
