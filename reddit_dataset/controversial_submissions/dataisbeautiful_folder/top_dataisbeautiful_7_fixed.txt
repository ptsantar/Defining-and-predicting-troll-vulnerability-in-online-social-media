{"body":"[reallly?](http://i.imgur.com/Q3YKdko.png)		why is this posted here..?  it's not beautiful, not interesting, and it's factually misleading.  this chart uses market cap to compare public businesses to a private business whose valuation is based on debt offerings.. and it just doesn't even *mean* anything, the metric has literally nothing to do with being a car company, it's a measure of the public equity available.  it doesn't even accurately represent the size or value of the company because it doesn't take debt into account, let alone does it say anything about what type of business uber is.  the only 'data' in this article is something a journalism intern that doesn't understand fundamental finance whipped up to make their bullshit article get a couple more clicks.		this entire piece is so absurd and non-sensical it's almost baffling. this chart is the equivalent of one titled "apple isn't a tech company, it's an oil company!" just based on one metric of size that doesn't take industry or anything relevant into account at all.		get.this.shit.out.of.here.","depth":0,"score":75,"ups":75,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zachattack82","name":"t1_cmo2wy8","parent_id":"t3_2ok5ww","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1418013979,"created_utc":1417985179}

{"body":"That isn't really a fair comparison. In many cities taxi services have to deal with a lot more regulation like additional insurance, etc. which at least partially explain the higher prices.

{"body":"I see.  Now for the additional insurance, is it possible that may be a reputation thing?  I mean I've been in two hit and runs in my life both with taxis.  Coincidence?  Maybe but probably not because a lot of them drive like maniacs.  Maybe it isn't fair that they pay higher insurance but hey, I don't think it's fair that I pay more for  insurance because I'm still fairly young in the eyes of the insurance companies.  That is pure reputation working against me.  Maybe it's the Taxi companies that need to adjust to this game changing business model.  I'm sure it's much more complex than that but it's just a thought.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"trashcantreasure","name":"t1_cmocq1t","parent_id":"t1_cmo5xsp","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1418034826,"created_utc":1418006026}

{"body":"Uber/Lyft are a lot more than just a "car company" or just disrupting the Taxi service.		Look at the Nest...you think their value was a fantastic looking ThermoStat??? It was one of the last areas where Google didn't have the grubby little hands on your data.		Uber/Lyft are competing with Taxi services now...but a goldmine for advertising & data.  Some taxis have ads now, but nowhere as sophisticated; nor do taxi cabs collect constant data one you (i.e. Uber allowing passengers to play DJ with Spotify).		In a few years, when driver-less cars come to fruition a service like Uber/Lyft, are very well positioned to turn the market share/brand into a country-wide fleet of vehicle services (not just people...delivering groceries, packages etc.) all while selling you ads and collecting data on you.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bartczernicki","name":"t1_cmo31n8","parent_id":"t3_2ok5ww","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1418014201,"created_utc":1417985401}

{"body":"In Canada we will likely never experience any service even remotely like this. The " Motor Carrier Division" licenses taxis and busses and is basically run by the taxi companies. It's next to impossible to legally get into this market. It's all in the name of public safety but it's a mafia as strong as any. A legal mafia at that. As a result we have unaffordable service  that is staffed by the shittiest drivers on the road. You can almost guarantee to not be able to get a ride when it's needed the most ( last call, after concerts or sport events) and no one trusts the drivers. If you have a friend who has a few too many and that friend is female you'd NEVER put them in a taxi alone. You just know it is too dangerous for them.
