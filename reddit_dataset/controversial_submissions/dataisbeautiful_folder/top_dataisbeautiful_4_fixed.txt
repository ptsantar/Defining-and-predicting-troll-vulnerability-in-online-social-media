A country/society misses out on those skilled workers if education isn't free.		> They're making an assumption that college education equals a job		This is not the assumption they are making. They assume that people with a job pay more taxes if they have a college degree. I agree with you, it only works under the assumption that most people generally have a job.		> What they're forgetting is the decreased value of a degree if everyone has one.		This always happens when there is a low demand and a high supply of anything. It doesn't have much to do with free education.

Because it was pretty obvious from Obama's first win that it would be 8 years before anyone could really challenge.  The sad part of all this for GOP is that they literally have so many stupid, socially conservative, right-wing voters who will support the Trump/Cruz campaigns such that swing voters will be compelled to vote democratically.  This is the election of our lifetime.  The two most popular candidates are juxtaposed.  And most people want neither.

Um, have you ever talked to a student?  I can guarantee that at least half never think about this.  The thought process pretty much goes like, "Hmm, should I go to college?  Literally everyone around me is saying that I should, and I'll be broke if I don't.  Guess I have to.  That shit's expensive so.  Guess I need to take out some loans."		High school students have it shoved down their throat so much that the NEED to go to college, that the cost of school is probably the least important criteria to them.  They're 17 when they're making this decision.  They've never worked more than a part time job, which was all disposable income.  They have no idea what working a full time job is like.  They have no idea what paying rent or other large bills is like.  They have no experience to actually gauge what paying off that kind of debt will be like.  They are completely unequipped with the necessary knowledge and experience to accurately make the decision of whether or not they want to take on that kind of debt, and whether or not it will be worth it.		Not to mention that with the rate at which tuition increases, your last semester will cost WAY more than your first semester.  Even if you are taking the cost into account, school is going to be way more expensive than you anticipated.

I think without my degree or any higher education I'd be making significantly less. Probably somewhere around 30k Max- probably in a call center. The reality of degrees is even Wal-Mart wants their assistant and store managers to have at least BAs - although there are exceptions to that (I worked in the bakery there full time during college). But I might do things differently if I could go back- maybe look at other countries/ other states to see if any of their programs are cheaper. I can say 100% I would rather pay slightly more in taxes (for example) until the day I retire than have taken out these loans.

{"body":"Thank you. Your experience is very interesting and it seems like you did make the right choice. There are other routes to get a free education that many people do not think of. For instance, I joined the Air Force, served my four years and used the GI Bill to go to a highly accredited university in California for free plus money for living expenses and books. I graduated a few months ago with a double major in economics and statistics and a minor in management. I would not have been able to complete all that without the living assistance which allowed me to focus on my studies and extract as much value from my GI bill as possible. I completed my general education while serving so I still have enough time on my GI Bill to get my masters paid for also which I plan to complete in a year or two.

But back to the topic  not everyone is able to go the military route- whether due to physical/medical limitations or otherwise. I might join the guard if I could go back in time though. A girl I met in college was having a large portion of her college paid by the guard but I didn't even know that was an option when I was in highschool. I think first gen college students (like myself) face some greater obstacles since we didn't know all the options, we didn't have anyone that had done it before to help, and where I grew up, in a very rural area, there weren't any resources to help me navigate. That's part of the problem IMO- not all kids get the same access to resources. There's no highschool class that teaches kids what their options are or the actual impact of loans. And 17 is a tough age to expect kids to figure out their lives with no guidance.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Redditurtle","name":"t1_d04oy0k","parent_id":"t1_d04mvnz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1455844642,"created_utc":1455815842}

{"body":"You listed four articles sourcing the same four economists who have had direct professional involvement with either Bill or Hillary Clinton and never, not once, provided any supporting evidence for their encompassing objections. Friedman's paper has been torn apart, rightfully so, especially given that a corporate transaction tax is unprecedented in this size of market and thus there's very little supporting or dissenting statistical evidence available anywhere. The numbers in his paper are optimistic at best assessment and ludicrous at an honest one; especially given the aforementioned uncertainty surrounding this CTT. The irony, though, is that in no way, shape, or form do they posit to even assess whether these numbers indicate feasibility of the tax and spending plans proposed by the Sanders campaign. They are an overly optimistic assessment of economic growth put forth by a Bernie Sanders supporter; not a statistical analysis of the feasibility of the tax plan itself. And yet, Sanders' opposition has taken critique of that paper and blindly warped it into a condemnation of his entire financial proposal, which isn't surprising, but also isn't accurate. We don't need 4.5% annual GDP growth to curb or eliminate the cost of tuition through a CTT, we don't need median household income to rise 50% in order to expand social security and remove the income cap on its tax; and we most definitely don't need those things for the most important tenet of the Sanders campaign, a mentality change away from the American oligarchy/corporatocracy. If we're realistic for just a moment, we're all aware that the wide-sweeping changes proposed by each campaign aren't possible. Being president is about driving ideology from the bully pulpit; and no member of this election has stuck as true to their ideology or fought as hard for middle-class America as Bernie Sanders. Somehow people think the size of Dutch nations is what allows them to subsidize healthcare and education; as though GDPs aren't commensurate to size, or as though America isn't missing billions of tax revenue dollars parked offshore and shoved through loopholes.

Why does he say "wealthy" when he means all of us? To make you angry. To make you feel like they somehow stole something from you. Hatred is a powerful tool. It's an avenue to power that socialists have used over and over and over again. The truth of the matter is he's going to tax YOU.

{"body":"In the 40s and 50s we had massive government expenditure due to the Second World War, which artificially inflated the job market and economic growth. The 60s, 70s and 80s saw a fluctuating economy that was intensely unstable. Reagan wasn't perfect, but the economy did well under his administration. Trickle down isn't perfect, but it's worked vastly better than trickle up. The current 20% highest income earners pay for 84% of the income taxes in this nation. The tax burden definitely has not moved to the poor. Don't get me wrong, I still fully support closing tax loopholes, taxing corporations smarter and preventing tax evasion, but it's a fallacy to say the middle and upper class aren't pulling their weight in taxes. When you factor in all the benefits and subsidies lower class families receive, the gap becomes more clear. The reason we have little to show for our money despite all the taxes being collected has to do with incompetent management of assets and policy in the government, not the failure of trickle-down economics.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jonybagodonuts","name":"t1_d03vial","parent_id":"t1_d03uvfh","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1455782863,"created_utc":1455754063}

Thing is, the two scenarios couldn't be more different. The US *issues* the USD, Greece *shares* it's currency.

It's for this reason that Japan is never denied yen by markets. Why balancing the budget is not something issuers do, or even should do.

While those aren't bad diplomas to have, it's not much more than many companies offer as on the job training. In terms of 4-year university grads, Canada is tied for 7th, behind a lot of other countries like the US, UK, Australia, Norway and others. (see Table A1.1a, here - http://www.oecd.org/edu/Education-at-a-Glance-2014.pdf and compare "Type A tertiary education" - the equivalent of longer university programs only - The USA is tied for 2nd place by that measure, only behind Norway and tied with Israel) 		The other question is figuring out what value colleges actually offer. Expensive private colleges aren't just providing education; they're offering a way to buy your way into exclusive social networks as well, and having a high sticker price is the whole way of guaranteeing that. You simply can't replicate that value from a free college system - it's also pretty clear that's not a value you'd want to replicate either. But it would boost the number of students attending those colleges who can afford it even if they have no interest in learning anything, since regardless of the education being offered the social network value is there.","depth":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"fencerman","name":"t1_d03qtcc","parent_id":"t3_46aooq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1455775796,"created_utc":1455746996}

The article does not outline the processes that Germany, Sweden, Norway and Finland allow for "free" college and strict class division that results from it.  In Germany you (or your grades) decide after age 10 which school you end up in and once you make that decision - it will take some effort to climb up: 		Hauptschule - The main aim of Hauptschulen is to offer young students with average grades or below, most of whom will not attend a university, an adequate general academic education.  From my experience, this school is limited to blue color workers and it takes real effort to step up and end up in a university.		Realschule - school level between Hauptschule and Gymnasium which prepares its students for more technical jobs.  After graduating from Realschule, good students are allowed to attend a professional Gymnasium or a general-education Gymnasium. They can also attend a Berufskollege or do an apprenticeship.  		Gymnasium - The gymnasium is a secondary school which prepares the student for higher education at a university. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students, who are sifted out at about the age of 10–13. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a gymnasium often study Latin and Ancient Greek.  Some gymnasiums provide general education, others have a specific focus. 		I've been to all three schools and can attest that it is not pleasant to be pigeonholed in a tier and it is something that I would detest if it were here in USA.  On the other hand free tuition under such system makes sense since you have specific barriers who gets into college.

You can't apply the idea of a personal loan to that is national spending. We've essentially written an IOU to ourselves, and other countries have the option to bet on whether we repay it or not. But you can't call in a national debt against an economic leader; it'll trash the global economy. The worst thing that could possibly happen is that that our money exchanges at a worse rate than before, but then that means that the debt (all of it listed in USD, mind you) actually becomes easier for us to pay off, and has the added bonus of making domestic manufacturing cheaper, thus bringing more jobs home.			To be quite honest, I'm not at all concerned about the prospect of inflation. We have a long way to go before anyone cries foul on our spending.

The irony is that the US education system is actually frowned upon in the German speaking area of Europe, where university is for free, for having too many university students. The reasons is that universities in Germany are far more difficult than an average US university and a smaller portion of people go to uni. Also most employers expect you to have a relevant degree, even if you go to a very good uni, e.g. a bank won't hire someone with a degree in history or biology. University is only for the best people and people that want jobs that specifically require uni level education. Uni degrees aren't used to simply check a box with employers. Therefore a lot of people in Europe don't take it seriously if Americans are university educated (unless it's a top uni) especially when they studied something exotic / unrelated to their job. People also think it's strange that in the US normal office workers have university degrees. E.g. why would someone that work as a bank clerk have a degree in literature or psychology? You are actually far better off in Germany with an apprenticeship and relevant work experience.		So the whole idea of the US sending even more people to uni seems absurd to most people in countries with free universities.

There are so many problems with this I shouldn't even need to comment. If your average person pays more in taxes plus health insurance premiums and copays in the USA than in Sweden or some other sane country, then you have to look at where the money is going.

{"body":"This article leaves out really important points to consider. For example, it lists South Korea as a country where most people go to college, then cleverly discusses the way that Canada finances its tuition (much like US). In Korea, public colleges are substantially cheaper than your average state school, so that's just wrong. Furthermore, there are important cultural implications to consider. In Korea, it is assumed that the parents will finance the education, unlike in the US where the responsibility is on the student. Additionally, students in Korea are expected to live at home, not just while they're at college, but also for the first couple of years in the work force. The cultural climate is very different for college students in the US who frequently have to work while going to school (something almost no one in Korea does) just to make ends meet or make up for the gap between loan allowance and cost of tuition. American students are also expected to leave home, especially since not everyone's parents live near a college, although this is increasingly harder and harder. 		I can't speak for the other countries listed here, but I can guarantee that there are massive considerations missing. I can only speak for Korea, where I live, and I can tell you that I have never met a Korean who is personally responsible for his or her loans. Furthermore, when I explain that I have to work two extra jobs here to pay off my $40k+ in loans for attending my state's public university for 3.5 years, Koreans stare at me in horror and ask how this can possibly be true in America.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"neco23","name":"t1_d041lmx","parent_id":"t3_46aooq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1455792624,"created_utc":1455763824}

{"body":"How about instead of paying for tuition completely, the government just puts the money up for you to go to college, you graduate, then you get 4 years to pay it back with no interest. Anything left over you pay back with interest from then on out.This way no one has to pay for other peoples schooling and on the other side no one gets trapped in a loan. Giving them 4 years no interest after they should have joined the work force should be plenty of time to pay off what they owe.This will also prevent the public from subsidizing people going to college who just want to go for the experience or without a plan to join the work force after graduation. If we offered outright free college that never needed paying back were gonna see a lot of wasted money.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TenEightToTenTen","name":"t1_d03ypg6","parent_id":"t3_46aooq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1455788043,"created_utc":1455759243}
{"body":"You already pay for other people's schooling, it's called K-12 public education.		And no, 4 years is not enough, even without interest. Let's say a new graduate gets a decent entry level job and makes 50,000 a year, but has 50,000 in debt. 50,000 income puts him in the 25% tax bracket, he also pays 8 % payroll tax, and lets assume a 15% tax for sales tax, state tax, local tax, etc. After tax his income is only 24,000. Because he probably gets some deductions, lets be generous and say 30,000. If he spends 20% of that on loans, that's 6,000 a year. After 4 years he has put 24,000 toward his 50,000 loan and still owes 26,000 when interest kicks in. Lets assume 5% interest, still paying 6,000 a year. it will take him about 6 more years to pay it off, total cost about 55000 dollars. Not a terrible amount of extra interest, but his interest rate might be higher than 5% (6.8% is common for student loans) and I'm not even considering the cost of housing, transportation, food, utilities, etc. If he gets married and has children during this time his expenses will go up by a lot (it costs about 200,000 dollars to raise a kid from 0 - 18). So no, 4 years with no interest is not enough.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"borrax","name":"t1_d049597","parent_id":"t1_d03ypg6","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1455806953,"created_utc":1455778153}
