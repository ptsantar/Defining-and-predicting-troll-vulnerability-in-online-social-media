That means that someone thought that 10% of Billy's company is worth $100. So ... 100% of Billy's company can be thought to be valued at $1,000.		You can play all kinds of trickery too.

On the bright side, Facebook and whatsapp are both revolutionary tools that draw critical attention to worthy causes, or allow for freedom of Communication in oppressed nations. While it's a sad reality that more money isn't given to humanist causes, if donations alone could change the world and solve problems of inequality on a global scale, you would think that we would have seen far more progress... I would argue that technology, specifically the internet and social media tech has profoundly altered the human rights landscape and shed tremendous light on the disadvantaged, oppressed and besieged, while doing more to hold corrupt leaders and organizations in check than we have ever seen before. 		Facebook, Twitter and whatsapp, and the hundreds of children tech platforms stemming from them are the weapons that are required for the ultimate class conflict to begin, and while it may or may not lead to the Marxist "classless" utopia, I do believe that the peoples of the world, of armed with full access to knowledge and instant communication long enough, will fully realize the class imbalances and will institutions will begin to crumble at exponential rates. 		It's for this long-winded reason that I don't care about the cost of whatsapp vs aid money.
