{"body":"Yeah, I went through this in college.  I found it to be partly a self reinforcing cycle.  The more burnt out I got, the longer it took me to get things done, the more stressed I was to get everything I needed to get done done, cue catch-22 (though I wasn't that self-aware at the time).  I was later found to have basically ptsd-lite, and gained ~50lbs in ~3 or so years (which thank god, I'm nearly done working off now).		So I don't know who you are, or what exactly you're situation is, and I'm just a guy who made it through sitting in his bed at 12.30 in the morning that saw this message come in.  But here are a few things that I wish someone would have told me years ago, instead of dealing with all the shit I did to myself, in increasing order of importance.		1) First things first, and second things never.  This mantra got me through a lot.  If you're already in grad school, I expect that you already have a pretty good way of dealing with the daily shit, but I swear, that mantra got me through a ton.  Not stressing over thing #2, until thing #1 is done takes a lot off your back, you can only do one thing at a time after all.		2) I usually found that if I just said fuck it, I'm going to bed at 4 or 5 instead of 6, even if it meant turning in something slightly worse, overall resulted in me doing better, simply because the extra sleep and less stress meant my productive hours ended up being better.  You obviously can't do this too much, but I found that by never doing it, I was never giving myself a chance to catch up.  And constantly doing 6am nights, night after night meant I was forever tired.  That one day of 4 extra hours of sleep and a possible bad grade is worth its weight in gold, so long as you don't get yourself into an inescapable situation.		3) Working 24 / 7 isn't a life worth living, and doing it forever isn't possible, or manly or okay.  Your mind is a muscle, and it needs breaks, and it doesn't matter where they come from.  It can be worth it to fuck something trivial up, in order to get truly carefree time in.		4) If you're the type of person that gets stress relief from exercise, do it.  		4.b)  Buying a musical instrument (or other emotionally expressive hobby) can be an amazing stress relief.  you don't even have to play it	4.c) Alcohol, ritalin, and all other psychoactives are detrimental, because they all inevitably have recovery periods that last longer than the helpful periods, and you are currently time constrained.		5) Your time at grad school is finite.  Once you graduate, especially after you land your first job, you really will have all the time in the world.  You just have to make it to that finish line.		6) It doesn't matter WHEN you get to that finish line.  When you enter the private sector, all your future resumes / applications / etc, are just going to ask: do you have X degree?  They don't care if it took you 1 year or 7.  Take a year off.  There was literally a night where I realized I was no longer just jokingly contemplating suicide back in 2008, and I said to myself, fuck it, if its this bad, then I'm taking a year off from school.  I know I can pull it off in a way that won't hurt me academically (except the time frame, which is turns out DOES NOT MATTER to future employers, I wish so badly someone had told me that), and after that, I don't care what the fuck happens.  It was the best decision I ever made.  It wasn't some glorious trip where I traveled across europe or something, most of it was seemingly boring, but it gave me the time I needed to pull myself back together.  No employer I have ever had has ever even noticed the year missing in college, but to me it turned my life around.   And when I came back, everything was soooooo much easier, because I was actually at (almost) 100% .		7) It doesn't matter HOW you get to that finish line.  When you enter the private sector, no one cares about your grades (unless you have nothing else interesting to talk about).  Again, all they care is that you can check the mark off that says you have the degree.  So it doesn't matter what your grades are, or how long it takes you to get there, so long as you can get there.			-----------------			Because of 6 & 7, you have more freedom than you think.  And because of the catch-22 mentioned before, its probably not actually as bad as it seems like, because your brain is running on half empty at the moment, which causes that catch-22, which keeps you up to 6am, which mounts the work you have to do........		Anyway, my point is, so long as you don't get do anything irreversible, and so long as you can acquire bread to eat tomorrow, chances are there is a way to go forward, that is more peaceful and relaxed than the path your on now.  Its turning the ship in that direction that's going to be hard the next few months, but you can make it.  You only have to crawl over the finish line.  You'll be surprised too how fast you'll bounce back once you can get the pressure off your shoulders.  Its just a muscle, like any other, and it sounds like you're trying to lift a weight with a pulled bicep.		I'll try and review this post in the morning, hopefully it was somewhat coherent (I'm about to fall asleep), but I hope it helps.  And feel free to im me whenever.				---------------		Next morning review:  I stand by everything I said here, but want to make a special point for the people commenting below from undergrad.   While point #7 is still true, it was originally written for the person in grad school.  If you're coming out of undergrad, your grades will still (unfortuantely) matter, after graduation.  What's important to understand (and what you likely haven't been told yet) is exactly how they matter.  They are important, but they are not some all important all knowing evaluation of your total potential post-college.  They are one of multiple possible indicators to future employers that you will be good at the job, and a way to get past the people in HR to get the interview.		So ignoring point #7 for a moment, the remaining 6 points above are all about techniques for IMPROVING your grades, and the fact that if you can restore sleep and stress-relief to your life, your grades can go up too.  I just want to restate that.		So that said, let's talk about how your grades are used post college.  Firstly, you are only going to be asked about them for your first job (if even then).  After that, you will never need to talk about them ever again.  The important thing is just to get that first job by any means necessary, and your grades will help with that.  		If your grades aren't great, you leave them off your resume when you apply to your first job, or you put your major-specific GPA.  The company you're applying to may ask for them anyway, so they are still important, and the better they are, the better.  They're more important if the HR department mandates a minimum gpa for fresh out of college grads, but I can't tell you how likely that is in your industry (in computer science, its on the way out.  In academia and research, its really important)		That said, many employers are just looking to see that you will be good at the job once you are hired.  You know what trumps grades?  Experience.  Project teams, internships, research, personal projects, volunteering, etc (and the people you meet doing these things / your friends in your major).  		And you know what's really great about experience?  If they're related to your field, then you'll spend the entire interview talking about this, instead of your grades and classes.  		And you know what's even better than that?  Experience can be gained during a semester or year off.  Too burned out?  #6 still applies to you, you can take a year off, and come back refreshed.  And if you can say over that break you did something related to your future job, chances are, you've actually massively improved your potential future job search, way more so than even if you had stayed and magically gotten better grades, because now you can talk to employers about your knowledge in the field already.  And you probably will get better grades when you get back, because you'll be refreshed and be more knowledgeable about your field, and will have had time to reevaluate and plan for your return and how you're going to be better when you get back.  Not to mention your new friends in the industry.		So in short, don't shirk your grades, but hopefully this post will help get you some balance back in your life, which will in turn improve your grades.  A .1 GPA difference isn't going to matter much (unless its a 2.9 vs 3.0), but those extra few hours of sleep will.  And if you're fighting a tougher battle than that?  Take time off.  Future employers won't know, won't care, and you'll come back refreshed, and possibly with relevant work experience that they may very well care more about than your grades.","depth":4,"score":217,"ups":217,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"ep1032","name":"t1_cmccvyl","parent_id":"t1_cmcc7gb","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1416922554,"created_utc":1416893754}

I know I can pull it off in a way that won't hurt me academically (except the time frame, which is turns out DOES NOT MATTER to future employers, I wish so badly someone had told me that), and after that, I don't care what the fuck happens. It was the best decision I ever made. It wasn't some glorious trip where I traveled across europe or something, most of it was seemingly boring, but it gave me the time I needed to pull myself back together. No employer I have ever had has ever even noticed the year missing in college, but to me it turned my life around. And when I came back, everything was soooooo much easier, because I was actually at (almost) 100% 			I also did the year off, 2.9 semesters in again and im running out of motivation again with maxed out stress again.

The colors on the bars don't add anything to the graph. Be ruthless in any element in your visualization. If it doesn't help your story, it doesn't belong.		2. Sort the bars from highest to lowest, from left to right. While you can tell from the numbers atop the bars, it's an extra mental hop to find the ranking of them. With the bars sorted, you can probably even get away without the values labeled. 		3. Consider reducing the amount of space between the bars. This is not critical, especially if you order the bars by rank.		4. This is nitpicky, but even the underline of the chart title is not necessary. There's not a paragraph text or other text close to it for it to be underline emphasized.		5. Finally, embed the source of your data as a caption on the graphic, and attribution (to yourself).

Or I would have asked the students to what extent those individual issues you focused on affected their lives, as their own separate question. 		You're on the right track.

It gives them this explosion of books, essays, material, and -forces- them into essentially learning them without actually understanding any of it. Not too mention the pressure other children put on with the whole 'being accepted' thing. Bullying plays a good factor in this area. Children that usually simply cannot cope with so much information (not stupid, just simply cannot comprehend or bare this much stress) are almost immediatly labelled stupid by teachers and other kids then start mimicking the way the teachers behave around those certain students.
