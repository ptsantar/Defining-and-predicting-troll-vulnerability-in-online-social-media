{"body":"Uuuuugh. I'm sorry, but this is such a poorly-done rework and an obvious stab for pageviews. All OP did was take the figures from [here](https://blog.compete.com/2016/02/18/powerball-jackpot/), rework them slightly, and introduce one new error with the first graph^1. None of the new graphs even introduce different ways of looking at the data, and the new presentation isn't *that* much better than the old one.		I downvoted this post because I dislike behavior like this. This is not contributing to the community.		^1 The unique visitor and average stay lines should be reversed","depth":0,"score":146,"ups":146,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rhiever","name":"t1_d0frpfc","parent_id":"t3_47uefq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1456610510,"created_utc":1456581710}
