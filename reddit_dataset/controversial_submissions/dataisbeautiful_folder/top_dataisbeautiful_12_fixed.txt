Walker was decent, but it was a typical sequel. Try to cash in on the success of the first with a cheaper cast and shallow plot.		The third movie was the worst of all of them. Not only did you loose the characters that made the movies what they were, the whole drift thing and failed attempt to include the US Muscle vs Euro car thing just fell flat. 		The fourth movie was a large portion of the fans super happy to have walker and diesel back. Here we're back to the same characters, but with the way the first and second movie ended, its hard to really go back to that same formula without it feeling shallow or forced. So they took the characters that made the first movie, with some additions from 2 and 3, and came up with a way to keep the cars and the sex but make the plot driven by a different situation. They made lots of throwbacks to the original formula and it worked.		The fifth, sixth and now seventh was really just continuing the same character/situation based storylines with the same cars and sex appeal as the fourth movie, with some additions to the good/bad guys to make things interesting.		Ultimately, 1,4,5,6 and 7 were all centered around the Walker/Diesel dynamic with everyone else a part of that dynamic.
