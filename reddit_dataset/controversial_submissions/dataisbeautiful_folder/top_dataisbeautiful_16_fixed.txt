{"body":"okay for any correlation you can produce a correlation coefficient. 		The correlation coefficient is computed by taking the sum of the products of the z-scores for each data set and then dividing that entire sum by n-1 where n is the number of data points. The z-score is computed by taking the obtained value, subtracting the expected value(which is the mean of the data set) and then dividing it by the std. deviation of the data set. 		This cannot work with qualitative variables since they take no value. Therefore qualitative variables cannot be part of a correlation.		But ignoring that let us go to definitions.		According to Berkely: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm		Correlation is defined as "A measure of linear association between two (ordered) lists. Two variables can be strongly correlated without having any causal relationship, and two variables can have a causal relationship and yet be uncorrelated."		An association is defined as "Two variables are associated if some of the variability of one can be accounted for by the other. In a scatterplot of the two variables, if the scatter in the values of the variable plotted on the vertical axis is smaller in narrow ranges of the variable plotted on the horizontal axis (i.e., in vertical "slices") than it is overall, the two variables are associated."		A scatter plot is defined as "A scatterplot is a way to visualize bivariate data. A scatterplot is a plot of pairs of measurements on a collection of "individuals" (which need not be people)"		As you can see scatter plots require measurement, therefore associations can only be between quantifiable variables, and thus correlation is between quantifiable variables only.			Correlation is between two sets of random variables. Random variables must take a quantity. Therefore Correlation can only be between quantitative variables.			For your example, that is not a correlation. The two things (gender and hair length) are related, but you cannot correlate them. You cannot create a linear association between gender and hair length and thus cannot create a correlation. You have just called it a correlation without proving how it is so.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alien122","name":"t1_clf8gov","parent_id":"t1_clf79hk","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1413888509,"created_utc":1413859709}
{"body":"Okay, here is why it is a correlation:		Definitions (aka general language):		[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/correlation): "mutual relation of two or more things, parts, etc. or in statistics, the degree to which two or more attributes or measurements on the same group of elements show a tendency to vary together."		[Miriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/correlation): "a relation existing between phenomena or things or between mathematical or statistical variables which tend to vary, be associated, or occur together in a way not expected on the basis of chance alone."		Statistically: 		There are many different types of correlation coefficients...not just one. These are used for various types of data. 		[Here](http://jalt.org/test/bro_12.htm) is a link that has a table of different types of correlation coefficients and describes when they are used. As you can see, some of them are used for nominal or dichotomous variables. 		[Here](http://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/math/edrm611/edrm13.htm) is another link that describes them as well. 		For example, "The point-biserial correlation coefficient, referred to as rpb, is a special case of Pearson in which one variable is quantitative and the other variable is dichotomous and nominal."		[Here is the wikipedia link on the point-biserial correlation coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-biserial_correlation_coefficient) It states that "The point biserial correlation coefficient (rpb) is a correlation coefficient used when one variable (e.g. Y) is dichotomous; Y can either be "naturally" dichotomous, **like gender**, or an artificially dichotomized variable."		In cases where a variable is nominal, numbers are assigned to the variable. So in my example of gender v hair length, males = 0, females = 1. The numbers assigned do not matter at all whatsoever because you are looking at the relationship of the data, not the raw numbers. This could be used to create a scatter plot. And linear association couple be developed from such a plot.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RashaGirl","name":"t1_clg5sdr","parent_id":"t1_clf8gov","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1413970618,"created_utc":1413941818}
{"body":"So in point-biserial they convert the qualitative variable into two distinct parts to produce a linear relationship. 		I'll concede I jumped the gun on calling your example not a correlation. And furthermore saying that all qualitative data can't be correlated.		However the data that was presented is not dichotomous, so even with the point-biserial correlation coefficient the data presented could not be correlated.		But for this data wouldn't a chi-square test for association be used instead? It wouldn't make sense to use point-biserial since there are much more than just two parts in the non-quantitative variable.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alien122","name":"t1_clg675b","parent_id":"t1_clg5sdr","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1413971391,"created_utc":1413942591}

{"body":"Hi all, author here.  I wish to clear up some confusions.		* This was actually done back in 2008.  I'm glad you like it though!	* It uses a SAT range with a max score of 1600.  ACT scores are converted to SAT scores using the table provided by the CollegeBoard.	* The data was collected not by Facebook "likes" but by the most popular "Favorite music".  I.e., if someone has signed up with their .edu email address AND has listed a "favorite music", they are counted.		* The data becomes much more clear when you drill down through the "music" and "schools" pages:	  > * http://musicthatmakesyoudumb.virgil.gr/music.php	  > * http://musicthatmakesyoudumb.virgil.gr/schools.php	  > * http://musicthatmakesyoudumb.virgil.gr/musicdetails.php?music=Radiohead		* There are two "sorted" visualizations available.  They are here:	  > * http://musicthatmakesyoudumb.virgil.gr/mtmydGenreLarge.png	  > * http://musicthatmakesyoudumb.virgil.gr/mtmydStaircaseLarge.png		* The width of the "pills" on the visualizations is the standard error.		* As no one was surveyed, there is no survey bias.  There is a bias that anyone who doesn't list their "favorite music" at a school is not counted.  Also, the sample size here is ridiculously large.  You had to be in the top 10 "favorite musics" for at least 10 different schools.		* As for the entries themselves, they are what Facebook users themselves listed as their favorite music.  I had no control over this.  Blame the unwashed collegiate masses.	* Facebook used to publish aggregated data for the most popular "Favorite Musics" and "Favorite Books" for each network.  After the release of this study in 2008 Facebook stopped making it available.  Lame.	* Finally, there is a FAQ. http://virgil.gr/44		(Sorry for the site not working most of the day.

{"body":"Phish, the Beatles, and Bob Dylan are listened to by those who get higher scores?  All of those acts are terrible.  No young person should listen to any of them.

The whiter and lamer you go for acts, the higher the scores.)		Classical listeners are among the dumbest of people?  Blink 182 listeners are not the smartest of all?  Fuck this.  Blink 182 is the greatest fun pop rock band of all time.		This list stinks.		As an aside, it is interesting that Beck's listeners score so high when he is a fucking moron.
