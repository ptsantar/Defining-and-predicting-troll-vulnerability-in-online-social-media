{"body":"There's an easy way to eliminate the marginal remaining involuntary pay gap, as well as get more women hired in lucrative fields; paid maternal AND paternal leave. That way, employers don't have an economic incentive to not hire women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, because men expecting a child will take the same leave as women. This also shifts cultural perceptions away from "women should be primary child-rearers" and "fathers are not as important to a child as mothers," gender stereotypes that hurt everyone and help no one.

{"body":"Paternal leave does exist under the FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act). Employers have to give 12 weeks to all employees expecting a birth or new child, mothers and fathers alike. The problem is that the leave isn't always paid (that depends on the employer) so often only one parent will take the leave. Usually the mother, for obvious reasons.		Another huge issue is the perception of leaves, and an employee's awareness of their rights. It's far more acceptable in society for a pregnant woman to take the leave, rather than an expectant father. Say a father asks, and their boss pushes back.

Anecdotally, I've known women who quit their jobs right before their _unpaid_ maternity leave expired.

Everyone makes trade-offs when choosing which jobs they work. Often, women trade money for convenience: working around school schedules, keeping evenings and weekends free, the ability to leave work in an emergency and still have a job tomorrow. A promotion which infringes upon those things may be turned down.		When an adult family member becomes sick or injured, women are more likely to become their caregiver than men are. So even once children are grown and out of the house, many women are expected to then fill a similar role for their parents or siblings.		I think paid parental leave helps. I think flexible work schedules help. I think a better expectation from employers that family is more important than work will help. I think 40h work weeks will help.		But with all that, the gap may not close if women _choose_ to take more of the intangible benefits than men choose to.

{"body":"bit late to the party here, but are you arguing that society molds women into choosing these options more that men? 		Consider this, a family decides to have a baby. Wife takes her unpaid maternity leave. This forces the husband to either get another job/ promotion to support his new family and his pregnant wife physically can't. No you might say that the wife can work up to her last trimester and they save or she can even get a part time job maybe waitress or cashier work. I can tell you as a manager, no one would hire a pregnant women simply because she will leave in the immediate future to have her child. Now as the employer we have just spent countless man hours, (30 - 40 in my restaurant per trainee) to train an employee that we know will leave. We will have to do the same for her replacement. And yes her job will be there when she get back. which we will have to retrain her on or at least bring her up to par again,  but why go though hassle when you can just tell her to come back after the baby and work unimpeded. 		Now back to the husband. As his wife probably wont have a job for the next few months hes now forced to make it work. Its gonna suck for him but who cares, hes got a family to take care of. So he gets used to it. 		When the baby comes the husband is already used to supporting the household on his own. The wife can make the choice to go back to work, but there is nothing forcing her to at this point. It easy to see why they would willingly choose to stay with their child instead of returning to work. And unless she loves her job there is no reason to go back. So that leaves only the women that want a career left. Of course they are going to be behind in salary. They just missed months of work while others are putting in their time to advance their own careers. You cant give the lady that just came back from leave a promotion or a raise she wasn't here to earn it. Now is she wants to bust her ass to catch up with everyone else that's on her.

{"body":">Taxpayers are already forced to subsidize practically everything everyone does. That's the entire point of taxes. People across the country driving on a road? You're paying for that road, in part.		Incorrect.  "Practically everything that everyone does" is not subsidized by taxpayers.  Most funding for roads in the various states comes from gasoline taxes paid for by drivers within the state in which the road is being built/maintained.  These taxes are essentially user fees that mostly ensure that the people who use roads the most pay the most for the maintenance of those roads.		It's also a false equivalence to compare paying taxes for roads with paying taxes to pay for maternity and paternity leave.  Why not just have everyone pay 100% taxes and have all goods and services provided by the government?  Following your logic that would be both appropriate and justified.		>Even before the ACA, hospitals were legally forbidden from denying care, so if someone comes in, gets treated, and can't pay? Taxpayers foot the bill.		It's true that taxpayers foot SOME of the bill for these people, but they don't foot all of the bill.  Some of the bill is paid for in the form of higher health insurance premiums as hospitals are forced to raise their fees to compensate for those who cannot/do not pay.		>More than that, it has been shown over and over and over that the earlier we give the money to those who need it, the less we actually have to give.

{"body":"In game theory and economics, they use the ever elusive [utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility). An important point is that monetary compensation and utility are not necessarily aligned 1:1.		A common example is the ultimatum game, with the following rules. Player 1 is given $100 and the task of choosing how to divide the money. Player 2 then has the ability to either accept the offer or refuse it. If Player 2 accepts, both people get the payoff determined by Player 1. If Player 2 refuses, then nobody gets anything.		If money and utility were 1:1, then the obvious strategy for Player 1 is to split it $99/$1 in their favor. The obvious strategy of Player 2 is to accept because $1 is better than $0. It doesn't take much to see that this is not how it plays out at all. To Player 2, fairness and even punishing Player 1 for violating fairness has a greater utility than $1. Sequential playing of this game tends towards a 50/50 split as an optimal strategy. 		People, as obvious and evidenced by readers of this sub, like easy numbers. It's much easier to just use the dollar amount versus the harder to nail down and subjective concept of utility. This is also seen in things like taxation. People look at the amount of money paid versus the utility. Due to the diminishing marginal utility of money, the more money you have, the less utility each dollar contributes. A flat tax then is completely unfair as the $100 to feed your children is worth significantly more utility than the $100 used to pay maintenance on your third yacht.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"xmod2","name":"t1_cqm63em","parent_id":"t1_cqm4g3j","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429837481,"created_utc":1429808681}

Exactly, because labor force discontinuity means lower lifetime total earnings, the investment in skills it takes to join certain professions has a lower pay off.

Longer, paid parental leave solves that. It means there is less of a penalty for staying home with a child, which means you have the same ROI on skills investment as someone who will not have a child.   The fact that it's only *maternity* leave generally also influences it.   Women may select into those "intangible benefits" simply because the cost of those benefits is lower for her than her husband, who isn't offered paternity leave, or even because she expects to be pushed in that direction and therefore doesn't invest in skills.","depth":2,"score":17,"ups":17,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mphlm","name":"t1_cqm0qc4","parent_id":"t1_cqlzhit","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429829035,"created_utc":1429800235}

Oftentimes women do complain to a higher up or HR and the response is to fire them, not the person being sexist because the woman is seen as a troublemaker. Or the complaint just goes ignored.		I have dealt with this personally, and I know multiple other women who have at their jobs as well.

Still nothing happened. He is still working here. His behavior hasn't changed. 		So the only way to "deal with it" is to find a new job.

From personal exp.

Do you happen to know how much of that discrepancy might be because men take jobs that don't require a college degree? I live an area of the country where most colleges have a pretty equal distribution on gender. I'm guessing the Northeast part of the country is different and there are more women. I'm not attacking you, I'm genuinely curious what you think. Many trade jobs that pay high wages, for example, are not typically done by women but by men. So that could account for something. I know guys that make quite a bit of money as electricians (about $60,000+) or as roofers. I don't think they really work with any women though.

My aunt and uncle did the breastfeeding thing; she did it when she was home the first few months, then when she went back to work she would pump often, he would have plenty each day to give the baby (supplemented with regular milk and formula over time) and even had a funny looking breastfeeding device to wear to mimick the act of breastfeeding so that close skin-on-skin bond can form.

{"body":"We currently have this system (Denmark) but there is still a wage gap due to maternal leave. The main issue is that most women still prioritise a traditional family setup where they spend more time taking care of the children than their husband, so it ends up being a 70/30 split or a 80/20 split instead of 50/50 (its an option, not a requirement). At the same time there is a stigma for men who earn less than their wife. Bottom line is that there are equal opportunities here but men and women still prioritise differently.

{"body":"I'm a male nurse. I'm no economist, but I get paid, hourly, the same as any woman with my amount of experience and certification in my field. 		On the other hand, 32 hours a week is considered full-time at the hospital I work at. Most of the women who are mothers are satisfied working that much and having three days off to spend with their family. 		I, alternatively, only have a girlfriend and two four legged roommates to worry about so I normally average around 45 hours per week. Not only that, but since I'm there almost two whole shifts more than my counterparts I often work as "lead" nurse on my shifts because I have a better understanding of what's going on; It isn't a matter of seniority, on my shift whoever has worked the most consecutive days in a row is charge. 		Now, I'm not saying I work harder than these women because I don't. I know how much work is put in to being a mother. However, counting my average 13 extra hours worked per week, $2 shift differential for third shift, $2 hourly pay for being in charge (roughly half of my shifts), and my hourly pay of $23.50 equals an additional $18.6K annually. 		There is really no observable inequality in my field, it really seems to boil down to priorities. Not saying family and children aren't important, but my job is really my only responsibility and the only thing I focus on. A female counterpart on my shift works the exact same schedule as me just on opposite days and we bring home the same amount. 		My girlfriend works for an insurance company and makes the same as her counterparts. Again, she is single and has no priorities outside of her job. 		There are so many variables at play here. I'm only 24 but in my experience the pay difference is just based on lifestyle, which as a woman, statistically means you have other priorities outside of the workplace and thus aren't on the clock as much.","depth":0,"score":476,"ups":476,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FieldMarshalCrunch","name":"t1_cqm2259","parent_id":"t3_33l5sq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429831231,"created_utc":1429802431}

{"body":">  hand, 32 hours a week is considered full-time at the hospital I work at. Most of the women who are mothers are satisfied working that much and having three days off 		Do you really only get paid as much as other female nurses?  I am curious what you do as a nurse day to day, because you might want to ask for a raise.  		I work for HR in a hospital and we are running into a large problem with pay rates between male and female nurses.  Here is our problem: the number of obese patients who come in to our hopsitial has grown over the last decade.  Though the female nurses are just as good at the medicine part of nursing, they tend to have trouble lifting the patients. We even were forced to purchase new equipment to handle obese patients.  If a nurse can't lift a patient, we have to hire someone else who can.  This means more of the hospital's money goes into paying for wages, workers comp, health insurance, and retirement plans.   I hope I don't sound sexiest, but males tend to be stronger than females.  Overall, we in HR tend to be happy giving a male nurse a pay bump if the nurse is willing to do the physical labor as well.  If a female is strong enough to handle the weight of some of these patients, we will give them a pay bump too, but this tends to not happen as much.  		I am comparing you to the 24 year old male nurses at our hospital, but I am guessing you probably are able to do a lot things older and weaker nurses cannot. As an employee, you should point this out to your supervisor.  Giving you a 5-10 dollars raise, is much cheaper than hiring a new person to help lift and carry patients.","depth":1,"score":52,"ups":52,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"M00NDANCE14","name":"t1_cqm5519","parent_id":"t1_cqm2259","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429836043,"created_utc":1429807243}

{"body":"Economist here, to claim that this shows gender discrimination is not occurring because wages within occupation wages are similar is generally incorrect. The economics literature has studied this gap extensively. Now I'll avoid going into boring details on methodology, but simply put YES there is a wage gap and YES the gap generally disappears in the data when you control for positions within occupation/job titles. 		There is very little wage disparity within specific occupational titles (or tiers.) That is because the mechanism for discrimination lies within the promotional and title allocation process. Women are overqualified for their positions relative to their male counterparts. i.e. they generally have more education/tenure. Now companies are not necessarily discriminating because they have a preference against women, there are some other reasons. Female employees generally have a lower turnover rate and firms can exploit this by paying them less. Now firms don't generally just give women a lower wage, because that would be obvious and never hold up in court. Instead they promote women less frequently and put them in lower paying job titles. If you look at the differences in college educated wage growth, it suggests women don't get promoted/get placed in lower paying categories.		edit: GOLD. Thanks.

{"body":"Ooh, I've never seen this kind of regression. Doesn't it mean that you have to have pairs? Since you're subtracting design matrices? How do you pair them? Then what do the betas represent?

{"body":"**What does this mean?**		So I think a potentially easier way to think about this is that you're having a regression for the wage, Y, of an individual based upon a vector of other covariates (background characteristics of a person like education, race, etc.), Z, and their gender, X. Where X = 1 if a person's male and 0 for female. Now you have the regression:		    Y = beta_0 + (beta_1) X + (beta_2) Z + epsilon		Or in other words:	    Earnings = beta_0 + (beta_1) (Is_male) + (beta_2) (background characteristics vector) + error term		(Note: that beta_2 is a vector of coefficients, while beta_1 and beta_0 are just scalars in this)		In this regression, beta_1 is the mean difference in earnings between males and females conditional on the covariates in Z. This is pretty easy to see if you take the expected value,		    Mean earnings male (X=1): E(Y|X=1,Z=z)=beta_0+beta_1+beta_2 * z		    Mean earnings for female (X=0): E(Y|X=0,Z=z)=beta_0+beta_2 * z		(z is just some vector of background characteristics)		Mean difference in earnings for males and females:		    E(Y|X=1,Z=z)-E(Y|X=0,Z=z)=beta_1		Now this is a relatively simple linear regression, no interaction terms to see if background characterstics affect different genders differently or any of that.		**What about pairing?**		There isn't necessarily "pairing" per se in this case, but your question hits on an interesting point.  There's two different general methodologies for estimating causal impacts in a situation like this which are popular in econometrics: propensity score matching, and linear regression. 		So in a linear regression model, the implicit assumption is that females function as a valid comparison group for males conditional on all the factors in Z in the model above (and that we've specified the functional form of our model correctly). Suppose that our sample consisted of males who were high school dropouts, and females who were college graduates. This isn't comparing apples to apples! In our model above, you'd imagine that beta_1 would be biased downwards because of this sample the mean difference in earnings of a high school dropout male compared to a college graduate female is substantially different from the mean difference in earnings of a college graduate male and college graduate female. Therefore, sample selection is important. In most research papers, they usually have a section dedicated to talking a bit about the data and their sample and the distribution of the background characterstics in Z to make a case that two groups are comparable.		 In propensity score matching, we would construct a "propensity score" for each individual in our sample based on their background characteristics in Z and then attempt to match males to females using some sort of algorithm (you can read more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching)). This is probably more directly related to your question of pairing. However, both linear regression and matching should result in the same estimates in an ideal world, they're just different ways of thinking about the problem.

Point being, the regression ascribes gender gap to differences in work hours, when the real causality is partially attributable to sexism which causes differences in work hours.

Oaxaca does not break down what part of the wage gap is caused by sexism, it simply breaks down what part of the wage gap is explained by a vector of control variables, and what part is unexplained. As researchers, we have to be careful to note when differences in one of these control variables between genders may in itself be caused by sexism, as is the case with industry, hours worked, union status, etc. 		And I'll admit, without these controversial variables, the Oaxaca decomposition doesn't tell us much. I saw a paper earlier that found a negative predicted wage gap, when using only the uncontroversial variables of age, province, and education, mostly due to women having higher educational attainment than men. But this in itself tells us a lot about the wage gap: if uncontroversial variables cannot explain any differences in wages by gender, then there is a strong case to be made that the unexplained portion of the gap (all of it, in this case) is caused by discrimination.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Cilicia","name":"t1_cqmdkz4","parent_id":"t1_cqmco42","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429848653,"created_utc":1429819853}

{"body":"Not all critics have a political bias against you.		> split the wage gap into explained and unexplained differences		Who decides what the unexplained differences are? As you said here		[it wouldn't describe the entire gap](http://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/33l5sq/when_you_compare_salaries_for_men_and_women_who/cqm9wil)		I believe this is key. This is a phenomena involving millions of people in a complex world so the gap must be due to a wide variety of different factors, which no doubt include the theories put forward by popular feminism that prejudice and cultural attitudes are to blame but likewise I doubt this explains 100% of the gap. This does not imply the remaining proportion of the gap is explained by the arguments of your opponents in a tug of war between 2 sides, it implies that the remaining proportion is unexplained.		One factor is apparently the number of work hours, this in itself is partly explainable by cultural attitudes but again it can't be 100%, but anyway.		http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf		> The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not necessarily have to involve government intervention. It does not have to improve women’s bargaining skills and desire to compete. And it does not necessarily have to make men more responsible in the home although that wouldn’t hurt. But it must involve 	alterations in the labor market, in particular changing how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might even vanish if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who worked log hours and who worked particular hours. Such change has already occurred in various sectors, but not in enough.		This I think has further ethical implications. Shouldn't a person have the right, if they choose, to work harder than their peers and earn more without being penalized?		Feminism I believe is a subset of overarching ethics, which hopefully means the answer from popular feminism is "yes" and support for some other solution should be found like changing cultural attitudes, it also means that the truth is more important than what is politically expedient and analysis like this should be objective and unbiased. It is difficult when confronted by a bunch of internet trolls but even worse than falling for a troll is assuming legitimate criticism is from a troll when it's not.		It is like making predictions on the stock market, you can't afford to make mistakes, you can't pretend you made money when you didn't, so you have to take criticism and accept failure even if it is a hit to your ego or you will never learn and improve. Except here you can't test your assumptions easily and it is all to easy to let your own prejudices interfere, something I am guilty of so I'm not pointing any fingers.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"logic_card","name":"t1_cqnc72v","parent_id":"t1_cqlysfk","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429923114,"created_utc":1429894314}

As for posting in good faith: sorry I can't find the article about the economist or the community that hired him.

You seem to be flirting with the accusation that I'm talking about racial disparities generally or inequality generally. I'm not.

C has a negative interaction with both A and B if C is too complex.  		C only needs to be 'good enough', and any 'more accurate' beyond a certain level of complexity becomes a barrier to transmission and reception.

{"body":"Imagine a company with two kinds of workers: level A and level B. If you are promoted to level B, you get a 50% raise. If you stay with the company a year, you get paid 10% more than last year. Bob and Cindy have been working for the company for 10 years, while Dan has been working for 5 years.  All are level A workers. 		A round of promotions comes up, and Bob gets selected (for whatever reason). Now, Cindy earns more than Dan even though their both level As, but that's because she's more experienced. Bob is earning more than Cindy, but that's because he's level B. So in the study posted by OP, the differences between these people's wages wouldn't be considered. There would be no apparent wage gap.		However, if you have a company that, for whatever reason, tends to promote men more often then women with similar experience, then you'll end up with a bunch of men earning more at level B that have the same experience as a bunch of women at level A. As long as the company's rules about paying people based on job title and experience are consistent, then you won't see any difference between the sexes if you compare people with the same job title and experience. But if you compare how much those women at level A *would* be earning if, on average, they were promoted to level B at the same rate as men with similar experience, then there is a gap. Also, if you look at the average amount of experience of men and women at both levels, since women are less likely to be promoted to level B, women at level A would tend to be overqualified relative to male level As. Assuming they eventually do get promoted to level B, only later, than the experience level of women at level B would also skew more experienced, since males have a wider (younger) distribution. So that's how this situation arises.		The thing to remember about the "forces" of supply and demand is that they're not laws of nature, they're just something that tends to happen in cultures that have a certain set of social rules about how money and markets work. Other forms of capital, like social, cultural, and symbolic capital, can influence our decisions. Men, for instance, tend to make friends more easily with other men, and tend are often raised to possess traits that are traditionally associated with "promotion material", like ambition, extraversion, confidence, etc., while women are sometimes discouraged from acting these ways. So even if you have a boss that's not some caricature of a sexist jerk, if he's a man, he may subtly prefer men without understanding that his preferences are, in part, driven by a gender preference because the traits can be individualized ("I just like this guy more than that woman"), and even if the boss is a woman she may prefer men because they tend to act in certain ways. This points to a broader problem in discussions of sexism in the workplace, because it gets talked about as if it's something driven by people who are hateful and by practices that are clearly unfair. But these kind of differences can appear when everyone has the best of intentions and is careful to pay people the same money for the same job and level experience.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"UWillAlwaysBALoser","name":"t1_cqma2wn","parent_id":"t1_cqlzvb4","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429843437,"created_utc":1429814637}

First, I didn't say that "men leave all the child rearing to women by default." That's true in some cases, but what I said was that women tend on the whole to devote more time to family than men do - and, by extension, less to work. That's frequently something that people choose. 		I know that data is not the plural of anecdote, but I believe that the data are supportive of the anecdotes I'm about to offer. Let's look at my married friends:		 |Husband Education|Husband Employment|Wife Education|Wife Employment	:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:	Couple 1|J.D., Law|Attorney (Small Firm)|M.A., Arts Journalism|Non-Profit Event Coordinator	Couple 2|B.S., Software Engineering|Game Studio Owner|B.A., Art Education|Retail 	Couple 3|M.S., Electrical Engineering|Software|B.S., Electrical Engineering|Home (Mom)	Couple 4|M.S., Electrical Engineering|Control Systems|B.A., Journalism|Office Worker	Couple 5|A.A., Liberal Arts|Air Force Officer|B.S. Optics|Laboratory Worker	Couple 6|Ph.D., Electircal Engineering|Professor|M.A., Education|Teacher	Couple 7|J.D., Law|Attorney (Big Law)|J.D., Law|Attorney (Small Firm)		To the best of my knowledge, each of those degree programs and careers was selected by the individual spouse without coercion from the other. I know for a fact that the stay at home mom would rather be a mom than an engineer.		This is the context of these stats. I damn well plan on telling my daughter that she can do whatever she wants, and on discouraging her from playing in to traditional gender roles if that's not who *she* wants to be. Everyone should do that with their daughters.		But those friends of mine, self-selected, have created a situation where the men probably earn close to TWICE what the women do. It's not because industries are sexist. It's not because the employers are sexist. It's because the men have self-selected into fields with higher salaries than the woman have, and (in the cases of Couples 3 and 7, the women have chosen to take jobs that pay less in exchange for flexibility). The one couple where the wife makes more than the husband is Couple 5. More power to her.		This is not a workplace problem. It's not even a cultural problem, although when a woman wants to work or a man wants to stay home and prejudice results in them getting judgment for that, THAT'S a problem. 		>Of course you do. It allows you to pursue a career free from obnoxious responsibilities like rearing a child, or having to choose between family and job.		Excuse me, how dare you presume to know anything about me? I make about a third of my annual earning potential because I value my ability to spend time with my daughter and and to participate meaningfully in her upbringing as an equal partner with my wife, and to maximize my income potential would require steppinga way from that.","depth":9,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Moruitelda","name":"t1_cqmbmsi","parent_id":"t1_cqma8al","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429845746,"created_utc":1429816946}

{"body":"Edited/re-written.	------------------------	I'm gonna work with your analysis model:	>We have data that indicates X. Hold on, if X is true, we would expect to see Y.  We don't see Y?...		Okay, so I agree that this is a valid mode of reasoning (as far as our purposes go), but I think that in this case that comes with a huge asterisk around "if X is true, we would expect to see Y".		(i) So the harder-core you get into feminist theory (think of all the radical feminists the internet has warned you about) the more they are going to say "YES.  The free market DOES ACTIVELY EXPLOIT THESE GENDER ROLES FOR PROFIT.  Capitalism demands family units where one member is as profitable as possible, and one member is staying home to raise the next generation of profit machines."  I'm sure exactly what school of feminist thought this line of thinking belongs to (it's not my field, but it is the field of someone close to me, so I have a weird mix of in-depth and rank-amateur familiarity with it).  I'm not going to assert that this is the case, because many people find it contentious and I don't want to de-rail things, but I did want to put out there some people argue that "Y" does actually happen very legitimately, in a very open manner.		(ii) But let's say that, no, most reasonable managers do not intentionally exploit the wage gap for profit (I'll be assuming that "exploit" here means "intentionally hire more women, and pay them less").  Should we expect them to?  Well it depends on what you attribute the wage gap to.  A cursory analysis of the wage gap says "men and women are getting hired to the same jobs, but women are probably getting paid less for it because sexism".  As the header of this thread points out, the data does not bear out this hypothesis.  When you examine men and women in similar job roles, the pay tends to be similar.  But we still see women getting paid less on the whole.  Then we look more at the "ladder" of a career, and how it is different for men and women.  First up: biology.  Women will need around 2-5 months off of work if they want to have a child.  The demands of the job market are often incompatible with this need, so some women are forced to choose between a kid and a career.  Then, by social and business convention, if a woman is partnered with a man as a child-rearing unit, the man is really unlikely to (a) be able to get paternity leave AND/OR (b) less likely to even seek/pursue it in the first place (not that all men don't want to raise children, but even for some of the ones who do, there's a huge stigma around men leaving their jobs to be fathers, and that is going to give anybody pause).  So already, we have this massive block towards a long-term career labelled "family".  But there's another huge thing going on with the ladder, and that's implicit bias around gender roles (my favorite source about this: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/).  Women and femininity have, traditionally, been associated with incompetence, or at least not "business and profitability".  Basically this manifests most directly in the example I gave earlier about negotiation.  Women tend to be punished, in a social/cultural way, for acting like a "businessman" or a "shark". I mean, look at all the bullshit around Hillary Clinton, especially the last time she ran. Even if you don't agree with her politics, how much of the criticism around her was something like "she's an ugly, cold bitch!".  Women are told they are "cold", "bossy", or "bitchy" when they adopt the (often encouraged in men) traits of assertiveness, confidence, willingness to argue/haggle/negotiate, etc. This is a long term type of socialization, that continues for years throughout high school, college, and their career.		So this all adds up to a wage gap that is difficult to really monetize (unless you're the author of "Lean In").  It's not so much that businesses don't want to pay women as much as men (though that can enter into it, from a certain perspective), it's that "business culture" doesn't want women in the first place, and penalizes them for trying to enter it by keeping them from climbing the ladder as easily. In some ways, then, a business does profit from this, because it ensures a pool of extremely qualified candidates working low-level, but essential positions (while I believe this is specific assertion is true, if you disagree I don't really feel the need to debate it with you, as I understand that some people would regard it as contentious, and again, I don't want to de-rail things in general).  But yeah, basically this is why I don't think the free-market has capitalized on the wage gap.  If it tried to, in the sense of "exploit women with lower pay", it would open itself to very direct criticism and that would endanger the already existing structures of sexism (which I believe do generate some extra profit).  Therefore it is in its best interests to continue with this (less immediately obvious) structure.		Ultimately, I think that "we should expect Y" is way to simple to really capture the structures behind why "Y" doesn't occur (or at least, doesn't occur for the purposes of our argument, I'm sure a Marxist Feminist would say that it does occur, and that we should dismantle the system).

{"body":"Ooo.  Are we providing our own anecdotal experiences now?		Ok then. I'll add mine. 		Outside of self selective factors you describe, my experience with the wage gap is exactly as "Economist here" relates, it's related to differences in promotions between levels rather than pay at individual levels. 		Here are a couple of examples of how this works:		Both my husband and I worked at a major software company, when we had our first child we both took the same amount of unpaid leave and both returned to our jobs after the leave. 		In my husband's case this resulted in no changes at work. He wasn't treated differently than in any previous year. He received the same sort of work to do and received the same evaluation as usual at the end of the year. 		In my case, my manager was noticeably nervous about my pregnancy, she continuously asked me if I planned to return after my leave despite the fact that I gave no signs of wanting to leave my job and kept telling her I was returning. Once she learned I was pregnant she gave me the lowest quality work to do in our group. I did this work well, but was too naive to know I needed to push back hard on what work I was being assigned. 		I returned from maternity leave to a negative performance review. This was somewhat surprising since my manager had only given my positive feedback during the year on my work. She said the review was not because of the performance on the work I had done, but just because I hadn't worked on anything high profile that year and thus came out low in stack ranking. 	This had a hit to my income that year and all year's going forward as well as delaying any promotions. 		I learned from this that it is important to push back on what work you are given. 		Flash forward many years to a new boss. I meet my new boss at my performance review for the previous year under a different manager. Despite receiving a positive review from my previous manager, new boss tells me I should really consider whether I want to continue to be an engineer and asks whether it isn't time to move to more of a project manager role. He wonders whether I can keep up technically when there are so many "very smart young men coming out of college today."  I, of course, am appalled and explain to him that he does not know me, but once he        does he will find I am very smart and do high quality work. 	 	I spend the next year fighting hard with him about the work he is assigning me. In some cases, management above him who regard my work highly notice that he is not giving me the right kind of work and lean on him before I even hear about it.  When I grab work of a scale and complexity appropriate to my experience, he tells me to give it to men on my team many years my junior because he wants to get them promoted this year. I inform him I also want to get promoted and need a plan for that as well. This leads to a lot of hostility on his part and is probably not helped that I have upper management on my side. 		Needless to say, he gives me a poor performance review because I'm not doing work at level. He tries to fire me, but is thwarted by my allies in upper management. 		I request a transfer. My new manager is delighted with my performance, gives me appropriate work, works to provide me a promotion plan and makes sure I am singled out for recognition for my contributions that go above and beyond. 		I, however, take a permanent hit to my salary, and have effectively delayed any further promotions for a couple of years. 		These two examples are the most overt ones from my career. I've had other experiences that would be harder to tie definitively to my gender, but gender probably played a role in at least a few of them. 		These two examples are instructive because they illustrate how you can be hurt by not pushing back as well as by pushing back. 		Generally, the most damaging discriminatory behavior I've seen directed toward other women at work involves this driving work towards unproven young men at the expense of proven women to provide them with promotion potential.		To say that holding factors like position steady shows that discrimination is not a factor is naive.","depth":3,"score":147,"ups":147,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"fleet_roof","name":"t1_cqm4vq2","parent_id":"t1_cqlymbt","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429835651,"created_utc":1429806851}

{"body":"I may not stay in the long run.  I stayed initially probably because I was over confident.  I have a solid reputation in my org and I've never had any problems like this before.  I figured my manager just needed to see the quality of my work, which is excellent, and then things would turn around for him.		When things reached a breaking point, I went to upper management and they were apologetic and offered to help me go wherever I wanted.  I chose to stay close for one year.  The goal for me was to get made whole in the review process so I have unlimited options going forward and to have an opportunity to damage my manager for his behavior as much as possible.  He pushed two other women out of the org while I was there and he was pretty smug about it (I hear he gave one of them the exact same speech he gave me the day he met me.)  If I just bail, he wins.  		It was delightful to tell him in the middle of a meeting where he was talking about firing me to say simply that I was moving to a sister group.  His eyes widened and he started telling me how much "respect" he has for me and then pressing me for what I thought of him.  He knows it's bad for him to have me around.		I want to be financially made whole as well, however.  I've told management as much.  I find out next week.  If I'm not, I'm looking for a new job.  If I am, I may be looking for a new job anyway.  		My manager is still in the org.  I don't have to work directly with him, so it is tolerable.  I've told upper management that I think it is foolish to keep him on as he is a legal liability. I should note that the first day I met him when he made a bunch of crazy remarks announcing his biases, he did it not only in front of me, but in front of my outgoing manager with whom I had an excellent relationship.  The man is seriously cruising for a bruising, legally speaking.  I know they have talked to him about his behavior, but I doubt it is going to change.		I don't think this is how all tech companies work.  My company, let us just say, is very large and has a very poor reputation when it comes to employee issues, but this behavior was really beyond the pale. I don't think it is common even at my company, but I would not be surprised that if it exists in pockets here and there.  The way they handled it does not give me confidence.		Hope my story helps you out.  People rarely talk openly about the shit that happens to them, so it can be hard to learn from others' terrible experiences.  In retrospect, I should have moved to another group the day I met him.  I'm sure I could have done that, but after I stayed with him he had some say in my future.  When I told him I was looking elsewhere in my company midyear, he threatened to sabotage the move.  		People I know often comment about my sang-froid about the whole thing. In part this came from the fact that everyone I've ever worked with has liked me and my work, and I knew I was highly regarded by folks I had worked closely with for many years who were higher in the org than my manager. During this time, I couldn't walk across campus without having former colleagues ask me to join their teams and I had old co-workers calling me to ask me to join local start-ups.  This whole thing probably would have gone down differently if I had less experience and reputation backing me up. I've got lots of options, and I may exercise them after next week.		Good luck with your career.  Know that something of this magnitude of badness probably happens to everyone at some point in their career, men and women.  Don't take it personally, just work through your options.  Always be working with your manager on promoting yourself and figuring out your next move.  If you have a manager that isn't willing to work aggressively toward your next promotion, get out early and find someone who will. I think there are definitely some people for whom your immutable identity will be a problem, but there are many more for whom it is no issue, so don't waste your time.		Oh, and watch out about the whole pregnancy thing.  Purely anecdotally amongst my friends in engineering and out, that's the most dangerous time for your career.

{"body":"Ok, but let's not act like men don't have to watch what they say or how they act at work in other ways. Sexual harassment laws are far more harsh on men than they are women. So while women have to be careful about being too abrasive, men have to worry about not saying something that another (female) co-worker might misconstrue as being harassment or sexually charged. Just like you were chided for "looking too intense", a guy can just as easily be chided for looking at a female the wrong way or "looking creepy".		I'm not trying to compare sexual harassment with swearing in the workplace, or saying the effects are comparable, or anything of that sort. I'm merely pointing out that *both* men and women have to alter their work behavior in order to tiptoe around certain pervasive societal prejudices. For men, it's avoiding saying things like "I like the way your hair looks today" even though that statement from another woman is totally acceptable. For women, it's avoiding saying things like "That guy we just negotiated with was such a dick!" even though that statement from another man is totally acceptable. 		Both suck in their own regard, but corporate America expects people to play their roles. It's a shitty reality, but that's just life. I'd love to walk into a client meeting unshaven and wearing blue jeans, or get a tattoo in a visible place, but unfortunately I'm neither rich enough nor powerful enough for people to want to do business with someone who looks sloppy or rebellious. So I wear a suit and shave my face and refrain from getting tattoos because that's what's expected of me and I won't get a raise/promotion if I don't do that stuff.

I was completely convinced that my boss was going to fire me any time I was called to his office and was surprised when he didn't. I had a number of STEM lady friends switch jobs just because they felt like they couldn't handle the feelings of inadequacy. I was very lucky to have a boss who was a great team leader. I remember going into his office one day about 3 months in and asking him "Am I doing okay?" because I just was so stressed about my performance that I just wanted him to tell me I was crap and get it over with. I felt like it was the most unprofessional question I could ever ask. And he said I was doing great. After three years at that company, the impostor syndrome wasn't an issue anymore. I knew what I could do and I felt respected and professional and was proud of my abilities. I was *proud* of myself.

You mentioned that you believe our interests are embedded in our genetics, while some of this may be true (studies have been done which indicate that "naturally gifted" athletes are genetically different than "decent athletes", ie. different genetic expression of certain genes) it is NOT the end all. I would like to mention nature vs. nurture at this point. You said that you know many women who went into 'female-centric' careers because they were interested in them? But, why were they interested? It is possible they were so interested in stepping into those careers because they are fascinated at the prospect of teaching Kindergarten or can't wait to care for sick people everyday (many women probably are just naturally interested in these things, which is great for them!). It is also possible, however, that from childhood they were unknowingly geared towards these things so that they could uphold their assigned gender role in society. I experienced this first hand, allow me to explain.		Firstly, I am a biochemist. Secondly, I graduated University with an Honours Degree (even making Dean's List) and graduated from a post-grad program in College top of my class. Thirdly, I work for the government doing research into oil sands contamination in a high paying entry-level position with endless advancement opportunities.

My point is, not all women are inherently interested in "typcial female job choices" because it is a part of our genetics. We live in a society that tells girls they should play with Barbies and toy kitchen sets, before telling women they should have nurturing careers or stay home and raise children. All of those things are fine, if that is actually what they want instead of what they are beind TOLD to want.		I am lucky that my parents did not push traditional gender roles on me.

Skip to about 18 minutes in, they show an experiment where they put "male" and "female" toys with monkeys (toy trucks vs. dolls), and the male monkeys were much more interested in toy trucks and female monkeys were much more interested in dolls. There have been lots of others studies like this that tend to agree.		 Anecdotally, I had a sociology teacher in college who tried to raise her kids without gender bias, giving them only gender neutral toys (so no dolls or toy guns) and she thought they would not follow the stereotypes, but her boys started treating every object they had like it was either a gun or a sword.		While this doesn't mean that all men or women follow a certain pattern, I'm convinced that male and female brains are different and it causes us to tend to have different interests, and that this would be true even in a society with no gender bias or stereotypes about what's a masculine or feminine job.

{"body":"One thing that strikes me about these conversations when they come up is the lack of historical context.  It was not that long ago that women were on the whole simply not allowed to go into technical fields. George Tech, for instance, didn't even allow women in all courses until 1968.  We are finally aging out of that generation that had direct experience with very explicit gender discrimination, but there are still people working who have had personal experience with this -- Ruth Bader Ginsberg would be a very famous example of someone who was explicitly discriminated against based on gender in her early career -- and it was all perfectly legal and considered socially acceptable at the time.		I've had conversations with my mother's friends who talk about how they weren't allowed to take higher science classes in high school or college because of their gender despite plenty of aptitude and interest.		The point is that many of the people working today are just one or two generations out from a time when it was perfectly legal and common to bar women from certain kinds of education and jobs.		I'm in the middle of my career and I can remember as a child going through career days as a young child at school and doing gendered crafts projects and wearing gendered costumes.  For example, boys were dressed up as doctors and girls as nurses.  This was well after laws like the Equal Pay Act had been passed to provide employment protections based on gender.  Even after these protections were put in place, the rest of the culture lagged behind. I never worked in a time when it was legal to prevent women from taking certain jobs, but I have worked in the past with people old enough to have experienced that in their careers.		Why does this matter in this discussion?  		Because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree -- so to speak.  It is pretty common for people to pursue careers that they've seen those close to them pursue.  If your mother was a teacher, as was mine, because that was one of the few professions open to women,  then when you are a girl you may look at what your mother did and chose that profession because that is what you know.  Likewise you may chose a more technical profession if you are boy and you see the men around you working in those fields.		I have little kids, and they and their friends seem to have pretty open ideas about what they can choose to be.  If you ask them if they can be anything they want, they say, of course.  If you ask them what they would like to be when they grow up, however, their answers are pretty well bound by the people that they have come into contact with during their lives.  Now it may be that some will go off and pick something that cuts across the grain that they have no familiar experience with and for which they will be the odd one out, but I think on the whole that is comparatively rare unless they get some explicit encouragement from someone in their lives.		Honestly, I don't believe I would be an engineer today if my mother hadn't suggested it to me and told me I would be good at it.  I was always very good at math and science, but without at least one person saying you belong, it may not even occur to someone to go into a field that has few people like them.  I can't say anyone else in my life ever encouraged me to take that path, but one is enough.		It strikes me as odd to look at, say, the nursing profession and say that it is predominantly filled with women because females are more nurturing when in reality it is predominantly filled with women because until relatively recently women were barred from other jobs, so they filled up nursing because that was one of the very, very few professional jobs allowed to them.  The extreme gender imbalance in the profession caused by this is, I think, to a large extent fairly self perpetuating.

When you say that, because women tend to go in direction x, it's alright that we push all women to go in direction x, you're making a policy decision that favors laziness over personal choice.

No, I'm saying that you can't point to a field that's 80/20 male/female and say that this is evidence of gender bias and that it should be 50/50. Maybe if we remove all gender bias, the natural inclination and interests of the genders would result in a gender representation that's 75/25, not 50/50. So pointing to the 80/20 as proof of bias is problematic because we don't have any idea what to compare that number to.

{"body":"There's a thing called radical feminism, which, together with Imperialism, colonialism, etc grows out of Foucauldian power structure theory. It states that our society exists in a hierarchy determined partially by gender, whereby men are, say, 1, and women are, say, 0, and when this hierarchy encounters a variable that is set to 1 it executes one set of commands, and when it encounters a variable set to 0 it executes another set. Rather than being arbitrary, one of these sets is designed to empower, and the other is set to disenfranchised (look up power binary). As such, when one is born in this society and the doctor records 0 or 1 on one's sheet, one is launched into a social algorithm that is a significant determinant of where they end up. Radical feminism states that these algorithms shouldn't exist because it arbitrarily limits personal choice. That's what is meant by taking down gender roles.		So, regarding your points:		> Why is it that speech pathologists are 90/10 female/male? [...] Are men conditioned from birth to not be speech pathologists?		Probably. Men tend to be conditioned to take high-paid, non-caregiver jobs.

We come to that number because we have certain assumptions, and you reject that number because you have different assumptions. It's unclear whose assumptions are more reflective of reality. However, in my experience, this number is used as an illustrative statistic rather than as "proof". When people get down to looking at the data behind that statistic, they find stuff that OP mentioned - social expectations, fewer promotions, misogynistic work culture, need to exhibit higher achievement relative to males - which is proof of discrimination. Discrimination happens at the level of opportunity, not at the level of results. However, a result being vastly unequal may suggest discrimination. To be clear, we don't know that gender ratio should be 50/50 or that it should not be 80/20 (mathematically, those are very hard questions to answer), but we do know that some of the discrepancy is the result of discrimination.","depth":8,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"riggorous","name":"t1_cqmb1ud","parent_id":"t1_cqm9wf3","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429844888,"created_utc":1429816088}

There's obviously some stigma to being a male nurse, yet nursing is currently about 90/10....so how does SLP get to be 94/6 if it's A. high paid, and B. doesn't have the feminine reputation of nursing.

The first source that documents a fall of the female share of degrees in CS from 37.1% in 1984 to 26.7% in 1998 also shows the following: Women made up 27.6% of "Physical Science" degrees in 1984, and by 1998 that was up to 38.4%.		So CS dropped by 10.4%, but Physical Sciences increased by 10.8%. 		If women are being pushed out of STEM fields, why does it seem that they left CS to go do Geology and Physics?		These stats aren't conclusive. 		For example, this is looking at the percentage of those degrees that go to women, not the percentage of women that go into that degree. There is a big difference. 		For example, suppose at a University every year 100 women and 200 men enter the computer science department. That's 33/66, or fairly close to the 37/63 split at the peak in 1984. This holds for several years, women are 33% of the CS grads, but then there's an explosion in the market for CS as a tech boom starts and CS grads are likely to make lots of money and this leads to lots of men deciding to enter CS instead of something else, maybe they are pushed into it by society telling them they should earn more money, but regardless, suppose that after a few years, the same 100 new women show up, but now 500 men are showing up to the CS department. No women have been discouraged, the rate of participation among females is the same, it's just that now more men are in the field so as a share of this field, women have dropped from 33% to 16%. 		I teach at a university that has a lot of Saudi students. Saudi Arabia subsidizes their students to come to the United States and pays for their university education.

There are lots of factors that play into these stats that would need to be accounted for, including the fact that maybe men are being pushed into those fields and decreasing the percentage of women, rather than every percentage point drop being directly attributed to women being forced out.","depth":9,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jeffp12","name":"t1_cqmbh8d","parent_id":"t1_cqmaoe9","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429845517,"created_utc":1429816717}
{"body":"Then why do I have NO interest in a feminine job, or feminie toys when I was a child?		It cannot be based soley on genetics. If it were then I would have spent my childhood playing with dolls etc, and would not be a scientist right now. I did not say genetics are not a factor. I said they are not the PRIMARY driving force. 		Genetics provide us with a pre-disposition to many things (disease, intelligence, likely our interests also) BUT it is not so cut an dry as people are making it out to be (not you specifically although I am not going to touch the men and womens brains things bc in my neuroscience courses we discussed this and their is not; in what aspects of the brain are used there are some differences but the biological structure is damn near identical).		Yes. My parents allowed me to explore my interest in "boy stuff", sports, action figures, science, etc. BUT they did not spark the interest in me. I was already interested in those things from day one. I don't have an older male brother or cousin that I was super close to (a younger brother, but I already wanted to play superheroes before he was even born) that I was trying to be more like and thus developed an interest in their interest. I had mostly female friends at school, although when the dolls came out I booked it to the soccer field lol (so it isn't like my tons of boy friends influenced my interests). 		Genetics are not cut and dry, as I said. I agree some females and males have an inherent genetic interest in what society tells them they should, even had society not told them to BUT not everyone does. That is why it is so important to be sensitive to those that don't conform to gender stereotpyes. 		My field is dominated by men, on my floor at work they outnumber women 3 to 1. There are 5 supervisors and 4 of them are men. Yes, some of that is likely due to an inherent, natural interest in science on the part of men and a lack of interest in it on the part of women, but, as I can say from personal experience not all of it.		My mother, my grandmother and a couple teachers tried to talk me out of going into biochemistry and research due to the extremely competitive nature of the field (things like taking time off of work for having children and wanting to work part-time to raise them are frowned upon, and job security is not guarenteed bc the longer you aren't doing research for the less likely you can publish something new in your field). I don't want to be a stay at home mom (nothing wrong with this, just isn't for me) and I don't want a tradtional female career (again, nothing wrong with this, just isn't for me); and that is what they had a hard time understanding. I am a woman, why don't I want this.		A lot of people still think that way and still enforce those gender roles.

{"body":">Then why do I have NO interest in a feminine job, or feminie toys when I was a child?		We're talking about population wide trends. Don't confuse the fact that the majority of males play with guns/trucks and majority of girls play with dolls as "all girls play with dolls." This is a trend that's been shown not just in humans, but in other primate species as well. For some reason male monkeys are far more interested in truck toys and female monkeys are more interested in dolls. Try explaining that with culture and gender stereotypes. 		>It cannot be based soley on genetics		I said nature, not genetics. Nature is made up of more than just your genes, there's lots of other factors, epigenetics, or how your genes are put to work, hormones, brain development, there are lots of elements of your nature that are not simply down to your genes. Take the example of identical twins that have identical DNA, but they don't turn out as identical people, they can be quite different and have very different interests. 		[Here's a documentary on epigenetics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D44cu7v9x1w) 		>Yes. My parents allowed me to explore my interest in "boy stuff", sports, action figures, science, etc. BUT they did not spark the interest in me. I was already interested in those things from day one.		Exactly! It's your nature. Something about your genetics, epigenetics, brain development, hormones, some inciting incident to spark your interest, somewhere along the line these developments led to you developing these interests. That's your nature and it's not the product of being pushed a certain way. 		There are certainly girls like you that have these interests and are pushed to girl toys and feminine jobs, I agree that's awful, but I contend that this is really the exception and not the rule. That the general population trends are due to nature. Your mother and grandmother that tried to talk you out of a competitive field probably don't think the same way you do, probably don't see a competitive job as appealing, while you do, just as you are interested in "boy" toys and engineering and they aren't. 		>Genetics are not cut and dry, as I said.		Agreed! Watch that epigenetics doc. There are others I'm sure, it's very interesting to learn about how people develop and to look at it scientifically. I forget if I mentioned to you, but I had a sociology teacher who thought that boys played with "boy" toys and girls played with dolls because of gender stereotypes and that's what was in the literature when she was younger. But she raised her children as a-gendered as possible and didn't give her boys gun or car toys and yet they would grab any long object like a carboard paper towel roll and use that as a gun. The literature has changed a lot fairly recently on what drives these gender differences, but the outdated models are still being trotted out there despite being pretty much disproven by experiments with indigenous peoples that don't have media or with primates. For example, there was a view that what female body types men are attracted to was determined by the media. So they did experiments where they found indigenous tribes with no media and had them rate female body shapes and their results very closely followed the same experiments done with men from all over the world. But we still constantly hear the myth that male attraction has been heavily influenced by media to favor thinness when these studies have debunked that old idea.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jeffp12","name":"t1_cqnersi","parent_id":"t1_cqnec3b","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429927066,"created_utc":1429898266}

{"body":"I agree it's a combination of all things, however there are many that argue that it's all on nurture. I mean you just asked:		>Then why do I have NO interest in a feminine job, or feminie toys when I was a child?		As if the idea of it being in the nature of some women's brains to be into more "male" toys does not jive with what I'm saying. It does, as long as you know about epi-genetics and all the variables in brain development. There's more to your nature than just your DNA. Identical twins aren't identical, and their differences aren't all nurture, some are in their nature because of how their genes have manifested or interacted with hormones. 		> So why does American/Canadian media tell me that I am fat . . .  so why do men think that my size is less desireable than a size 2 if not conditioned by the media, at least in part?		First, don't conflate what the media says (which is usually trying to sell you something) with actual male preferences. 		Studies tend to find that men in the western world find a woman with a waist-to-hip ratio of around 0.7 as ideal. [Here's a bad source, but it has the information.](http://www.today.com/health/ideal-real-what-perfect-body-really-looks-men-women-2D79582595) (and I don't feel like spending any more time looking through the databases to find more studies). This actually translates to about a Size 4, not Size 2. 		So, if you find the ideal amongst men in the in the media-riddled western world, then go find some indigenous tribes and have them do the same experiment, based on what you said, you would expect this experiment to find that indigenous men prefer larger women with a waist-hip-ratio that's higher than 0.7. 		And here's one such study: Judgments of Sexual Attractiveness:[ A Study of the Yali Tribe in Papua](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3474915/)		>Similar to Europeans (Rozmus-Wrzesinska & Pawlowski, 2005), Yali men preferred a rather low WHR.		That is, their results showed that these tribesmen showed similar tastes to western men. In fact, they were kind of shocked to find that:		>In our study, we also found that more than 30% of men rated the female image depicting a .60 WHR as the most sexually attractive. 		They also found:		>An interesting result (however, observed only at the trend level for WHR) was that the number of pigs possessed by participants was related to their preferences for body composition. Male participants owning less pigs preferred higher WHR. 		That is, the more well off men with more meat handy were more likely to pick out a "meatier" girl. This result goes counter to what's often said by lay people that humans in the wild or in our evolutionary past, preferred women with more fat because it was a health indicator, and that in our modern world with little food scarcity we've suddenly flipped around the beauty standards. That seems not to be true. In this case, the men for whom food was more scarce, preferred skinnier women, and the men who had more food preferred the heavier women, which is exactly the opposite of this hypothesis about the western world. 		So if you want to make this personal,		>why do men think that my size is less desireable		Look to WHR, where being close to 0.7 is apparently the ideal even amongst indigenous tribes. They say WHR is the best indicator, not BMI or pant size, but waist-hip-ratio.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jeffp12","name":"t1_cqqdi32","parent_id":"t1_cqq74ky","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1430181442,"created_utc":1430152642}

Is there a commercial showing boys playing with barbies, or is the child on a toy vaccuum box a boy? No. The commerical for the barbies is filled with young girls, and that toy vaccum box has a little girl playing with the toy on it. 		You think we have moved past gender roles in society? I challenge that statement. I think we have made great progress, especially as you mentioned the under 35 generation BUT a lot of people (and I hear it on a daily basis, even from co-workers in their mid forties) still think that "genetically" I should stay home and raise children, and that work should not be my priority if I also want kids. Why can't I want both?		You said that you can't force women to be interested in things they aren't and vice versa, so how is me staying home to raise my kids or me being in a traditonally feminine field (because genetics say so) meeting that requirement. I didn't go into a science field, or discuss with my boyfriend the options of him working part-time to stay at home with potential kids because I just "had to be different". I discussed those things with him because I am NOT interested in a tradtional female-centric career or being primary care-giver for children, which if these interests are genetic and "Ignoring the genetic drive both sexes have is folly" that must mean I am not female since my genetics don't make me interested in "female" things (I know that isn't technically what you are saying here, but it kind of is on a less extreme scale).		I am not saying that genetically men and women don't have different traits and pre-disposition or natural ability at things (women tend to be more patient,compassionate, etc. while men tend to be less emotion driven, analytical etc.) HOWEVER those traits are not so embedded in us that woman should be told to feel/be interested in/do certain things (the same is true for men).		Not every female is ignoring genetics when she chooses to work in a field/do things that are not typically associated with women; she might just WANT to go into that field because it interests her. If I ignored my genetics (an analytical thought process, a drive to learn anything and everything about science, seeking out the thrill of a scientific discovery etc.) then I would likely be teaching grade school (a woman-centric job) right now, bored and miserable. Not because it isn't a great career, it is (my family is full of teachers) but because I had no interest in it.

{"body":"> Any proof of that subconscious bias? To put it nicely: that's a load of bullshit.		Not at all. [Implicit bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype) or implicit stereotyping is a recognised, well-researched phenomenon. [This page summarises it nicely](http://med.stanford.edu/diversity/FAQ_REDE.html) and [here's one example of a study about it](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1790742) - you can easily find many more by searching 'implicit bias' or 'implicit stereotyping' on google scholar.		It's not the same as consciously thinking to oneself "well women are crap in my field so I'm not going to hire a woman". It's more like, for example, having heard the stereotype many times that women aren't as good in the field, there's a subconscious association between "woman" and "less competent" which primes the potential employer to be just a *little* harsher in reviewing women's applications. 		This may make no difference to many (or even most) individual applications, but if every hiring employer in the field holds a similar implicit bias (and it's likely to at least be most of them, since stereotypes are pervasive and impact everyone's subconscious to some extent) it turns into a trend across the whole country that results in women being less likely than men to get hired in the first place - or, further down the line, get that promotion or pay rise.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"redminx17","name":"t1_cqm7pjy","parent_id":"t1_cqlzx1m","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429839908,"created_utc":1429811108}

{"body":"Something worth noting here: corporations are not necessarily in control of their own wage gaps.		For example, take a large law firm.  I can speak to this scenario although I am not specifically describing any particular firm.		Most litigation departments of large law firms are male-heavy.  All large law firms work exactly the same way: they hire qualified associates with a focus on gender and minority equity out of the available qualified pool of applicants.  The more obscure your heritage (Indo-Japanese female polyglot with a J.D.), the more likely you are to have multiple offers from different firms, because your legal skills are equivalent to the rest of the hiring pool (nil at time of hire), but your other traits add diversity which firms value as a way to expand their business into new markets, in theory.		New hires become associates.  Over the next seven to ten years or so those associates gain experience and become qualified lawyers who can operate without oversight.  How do they make partner?  It is not, as most non-lawyers would think, based on their merits as attorneys.  There are plenty of exemplary attorneys stuck permanently as senior level associates.  The criteria for making partner is extremely  simple: business generation.  At most law firms the trigger for making partner occurs when the associate begins to generate enough business to pay her own salary plus one or more associate salaries.  At that point the economic factors favor the associate: they can take their book of business and leave for another firm which will make them a partner, or the firm they are at can go ahead and make them a partner to retain those profits.		Once an associate makes partner that scenario continues ad infinitum.  Partners develop power bases and become players in their firms by becoming rainmakers and building large financial trees.  The legal business is mostly a pyramid scheme and the more people you have working your files, the more you get paid.		Nothing about this situation is discriminatory against this type or that type of person, and yet the majority of litigation partners are men.  Why?		Because this system operates within our broader society.  Firms don't control who gets the work; clients do.  And clients statistically are more likely to trust their sensitive files and in some cases their own personal careers to people they trust.  For whatever reason, they seem to trust more men and white men most of all.  Maybe this is due to ingrained societal prejudices.  Maybe it's due to testosterone levels in a combative industry.  Maybe the clients are simply giving work to people like themselves.  But at the end of the day, the law firm has no say.  		Every law firm would love to be perfectly balanced at the top end, but it isn't possible.  Some specific areas of law favor women more than others (generally the further you get from trying cases the higher the quotient of ladies).  There are plenty of bad ass lady trial lawyers, but proportionally they are a small number compared to their male peers.  		All of this completely ignores the fact that many women also are forced to hand their files off to other attorneys during 3 or 6 month periods in the prime of their career-building years if they also want to start a family.  Clients don't care if their lawyer is on maternity leave when they get sued.  They will just hand that file to the next best option who is not on maternity leave.  This also continues to serve as a sea anchor on working mother lawyers: every evening they have to devote to being at their daughter's softball practice is an evening when they are not out schmoozing more clients, and many of their husbands are still not as supportive as you would expect of their legal careers, which once again the firm cannot control.		This is the real world; it's not a mathematical model.  Women absolutely should have every possible opportunity and we as a society should continue to look to women as completely equivalent options when placing our business.  I just get tired of seeing these studies constantly held up as an example of some kind of nefarious prejudice at the top.  If anything, the prejudice runs the other way to try to achieve as much balance as possible in an imbalanced system.

Many other countries mandate that both men *and* women receive leave after childbirth. What that effectively means is that, due to discriminatory government policies, there's more monetary incentives for women to leave to take care of children than men. In turn, that means women are less likely to get promoted, since they are more likely to drop out of the job market to take care of their child. Looking at whether private employers discriminate based on gender reveals absolutely nothing about that.		How big of a role does it play? We don't know. There's a lot we don't know. Some kind of wage gap is inevitable. It's likely that many women would take off more than men even if we had more equitable child leave. But the point is that we're also not at the point where we have an entirely even playing ground. Furthermore, it's not just about what hurts women, but also what hurts men.

To clarify, I'm not making a big deal about the master's degree on the basis that it makes someone smarter or more capable. I list it because of the time and expense it takes to receive an advanced degree (side note - I don't have a masters degree for that exact reason), and that if they make it the base requirement to qualify for a position, it is reasonable that the position receives compensation on par with professions that also require that level of education. I did not say that there are no worse jobs out there that pay less money. That would be absurd.		Many of the positions you list are also very vague. Wastewater treatment is a field, not a job - but I can guarantee that the jobs that require a bachelors degree are not the ones making $34k median salary. "Dental tech" requires a two-year degree. Dental hygienist requires a four-year degree, but the median salary for that is around 70k. Paramedic requires a two-year degree. Most of the jobs you listed that might actually require a masters (or even a bachelors) degree are the social work jobs, and those are notoriously underpaid. 		I would argue that a lot of the other positions you listed are also underpaid, but just because I think other jobs are underpaid does not mean that I think that teachers are well-paid.

{"body":"I wouldn't say that's necessarily true. A huge portion of it has to do with exposure and encouragement from peers and advisors as young girls grow up and develop their interests.		For example, when I was in high school, my two biggest areas of interest were video games/computers and animals/nature. I found both to be fascinating in their own ways, but because I was pretty inexperienced with how the world works, I wasn't super aware of how either interest could translate to a real-life career. 		So I went to college and considered both fields, but I always received near-constant support for pursuing biology over computer science. When I was growing up, my parents would absolutely discourage me from getting involved with technology. Video games were banned entirely, I had severe restrictions put on the amount of time I was allowed to spend online, etc.		I was also typically met with disdain whenever I would express these kinds of interests around peers. If someone were to bring a a gamecube to school for melee tournaments during those last few fuckoff days before summer break, my completely average skill in the game would be met with "wow you're good at this for a girl". This pattern continued throughout college scenarios, with the annual LANs hosted by our esports club, being excluded from games at parties due to assumptions, etc etc. While every instance in itself is easily navigable, it absolutely gets tiring and embarrassing having attention drawn to your gender and being treated like an anomaly because of your interests.		Another note to mention is the prevalence of the "grrl gamerz" mindset that so many young people unfortunately had. I always felt like I had to constantly prove my worth as a "nerd". When a girl expresses interest in video games and computer science and such (especially in the late 2010's, when my late high school/early college career formative years took place), theres a super unfortunate suspicion in a lot of people's minds that she "isn't as knowledgable" or is "doing it for attention" or is trying to be "geek chic" or whatever the fuck else. So I always felt like I had to put extra effort in to make sure people understood that I was actually "for real", to the point where my interests became so specified and obscure that they in themselves became another social barrier. "Oh, you claim to like games but the only FPS you play is TF2? Pff what a grl gamer" Meanwhile I had 700+ TF2 hours and had spent the previous week neglecting all of my school work for a successful cave story hell speedrun, working on a custom FE6 patch with some online buddies, and micromanaging my $400+ worth TF2 inventory that I had been trading up for with a base investment of no more than $20. Those years were so messy in so many ways, and I've since learned to love what I love and disregard people who question me for it, but at the time it was a real barrier.		On the other hand, my interest in natural sciences was overwhelmingly supported. When I would explain to parents, advisors, professors, and so on early on that I was interested in both biology and comp sci, people would always immediately volunteer so much support for pursuing bio, and comp sci was dismissed.		So between the early childhood discouragement, the weird uncomfortable social stigma, the compete lack of support from adults, and so on, I was put in a position where I was made to believe that bio was the obvious better choice for me.		So four years later, I'm a fairly damn accomplished biologist/ecologist/entomologist, have coauthored on a number of papers in decent publications, and have a job with honeybee research all lined up and ready to go once I get out of undergrad in the next upcoming month. Hell, I'm planning on going for my masters with pollinator research once I have a decent amount of experience with these bees. And although I really do feel passionate about my bugs and the issues that my research is trying to solve, the pay is not exactly the most lucrative thing out there, and I really do wonder where I would be today if I did end up taking the comp sci branch early on in life.		TLDR; 	Even though it sucks, people are strongly shaped by feedback from their environment as they develop their interests. Even if a young girl expresses curiosity for computer	 science at a young age, she will be much more likely to be encouraged to pursue other contending (and likely less lucrative) options than a male counterpart, due to societal expectations of female interests and capabilities.","depth":2,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"twiggish","name":"t1_cqm4vwo","parent_id":"t1_cqlxg7v","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429835659,"created_utc":1429806859}

I would be interested to read it.		 > There's nothing inherent to STEM that makes it more appealing to a certain gender.		What are you basing this on, the study linked?  I would be very interested to see this.  I suspect that cultural factors are the largest thing keeping women out of these fields, but don't really know. It would certainly not shock me to learn that men were on average more inherently interested, but I can't much imagine how anyone would even figure that out, I mean we can't raise people in a vacuum to test the hypothesis.		I think the Made With Code initiative is sort of what the commenter above was describing, people "going out of their way" to get women into STEM, and still we get fewer. Perhaps these programs just aren't enough to counteract the stereotypes discouraging women from STEM.		Regardless of the cause, as it stands now, women seem to prefer other jobs to STEM, therefore to them the job is worse. If women are complaining about the wage gap, but unwilling to take high paying jobs because they don't like them, they are essentially saying, well I don't want to do that crappy (but high paying) job, but I'm going to try to make other women do it so I can feel more equal.		Anything we can do to remove the pressure keeping women out of STEM (well described by /u/twiggish in a nearby comment) is a good thing, but that won't necessarily result in the same number of women as men in STEM. But actively trying to pressure them into such fields may not be such a good thing.		I think a large part of the reason women don't go into as high paying fields as men is they don't feel pressured to. Boys learn from the media their value as a mate is based on earning potential and ability to be a provider in a way that women don't. So long as men feel more pressured to make money than women do, men will disproportionately choose jobs which pay more (even if those jobs make them less happy). I think that is one of the largest causes of the pay gap, so the idea that 'rich men are attractive to women whereas visually appealing women are attractive to men' is definitely something we should try to cut down on for the problems it causes to both genders. But trying to make girls more pressured into valuing making money may not be the best solution, I think we should put a little less emphasis on the value of making money for men and more on leading fulfilling lives, then they would be less likely to choose the often-boring but high-paying jobs women seem not to want quite as much. Simultaneously of course its a great idea to try and remove any barriers you can find to women entering STEM, since many people love it, and anyone feeling pressured out of something they could love or contribute to because of their gender is bad.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BoldnessReigns","name":"t1_cqmn5h7","parent_id":"t1_cqmaf7f","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429864879,"created_utc":1429836079}

My statement is based on common sense. It would be rather sexist for anyone to suggest that one gender is better at science or programming than the others. And to clarify what I mean, "appealing" in this case means that there is nothing inherent to STEM fields that make it more suitible/attractive for one gender than the others.		In general, women show less interest in CS/STEM because these areas aren't promoted to them from a young age. This doesn't mean that women as a gender are less interested in STEM as a default. That's why programs like Made with Code and Girls Who Code are important to foster more interest. These programs aren't "going out of their way" to get women into STEM." These programs are just trying to balance out society's expectation of STEM being a man's field.  One could argue that society goes out of its way to get men into STEM by propetuating the STEM stereotypes. You are assuming that men dominating these fields is what's natural, but that isn't the case. This is just what our society has decided to perceive to be the norm.		There is truth in your last paragraph, but it is not the entire cause for the inbalance. I do agree that it's a contributing factor. This all comes back down to gender stereotypes and perceived gender roles. We have to value men and women as equal contributors in supporting a household, as you've said. And at the same time, we need to promote interest in STEM in younger children of all genders, but especially young girls, since they are the demographic that receives the least exposure to it.

Seemed kind of like they were claiming these 'male' things were making cs more intimidating to women when really its that these nerd things were making it intimidating (ie more extreme/stereotypical nerd culture it's more intimidating than stuff that's only a little nerdy.) I think extreme nerd culture is also a barrier for men to enter these fields, but men are more likely to overcome that barrier in part due to the reasons I mentioned above. Though I don't think the article shows it, I DO believe the fact that stem is male dominated dissuades women from entering it, that seems like common sense (and is something we should work against).		I do not think it's common sense that women and men are naturally equivalent in their desires and abilities to pursue stem interests. Do you believe that if not for culture, men and women's abilities and preferences would be exactly the same? That there are no differences in our brains and only genitals separate us? It may be true, since as I mention there's really no way to figure it what people would be like without cultural influence, but I highly doubt it and don't consider it common sense. I don't consider it sexist to believe that men and women are different in their tendencies to preferences, our brains ARE different, they evolved to be different in several ways. It is entirely possible (though I don't know whether it's true) that those differences contribute to men preferring STEM on average more than women.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BoldnessReigns","name":"t1_cqn5rk9","parent_id":"t1_cqmnmk3","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429912751,"created_utc":1429883951}
{"body":"Also, to clarify, I do not assume that men dominating these fields is what's natural. As mentioned I think our culture is pushing men into fields that pay more and I think that is one if the primary reasons they dominate it. I also believe the fact that there are more men in them (which causes the media to portray more men in it) is a contributing factor. I claimed further that it is *possible* that there are inherent differences in men and women which make STEM more appealing to men. I do not believe this is the main reason for the huge disparity, but I just don't think you have any valid reason for taking it as a given that men and women aren't inherently different (on average of course).		And like you said, I agree that men feeling more pressure to make money than women is not the only reason for a wage gap, and especially is not the only reason for  the lack of women in programming and science.  However I do think it is the largest contributing factor to the wage gap. So long as men feel more pressure to make money, men will make more money. This seems like common sense to me. No amount of removing barriers to women entering fields will change that (though it will help a little, since the barriers are also a contributing factor). If we really want the wage gap to go away, I think we should focus on evening out the pressure to make money such that women and men feel it in equal amount. Then the wage gap will naturally go away because men and women will feel equally inclined to choose higher paying fields. IF it turns out there us any natural inclination towards programming and science in men (again, not claiming there is, only that it is possible), then this equal pressure would result in the increased presence of women in other high paying fields, like business. If there was equal pressure people would find a way to make equal money.

{"body":"> Shouldn't we also expect there to be men out there who managed to find maladaptive coping mechanisms?		Yeah, sure - it's why, before the development of ASD as a diagnosis, people with autism used to just be called "psychopaths." Childhood autism was called "childhood psychopathy" at one point because they didn't see any difference between the so-called "self-centered" nature of some autistic children (needing routine, needing quiet, etc) and people with antisocial personality disorder.		Only, in recent years, we've discovered that it isn't antisocial; rather, it's a sensory processing issue. 		> then you're basically a neurotypical human being.		When I say "maladaptive coping methods" I don't mean they just sit there quietly being anxious. I mean that they try to cope in ways that aren't constructive at all, and possibly even destructive in nature, to themselves or others.		Many girls with autism get very emotionally liable, in the same way as boys with autism - temper tantrums, extreme dislike of changing routine, etc. Except when a girl displays those sorts of maladaptive coping methods, we usually label her "Borderline" instead of investigating the autism route. It's "obviously" just bad behaviour rather than neurological in nature, when it comes to autistic girls. Some of that has to do with girls being placed on social pedestals, where as boys are expected to be rough and abrasive during childhood to a certain degree. Thus, when a boy and a girl get taken to get diagnosed, the boy is more likely to be diagnosed with autism, while the girl is seen merely as "lashing out" about something completely irrelevant, and labeled Borderline or Oppositional Defiant.		Thus girls are treated through a kind of social shaming - don't act that way, don't do this - as opposed to young boys who are given space and a routine to help them cope.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cqmehdo","parent_id":"t1_cqmdkdz","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429850011,"created_utc":1429821211}

She tolerated no bullshit: no favorites, do your job or GTFO, be the best you can or be somewhere else. Eventually, the best engineers were asking to be assigned to her projects, while the worst people were actively ducking the same assignments. Nowhere else in the company was this true. I asked Marie what, if anything, she thought she was doing "better" than other PM's. Her reply was so interesting to me that I wrote it down verbatim: "Nothing.

At this point gender is generally ignored and all applicants are screened and assessed on equal footing.

I take a small issue with this last point because I think it's pretty debatable how different this person's perspective could be and how valuable that may be, however, it is generally a good idea and then the employer gets to say that they are a diverse workplace which is apparently appealing to people.

If you have workers where their entire job is essentially just to independently produce widgets, it shouldn't make a difference. Where you'll see the benefit is when you have jobs that interact with people more, have more autonomy, and more decision-making involved. 		So if you are hiring programmers where the job is literally "You, program X function" and that's it, no difference. When they are needed to collaborate on a team effort and there is room for discussion and decision-making as well as possible eventual project management roles, it can make a large difference. 		I'll state again, though, that I don't think selecting in favor of diversity based on race, gender, or other similar classes is guaranteed to generate that intellectual diversity that organizations are looking for, which is my only personal problem with the practice. If all the people you hire look different but think the same, you've gained nothing and potentially screened out people who look the same but think differently.

{"body":"Let's put it another way.		/u/pm_me_your_kindwords' company needs to hire software developers. According to what they've said, the following are true:		1) They have a shortage of qualified candidates, such that they will, under normal circumstances, hire any qualified candidate that applies.		2)  They want these places filled.		3) Using 'normal' (a rather suspect term in most cases, because why is the 'normal' way of doing things inherently more fair or valuable?) recruitment strategies, few women apply. 		4) Using their strategies, more women apply. 		What they are doing does not interfere with anything that happens after the applications are lodged. Being a woman isn't seen as an additional gold star on the application. At the present time, anyone who they think is properly qualified will be hired, because they need new hires. A job going to a woman because their advertising strategies drew her interest isn't taking a job from a similarly-qualified man, because if that man applied they would also receive a job. 		This is sound business practice. Unless they're advertising solely in avenues that, magically, only women have access to, the only real net effect you're getting here is that more women apply. This opens out the pool of people applying to this job, meaning that the company is going to get more qualified applicants. This method of recruitment means that more women have an opportunity to get a job, not that fewer men have the opportunity. 		There are other arguments which I don't imagine will get much support here, like the view that it's important as a society to get more women into the software development industry, that having a substantial number of women on staff might potentially be useful to broaden the company's perspective,etc. 		But when you ignore those arguments, the answer is still that this company appears to be advertising more heavily to women because they feel they can get more qualified candidates than they otherwise would, candidates that they want, that might not apply if they went by 'normal' recruitment techniques.","depth":2,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Rioghail","name":"t1_cqmxyxx","parent_id":"t1_cqlxg8m","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429887332,"created_utc":1429858532}

I'm saying that they should make absolutely no attempt to "target" at all.		>  1) men and women are innately equal in talent and potential, which is true to anyone who isn't sexist		If men and women are, on average, 100% equally qualified, but 90+% of the candidates out there are men, the chance that the *very best candidate* comes from the men's pool is significantly higher. "Targeting" the women's pool for hires is fine with me if you want to do that, but you're both reducing your company's chance of finding the perfect candidate and giving unequal advantage to the women.		Men or women may, ***on average***, be better or worse at certain tasks, such as spatial orientation skills or diplomacy or throwing the javelin or whatever. Yes, an individual woman may be far above the men's average performance at a certain task, or even the very best in the world at it, while women on average perform worse than men on average for that task. Yes, an individual man may be far above the women's average performance at a certain task, or even the very best in the world at it, while men on average perform worse than women on average for that task. It's not sexist to note differences in the average abilities of men's and women's brains and bodies at certain tasks. It *is* sexist to target or hire a candidate simply because they are a man or a woman, either 1) because you are hoping that you'll get a better candidate due to that gender's better average performance, or 2) because you want to "right an imbalance" that nature has provided. Don't target anyone, and hire the *individual* based on their qualifications, not based on their gender group's perceived qualifications.		> 2) gender "blind" hiring results in significantly more men than women being hired		Because their are more men than women interested in doing that job? If the field of candidates is significantly more men than women, then gender-blind hiring would mean that the hires should roughly equal the gender balance of the candidate field at large. Unless, of course, the candidates of the minority gender are actually a better value to the employers than the candidates of the majority gender: It could be that women are generally much better at Job X than men, but very few women actually want to do Job X. If that is the case, employers will be eager to hire those few women, and women will make up a larger percentage of hires than the candidate field would indicate.","depth":9,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ZombieAlpacaLips","name":"t1_cqlzp5x","parent_id":"t1_cqlyvks","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429827229,"created_utc":1429798429}

{"body":"A couple of quick points I'd argue:		>They advertise more to women, which means they're artificially increasing the amount of women (and reducing the amount of men) eligible for that job.		I'm unaware of most companies exerting strict numeric requirements on applicant numbers in the early stages. (So far as I know, most companies are happy to get as many initial applications as they can--not only does it give them a reputation for selectiveness, but it lets them be increasingly choosy about qualifications in the later stages.) So long as gender is only a factor in those early stages--and the company's intent is solely to increase the number of female applicants in those early stages--how are men being adversely affected?		>If you have to look harder for women to get the same percentage, it's because there are less women available for that specific position, so you're intentionally leaving out men who should be there.		That disregards the fact that there might be multiple pipelines for qualified applicants, and depending on which of those pipelines you advertise to, you'll get a different representation of women in your application pool. 		I'll give an example: teaching has historically been a female-dominated profession, and most university education programs are overwhelmingly female-dominated as well. If I'm a public school district looking to have an applicant pool for history teachers that represents men as well as women, I'm not going to see a lot of male applicants by continuing to advertise to those education schools filled with women studying to be history teachers. But if I advertise to graduating seniors in the history department, which has a far greater number of male students, then the applicant numbers for open history positions would likely become far more equitably representative of both genders. Both pipelines can lead to successful teachers. (Applicants who come via the education school typically have a better sense of pedagogy; applicants coming in via the history department overwhelmingly have a better knowledge of and passion for the content.) But by advertising to the one that has typically been ignored, you increase the number of applicants coming from the group traditionally under-represented in the industry.

{"body":"Hiring 3 people to do the work of one? That sounds pretty stupid to me. And we don't give men the dangerous jobs, men take the dangerous jobs. Any field that is dominated by males actively seeks female employees, because diversity looks good on paper and works great in practice.  		My field is heavily male dominated, my class had 33 male students, 1 female. My summer job has only 3 females working as an operator, 1 of which is the female who was in my class (we're both locals so we got this particular job).  	The school offers several scholarships specifically for females in my program, most of which are sponsored by companies that employee graduates of my program.  		When i worked in concrete our crew conisted of: the boss, 3 young male adults, a slightly older (~30) male adult, a young female adult and a slightly older female adult. The young female had the most experience in the field (4 years), the adult male and one young male both had 2 years experience, they started when the company was created. The older female had 1 year experience and me and the other young male had just started. That is the order our pay scaled, we were paid based purely on experience. The experienced young female was able to do anything required with efficiency and was left in charge while the boss went to look at future job sites. order/purchase supplies or any number of other management tasks. Her pay reflected that, making $9 an hour more than me.  		There is no need to lower pay or higher 3 females instead of 1 male, as females are perfectly capable of working in labor intensive fields, but they often choose not to.   		EDIT: also you say competition is good, but 3 females working 1/3 as hard as 1 male would easily be replaced, because of competition. They could hire 3 of these miracle men and get 3x the work done, or higher 1 and pay 1/3 the price.

Don't soundbite. They did that for the section showing pay growth for a career and, basically verbatim from the article, not to illustrate differences in pay by gender.

If you're thinking of those "certain periods" as typically being a couple of weeks, then sure. So a typical, healthy woman who has three kids during her career might miss out on a couple of months over the course of her professional career due to physical limitations of pregnancy and delivery?

{"body":"The [average paid maternity leave is 4-7 weeks](http://www.growingfamilybenefits.com/average-paid-maternity-leave-usa/). The average number of children per family _who has children_ (as of 2000) is [1.86 (pdf!)](http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/hh-fam/tabST-F1-2000.pdf), so let's say a reasonable "average maximum maternity leave" is a woman who has 2 kids, and therefore gets 14 weeks of paid maternity leave.		14 weeks is about 27% of one year, _over the course of her whole career_. Even if that career doesn't start until she's 30, and ends fairly early at 62, that means that a woman has worked 0.841% fewer weeks than a man with the same career. And that doesn't even factor in that not all women in the set will have kids.		So if you want to justify a wage gap on the basis of typical maternity leave, then the difference should be about 1% or less over the course of a career. And the study under discussion shows that it's much more than that, and merely starts to diverge at about childbearing age; and lots of other studies that control for many other factors show an even bigger gap.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"loljetfuel","name":"t1_cqmh3me","parent_id":"t1_cqmaw8p","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429854187,"created_utc":1429825387}

{"body":"This is true, but I think the focus of this data set should be on realizing that it's (mostly) not employer salary discrimination at play any more. Having the data helps us direct our efforts at what needs to change and, as you said, there are other factors - those are the things we need to address.		Some things that this brings to mind, for me, are the following:		1. Ensure that maternity/parental leave is completely protected, for all workers, with no loss of seniority, pay bumps, jobs, etc.	2. Paid and protected paternity leave (not just splitting parental leave like my province does).	3. Subsidize / cover breast pumps and other tools for encouraging men to stay at home to watch children. I'd love to stay home to watch my incoming child, but my wife pointed out how inconvienient and expensive it would be to pump all the breast milk to feed the child (and if you think formula is a good replacement, I'll invite you over to /r/parenting).	4. Better income replacement programs for parents on mat/parental/paternity. We're looking at 45% of our incomes in Ontario, which means the lower-paying one of us is looking at taking most of the time (guess who that is). I would guess some places don't even have an income replacement program though.	5. More government assistance with childcare and child expenses. In my province, we're looking at $1,500 a month. That's crazy. If you have two-three kids, it's better to stay home than go back to work. If you have a single, low-income earner, there's so much more pressure on them to bring in a lot of money. Also cheaper education would help with that.	6. A more flexible working culture. In these days of interconnectivity, there are many jobs that could be done remotely and on flex-time, encouraging both parents to stay at home while still working.	7. Skill training courses for stay-at-home parents (moms and dads). Offer subsidies on training, certification, going back to school, etc.	8. Flexible options for claiming your protected leave. Two parents working a few days a week each, with the rest covered by income replacement, would help both parents keep their skills up.	9. Removing stigma around fatherhood. I like some of the steps that have been made recently, but fathers (especially stay-at-home-fathers) sometimes get a bad rap, leading them to feel like they have to stay at work and bring home the bacon.	10. Mmmmmm bacon.	11. Bacon breaks aside, also focusing on accessible education. I'm not a big fan of quotas, but making sure our culture is geared towards gender equality in choice of areas of study is important to ensure that people actually have a real choice that isn't impacted by stereotyping or cultures that reject women.	12. The same as above, but for actual jobs as well. There's still some stereotyping, in both directions, that certain jobs are for men or women. 	13. Also encouraging a culture in which it is not unmanly to be supported by your female partner, nor is it offensive to support your male partner.	14. Lastly, a minimum income system or changes to how we pay certain fields might also be useful. However, this is difficult to fix in a capitalist society.		Just to be clear, before my former MRA associates jump on me, I want to be clear that by "encouraging a culture", I mostly mean not shaming people for being different. I fully accept there are some people who honestly believe these things and more power to them in finding the relationships that they find fulfilling. But for every one of them, I feel there are ten who are shamed into thinking that is the only way of doing things; that's what really needs to stop.		I'm sure there are other useful things, but I have to go make bacon. The important thing is, studying why Simpsons' paradox presents itself in studies of pay is important in understanding why women end up, overall, on the short-end of the stick.

Maybe that's not a "major gap" but would *you* want to be making *any* less money because of your gender?     		Another thing that always gets left out of these conversations is our perceptions of the value of jobs that "women do" and the value of jobs that "men do." Women's time is considered inherently less valuable. Take teaching for example. In the US most teachers are women and teachers get shit pay, despite that being perhaps one of the THE most important jobs. But in cultures where teaching is a primarily male discipline or equally balanced between genders, teachers are paid more. Or take doctors for instance. We would also agree that doctors are very important to society. In most parts of the world, being a doctor is a male-dominated industry and is paid very well relative to the rest of society. However, in Russia the majority of doctors are women, and surprise surprise, doctors get shit pay in Russia, and nowhere near the respect doctors get in most other countries.   		It's time to stop dismissing women's lower wages in society overall as being solely due to "women's choices," because that line of thinking has it backwards. The fact is, *even if* women all made the *choice* to go into software development and if that field became female-dominated, *the pay would automatically go down because it is mostly being done by women.* Women's time, women's work, women's achievements, etc., are seen as *inherently* less valuable than men's.

The 23-cent gap is simply the average difference between the earnings of men and women employed "full time." What is important is the "adjusted" wage gap-the figure that controls for all the relevant variables. That is what the new AAUW study explores.		> One of the best studies on the wage gap was released in 2009 by the U.S. Department of Labor.

{"body":"They didn't show what it 'should be' they showed 'what it is when compensating for other factors'.  An example factor is women tend to leave the work force when they have children (more so than men) causing the median age and median experience of women in the workforce to be lower than men in the same career.  That lower median experience and lower median age make the median salary lower.  When compensating for these factors (read eliminating the factors by only sampling women who didn't leave the workforce to start a family) that median wage gap tends to disappear and in some cases even reverses.		What it boils down to is there is a gender wage gap but that gap isn't because employers pay women less than men for the same work with the same experience.  It boils down to personal choices that we make that affect our career path: amount of education, choice of career, area that we live in, amount of time taken off for leisure or to start a family, etc.  Why women and men make different choices regarding these factors is up for discussion. Is it a societal problem?  As a male and expecting father, I'd love to be able to take 6-8 weeks off when my kid is born, but I don't get paid paternity leave. I don't even get guaranteed un-paid paternity leave.  If I take 6 weeks off, I won't have a job to come back too.  My wife does get paid maternity leave.

In the median wage for an SDE that 4% is a $2400 difference, which is pretty sizeable.

However, after women go out on maternity leave they tend to substantially fall behind in earnings (which is why the gap increases so discretely near a particular age). 		Also worth mentioning, is that comparing median wages is nice but it isn't a good actual estimate of the wage gap; the estimate isn't causal in the least. This paper does a pretty good job of explaining the wage gap, and how once you control for a variety of factors it's pretty small (albeit its over a decade old now): http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/events/transatlantic/papers_2003/oneil.pdf		Also another major problem in their analysis is that they're controlling for a bunch of people in different cohorts for wage growth if I've gathered correctly.

{"body":"So imagine that you want to find out the impact of age on a person's earnings. It would be easiest probably to go out and get some cross-sectional data (i.e.: data on a bunch of individuals at one point in time) and then analyze those individuals' ages and come up with a model to estimate what the impact of age on earnings is. But doing this is kind of a poor way of analyzing the impact of age on earnings. Why? Because the people who are older are not part of the same cohort as the younger people. What if the older generation's entry into the labor force was affected by something specific to them (a recession, war, etc.) which changed their outcomes in comparison to the younger generation. Then it doesn't really make much sense to compare the two groups to each other. Basically, it's kind of weird to compare individuals who entered into the labor force at different points in time and lump them together into a kind of "synthetic" or fake cohort. A potentially better method would collect data on a bunch of individuals across time, so that we can track a single cohort and not have to worry as much about the different factors affecting each group of individuals.		The concern when it comes to this specific article is how reliable looking at older aged women in the sample is as a representation of the earnings of the younger women when they get older (i.e.: are the older women good predictions for the younger women).

They could have have created a model that accurately predicts male pay based on variables such as experience, location, education, etc. Let's say that this model has an R^2 of 95% or something -- enough for us to say that it's a pretty good model.		Then, they take this model and apply it to the data they have collected for women. They've asked a whole bunch of women their experience, location, education, etc -- all of the variables required as inputs to the model. So you have a model that is based on all of the expected criteria for pay, and use this to predict female wages for the group of women they've collected data on.		Then you compare the model prediction for the median female wage with the actual median female wage for the same group of women. The difference between the actual wages of the group, and the expected wages of the group given the experience, location, education etc of the individuals within the group is, presumably, down to gender. Once you've controlled (i.e. modelled out) all the other predictors of wage, the remaining difference between actual and modelled wage should be down to the only thing you've changed, i.e. the gender.		So, being a bit charitable, I suspect that this is what they've done. And I don't really have a problem with it - I think it's methodologically pretty good.		However, my problem with it is that it's (presumably) using self-reported data from payscale.com's website.

{"body":"First: people need to understand that FMLA only applies to certain employers (the main one being it only applies to companies with 50 or more *employees* - this word is a legal term of art and most employers try to switch people to 1099 independent contractors, properly or improperly). This basically cuts out truly "small" businesses. You also have to work for a year and have worked 1250 hours over the last 12 months (http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/benefits-leave/fmla.htm for all other requirements)		Second: forcing fathers to take paternity is basically screwing families where fathers make more and work in different/higher paying jobs. For example, I am a lawyer and make a lot more than my SO, who works at a different company. Just random figures - I make $200K and she makes $40K. I have to work at least 60 hours a week, she works around 40. If she gets pregnant, is everyone here really advocating that I should be forced to miss at least three months of work? That should be *my family's* choice, not yours. You have basically fucked us. I am working towards a partner position (owning equity, amazing benefits, huge increase in salary etc). Are you all really advocating that I am forced to leave for 3 months? Thanks, now my ambitions are fucked and so is my family's long term plan. She doesn't believe in abortion, nor does she want one. Condoms break. Accidents happen. Birth control doesn't always work. You have no right to force me to take off work because of some misguided notion of equality. 		Third: if you don't force me to take off work, then you've basically done nothing to rectify the wage gap, because the solution of forced time off is to make sure that employers won't be biased, and to rectify the 3.2-4% gap. If women get longer time then men, how will that help? It undercuts your own solution. If it is equal time, you've basically fucked the family, even if somehow both work the same job at the same pay. Now, all the other single people (or people who are childless) are pulling ahead of both of you. Instead of one person getting a reduced pay lowering family income by 4%, both get reduced pay lowering totally family income by 8%. Seeing as, as other people have pointed out, women actually give birth, I see no way around them actually having to take time off until men can get pregnant or artificial wombs that exist outside the body are created.		There is an issue here, but forced leave is not the solution. A choice of time off would undercut the solution because men wouldn't take off and women would have to. If the woman made far more than the guy, then I can see her taking two-thre months off (or hell, telecommute if possible!) and going back and the father leaves his job to stay at home (people seem to forget that daycare or a nanny can cost nearly 24-30K per year, if not more depending on where you live).  Sometimes, life is just unfair and there is only so much you can do before "solutions" make the problem worse.		Edit: a few words (on mobile at work). Also, I don't mean to come off as overly aggressive but the Facebook comments annoyed me (this whole debate does really) and it has not been a fun morning at work (yay for reddit distractions!). For a more polite version, please check my history for the previous post. Thanks for your understanding.		Edit 2: I think a better idea is covered work arounds (and increased funding for medical technology that would increase the rate of healing after birth, thereby allowing people to take less time off). The solution, to me, is ensuring that women don't have to take time off. Instead of bringing the whole family down by forcing someone to work less, we should be decreasing the time needed to take off and making it easier for mothers to get back to work sooner. For example: breast pumps (covered under ACA now), free employer day care (subsidized by the government so either parent can be at work and go down to visit the baby for feeding/checking on them), and some leave for complications/recovery (obviously), telecommuting (if possible) etc. There are a lot of work around, and the above, I think, is a step in the right direction as it allows for massive flexibility, decreases time away from work, while practically allowing for  parents to not have to spend an arm and a leg trying to make sure baby is taken care of by baby sitter/nanny/daycare.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Gankrhymes","name":"t1_cqm2ibz","parent_id":"t3_33l5sq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429831951,"created_utc":1429803151}

I believe we both agree that encouraging women to become proficient in skills that will lead them into higher paying (STEM) careers is a good thing to do.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zerozed","name":"t1_cqm2gc1","parent_id":"t1_cqlzw98","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429831864,"created_utc":1429803064}
{"body":"I don't think that disparity based on ill-intent and evolving socioeconomic roles are mutually exclusive, and that's a key concept that I think the 'feminist' academics (or perhaps merely academics) are trying to explore and exploit. "Choice" is the flavor that keeps coming up in these discussions. What are the parameters of 'choice'? While your argument is not lost on me and certainly isn't without merit, I think there is good reason to investigate why women are 'choosing' lower paying jobs. Even if this data is accurate and the methodology is sound, there's another layer here, and one that greatly interests me, particularly in other fields, such as management, development, and non-STEM fields that are nonetheless essential.		I do hope that in another 20 years, we will see the gap between gender potential and outcome shrink even more. In fact, I hope we put this issue to rest well before then, when we can show that not only are people of equal experience and talent are valued equally, but that all people have reasonable access to these opportunities, regardless of gender, etc. Probably a pipe-dream, but a decent vision, anyway.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Chique_Fritz","name":"t1_cqm77k8","parent_id":"t1_cqm2gc1","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429839162,"created_utc":1429810362}

This is the kind of thinking that fuels the entire wage gap grievance industry.   Even if you somehow wave the magic wand and erase all cultural history past 10 years ago, men and women are different.     They want different things, they have (in aggregate) different priorities.

Expecting men and women as aggregate groups to always end up equal in every measure is absurd.    At a certain point if women, as a group, on average, decide to make career decisions that are driven less by money and more by other factors (as studies show they do), then they'll fall behind in wages.

The female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.81, slightly higher than the 2008 ratio.  The female-to-male earnings ratio of 0.81 means that, in 2009, female FTYR workers earned 19% less than male FTYR workers. The statistic does not take into account differences in experience, skill, occupation, education or hours worked, as long as it qualifies as [full-time work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time).

A 2010 research review by the majority staff of the [United States Congress Joint Economic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress_Joint_Economic_Committee) reported that studies have consistently found unexplained pay differences even after controlling for measurable factors that are assumed to influence earnings. They attributed this to gender discrimination.  Other studies have found direct evidence of discrimination – for example, more jobs went to women when the applicants sex was unknown during the hiring process. 		>====		>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/xiXuwDv.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_gender_pay_gap,_by_sex,_race-ethnicity.001.png) - *Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, 2009.

{"body":"Salaries are set by the employer. The base line salary is what the employer wants to get away with paying and it's always lower than the potential salary a person could have. If a man ends up making more than a woman or other co-worker for the exact same position, there are several factors that can play in to this. Experience, qualifications and how the male employee negotiated his pay can determine how much he or she ultimately makes. 		I have an anecdotal example but it's actually the best one I can think of. My husband's cousin had finished school overseas where he was from and was here on a visa. He was an an electrical engineer and when he came here he leaned on my husband a lot because America was very new to him. When it came time to interview for a position at this company he came  to my husband not knowing what to ask for because negotiating a salary was not something you did in his country at the time. Where he lived, a very socialist country,  he was use to making only 40k for an 80k job. He was shocked he could ask for so much in the states but ultimately he did despite his nervousness and he got what he asked for. If he hadn't negotiated he would have made so much less and the employer would have gladly paid him a lot less even though they would have been willing to pay more. 		Some people know how to negotiate and have the confidence for it but plenty of people don't even realize you can negotiate for higher pay. Negotiating is something anyone looking for work should learn how to do even if it's a low-wage job. Negotiate everything for the hours you work to your vacation days. If more people started pressuring corporations to pay more then we would get more but too many people are just thankful to have a job and our corporations know it. 		**TLDR; Negotiating salary is the main factor in  determining an employee's salary and not gender.**","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"RadioIsMyFriend","name":"t1_cqm0rd7","parent_id":"t3_33l5sq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429829080,"created_utc":1429800280}

My personal sample size is about 120 filled with previous attorneys, doctors, bankers, and techies who all had 'high level' careers, but decided it was best for the *kids* to stay home while the dad's maintained and climbed the ladder. They will probably work again at some capacity after the kids are grown. I'm just saying, raising a healthy family is more complicated than 'the woman has been pushed into childcare'. Most women, I know, made this choice consciously.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"narcimusic","name":"t1_cqm3bre","parent_id":"t1_cqm2y68","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429833221,"created_utc":1429804421}

Although I think it would be silly for a financial enforcement agency to try to go in and check that people are being paid commensurate with their experience and expertise (and it would possibly be kind of draconian - there may be good reasons for pay differences that aren't apparent to a regulator), I think that having a law on the books that generally supports the notion that companies should not be allowed to discriminate might be a good idea because someone who faces discrimination would have some sense of being supported by civil law. A true dispute could be handled on a case-by-case basis in the courtroom, which is what civil law is for anyway. This creates an economic incentive (and a notion of civil justice) that supports equality.		This is especially true because any discriminated-against group is going to be a minority, and it's ultimately got to be part of the government's mission to protect minorities (i.e., "democracy should be more than two wolves and a sheep deciding what to eat for dinner").		I do agree, however, that there are a lot of injustices right now and there is a right tool for every job.

So half the battle is knowing *what are the injustices*, and the other half is knowing *what is the best way to deal with that*?

There's just so much unfounded claims going on and, as a male, I feel I've experienced my fair deal of inequality as well (try getting a job as a male secretary or receptionist, or even babysitter - good luck with that). And even the things that I used to take mostly for granted that are purely subjective, such as the alleged 'objectification of women', I am not so sure about anymore. I'm not saying there aren't situations where women are 'needlessly' portrayed with too much nudity (booth babes is a practice that comes to mind), but especially comments like [this one](http://imgur.com/gallery/gzTILP2) have made me ponder really hard to what extent the 'objectification of women' can be called 'a problem of inequality'. All the complaints I've seen about how female characters aren't "accurate" or "portrayed in an inequal way" are complaints that could just as easily apply to men if the tables were turned. They're really objectified just as hard as women in that sense.  	&nbsp;  	Of course I realize these things vary somewhat by nation (and I readily concede that there are parts of the world where women unequivocally get the short end of the stick), but where I live I do not feel in any way, at least on a social level, that women are treated worse then men in a general fashion. Even simple things like 'catcalling' (which I can see as an inconvenience to women) seem to rarely happen, at least in my world of experience. And for as far as they do, most of these things have some kind of male equivalent, such as males without a perfect body being yelled at or insulted at random on the street. The fact that women are 'expected to be beautiful' is also mirrored for men, who are just as much expected to fit a certain extrovert 'cool' stereotype.  	&nbsp;  	Are there issues individual women run into in today's society because they are female? Sure. But are there issues individual men run into in today's society because they are male? Yup, that too. Do these two issues happen on a somewhat similar basis? Yeah, in my experience they do.

Which of course is bullshit, because as we've learned from civil rights movements around the world, simply being different is an inexcusable justification for being treated unequally.		If you take away nothing else, let it be that feminism simply means viewing women as equal to men. Yes, there are feminists out there who may hate on men, but they really are the minority, and they themselves don't truly grasp what it means to be a feminist. Most feminists are simply hoping for a world where women don't have to put up with the shit they do because of their gender. Maybe they are minor things (although I disagree), but lots of minor aggressions really add up over time and have a huge effect on how you view yourself in relation to society. Depriving women of that stance is akin to telling people with depression that they're overreacting and to just get over it - it's simply not for you to decide. 		You said you're all for listening if there is a point to hear. So do just that. Don't solidify a notion in your mind that feminism is misguided. Start off, like you had before, with a open mindset that maybe the playing field isn't even. Then listen. And ask. And listen some more. I think you'll find there's a lot more than meets the eye.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vomitfreesince93","name":"t1_cqmgr58","parent_id":"t1_cqmcame","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429853617,"created_utc":1429824817}
{"body":"The thing is, you can *always* find issues somewhere if you just keep looking. The question is whether you should. There's a famous quote about this that escapes me right now. Either way: there is a point where the way you are treated doesn't necessarily have much to do with your gender anymore and rather with how another person views you, or how another person views the world at large. I can argue the exact same point as you are in your second paragraph from a male point of view: the way society views males, and thus views me as a male, can also at times be exhausting and have a huge effect on how I view myself in relation to society.  	&nbsp;  	To bring back my earlier example: what if I'd love to wear skirts in public? Even in my (apparently) fairly safe environment, there would be no way for me to do so without exposing myself to constant ridicule. Are you saying I'm at this point allowed to tell you that it is not for you to decide how I feel about this? That I should start campaigning for men's rights, claim men as a whole aren't treated equally to females and hope for a world where I don't have to put up with the shit I do because of my gender?  	&nbsp;  	The reason I don't do any of the above (apart from the fact that I don't care about wearing skirts) is because unequal treatment isn't per definition a bad thing. We treat the old differently from the young, too. Treating a woman like a woman and a man like a man doesn't have to be negative - it could just be acknowledging the biological and psychological differences between the two genders and slightly adjusting your behavior based on them. Maternity leave is such an example.  	&nbsp;  	In the end, perhaps I should adjust my earlier statement: I'm all for listening if there is a *reasonable* point to hear. And if I hear someone identify themselves as a feminist, and starts telling me that one of their issues exists because of the way society views women in a situation where I, as a male, could have an exactly similar issue... then yes, I will view that person as misguided. The issue there isn't the playing field being uneven, as in this case it is just as uneven for them as it is for me. And the more people announce themselves as feminists to me while making these kind of nonsensical arguments (gamergate comes to mind, where people are constantly hammering on 'the lack of good female characters in games'), the more my view of 'what feminism is' will change. I'm not saying there are *no* issues based on how genders are stereotyped, just that I'm starting to feel like lot of issues traditionally attributed to this may be very simple personal things not necessarily representative of 'society as a whole'. Sometimes, it is as simple as *you* being the issue, rather than society.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mozared","name":"t1_cqmiiiu","parent_id":"t1_cqmgr58","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429856599,"created_utc":1429827799}

Are you saying I'm at this point allowed to tell you that it is not for you to decide how I feel about this?		100%. And in fact there are men who don't fit into the rigid roles our society expects of them, and they are absolutely entitled to live in a world where they can express themselves as they are, as long as it poses no harm to anyone. 		The thing is, no one's saying men are never slighted, generalized, or hurt by society at large. In fact they are, and there are plenty of ways in which our gender norms negatively affect men. Every human being deserves to have their identity respected and deserves to be treated equally. 		*However*, and this is an important however, the reason "men's rights" movements don't (and shouldn't) receive much credibility is because they fail to recognize that while men may be slighted and worse off in various ways, they are far and away the winners of the genetic lottery (especially straight white men). From the moment males are born, they are treated in subtle but noticeably different ways that encourage being vocal, smart, and active: entrepreneurs. Whereas girls are encouraged to be pretty, creative, and caring: mothers and wives. Though it's slowly beginning to change, societies historically have and continue to view men as the protectors and breadwinners of families, and this path is paved and nurtured for them throughout their lives, so that by adulthood, they're much more well-equipped to get the jobs that will put them in those positions. Without the help of progressive educators who see and encourage in women the same they see and encourage in men, women are left to fight expectations. To constantly prove themselves as equal, they have to be vocal, and this is where the stigma of feminism comes into play. 		Education and upbringing notwithstanding, there's also everything that has to do with sexualization and objectification of women as well. Rolling your eyes at this will do nothing to change the fact that it is absolutely true, even in the most progressive of countries. The media is oversaturated with images that are meant to be pleasing to straight men. Again, these things are thankfully starting to change, but at a dishearteningly slow rate. They still exist everywhere. 		Now this next point is **super** important, so please take it to heart. When hearing these types of claims about male privilege, as a male, it's very easy and natural to react defensively. Of course *you* haven't objectified women and *you* don't think of them as inferior. But the point is this isn't about you. This is about men at large; in your country, in the world, throughout history. When considering the lives of others, we need to be able to criticize our own communities without taking it personally. As a white person, this has been my struggle in understanding issues of race. And as a male, this has been my struggle understanding issues of gender. I wasn't always a feminist, and like yourself, found feminists to be over-analytical and needlessly angry. But when I was able to step back from the situation and remove my own self from the equation, I was then able to see that yea, as a whole, men *are* a lot better off than women, and yea, as a whole, white people *are* a lot better off than black people. And moreover, it was the men and the white people that contributed to that inequality: over time, across populations, systematically, institutionally. And it was then as if a light bulb went off. I saw the invisible structure. I heard what these people were telling me and suddenly it wasn't exaggerations and nitpicking but it was their real, lived experiences. Things they faced that were entirely out of their control for which there was no sane reason they had to face them. And then I was able to put myself back into the equation, and ask myself what things I may have been unconsciously doing to contribute to that dynamic, and found that it was a whole lot more than I realized. And I so wish more people were able to do that, because then we'd be a whole lot closer to that more equal world. And quite honestly, what does it hurt? How could it possibly hurt you or any other human to sit back and listen to the problems of others, accept that that's their lived experience, and do something to change it? If nothing else, it would make these people quieter about these issues, and then there would be less ideological battles, and things would just be a little bit better.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"vomitfreesince93","name":"t1_cqmo8tv","parent_id":"t1_cqmiiiu","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429866805,"created_utc":1429838005}

The media is oversaturated with images that are meant to be pleasing to straight men. Again, these things are thankfully starting to change, but at a dishearteningly slow rate. They still exist everywhere.  		But this was my point: sure, I'll readily concede that images pleasing to straight men are everywhere. However, I'm beginning to feel like the balance isn't as out of whack as I've been led to believe: for every 'straight men pleasing image' I see there is a 'straight female pleasing image' to oppose it. As much as women are 'objectified' to sell products, this happens to men in an equal fashion. I would even go so far as to say that the differences in amount that do exist can perhaps be explained by the fact that traditionally men are seen as more visual creatures and that they are thus easier lured to buy products if they are advertised by scantily clad ladies than women are by products advertised by sexy hunks.  	&nbsp;  	I find this to be especially true for games (though also somewhat for movies), and the earlier mentioned complains that 'games do not portray good female characters'. As much as people say that, I'm starting to have a hard time finding a clear example to prove that point - and believe me, I've tried. Even with highly sexualized characters like Bayonetta it is debatable to what extent she fails at being a 'good female character', and I've seen some good arguments for her being exactly the strong female lead feminists claim she is't. Looking at the Guybrush argument I linked earlier, I'm sooner beginning to think that men are more strongly objectified and unfairly treated in games than women, even. In terms of looks, sure - women tend to have perfect shapes and as little clothing as possible. But the same is true for men, who all look like the Hulk. In terms of character, flawed characters are generally male because developers don't even consider making them female; because doing so would make them seem sexist as hell to a 'feminist' audience. That is, I think, a pretty big issue.  	&nbsp;  	In regards to the other things you've mentioned: believe me, I know that on a larger scale there may be work to be done. I spent a year studying history, and the two biggest things I learned from that is that there has A) always been a rich 1-10% and a poor 90%, and that B) women up to the 19th century practically only fulfilled the role of housewive (or nun). In this sense, I know the situations we have come from. But that said, I'm not seeing some of the things you're saying in practice. On the university where I study there is so much more emphasis on women being vocal, smart and active than men. I believe we even have more female students then males, at this point, and last time I heard they were getting better grades. And for me personally, finding a job has been harder than a lot of women I've met. I'm not saying the world is perfect for women, but especially in my surroundings, it seems pretty damn rose colored. The only women I know of that are genuine housewives are those who had the option to choose for a career but simply preferred having kids or just fulfilling the traditional roles instead. Or they are two generations old.  	&nbsp;  	And the thing is: the feminism I have encountered lately has been far more destructive and negative than positive. I wish I could say someone like you is representative of it, but sadly I cannot. Even at the academic level I've ran into issues where "women's studies" are forcibly pigeon holed into classes where they really have no business, purely "because we also need to talk about women". The reaction to a problem should be in line with the scope of the problem, and not overly draconic, and that just isn't what I am experiencing at all. If you would define feminism as "the belief that there are still some situations where women are unequally and therefore unfairly treated to men in a problematic fashion" I could get behind it entirely, but most of my recent experiences with feminists have been outright "DIE MEN DIE", "We NEED to discuss women right now, just because", or at the level of "some guy was looking at my ass when he was walking up the stairs behind me and I was wearing a mini-skirt that the wind blew up!!!". I'm always open to discussion and I see no problems with talking to someone who identifies themselves as a feminist and raises sensible points (like you have), but at the moment it is just not a movement I could comfortably and openly associate myself with.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mozared","name":"t1_cqms62i","parent_id":"t1_cqmo8tv","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429873609,"created_utc":1429844809}
{"body":"As for the games, I can't speak too much to that since I'm not a huge gamer. You may very well be right. Although I will say I think it's toxic and incredibly unproductive to assume what feminists (or anyone) *would* think in a hypothetical scenario. When people project their own understandings about their opponents' arguments, they usually miss the mark and unnecessarily add fuel to the flame. 		Do check out [this article](http://turbomun.tumblr.com/post/80012362197/sameface-syndrome-and-other-stories) though, and then [this one](http://mic.com/articles/113332/the-disturbing-trend-in-almost-every-female-pixar-character-br) as a follow up. The main point to take away from these is that women's beauty is seen as a primary and crucial part of their character, and thus their personalities (and some would go as far to say identities) themselves are disregarded and unappreciated.		And of course there's also the [Bechdel test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test), which continues to serve as a reminder of women's lesser stature in society. The test is used on movies and asks the question, "Does this movie feature A) more than one woman who B) talk to each other C) about something other than men?" You would think it's pretty easy for a movie to pass this test, but you'd be surprised how frequently movies continue to fail it, even today. 		Ultimately, when you (and others like you) describe the brand of feminism you're familiar with, it saddens me. It's already hard enough to open your mind and see issues like these from other peoples' perspectives, and certain people in the feminist community make that even more difficult for others. But I try to tell everyone I talk to about this that as long as *you* believe in the equal treatment of men and women, then you by definition are a feminist, and you shouldn't worry about the stigma that that label carries. Fight the stigma, and show others that feminism doesn't have to be a negative thing. Would you say you're not a citizen of your country simply because you disagree with some of the decisions its government has made? No, of course not, because that doesn't change the fact that you're still a citizen of that country.

Wait a second -- why would *anyone* be actively seeking a low-level menial job like those, or a difficult/dangerous job like the ones you listed (other than firefighting or, very arguably, being a soldier)? 		People seeking work without much education/experience/skill seek whatever job they can get, which meshes with what they can physically/mentally do.		If I'm staffing garbage collectors, I'm looking for people who can easily and repeatedly lift heavy shit all day. Women aren't usually very good at that. Big surprise! If I'm a chick fresh out of high school looking for work, I'm not going to be looking for a job I can't physically do.		For the jobs that involve labor but not strength, such as electrical work, you're right, there *should* be more women in those fields.

{"body":"That would be an astonishing distortion of reality.  Allow me to quote the Atlantic's obituary of the great feminist DeCrow:		>'DeCrow’s foreword to Why Men Earn More—her last text to appear in a book—concluded, “We have been working for gender equality for a short time, given the span of human history. Eventually, it will even up. I am very hopeful.” She always believed that fulfilling this hope requires looking at both sides of gender issues. As we say goodbye to this pioneer of modern feminism, we should ask ourselves if it is the movement’s loss that it did not follow her direction.'		The one and unquestionable message of the MRA campaigns is to ask for equality for *both* sexes. While NOW organisation-- the largest women's rights organisation in the USA--formerly opposed the presumption of joint custody of children, you need MRA groups to bring about equality.		Complaining they are loud and visible is also preposterous. Were they meek and invisible what good would they do.		Wake up. Some rights are indeed zero-sum. But it is a disgrace that women's rights organisations oppose men's rights on non-zero sum. And even with zero-sum rights, the nasty tactical use of the image of female frailty is all too evident in NOW.		It is the women's groups closing down or censoring the MRA groups and not the other way around. You are blinded by your framing of reality.

{"body":"But to begin with, men and women aren't even close to similar within our own species. We completely develop traits and hormones and bodies differently, we're inherently different. And this is beyond a vanity difference, this is a matter of physiology and capabilities by a whole broad consideration of our species. There will never be equality, unless we modify our genes and end up in a cloned state. Or evolution takes us that way. (assuming our species survives to observe such dramatic changes to our composition)		And beyond that, we embrace our differences, we have clear preferences to certain things against the opposite gender. These are determined logically, not economically. Differing personalities and considerations cause us to gravitate towards different choices. Of course there are outliers, but the raw statistics don't lie about these things. They tell us sweet nothings that you can spin anyway you want, but they're not lying to us. We do enough of that to ourselves for the sake of social engagement I'd say. And good on the gap, which is tiny and unimportant by all standards because the only people debating this are from countries it pertains to, and, in probably all these countries, you have the freedom of choice. Claiming you don't is a cop out of laziness and acceptance of the futility of fighting something the size of the entire species. You can go to a job where someone will favor your ideals, and benefit from it. It'll take extra work, but that's basically the story of fighting uphill. It's not exclusive to the professional female, there's always an experience or interest or niche somewhere in something where someone wants to go against the flow and conquer some challenge. Good on them, I hope they get something out of the experience even if it's not their intended goal. In my work place, I face the opposite, where the boss is an overempowered female attitude, and she wants to support females into comfier stand still positions where they do little beyond the social aspect of the job, and position the men into the laborous and manual work. She even does it to a degree that it's easily observable. But it functions well (atleast compared to many other failures on her part) and aside from being questionable by the sensitive, doesn't really pose any problem.		And finally, a fun statistic to throw into the cess pool that is debating this subject most of the time... For shits and giggles I looked up [mortality rates](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/LCWK1_2012.pdf) [warning, 1.6mb pdf]. Man was I daunted by the US's documentation on mortality and the amount of charts and pdfs (I hate opening pdfs off the net, it's just a pain in the ass in my opinion) but ended up wading through the endeavor, and was brought to a giggle by the surprise. In the United States, of what total demographic I am not entirely sure, but from what I gathered and quickly moved on from is; The mortality rates of men ages 15-19, 20-24, and 25-29, were something along the lines of 2-3x higher than that of women. These are what I'd consider to be the high risk age for developing your situation in life. Of course these don't show job-mortality correlations. Those would be hard to gauge, and don't include the risk as well as we'd like for statistics (Which is actually a great thing) The focus is on accidental deaths, which is generally 2+x higher still.

Liberal women are just like conservative women, only that they're stronger because they're less repressed by society, they're just as beautiful but maybe they don't look as pretty because they don't feel like they need men to approve their looks and they're more intelligent because being conservative is correlated with being religious, and being religious with being ignorant (compare, say, uneducated super-religious india with super-educated quite atheistic scandinavia).

{"body":"No, I'm saying we should revert ourselves back to a time when we're not having sex so casually and show a little restraint so we don't have to worry about such percentiles. And by we, I mean both men and women. And if you do choose to have sex casually, using protection to decrease your chances by 98% is far better than that 50% gamble. As far as sex education is concerned, there is sex education in our schools already. Yet you blamed everyone except those who are truly responsible for their child's sex education: The parent. 		But using your own logic against you... Do you know how much damage abortions cause the woman's reproductive system? Are you telling me that women should be allowed to keep killing children, damaging themselves in the process, and when they're finally ready to settle down and start a family... Oh wait, they can't.		> Love isn't forever, friendship is.		Love is the best kind of friendship. If you're not marrying your best friend, you're getting married to the wrong person. What an uneducated thing to say.		Conservative women are the least repressed people in society. Why? Because they're highly educated, generally hold positions of power and are just as successful as their male counterparts. Plus, at the end of the day, they experience all of the freedoms a woman deserves, while at the same time showing self control and constraint. Which in the end, making themselves more free to do whatever they wish. Liberal women tend to lead what I call a fake liberated lifestyle. They're free to live that life, that men truly want them to live. With little self-respect these days, men have won the battle of the sexes. The men of the world would like to thank you feminist, for pushing women to have sex with us.		And for every 10 conservatives that would rather slap their children than let them love someone of the same sex, there are 100 liberal parents unable to slap their children, let alone know the location of their children. Or they don't have to worry about having children, thanks to the birth control abortion. But hey, killing children in the womb is okay, but in the schoolhouse? Outrageous! Liberal Logic 101.

{"body":"(well it's actually slightly lower than 50% without protection actually, kinda). Anyway I don't really see the point of going back to sexual repression, just teach kids to play it safe from a really early age, sex education is too light, it should be more direct and more explicit, in fact, I think that the whole "+18" "ban" to pornography should be removed (except for extreme violence though, sexual content should be, at most, +10, assuming a perfectly consensual display without violence, a depiction of rape would be +18 along with any distortion and unrealism, homosexuality though would still be +10).		Also, most parents are really uncomfortable talking with their kids about sex, why not letting the education system do it for them? Just the whole "this thing goes here and then babies unless you use protection" and the rest is responsibility of the parents, I see no problem here really.		Well, I don't really think that a few pills count as a full-blown abortion, and anyway, the idea is that the, like, 10% of women who, after years of responsible preservative use, still get pregnant somehow (2% failure for condoms, A YEAR, not a lifetime, and accidents happen unless they outlaw alcohol or something), don't have to be forced to conceive before they're ready, there's one thing more damaging than an abortion: Being forced to have a parasite in your uterus (technically, if its not wanted, biologically, it is nothing but a parasite) and then having to take care of it for two decades or feeling guilty forever for leaving it in an orphanage.		I mean that passionate love only lasts like 4 years (as confirmed by science) and then it wears off, that's why "happily" married men and women sometimes have lovers, because they want feel passion again, both in terms of love and sexuality. If only marriages had a half-expiration date, so that partners after being 5 years together still were married but they could fall in love with other people without remorse (polygamy has no downsides), people wouldn't start bitching about how awful their wife/husband is like it's the most normal thing in the world. Life-lasting marriage doesn't work, period.		Conservative women are simply women who hold particularly right-wing views, and that includes both the educated minority and the large, ignorant majority. With liberals is the same, however for some reason educated people are more likely to be left-wing, possibly because religion (and thus 50% of right-wing beliefs) are a product of superstition and ignorance (guess who almost killed Galileo? guess who made Darwin's idea illegal? guess who is using any excuse to stop science in their tracks?). Consequently, conservative women are, on average, only fairly educated, and less so than their liberal counterparts.		Also, they don't experience all those freedoms when they're expected to take care of the kids and serve their husbands (or at least more so than their liberal counterparts). There's no "fake liberated lifestyle", it's an actual liberated one, liberal women don't have to stay at home, they can work if they wish just like men, and just like men they have libido and they want to have sex just like men want to have sex all the time (or almost), feminism isn't about men who want women to "unprotect" themselves from the sanctity of marriage to become their sexual toys, feminism is about women, who, fighting a predominantly male opposition, made it possible for women to choose what to do with their lives, and that includes refusing to marry whoever their parents chose (unlike in the old times) and being able to have sex with those men they deem worthy, who, surprisingly, are only the sexy ones.		Liberals don't discipline their children that much, on one hand that means that sometimes they get too free to do stupid things, on the other hand if they happen to be homosexual, or really like the arts, or simply don't agree with their parents in everything, they don't get beaten up but rather talked to, and possibly their attitude tolerated if it isn't really a problem. Discipline vs freedom, collectivism vs individualism, fascism vs liberty, it's all the same, some people think it's all about behaving, other people (like me) think it's all about letting people make their mistakes, what's the problem with that?		Actually in the first few months "children" are only masses of cells, are you telling me that having a period is also "killing a child" since an actual egg is dying? They don't have a brain, natural abortions happen all the time in the first few months, a regular woman trying to conceive might "kill" dozens of possible children accidentally one after another, as they simply get naturally aborted because of pure chance, only a small portion of fertilised eggs get to become children anyway. Only when they have a brain and can feel pain we can start considering the possibility of abortion being murderish, a small, chemical abortion in the first few months is as murderous as cutting down your hair, just a few cells less.		Nah, actually the average liberal to me is like you to the average liberal, my public school was a lot about "think whatever you wish no matter how stupid it is, I can't even say what I think because I'm not allowed to influence you", while churches are a lot about "this is what you should think and if you think otherwise go to hell you heretic" (for the record: I live in Spain, and teachers wouldn't even tell me what they thought because of their liberal obsession with being objective and impartial).		And by thinking outside of the box I'm going against lots of things in society, for example your average liberal thinks of bisexuality as "ok whatever", I think that it is preferable to heterosexuality (I'm mostly straight though), your average liberal thinks that people should act altruistically, I believe altruism is just a useless remain of religion, your average liberal thinks that religion is acceptable as long as they're tolerant, I wish all churches, mosques and synagogues burned down, after being emptied first and their leaders arrested.		But well, at least I have to thank you for listening, most "educated conservatives" just stop talking to me until I cross the "you're too stupid to debate with me" line, so that's good I guess.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Miguelinileugim","name":"t1_cqrfr51","parent_id":"t1_cqrd2kv","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1430258877,"created_utc":1430230077}

{"body":"Let's say that my starting point was such "liberal brainwashing" which, to be fair, isn't any better or worse than "conservative brainwashing", trying to put any kind of moral/ethical ideals into the mind of a person is brainwashing and indoctrination, be it through a government-owned public school or through a privately-owned church. I'd say that conservatives do it more intensely than liberals, since liberals are rather weak-willed when defending their liberal ideals than conservatives who seem to take theirs real serious.		Anyway, regardless of who is more or less brainwashed, being liberal was my starting point. However as I discovered that morality and ethics didn't make any sense I just stopped believing in them, and without religion nor "liberal" morality and ethics (nor the conservative ones) I just became amoral.		And turns out that liberalism is closer to amorality than conservatism, so I might consider myself an "extreme liberal" if by liberal we call everything that isn't conservative in direct proportion to how non-conservative it is. So I'm not "liberal" since that's moderate and I'm not conservative since it's the opposite of my position, conservatives take morality and ethics very seriously, especially the traditions, liberals are more relaxed and I'm 100% relaxed and literally don't have any morality at all.		That doesn't mean I go out there killing people, it just means that I live for myself and to become as happy as possible. So for example while conservatives might say "don't have sex until marriage!", and liberals might say "have sex if you want but don't go overboard", I say "have sex in whatever way makes you happiest".		So yeah, it's not brainwashing, it's simply un-brainwashing myself from liberal ideals into amorality, without embracing the other kind of brainwashing known as conservatism.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Miguelinileugim","name":"t1_cr0w481","parent_id":"t1_cr0ieeb","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1430988696,"created_utc":1430959896}

{"body":"I don't have any comments on all the studies or whatever but I do have some relevant personal experience on the topic.		I work in IT in a large fortune top 10 company.  I graduated from a state college a few years ago with a bachelors in Management Information Systems.  About 10% of my college graduating class with my degree were women.		I was hired into my company at the same time as about 35 other college graduates with similar IT degrees.  We were all hired with the same starting salaries.  6 of the 35 were women.		Since then 3 of the 6 women have been promoted into supervisor positions, which have higher pay.  Only 1 of the 29 men have gotten that promotion.  There's no way I can prove it to any of you but I know all 6 women well enough to say with confidence that neither their technical nor organizational aptitude is significantly better than many of their male counterparts.		Within our company's IT organization as a whole I would guess that it's 80% to 90% men and 10% to 20% women, which seems to roughly align with the male/female ratio with IT degrees.  However, around 50% of all supervisors and management positions (upper and lower) are filled by women.  Our CIO is female and 40% of the senior level managers reporting to her are female.		In our company culture you have to be extremely good at what you do to get a promotion as a male.  As a female you are pretty much guaranteed to get a management promotion unless you specifically don't want it or are extremely terrible at your job.		A wage gap may exist at some places but it's not everywhere.		Now I will say that our finance organization is probably 75% women, and our accounting jobs always have lower starting salaries than our IT jobs.  So since most finance people are women and those jobs pay less and most IT people are men and those jobs pay more does that mean there's a wage gap?  I would argue no, since a finance degree as a whole (male or female) does not get the same pay as an IT degree.  Gender has nothing to do with it beyond that fact that not as many women chose the higher paying career.  It seems like according to some of these studies that does qualify as a gender gap because both types of degrees are undergrad bachelors and are assumed to be apples to apples.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jr712","name":"t1_cqm6b8m","parent_id":"t3_33l5sq","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429837812,"created_utc":1429809012}

{"body":"A large reasons or the pay gap is that women are less likely to get high paying jobs. We know that more women go to college, and therefore more women should be qualified for professional positions, but that is not the case. Partly this is discrimination, both in hiring and promotions. The fact that society expects the women to play a larger parenting role than men is also a big part, as often the mothers career takes a backseat to having children while the father is expected to parent indirectly by providing, rather than an equal parenting partnership. Another part is that many women do not pursue more competitive fields, which is likely due to the fact that society traditionally places greater emphasis on leadership and professional ambition for men than women while women are raised with more familial ambition in mind.		It's kind of like how as a kid, role models marketed towards girls are princesses while boys ar expected to like superheroes. It's also a self-fulfilling prophecy. You grow up and see that no woman has ever been president and you think "I guess I wouldn't be a good president" and you can't even imagine yourself in that role. Same which such things as famous scientists and CEOs-- so few female role models convinces girls that it's not something girls do, and many will not pick up the interest. Minorities have been battling that too, but we as a society have grown to accept that race is purely a difference in physical appearance rather than competence and intelligence and leadership abilities. The rampant belief that women and men are so inherently different makes young girls feel the need to live up to that identity.

{"body":"You're right. Companies are still going to try and recoup the cost of either the missing labor (unpaid maternity) or paid leave (paid maternity) by decreasing earnings potential over the long run. I don't agree with it, but it goes on. When a lot of people say there's a wage gap, that's the first thing I think of - "Well, yeah, the greedy company you work for wants to make up the difference from the time off that maternity leave gives you." That, among other things, of course, could and does contribute to some small wage gap at certain companies in certain parts of the country.		As for the gender thing: The FMLA guarantees two weeks off without risk of job loss for any "family emergency" to both genders. As in, your mom dies, you can fly home and attend the funeral, and not be worried about a job loss in the mean time. I don't believe that men are entitled to the full 12 week paternity leave though, I'll look into it to confirm.		EDIT: Looks like you're right - newborn child leave can be up to 12 weeks unpaid or paid, and must extend to mothers and fathers equally - also must be taken within a year of child birth or adoption, and if mothers get paid maternity leave, fathers must get paid paternity leave as well.		So why did I think otherwise? Well, because at the time my kid was born, I was a contractor, see, and the same rights don't extend to contractors as full time employees.

{"body":"Most of the wage gap can be explained via compound interest (and people starting off in lower paying careers). Since the starting salary for your next job or position is generally a percentage increase over your previous salary your starting salary essentially acts the same way as a retirement fund. 	For example a male who starts out in a position that makes 60K vs a female who starts out in a position making 50K assuming a 3% raise every year for both at the end of a 40 year career the person who started out making 60K would be making $31K more than the Female who started out making 50K.		Then if you assume a female has two kids over there career (year 5 and year 10) and in those two years they don't get a raise the difference at the end of a 40 year career ends up being 40K. If you even assume that the woman started off in a lower paying job track and changed careers in year 8 and was given a 20% raise in their new job at the end of a 40 year career the woman is still going to be making 16K less than the man.		The key is for women to start in higher paying jobs and teaching women to negotiate every salary, be more willing to leave their companies etc but nothing is more important than your first salary. One thing I will say is that companies with diverse leadership perform better in the long term than companies that lack it. So this payscale visual doesn't really explain the under representation of women at the senior level.

{"body":"**/tldr There is a genuine gender gap that remains in this country.  It's not as large as what is often cited, but it's there.  It will be very hard to untangle.  For the most part, people yelling about it on the Internet aren't yelling about the real it.**		[The same research](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/lean-out-the-dangers-for-women-who-negotiate) also typically demonstrates that women are penalized when they negotiate, particularly if they negotiate like a man.  Thus, the gap you cite is an example of the modern manifestation of gender inequality.  Not because men negotiate and women don't.  But because men are rewarded and women punished for negotiation (so they often don't negotiate), leading to an easily misinterpreted statistic.		My understanding is that most of the more serious researchers on this topic understand that it's not simple 1960's discrimination at play.  They also recognize that the true gap is much smaller than the oft-cited political gap (more in the range you describe).  		It's also going to be very hard to undo because that remaining gap is bundled into tightly interwoven societal patterns.  We're talking about things like parenting, putting careers on hold for family (required of the woman, rarely for the man), social norms for things like negotiation (your point), and social patterns that emerge in early education pushing gender norms over personal capabilities (evident very early in education). 		Addressing these requires some serious, and certainly discomforting, discussion and it's often just far easier for each side to scream at each other.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ryahl","name":"t1_cqn5hsb","parent_id":"t1_cqn0o27","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1429912244,"created_utc":1429883444}

{"body":"If you are the hiring manager, damn you are sexist and racist. 		I kid. Its more the idea of the 30 whatever cents wage gap that I find bullshit. Most the time I see studies that "confirm" the wage gap, all my wives friends talk about it. Most of the studies that they bring up just go of how much are men paid versus women paid. They don't control what fields they poll or experience or time off of work/ out of career field. 		To me, that invalidates the study and doesn't prove a wage gap at all. It merely shows the men overall make more money than women. To see what the issues are with why this is happening, we need to look at	what careers each sex is choosing. Recently there was an awesome infographic showing a good amount of research into many people of each sex is in each field. It also showed median income for each field. What you can get from the graph is that the fields that tend to make more money, seem to have more men except for a few. But some of the lowest earning jobs have mostly women in it. Why are they like that? There are some theories out there but I'm just some lowly internet user just trying to make a point with some data that he thinks he understands. 		To give you what I think about the wage gap, is its there. Just not 30 cents. Its more like +/-2-4 percent. A few studies way back went over some of this and they went and found pairs of people, one male vs one female and compared them in many fields by work ethic, work experience, time out of career and a few other variables. It showed what a lot of other studies that have looked into wage increases for male and females over time did. That when you look at two people with equal experience, career time and time out of career, there is a difference of +/-2-4%. Nothing close to the 30 cents per dollar level, but still there. I would love to see this brought down to 0% difference.
