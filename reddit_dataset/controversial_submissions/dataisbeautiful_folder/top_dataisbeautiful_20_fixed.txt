{"body":"I think there is a serious division in this subreddit. I've been a subscriber here for a while, and when it had fewer subscribers it was all about DATA is beautiful. That is, it was meant to be an antithesis to subreddits like /r/pics. This sub was designed to highlight the INHERENT beauty of a good dataset and, furthermore, the "beauty" of being able to visualize lots of data quickly and easily in the simplest way possible. The beauty of good statistics, rather than a requirement for literal, visual beauty. Over time, as more people subscribed, the content has shifted to mean something like "beautiful data," or "artistic masterpieces that just happen to be derived from data," like the recent post on [ubuntu package dependencies](http://i.imgur.com/8yHC8.jpg), which looks visually stunning, but actually conveys almost no information.		To illustrate this distinction, just look at the subreddit FAQ which was written long ago:		>Does appearance matter?	Yes! But pretty pictures are not the aim of this subreddit. Posts should strive to present information as effectively as possible. Part of that process is visual design. Default output from Excel, R, mapping programs, etc. can be overly cluttered and hard to understand. Try looking at font sizes, erroneous grid lines, alignment, and aliasing. A lack of good design ultimately limits the ability to convey information. 		>However, NEVER downvote because you think a post is ugly. If you have some design experience, PLEASE add some constructive criticism, so people know how to improve.		Anyway, the point is, every time a data-centric post gets made (like this one), people complain that it's ugly, and then when a beautiful but data-lacking post gets made, the other people complain that it has no interesting data. I think both types of posts are fine (unless we're big enough to split off into two subreddits), but I'm just tired of constantly seeing comments from one side who doesn't understand the other side's point of view.","depth":1,"score":335,"ups":335,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Memeophile","name":"t1_cgcfajf","parent_id":"t1_cgcabgo","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1395877390,"created_utc":1395848590}

The OP may have 'politics', but it was straight forward and assuming the numbers are right, there is absolutely no twist of the data. And really, it's only a political graph because people have made it one. That's also kinda of the point --- why so many deniers when essentially zero scientist reject man-made global warming. It's a lot less political than all those income related posts because with those, the issue is more complicated since people don't argue that wages aren't stagnant for the middle class or that the the rich aren't getting richer, they argue about the importance of that information (would taxing differently affect it, should we do anything, is stagnant even bad if it's adjusted for inflation, etc). 		edit: If the OP had been presented with a political bias, it may have done something like % of people who do (or do not) believe in man-made global warming by education level.  Then, the data is not as straight forward since it would lead to more complex political discussion. 		Another example is if a post had % believe in god or evolution by country. If it's straightforward question and presentation, it's just reflecting the facts. However, if it tries to compare that by income or education level, then it may begin to feel political.","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"daimposter","name":"t1_cgcqskd","parent_id":"t1_cgcgfhv","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1395900285,"created_utc":1395871485}

Some have mentioned that they appreciate what this pie chart conveys, and view it as beautiful.

I concede, though, that part of the reason I didn't think of this submission as 'beautiful' was because it was visually not-so-appealing; it looks like a chart hastily drawn up in Excel with little effort put into making it look nicer, and that grates with me. 		I appreciate what information the data is trying to convey, but the claim that "Global Warming is supported by 99.999% of scientists" combined with the (forgive me, OP) sloppy presentation gave me the impression that it looked to gain support/upvotes via the hivemind-circlejerk nature of Reddit rather than really trying to follow the spirit of /r/dataisbeautiful (its spirit, the way I interpreted it).","depth":2,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PioUnique","name":"t1_cgcfla6","parent_id":"t1_cgcfajf","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1395878027,"created_utc":1395849227}

Several weeks before the [Copenhagen Summit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference) on climate change, an unknown individual or group breached CRU's server and copied thousands of emails and computer files to various locations on the Internet.		>The story was first broken by [climate change critics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy) on their blogs,  with columnist [James Delingpole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Delingpole) popularising the term "Climategate" to describe the controversy.  Climate change critics and others [denying the significance of human caused climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial) argued that the emails showed that [global warming was a scientific conspiracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_conspiracy_theory), in which they alleged that scientists manipulated climate data and attempted to suppress critics.   The accusations were rejected by the CRU, who said that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas.  		>The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over [climate change mitigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) began in Copenhagen on 7 December.  Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a [smear campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign) intended to undermine the climate conference.  In response to the controversy, the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science) (AAAS), the [American Meteorological Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Meteorological_Society) (AMS) and the [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Concerned_Scientists) (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the [Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding "based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society." 		>		---		^Interesting: [^Hockey ^stick ^controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_controversy) ^| [^Climate ^Audit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Audit) ^| [^Climatic ^Research ^Unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit) ^| [^Stephen ^McIntyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_McIntyre) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cgcb1mq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cgcb1mq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autowikibot","name":"t1_cgcb1mq","parent_id":"t1_cgcb1hm","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1395866329,"created_utc":1395837529}
