{"body":"I don't think comparing the number of deaths is the proper statistic to show here. You should compare age-adjusted death rates, which shows the estimated years of life lost (YLL) to each cause. Cancer, for example, kills mostly elderly people and is tremendously diminished by the YLL statistic.		**Edit:** If you would like to see a proper comparison of death rates in the U.S. according to the YLL statistic -- performed by actual researchers on the topic -- please head on over to [GBD Compare](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/). There they compare the YLL for all causes of death in the US.		To save you some time searching, here's a screenshot of the YLL comparison: [link](http://i.imgur.com/nv1XmWR.png)		**Violence (i.e., murder) accounted for 2.26% of all years of life lost in the US in 2010 -- roughly 1,000,000 YLL in total.

I actually think it's still pretty beautiful, but the meanings of the larger groupings could be made more clear.		I have one question for you regarding the data. How are you handling abortion and miscarriage from chromosomal abnormalities? I would have thought it would be in the preterm section, but then I would expect the preterm section to be much larger. Or does preterm only refer to deaths caused after birth but due to issues that arise while still gestating?","depth":2,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Intropy_","name":"t1_cseench","parent_id":"t1_csebwvi","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434970914,"created_utc":1434942114}
{"body":"Thanks! Re: the larger groups, definitely one of the challenges with it was making it useful to a wide variety of audiences. When I originally made it, it was just as a tool for vetting data and statistical models internally - after I passed on the project to another team it got turned into something public facing. So it sort of suffers from originally being intended for a niche audience who already were familiar with most of the terms. There's a new version coming out soon that should be much more user friendly!		Re: abortion, there are no death certificates issued for abortions (just as there are of course no birth certificates), so those cases would not be counted in the US vital statistics data which we use for this analysis. The CDC does collect some data from states that voluntarily provide it, which you can find at e.g. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6208a1.htm		For ICD10, I believe the preterm section includes death certificates with underlying cause of death attributed to ICD codes P01.0-P01.1, P07, P22, P25-P28, P61.2 and P77.

We've seen that happen over and over again.  Issue groups do it, and even broader loose affiliations do it.  One of the biggest mobilizations of this sort was the pre-planned invasion of Iraq which unfolded after 9/11, for example.		I want to clarify that I honestly didn't think that the Neocons "caused" 9/11, at least not specifically.  But they were ready to capitalize on whatever big news event may give them the excuse to push their goal.  They would've been just as happy with an Iraqi encroachment into Syria, a "vaguely Middle-Eastern" assassination against a U.S. ally, or Iran destabilizing southern Iraq.		What I'm saying is that the Neocons had their plans already laid out, with a number of alternate plans, and they waited for a news event that would allow them to leverage public outrage and/or confusion into a full blown agenda.  Groups like Greenpeace and The Brady Campaign all have plans like this that they're sitting on.		Constantly scanning the headlines, they wait for an event that fits, then they dust off that manila envelope full of talking points, drafted legislation, and boogeyman stories.

Just practice your draw and gain that muscle memory, and practice reliably hitting your target without aiming traditionally.

I've known people who do this, but I don't. I always try to find some kind of data before I swing either way, on any topic. Stereotyping is bad, but this one at least has some founding.

This stems from many people believing that things like Assault weapons bans are at attack on their culture and rights. In most cases the supporters of these things only mean well, but that isn't often the perception. There is also the perception that some pro gun control supporters have which is pro-gun people are angry racist bigots(I've been on the receiving end of this).

A study undertaken by a group led by criminologist Dr. Gary Kleck of Florida State University found that there are approximately 2.1 to 2.5 million instances annually in which individual Americans use a gun to defend themselves. Considered as households, the figure is 1.3 to 1.5 million annual DGUs (Kleck 1995, Table 2). If this figure is correct, defensive uses of firearms are much more common than crimes committed with guns. Kleck's study defines a DGU as a defensive action against a human (rather than an animal), involving actual contact with the person being defended against, in which the defender could state a specific crime which he or she thought was being committed at the time of the incident, and in which the defender's gun was actually used in some way, even if it was only as part of a verbal threat. A reported DGU incident must meet all of these criteria in order to be counted as a valid DGU for the purposes of the survey. Additionally, DGUs associated with work as a policeman, security guard, or member of the military are excluded.		- Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics 1994, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Dept. of Justice	SuDoc# J 29.9/6:994 (1994)			Or maybe you want a middle ground estimate? 		>Middle estimates have estimated approximately 1 million DGU incidents in the United States.[1]:		- Harry L.

{"body":"so you seem to have two separate questions		to the first, mexico is at 21+, and yes that does spill over. go look at the map in my original link, countries tend to be gradients. So the same way some of the violence from eastern europe spills into central europe, mexico spills into america. I mean a lot of the drug trade (responsible for a bulk of the violence) is with america.		to the second, what you listed is an awful metric. violence is higher, even per capita, in high density areas. So if you use states, which corrects for that by including cities and smaller areas you see a strong bias [towards the south](http://www.businessinsider.com/maps-on-fbis-uniform-crime-report-2013-9). Not obviously this isnt perfect, states arent an ideal way since montanna would ave fewer large cities than california. And we still see outliers like michagan. But the trend is pretty strong. We can even support this by the fact that the [FBI believes 80% of violent crime is from gangs (ie the drug trade)](http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/FedCrimes/story?id=6773423) (I personally think 80% is high but whatever). Another great influence is from our income disparity.		Look im not trying to say america is perfect, or the model every country should abide by.

In some large cities here you can be mugged or worse for walking a street over too far at night.Maybe I'm overlooking things, but my own conclusion was that America's society and culture is one that allows for more violent crime.

{"body":"There are still casualties of the dramatic coverage of mass killings, though. For example, individual school districts have spent millions of dollars (that in many cases they didn't even have in the first place) implementing security measures directed solely at preventing such events, despite the fact that mass shootings account for a negligibly small percent of student deaths. That money could have not been borrowed (saving the town a substantial financial burden) or spent improving or expanding the actual educational programs provided by the schools, or even directed towards improving school food or educating young people on safe driving - all of which would probably prevent vastly more deaths and injuries.		Schools which implement strict security measures also typically result in a much more prison-like environment, restricting students movements, preventing them from entering/leaving the building while school is in session (even if they aren't in class), etc. In some environments that is probably wise; in others it destroys the cooperative, respectful atmosphere of an otherwise successful school. 		That said, I think mass murders in schools *are* more important than just the number (or age) of people killed. The effect is very concentrated and can really ruin a whole community of people, much like what happened to some communities in the world wars when platoons were divided by hometown. The platoon might be much more tightly bound, but it wasn't all that uncommon for a whole platoon to be wiped out, and if all those soldiers were from the same town, it resulted in a sort of devastation that is not reproduced when that suffering is more spread out.		TL;DR while I do think that the significance of preventing mass murders is more than just the number of deaths prevented, because such events tend to have disproportionate effects on communities, I also do think that we spend too much and sacrifice too much for the sake of their prevention.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sticklebat","name":"t1_csedlrc","parent_id":"t1_csecaos","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434968720,"created_utc":1434939920}

Look at Chicago and DC before the bans, they were heavily controlled gun zones and had very high levels of gun violence.		In both of those cities, gun crime reduced dramatically after concealed permits began being issued. If we were to enact sweeping gun bans you would see more results like DC and Chicago. Gun laws don't remove guns from criminals, they remove them from law-abiding citizens.		And if you don't care if you live or die, you will easily be able to find a gun, or find another way to kill tons of people (knives, bombs, vehicles, etc).  Which is really where the problem should be focused.  In the case of Charleston, people KNEW what he was going to do, so much so that they confiscated his weapon. We need a much better system of dealing with mental health issues, often times these shooters are known to have a problem and yet we don't do anything until they kill people.

Not every country is the same but you take the information and data from a number of resources and make the best possible decision.  		Why do people use the "only takes guns our of law-abiding citizens hands" scare tactic?  I understand the concern but long term rationality is lost on me.  If you make it a much more involved and longer process to that goes far beyond our current background checks (like Australia), coupled with a buy back program (like Australia) the long term effect on gun numbers in America would drop dramatically.  Plus, you enact legislation that makes the penalties for owning an un-documented firearm much more severe.  Eventually, I believe, the end goal would be a shift from a gun-crazy culture with gun shows and mass produced weapons, to one that allows limited gun ownership to those that have actual reasons for owning it (so law-abiding citizens can still own one) along with coupling those reasons with the actual firearm being owned. Like a need-to-know categorization for security clearance levels, if you want a firearm for self-defense, you can own a handgun.  If you want to hunt deer, you can have a single hunting rifle, and so on.  		To me it's not about outright bans on all firearms.  It is implementing a system that documents and greatly restricts the amount of firearms in this country to what is absolutely necessary.  Yes, maybe it will be years before there is a significant drop in firearms, but we have to start somewhere.		Edit: Also, where did you hear about someone confiscating the Charleston shooter's weapon?  I can't find it online and it would be an interesting read.

There are countries in the world that have less than 1/10th the amount of firearms per resident as the US, which completely outlaw guns, and they STILL have gun crime.		If the US were to outlaw guns completely, they would still be prevalent for many many decades (assuming they declined after that). In that time, you would have crime similar to cities that have enacted rigid gun control (Chicago and DC are good data points). From recent history, we know that gun crime would go up during this time.  Is that fair to the citizens who want to protect themselves?		The crazy gun culture we have here is not the culture that kills people with guns. There are 300 million guns in the US, many people concealed carry. In my state, arguably one of the most "gun crazy" almost 10% of the adult population carries a concealed weapon. And yet we NEVER hear of someone who conceal carries committing gun crime.		It's been shown with actual real world examples in the US, that when gun laws tighten, gun crimes increase. Criminals don't care about following the law, and guns will still be easy to acquire even if you reduce the number in this country by half (which would be a massive undertaking). It's just not reasonable to expect that enacting tighter gun laws in the US will reduce crime, there is too much evidence to show the opposite.		Gun hiding link.

{"body":"Like I said, I don't advocate banning guns.  I'm only advocating that the lawful ways to obtain a gun are exponentially tightened and that the penalty for owning an unregistered firearm be extremely severe.  Do you object to both points or just one?  I understand owning a gun to support a hobby you have (hunting, target shooting, etc.) or to protect yourself.  However, I do not agree with gun collecting being the actual hobby.  I see no downside to those two proposals unless you feel the need to create your own personal arsenal. In my opinion, any type of law/buy-back would have to be on at the federal level in order to prevent people from circumventing these new laws (like criminals may have done in Chicago and DC but law-abiding citizens may not be willing to circumvent).  This is not about ending all gun violence immediately, this is about getting rid of the market (and therefore mass-production) of firearms in this country.  A large number of illegal weapons are obtained legally and then sold or lost into the criminal world.  If Mr. GunOwner was only allowed to have 1 handgun to protect his home and 1 rifle to go hunting, he would be much less inclined to give away or sell one of his 2 guns and it would be less likely that he would lose track of those 2 firearms.  		Finally, I don't see how enacting any amount of new mental health laws or initiatives would have saved anyone in regards to the Charleston case.  From that article listed it does not look like the threat was relayed to any type of authority and therefore, nobody had the information to act upon it.  I am absolutely not against new initiatives to help those with mental disease before a crisis (this likely would have helped avoid the Washington Navy Yard Shooting), I'm just saying Roof probably would have still fallen through the cracks.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"glxyjones","name":"t1_csg2y3h","parent_id":"t1_csfxbdg","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435108406,"created_utc":1435079606}

The point of the post isn't to not focus on it being a horrific tragedy, it's that if the murderer hadn't done it with a gun via mass shooting, he probably would have built explosives or something and blown the church up.		The point OP is making is not to focus on the vector of murder but on what's motivating this hateful fuck in the first place. 		Let's not get all hung up on solving this via gun laws is what OP (IMHO) is saying, because that will miss the point that shooting was how this guy expressed all this hate, and solving shooting won't fix that, trying to attack, degrade, destroy and deny this culture of hate and white supremacy will do that.		I feel as though focusing on the picture OP linked to as if it's saying to ignore this event is to miss the point entirely. The idea is to not miss the forest (white supremacy, hatred, racism) for the trees (that it was done by pistol and not fire, bombs, or poison)		Mass shootings are rare, rare events.

Koper, Daniel J. Woods, and Jeffrey A.

Those are the ones you'd want to go after if you want to put a dent in the number of murders.		The problem is that most gun control proponents are people without much knowledge about guns and don't know much about the issue. So their ideas are usually not very logical or well thought out.

Either all of those people have somehow failed to read the rebuttal posted *every single time* it's used, or those people know full well that it's a bullshit claim but deliberately ignore it so they can continue to believe they're correct.		I'll give you the benefit of the doubt in assuming you're the former possibility.		The claim that the UK has more violent crime than the US uses each country's definition of "violent crime". Sounds reasonable, you might think. Except that the US uses a much, *much* narrower definition.		In reality, despite its predictably higher rate of knife crime, the UK has a *vastly* lower violent crime rate than the US, if we use only the US definition of "violent crime". Whereas in the UK, "violent crime" includes things like simply shoving someone, in the US it is one of just four crimes: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape of a female, robbery, and aggravated assault. The US has higher rates of *every single one of those things* than the UK (although rape rates in the US are only very slightly higher).		 Hopefully that's cleared that up for you.

Mass murders are sad as well, but they do not deserve national attention when the hugely more common single murders are all but ignored.

{"body":"**Moderate position** (Trying to be fair to both sides while giving some weight to implicit argument in OP):		The point is that, in policy, there are always competing values that are being sacrificed. Whether or not you think that owning an assault rifle is a good or bad thing, there is at least some argument to be had for the value of owning assault rifles. Putting the amount of deaths from mass shootings "in perspective" means that we can more accurately assess the moral value we should assign to preventing these deaths relative to the moral value of preserving the right to own an assault rifle. It may be that one is more important than the other, but the debate over gun regulation (that is, pro-regulation) tends to overstate the frequency of mass shootings in order to strengthen the case against private assault rifle ownership.		There are two main points you have to accept for this argument to make sense. First, *human lives are not infinitely valuable* - life is an incredibly important value, and it makes sense to give saving life a lot of moral weight, but "saving lives" isn't a value which always and everywhere outweighs a competing value. For example, it is possible that banning sky-diving would save a single life every year, but most people would generally agree that this isn't sufficiently important enough to actually justify banning sky-diving.		Second, there are either other relevant competing values which can rise to the level of rivaling small (but non-negligible) amounts of human death, *or* that there is a general moral presumption in favor of some particular value that gun control sacrifices. For example, libertarians sometimes get derided for relying too heavily on the "because muh freedoms" argument, but most of us, outside of the gun control debate, actually recognize that "freedom" is a relatively important value. There may be times in which it is justified to limit freedom (again, not taking a position on gun control here - maybe the issue is sufficiently grave to warrant restrictions), but, barring some exceptional circumstance, we should err on the side of a *moral presumption* in favor of libertarian social policy.		Now, gun control (if the traditional pro-regulation position is correct, and I realize that this is a subjective of dispute, but that's more of a technical issue than a broader moral one) might save a non-trivial number of people. But is that enough to justify sacrificing some competing value? Maybe, maybe not.		I think the more interesting question is that technical point: whether or not a policy like gun control actually accomplishes its stated objectives. That renders the broader moral debate (which can get a little murky - who really knows how many lives are necessary to justify restricting rights? The "any saved life is worth it" argument seems ridiculous, because it could literally justify any form of regulation that could plausibly prevent a death, but it also seems like, if hundreds of thousands of people are dying from plague, maybe restricting peoples' movement by a quarantine is okay) irrelevant.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HippeHoppe","name":"t1_cse7uhs","parent_id":"t3_3an7hw","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434956428,"created_utc":1434927628}

{"body":"> Firstly, States with more gun regulation have less gun violence.		I never said that they didn't? In fact, I never even argued that gun control didn't work, nor that gun control isn't worth doing. It may very well be that gun control is a worthwhile policy and we should do it!		I only argued that the logic of "any lives/any risk of lives saved" isn't sufficient justification for gun control. When people say that "If gun control saves one person's life, then it's worth doing", they aren't just being hyperbolic: they're actually forwarding that as a justification for gun control (because they view it - technical debate about its effectiveness aside - as a 'no risk' option), whereas this probably isn't the case: there are costs to gun control, the most obvious is simply the freedom to own a gun. That freedom might not be *super important*, but neither is the freedom to go sky-diving: in each case, we assign freedom, as a value of its own, at least some importance.		>This is a fact. This is not only insultingly obvious to the rest of the gun-regulated world where constant gun violence doesn't occur, but it has been empirically observed here in the U.S.		Now, I'm not super well-informed on the gun control debate, which is why I tried to write a moderate post - I don't have a really strong view either way. But there are two points to consider:		1) What you've said is in no way evidence for the efficacy of gun control. That gun control states have lower gun-murder rates than non-gun control states is not evidence that gun control is actually responsible for lower murder rates. It may be a case of correlation rather than causation: for example, liberal states with strong gun control may have lower poverty rates, stronger economies and better social institutions generally than conservatives, more rural states with high poverty rates, weak economies, and little to no police protection. Hospitals have higher death rates than the general population, but this doesn't mean that hospitals are so dangerous and responsible for death.		2) Second, it's not "insultingly obvious" - it's an issue of academic debate, and it's insulting to dismiss your opponents without doing adequate scholarly research (a Huffpost article is hardly a deep survey of the academic literature). Maybe people don't disagree with you because they're evil or stupid: maybe there actually are arguments for the positions you oppose.		[Here's](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf) a comprehensive Harvard study that seems to condemn gun control as counterproductive: according to the study, gun control may actually make society more dangerous. I don't know if that's true (again, I don't have a strong view), but Harvard Law School (currently #2 in the world) is probably a pretty credible source.		>Furthermore, to compare death by skydiving to mass shootings is a false equivalency. Individuals that die as a result of skydiving do so doing an activity they chose to do, whereas the victims of mass shootings have no choice in the matter, and the actions that lead to their deaths are not actions within their control.		Driving carries with it the possibility of homicide. In fact, far more Americans die as a result of reckless or even purely accidental (no fault of the driver) driving than as a result of mass shootings (twice as many people die in car accidents annually than *all* homicides in the US). Does it follow that the government ought to ban automobile ownership?		True, automobiles have purposes other than killing people - but assault rifles do too (amusement, decoration, masculine self-esteem issues, etc. etc.). My argument is not that the two things are equivalent, but that they are similar in two respects: that banning them comes with some real cost (the loss of freedom), and that banning them may (theoretically) save lives (potentially stopping murders in both cases - yes, people commit murder with automobiles).		>If you'd like an actual valid comparison, try driving. As with gun ownership, owning a vehicle involves utilizing a possession that places other people conceivably at risk; a possession that when used improperly can kill other people. Yes, people have the right to own a vehicle as well as valid reasons to use them, but look at how much regulation we have in driving: Must you get licensed to drive? Yes. Are there restrictions on the type of vehicle you can own and operate? Yes. Must you get insured to operate a vehicle? Yes. Must you register your vehicle with the state? Yes. Are there restrictions and regulation on transferring ownership of vehicles? Yes. Are there restrictions on where owners can operate their vehicles? Yes. Are there limitations on how you can operate then? Yes.		I guess you anticipated my second example. The skydiving example's purpose was to show that a human life is not infinitely valuable: that the argument that a policy saves a life is not sufficient justification for adopting that policy. In this sense, all three of these regulatory proposals are similar.		And I never said that I was opposed to any of this (or even that I was opposed to banning assault rifles!). I only said that each of these incrementally damages an individual's freedom, and that this is a real value that deserves consideration (if the government were to require years of security clearance and background checks before allowing you to skydive, we would all think that's ridiculous, no? Even if, in the end, you were still permitted to skydive: that's because the inconvenience of these additional regulations, while not actually constituting a ban, is actually a real cost to you. Doesn't mean that they're not worth it in the case of handguns or that they can be worth it in some areas - handguns - and not in others - skydiving -, but it does mean that the argument "because freedom" isn't as ridiculous as people make it out to be).		>So then why is it that if we have all of these regulations in place for vehicles, many of which are designed for the safety of others, that the same reasoning and justification doesn't also apply to a device made for the sole purpose inflicting injury or death?		I'd dispute that a gun's sole purpose is inflicting injury or death (I don't like handguns - I've never held or fired one, or been around one when it's been fired, and I think I'd prefer not to). How do you know that a handgun's sole purpose is inflicting death? It seems like a difficult thing to divine: the 'soul' of an object like a gun. Handguns factually *are* used for other purposes than inflicting death, yes?		>Regulating guns, for the same reasons we regulate vehicles, medicine, and food, is common sense.		"Common sense" means that it's intuitively obvious. For example, that, if you drop an apple (having seen that apple fall to the ground the last thousand times you've dropped it), and you expect the apple to fall to the ground the thousand-and-first time you drop it, *that's* common sense. It's not common sense that objects fall at 9.8 m/s^2, it's not common sense that the War in Iraq was or was not a good idea, and it's not common sense that regulating handguns is a good idea either - none of these are just basic intuitions that we all have. These are empirical questions about complicated issues, which is why there's plenty of academic research devoted to them.		>The rest of the world understands this. 		I'm not sure why "the rest of the world does X" is sufficient justification for the US doing X. The rest of the world was monarchic when the US became a democracy by modern standards (under Jackson) - is that justification for monarchy? The fact that something is widely practiced or thought to be true (Ptolemaic astronomy, Aristotelian physics, slavery, animism, etc.) isn't justification for believing that it is actually the case.		Furthermore, it's just factually not true that the rest of the world is some gunless utopia and the US is a violent, chaotic haven for gun nuts. There is plenty of academic debate about gun control internationally (and many US studies rely upon international comparisons, such as the Harvard study I linked, iirc): numerous nations have very lax gun control laws (many of which incentivize gun ownership), and many nations with low rates of gun ownership have higher rates of violent and property crime than does the US. This doesn't mean that this is the result of gun control or that gun control wouldn't work in the US, and it doesn't mean that this sort of higher general violent crime rate is more important than the lower gun homicide rate, etc. etc.		>Why people like OP do not, is infuriating, unjustifiable, and incomprehensible.		But I just provided potential reasons why OP does not advocate gun control...		The only point I've tried to make with my post is that there *is a debate*. The reddit hivemind relies upon caricatures of everyone you disagree with as Rick Perry: bumbling, Jesus-freak idiots who believe what they do because they're rolling in Koch cash.

After Port Arthur, counting from the next mass killing you had (before this is an edit by the way) you've averaged almost double that for the last 15 years. 4.21 dead a year from mass killings.		You're wrong, I'm afraid. Not that I think this should even be something you're expending the millions of AUD you are on this when you've got the more pressing concerns of.... 		Literally any of the following:	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3303.0main+features100012012		Seriously, 2 people a year?

I'm certain he would have indeed harmed people anyway. But if he had a knife, a club or a bow and arrow, it would have been less people. You know this. Gun regulation is not intended to stop people from being violent, and nobody ever claimed it was. That's a straw-man on your part.

In the case of school shootings, it is normally kids who have taken their parents' legally-owned guns ([source](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/09/report-says-guns-in-school-shootings-often-come-from-home/20143495/)). That can't happen here, because (aside from some farms) regular households don't have guns in them. If an Australian teenager gets angsty and feels like shooting up their school, they sit, fume, and ultimately do nothing until they cool off - because they don't have any way to access a gun. As a bullied teenager myself, there were certainly times when I got angry enough to think of that. Fortunately, there was no possible way for me to access a gun. My family didn't have one; nobody's family does. To this day, I've never met a private citizen who owns a gun. I'm in my 30s and haven't even seen a gun before, except those carried by police. In the US many angsty kids, in a moment of anger, have the ability to simply pull a gun out of a closet. Big difference.		> lmao, liberal logic. The same damn Obama worshippers preaching gun control lack control themselves 		In Australia, the big gun regulations were implemented by a conservative, right-wing government led by probably the most conservative prime minister in our history (John Howard). So it is not exactly liberal logic. In Australia, as in NZ and Europe, gun regulation is a bipartisan issue of public safety, not a 'liberal' issue. In fact, social conservatives were the biggest supporters of it (due to 'think of the children!' reasoning). Besides - what you call a 'liberal', the rest of the world calls a 'normal person'. I'm not an Obama worshipper either; he'd be considered a right-winger if he was a politician in Australia, NZ or Europe.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sunkencathedral","name":"t1_cshtqbo","parent_id":"t1_cseidcr","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435228748,"created_utc":1435199948}

{"body":"**You're one half of the reason why we can't have a reasoned discussion about gun control.** The official line, of course, is that the purpose of gun control is not to simply take all the guns away, but this is precisely the implication of your argument. You are, as much as Joe Gun Nutter, an extremist.		Now, on to your argument.  		Guns obviously have some useful purposes or we would not allow cops or soldiers to carry guns. *Why is it good for them to carry a "thing whose only purpose is to kill"?* **The answer must be that killing is sometimes us a useful purpose.** It's not beautiful, but it is sometimes necessary. 		What useful purpose could these things have for the general populace? I mean besides sport shooting, collecting, and hunting, of course. Well, why should cops have guns? They use them to defend their lives and the lives of others. And this is a good use and it is a use which a citizen has a legal right, more than that a human right, to put them to use for. It's morally repugnant to suggest that people do not have a right to defend their own lives. 		But why do they *need* a gun to do this? For one thing, it's called the Bill of Rights, not the Bill of Needs. Also, it's because the bad guys have guns. Even if, however, they didn't have guns they'd have knives and pipes and friends. When four people move on one, when a 220 pound man moves on a 130 pound woman, when an elderly person is threatened by a young person, a gun is an equalizer, a means of defense. 		Killing, maiming, and intimidating is NOT a product defect, but a product feature. Guns do what they're supposed to do, which is go bang and push projectiles on target. 		You would entrust the state with these devices, but the state is simply a collection of people in institutional roles. Indeed, a government of, by and for the people, would suggest this. The best proof you can trust the average person with a gun? Well, there are already 9 guns for every 10 Americans and we're not living in the Wild West. Most people with guns, the vast majority of people, do not defect, do not murder, do not kill. 		If you live in America, you have enjoyed the herd immunity conferred to you by gun owners. Someone may not have broken into your home or escalated a situation with you on the street because they could not be sure that you would not defend yourself with lethal force. And this is why we should not know precisely who does and does not have a gun. The gun owner is at risk from that weapon, so you owe that owner a debt of thanks for conferring this herd immunity to you. As much as you owe thanks to police who are doing the job right and to servicemen who fight your wars, you also owe thanks to gun owners of America. 		Could we do gun control better? Certainly. There is no absolute right to defense or speech or anything else. But you are part of the problem, not the solution. You are not one I can dialogue with. You are fearful, excessive, and reactionary. And ultimately, you are part of the reason people will needlessly die (i.e., because your absolute stance which does more to derail the dialogue than forward it).","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tisias","name":"t1_csedkom","parent_id":"t1_cseccd6","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434968656,"created_utc":1434939856}

This is common whenever you have a loud, decent-sized minority in a sub: a submission going against their beliefs will get upvoted by the majority because they agree with it, but those people won't usually bother with the comments, they'll just vote and move on, whereas the loud minority upon seeing it will downvote it *and* come into the comments to complain about it.		It's sort of like how when people are happy they don't say anything (e.g. they won't bother to tell a company "wow this product did exactly what I wanted and expected, thanks!") whereas when they're *un*happy they'll scream at the top of their lungs about it.

And lastly, you say "if something doesn't work"...the problem is that there is little evidence that the 2nd Amendment doesn't work. These shootings are not a strong case to ban guns because they're relatively rare. I am for closing "gun shows loopholes". I am for thorough background checks in every state and I am even for mandatory gun safety courses for new gun owners. But the idea of banning guns outright is insane.

This mourning also doesn't undermine any other murders, it's just acknowledging this particular situation. No murder is good, but these mass murders in particular are more tragic in nature due to the cuircumstances. A large amount of murders in the U.S. are because of conflict and violence towards one another. These situations are different because of the randomness and innocence of the victims.

This graph goes nicely with for every 1 justifiable self-defence there are 2 accidental deaths, 34 murders, and 78 suicides from firearms.

Yes, a very small percentage of people die from being murdered with assault weapons. Still, ownership isn't justifiable. You shouldn't keep them to "overthrow an unjust government" because, lets be real, you don't stand a chance against the US Military. You don't need drum clips for hunting or self defense. The only justification is "I like them they're fun." Even if it only saves 12 people a year, it's worth it to outlaw the stupid hobby tens of thousands of people hold dear.
