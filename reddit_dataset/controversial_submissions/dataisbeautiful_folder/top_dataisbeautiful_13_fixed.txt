{"body":"My cartography experience is limited to yelling at Google Maps when I'm lost.  So I'm confused by the data, what it means, what it references, basically the overall scope of the project.  	Part of my job requires that I make websites as easy and enjoyable for end use as possible.   Which is slightly annoying sometimes because it tends to mean dumbing things down, for lack of a better term.  I say all that because as a cartography layman, this data has me lost.  I'm a curious person and I want to understand what you've probably put a good amount of effort into, but I'm more confused.  		My suggestion would be to be more elaborate visually.  Meaning add a title, put more info in the legend, etc.   This doesn't necessarily mean add a bunch I wordy explanations, think about icons or maybe some other symbology.  For example, infographics help people ingest and understand massive amounts of quantifiable data in fast ways.   I'm rambling so I'll end with this:  now I need to look up isochronic.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Jg_webdeveloper","name":"t1_d0fe7uc","parent_id":"t3_47oxld","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1456569443,"created_utc":1456540643}
