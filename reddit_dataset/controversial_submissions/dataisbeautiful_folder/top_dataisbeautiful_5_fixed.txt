{"body":"This is a really bad chart. 			1. You have data points for the average(?) weight from 20 to 74 year olds beginning the line that then shows how weights fluctuate with age between men and women. This is very misleading. Consider putting in an average  horizontal line or removing it to a footnote.			2. Your title is making a claim that has nothing to do with the evidence being shown. Yes, you have a data set from men in the 1970s and you are comparing it to a data set of women today. What does this even mean? Do men and women no longer have similar weights in these age brackets? Maybe you meant to show a line showing average male and female weight from 1970 to present?			You should consider remaking this chart or rewriting the title to claim something different.","depth":0,"score":635,"ups":635,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Encelados242","name":"t1_cs2oo5r","parent_id":"t3_39dm6v","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434025724,"created_utc":1433996924}

{"body":"> I quite frankly, have no idea how that is misleading.  It seems quite clear to me[...]		Your data isn't *wrong*, but it is *misleading*.		The title is misleading because the wording implies that [all] American females Now are heavier than [all] American males from the 60s-70s, which is not true.  The data shows that only women over 40 Now are heavier than men over 40 were from the 60s-70s.  		The graph is misleading because you're using a line graph, which implies that women Now as a group change weight as they age according to a fundamentally different pattern than men Then did.  You're not claiming this, but your presentation of the data implies it, which is why it's misleading.  In actuality, the graph of Females Now to Males Now has almost the exact same shape along the age-axis that Females Then to Males Now has, or Females Now to Males Then, or Females Then to Males Then.

{"body":"Weight by gender and age bracket from 1960 to 2012 is here: http://i.imgur.com/1Ib98VJ.png		Just browsing through the NHANES data sets from the CDC I thought it was interesting to note that	females today are roughly the weight of males from the 1960s and 1970s as shown in the linked image.	Edit: Males are also larger, but hard to compare them to anything, except perhaps Giants, of which data I have 0 so....		Height meanwhile hasn't increased much over the past half-century: http://i.imgur.com/xlyzGT3.png.	Males are roughly 1/2 inch taller than their 1960 counterparts, and females the same. 			Interestingly enough, while adult height hasn't seemed to changed much,height during the ages 8 - 15 	for males are greater than same-aged children in the 70s by 0.9 to 2 inches each year. 	Even more interesting is that from 16 - 19, the average height has actually fallen by 0.6 to 0.9 inches.		It appears adolescents are growing faster to their full potential, whereas in the days of yore, 	it took longer before full-height was reached. 		Here's a chart of year over year changes in height for 1970 vs. 2012: http://i.imgur.com/BwfFYxi.png.	And the cumulative changes in height up to age 19 for 1970 adolescents vs. 2012: http://i.imgur.com/O9wZph9.png.		Another interesting (start?) trend is that males seem to have peaked in weight over the 2003-2006 	time-frame and are starting to shed some weight, whereas females are a bit of a mixed bag (so far) 	with the peak for 20-39 & 60-74 reached in the 2007-2010 time-frame, but the other ages still seem 	on the increase. Too early to say if these will endure, but, perhaps a glimmer of hope in the	fight against obesity and sedentary lifestyles?

Also, (generally speaking) people weigh more because they eat more, and exercise less compared to decades ago. People today are unhealthier than decades ago. This isn't fucking news.

I agree that a conclusion that women weigh more now then they did in the 60's and 70's is probably something we would all logically agree is likely. However people get upset when data is presented poorly, with little explanation behind it, and biased.			You seem to think that by pulling published NHANES data that it creates an unbiased data set, but without explanation from you on pre-processing this isn't the case.		NHANES is a HUGE nationally representative survey now conducted continuously. Each cycle has a slightly different focus, and is limited in participants. It is immensely complex which is why there are courses dedicated just to interpretation of NHANES data. The participant limitation is a problem, and thus they over sample specific populations. This oversampling has to be taken into account in any analysis. Additionally our demographics are vastly different in 2011-2012 cycle than they are in the NHANES II cycle. At a minimum, you should be addressing whether the population weighting and demographics play any significant impact on the overall averages you are using for this comparison.","depth":1,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bobette42","name":"t1_cs2xnu5","parent_id":"t1_cs2iecr","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434054013,"created_utc":1434025213}

{"body":""Healthier overall" implies, well, exactly what it says. We are talking about the aggregate here, which inarguably is a fatter, unhealthier population. 		So yes, there are health conscious people now, just as there have always been health conscious people. It probably isn't a "huge percentage of the US population" (although if you can demonstrate that it is, I will gladly accept that), and it clearly isn't enough to skew the trend. 		Your comment seems to imply that women are heavier because they are bulking up on muscle, and I sincerely doubt that is why. For *some* people I'm sure that's true, but not enough to influence the weight trend in the way that we are seeing.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yertles","name":"t1_cs2k374","parent_id":"t1_cs2jv59","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1434017741,"created_utc":1433988941}
