{"body":"There seem to be many complaints about your graphs and data. I understand you are trying to make a point so let's address that. We are doing terrible things with incredible consequences. I think you want us to be aware of that. Here is the bottom line, if it comes to be that we destroy ourselves and other species because of it then it becomes just another mass extinction that occurred on Earth. There have been many and we did not cause them. If we destroy our own species in the next mass extinction then the planet has no more worries from us. Think of beer. It is created by a living thing changing the environment that it is in by utilizing the resources it has to benefit itself. Yeast eat the sugars and make alcohol. The waste product is alcohol. These little yeast organisms have a waste product that is good for something else. Yeast pee gets us drunk. In the process of pissing all this good alcohol out the environment is ruined for the yeast. They die. That's all we are doing, creating an environment that will be used by some comic entity to get a buzz. We should concern ourselves more with the what happens then. Will that comic entity get another comic entity wasted and force an unwanted sexual encounter or will it be less benign? Maybe it will give that entity enough courage to participate in some cosmic karaoke. Does the universe have a future that, because of our actions, sound something like, "We're no strangers to love	You know the rules and so do I,  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of, You wouldn't get this from any other guy		I just want to tell you how I'm feeling, Gotta make you understand 		Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down	Never gonna run around and desert you	Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye..."","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cocuke","name":"t1_cr4i7kf","parent_id":"t3_35hh1v","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1431297396,"created_utc":1431268596}
