{"body":">Myth #1: They're coming for your guns.		>Fact-check: No one knows the exact number of guns in America, but it's clear there's no practical way to round them all up (never mind that no one in Washington is proposing this). Yet if you fantasize about rifle-toting citizens facing down the government, you'll rest easy knowing that America's roughly 80 million gun owners already have the feds and cops outgunned by a factor of around 79 to 1.		Not really adressing the issue here...		>Myth #2: Guns don't kill people—people kill people.		>Fact-check: People with more guns tend to kill more people—with guns. The states with the highest gun ownership rates have a gun murder rate 114% higher than those with the lowest gun ownership rates. Also, gun death rates tend to be higher in states with higher rates of gun ownership. Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such as assault-weapons bans or safe-storage requirements. Update: A recent study looking at 30 years of homicide data in all 50 states found that for every one percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly one percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.		If you discussed total homicide rates rather than firearm homicide rate this might mean something. Right now it doesn't.		>Myth #3: An armed society is a polite society.		>Fact-check: Drivers who carry guns are 44% more likely than unarmed drivers to make obscene gestures at other motorists, and 77% more likely to follow them aggressively.		>• Among Texans convicted of serious crimes, those with concealed-handgun licenses were sentenced for threatening someone with a firearm 4.8 times more than those without.		>• In states with Stand Your Ground and other laws making it easier to shoot in self-defense, those policies have been linked to a 7 to 10% increase in homicides.		Has anyone seriously made the point that people with guns are more polite? And people carrying a weapon are more likely to threaten someone with that weapon than *people who are not carrying a weapon*?		This is one shit article this.		Edit: I'm not pro-guns. From an outside perspective, American gun legislation seems extremely weird and unsettling. That being said, this article is shit.","depth":0,"score":33,"ups":33,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mister_moustachio","name":"t1_csft3fy","parent_id":"t3_3atigf","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435090670,"created_utc":1435061870}
{"body":"Since the post I replied to has been downvoted to invisibility, here's the rest of the myths debunked as well:		> Myth #4: More good guys with guns can stop rampaging bad guys.	> Fact-check: Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 30 years: 0		Bullshit. They use BS statistics for "civilians" to ignore pretend that mass shootings like the New Life Church weren't stopped by civilians, and furthermore there's incidents like this [barber shop shooting stopped by a guy with a CCW](http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Man-Shot-in-the-Chest-Inside-West-Philly-Barbershop-297176271.html), and this [Uber driver stopping a mass shooting in Chicago](http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-with-concealed-handgun-prevents-mass-shooting-in-chicago-2015-4).  Mother Jones is just grasping for straws.		> Myth #5: Keeping a gun at home makes you safer.	Fact-check: Owning a gun has been linked to higher risks of homicide, suicide, and accidental death by gun.		This "myth" compares suicides, homicides, and accidents to justifiable homicides. It's cherry picking. It completely ignores defensive gun uses that don't end in a justifiable homicide, and lumping suicides into the mix is just scare tactics.		> Myth #6: Carrying a gun for self-defense makes you safer.		This one is particularly bad because they use a study by Branas in Philly to justify their argument.  What's not mentioned is that the [full text of the study (hidden behind a paywall, naturally)](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2008.143099) has quite a few confounding variables.  Mother Jones counts on you not actually doing the homework, so [here's the full text](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/) - you should look [very closely at Table 1 in particular](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/table/tbl1/) as owning a gun isn't the biggest risk factor; being involved in illicit drugs or being drunk has a much greater risk factor.  Notice the number of drug arrests per sq mile too.  When even [Wintermute \(severely antigun\) points out the problems with it](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866589/), it's a bad study.		> Myth #7: Guns make women safer.	Fact-check: In 2010, nearly 6 times more women were shot by husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners than murdered by male strangers.		> * One study found that women in states with higher gun ownership rates were 4.9 times more likely to be murdered by a gun than women in states with lower gun ownership rates.		Another example of cherry picking & tautology where they compare defensive gun uses only ending in justifiable homicide.  The facts remain that a firearm is the single best tool for a woman to defend herself against a man as [seen in this incident in Georgia](http://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-mom-hiding-kids-shoots-intruder/story?id=18164812), [this one in Detroit where a woman fought off 5 home invaders](http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/home-invaders-shoot-woman-during-home-invasion/33477032), and in particular[ this incident where a man was released from prison and shot by his wife 11 minutes later](http://www.guns.com/2013/07/16/woman-shoots-and-kills-abusive-husband-11-minutes-after-hes-released-from-jail-video/) when he attempted to kill her. 		Of all their arguments, this one is the most insulting because it shows the hypocrisy of the "my body, my choice" arguments as Mother Jones don't want women to defend themselves and say so in the most patronizing manner possible.  The results of this sort of thing? You get [women murdered while waiting for a gun permit because the restraining order didn't do a thing](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/06/10/no-one-helped-her-nj-woman-murdered-by-ex-while-waiting-for-gun-permit/).  You get women disarmed by gun free zones on college campuses and [then raped within sight of a police call box](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/counterpoint-rape-survivor-argues-why-we-need-guns-campus).  The rapist went on to rape two other women and kill one.		> Myth #8: "Vicious, violent video games" deserve more blame than guns.	Fact-check: So said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre after Newtown. So what's up with Japan?		No argument.  It's a stupid myth.  Congrats, Mother Jones is 1 for 10.		> Myth #9: More and more Americans are becoming gun owners. 	Fact-check: More guns are being sold, but they're owned by a shrinking portion of the population.		Relies on the General Social Survey which is contradicted by multiple other surveys showing higher ownership rates and FBI NICS figures.  The GSS has no actual fact checking behind it, and relies on whether or not a gun owner is going to tell a complete stranger whether they own a gun.  On the flip side, NICS background check statistics have shown more than a doubling in the last decade, and excise taxes collected on new firearms and ammunition have hit all time highes.  If there's a shrinking population buying more and more guns in the middle of a recession (that was a near depression), those gun owners are *rich as fuck* if they can make [ammunition companies work 24/7 shifts](http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/27/so-really-where-is-the-22-rimfire-ammo/) for more than a year.  On top of that, NSSF retailer surveys indicate there are more first time buyers than ever, with the most rapidly expanding demographics being women & minorities.  Firearms bans in Chicago & DC have been reversed in the last few years, opening new markets, which also has an effect.  Finally, CCW figures show around 11 million permit holders, with 1 million in Florida alone.   If less people are buying guns, it's not apparent in the gun industry.		> Myth #10: We don't need more gun laws—we just need to enforce the ones we have.		This is more scare tactics, using the discredited "[40% of guns sold without a background check](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/guns-acquired-without-background-checks/)!" talking point, and hypothetical sales online that didn't actually take place.  Finally, whining about a lack of a permanent director to the ATF is laughable as the entire agency doesn't grind to a halt when only an interim director is in charge.		In short, Mother Jones is a group of lying douchebags and laughably lacking in credibility.","depth":1,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elsparkodiablo","name":"t1_csg5346","parent_id":"t1_csft3fy","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435111635,"created_utc":1435082835}

{"body":"> Myth #4: More good guys with guns can stop rampaging bad guys.	> Fact-check: Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 30 years: 0		Bullshit. They use BS statistics for "civilians" to ignore pretend that mass shootings like the New Life Church weren't stopped by civilians, and furthermore there's incidents like this [barber shop shooting stopped by a guy with a CCW](http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Man-Shot-in-the-Chest-Inside-West-Philly-Barbershop-297176271.html), and this [Uber driver stopping a mass shooting in Chicago](http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-with-concealed-handgun-prevents-mass-shooting-in-chicago-2015-4).  Mother Jones is just grasping for straws.		> Myth #5: Keeping a gun at home makes you safer.	Fact-check: Owning a gun has been linked to higher risks of homicide, suicide, and accidental death by gun.		This "myth" compares suicides, homicides, and accidents to justifiable homicides. It's cherry picking. It completely ignores defensive gun uses that don't end in a justifiable homicide, and lumping suicides into the mix is just scare tactics.		> Myth #6: Carrying a gun for self-defense makes you safer.		This one is particularly bad because they use a study by Branas in Philly to justify their argument.  What's not mentioned is that the [full text of the study (hidden behind a paywall, naturally)](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2008.143099) has quite a few confounding variables.  Mother Jones counts on you not actually doing the homework, so [here's the full text](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/) - you should look [very closely at Table 1 in particular](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/table/tbl1/) as owning a gun isn't the biggest risk factor; being involved in illicit drugs or being drunk has a much greater risk factor.  Notice the number of drug arrests per sq mile too.  When even [Wintermute \(severely antigun\) points out the problems with it](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866589/), it's a bad study.		> Myth #7: Guns make women safer.	Fact-check: In 2010, nearly 6 times more women were shot by husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners than murdered by male strangers.		> * One study found that women in states with higher gun ownership rates were 4.9 times more likely to be murdered by a gun than women in states with lower gun ownership rates.		Another example of cherry picking & tautology where they compare defensive gun uses only ending in justifiable homicide.  The facts remain that a firearm is the single best tool for a woman to defend herself against a man as [seen in this incident in Georgia](http://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-mom-hiding-kids-shoots-intruder/story?id=18164812), [this one in Detroit where a woman fought off 5 home invaders](http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/home-invaders-shoot-woman-during-home-invasion/33477032), and in particular[ this incident where a man was released from prison and shot by his wife 11 minutes later](http://www.guns.com/2013/07/16/woman-shoots-and-kills-abusive-husband-11-minutes-after-hes-released-from-jail-video/) when he attempted to kill her. 		Of all their arguments, this one is the most insulting because it shows the hypocrisy of the "my body, my choice" arguments as Mother Jones don't want women to defend themselves and say so in the most patronizing manner possible.  The results of this sort of thing? You get [women murdered while waiting for a gun permit because the restraining order didn't do a thing](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/06/10/no-one-helped-her-nj-woman-murdered-by-ex-while-waiting-for-gun-permit/).  You get women disarmed by gun free zones on college campuses and [then raped within sight of a police call box](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/counterpoint-rape-survivor-argues-why-we-need-guns-campus).  The rapist went on to rape two other women and kill one.		> Myth #8: "Vicious, violent video games" deserve more blame than guns.	Fact-check: So said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre after Newtown. So what's up with Japan?		No argument.  It's a stupid myth.  Congrats, Mother Jones is 1 for 10.		> Myth #9: More and more Americans are becoming gun owners. 	Fact-check: More guns are being sold, but they're owned by a shrinking portion of the population.		Relies on the General Social Survey which is contradicted by multiple other surveys showing higher ownership rates and FBI NICS figures.  The GSS has no actual fact checking behind it, and relies on whether or not a gun owner is going to tell a complete stranger whether they own a gun.  On the flip side, NICS background check statistics have shown more than a doubling in the last decade, and excise taxes collected on new firearms and ammunition have hit all time highes.  If there's a shrinking population buying more and more guns in the middle of a recession (that was a near depression), those gun owners are *rich as fuck* if they can make [ammunition companies work 24/7 shifts](http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/27/so-really-where-is-the-22-rimfire-ammo/) for more than a year.  On top of that, NSSF retailer surveys indicate there are more first time buyers than ever, with the most rapidly expanding demographics being women & minorities.  Firearms bans in Chicago & DC have been reversed in the last few years, opening new markets, which also has an effect.  Finally, CCW figures show around 11 million permit holders, with 1 million in Florida alone.   If less people are buying guns, it's not apparent in the gun industry.		> Myth #10: We don't need more gun laws—we just need to enforce the ones we have.		This is more scare tactics, using the discredited "[40% of guns sold without a background check](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/guns-acquired-without-background-checks/)!" talking point, and hypothetical sales online that didn't actually take place.  Finally, whining about a lack of a permanent director to the ATF is laughable as the entire agency doesn't grind to a halt when only an interim director is in charge.		In short, Mother Jones is a group of lying douchebags and laughably lacking in credibility.","depth":2,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elsparkodiablo","name":"t1_csfztef","parent_id":"t1_csfw3d6","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1435103593,"created_utc":1435074793}

The attacker gets to pick the time and place, whereas you're trying to put a knife in place in a gunfight.		A killer looks at the available weapon and composes the time and place according to its strengths and weaknesses.  A knife-wielding killer doesn't need a field of fire or a bag full of mags; rather they need tight spaces with few or controllable exits and a wall to back against, max confusion, low resistance.  A pre-school, a crowded bus, a nightclub, all with blockable exits.  		But many adults will resist an attack with a knife, and it wouldn't take too many to overwhelm a knife attacker.
