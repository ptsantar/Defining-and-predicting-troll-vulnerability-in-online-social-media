{"body":"Clean heroin.		And like I said, permanent health issues, not overdosing.		And sorry to hear, but speedballs are hardly a safe drug choice as your mixing strong stimulants and depressants.		One of the issues with drug prohibition is the lifestyle associated with the drug.	We can go to a store and buy clean alcohol - we know what we are buying with illicit drugs as its all underground. What's the purity? What has it been cut with? Fully clean heroin has no permanent health effects like alcohol. The health damages are because of the lifestyle associated with its use in an illicit setting - living in slum, crime to afford, neglecting personal health issues. 		"Alcohol consumption is one of the most important known causes of human cancer after tobacco smoking, chronic infections, and possibly obesity. With the exception of anatoxin, for no dietary factor is there such strong and consistent evidence for carcinogenicity. In central and eastern Europe, the burden of alcohol associated cancer, and of other alcohol-associated disease, is substantial. Alcohol consumption is increasing rapidly in many parts of the world, such as east Asia.2 For breast cancer and colorectal cancer, a causal association with alcohol consumption has been established only in the past 10-15 years, and the implications of these associations for public health have not been elucidated fully. In many countries, people of low income or education consume more alcohol than do those of high income and education, which contributes to social inequalities in cancer burden."	--- Alcohol and cancer: Boffetta and Hashibe				Im not saying at all that heroin is good - in fact its horrific. Im saying that we think alcohol is safe in comparison to other drugs, but it's not. Yeah we still all use alcohol, but we are ignorant to its dangers, just because it is legal. Also there's the assumption that all drug users are addicts, and that all use leads to addiction, but its simply not the case	["It is estimated that about 23 percent of individuals who use heroin become dependent on it."](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin) - yet we assume that all users are addicted.
