My first thought is that since we're interested in the thread purely because of the statistic, even though it includes suicides, that the statistic must matter to some degree.

As for suicides increasing, I think this happens only if having legal access to euthanasia somehow encourages people to die.

{"body":"> thread purely because of the statistic, even though it includes suicides, that the statistic must matter to some degree.		The statistic doesn't really matter, except as a tool to judge how guns may be contributing to suicides, accidental deaths, and murders. However, it's the actual deaths that are meaningful here. If you replace gun deaths with knife deaths, for instance, you've achieved nothing. This is a frequent problem with news articles on gun control that only compare *gun deaths* between countries, rather than overall murders. 		I think we have to accept that legalized *anything* will lead to increased use of that substance. That's just the nature of the law, people are deterred from doing things that come with punishment. The question is always how much the activity will increase, and whether or not that is worth the benefits of legalization. Sometimes the increase may be negligible, sometimes it may be huge. It depends on the issue under discussion, the implementation, and other factors. 		I think all of your examples: 		> * legalizing drugs increasing drug usage in the population	* legalized abortions encouraging women to end pregnancies early	* legalized gun ownership encouraging gun homicides		are unequivocally true, even though I support some legalization of all three. 		The reason why I hold the position of only allowing terminally ill people to kill themselves, is that I believe it would effectively eliminate any possibility of an increase in suicides due to euthanasia. Well, suicides may increase, but only for people that would soon be dead anyway. So the net total of human years lost would be very low, and those probably would be years of suffering anyway. So a mercy is given to the patient, but society as a whole isn't corrupted.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AloftMD","name":"t1_cvpstef","parent_id":"t1_cvpsf70","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk95","created":1444136435,"created_utc":1444107635}
