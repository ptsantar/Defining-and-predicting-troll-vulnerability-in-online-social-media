{"body":"> His position on Pluto has been consistent throughout.		This is one of the most amusingly ironic parts of this whole dumb planethood debate. :)		Alan Stern co-wrote [this paper](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/planet_def.pdf) that proposed the Stern-Levison parameter as a way of evaluating how capable an object was of clearing its orbital zone, which was presented to the IAU general assembly in 2000 and which is thought to have been a key influence in the 2006 definition's use of the "clearing the neighborhood" criterion. The paper stated "we define an ??berplanet as a planetary body in orbit about a star that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ..." and a few paragraphs later, "From a dynamical standpoint, our solar system clearly contains 8 ??berplanets." These 8 being the 8 objects the IAU went on to call planets. The paper used the term "unterplanets" to refer to objects which were *not* capable of clearing their neighborhood, ie dwarf planets, and Pluto was on that list. There's a bunch of solid math backing up the distinction.		So when Stern now talks to the popular media and makes statements about how Earth hasn't cleared its neighborhood because of NEAs or Jupiter hasn't cleared its orbit because of the Trojans, this is directly contradicted by a paper that he is the principle author of.		If he's really changed his mind, maybe he should publish a new paper refuting the math he put forward in the old one.","depth":1,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FaceDeer","name":"t1_ctge7k3","parent_id":"t1_ctg5skl","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437889301,"created_utc":1437885701}
{"body":"That paper, while used as a reference in the 2006 planet definition discussion, is just one point in the discussion.  That paper doesn't contradict the current definition nor Stern's opposition to it.

{"body":"And by the strictest definition of "has achieved hydrostatic equilibrium" Earth isn't a planet because it has mountains. But this level of pedantry is just plain *silly*.		The IAU definition clearly wasn't intended to mean that there are no planets in the Solar System, it has an explicit footnote that lists off the 8 planets that do meet its criteria for planethood. So when arguing about the various interpretations of "clearing the neighborhood' or "hydrostatic equilibrium" one should first check if there are ones that are consistent with the footnote (and with sanity in general) and focus on those ones. Interpretations that contradict this (for example by saying that Jupiter or Earth aren't planets) can be discarded as being obviously not what the IAU had in mind.		Anyway, Stern's opposition contradicts his earlier paper on a more fundamental level than just quibbling about exactly how many orbit-crossing grains of sand it takes to invalidate a planet. The paper says Trojan asteroids are counted as having been "cleared" because they've been put into a resonant orbit. So pointing at the Trojans and saying Jupiter hasn't cleared them is contradictory to the paper's definition of "clearing the neighborhood", plain and simple.","depth":3,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FaceDeer","name":"t1_ctgrkm5","parent_id":"t1_ctgqd7e","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437931218,"created_utc":1437927618}

The term continent is a man made term, just like the word planet.  Now, planet does have a bit more rigid of a definition, but there are certainly grey areas.  After all, Ceres is much more similar to the 4 terrestrial planets than it is to the gas giants.  		I agree, based on our current interpretation of what a "planet is", Pluto does not fit the bill...

{"body":"Actually, that's not true.		There's a measure of orbit-clearing capability called the Stern-Levison parameter that can be calculated just from a planet's mass and orbital radius. [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_the_neighbourhood) has a table listing the Stern-Levison parameters for a variety of planets and dwarf planets. Earth in its current location has a value of 1.53 ?? 10^5, and the parameter's value varies with orbital radius by the inverse of 3/2 power. Pluto's semimajor axis is 39.264 AU, so Earth's Stern-Levison parameter would go down by a factor of 1/(39.264^(3/2)) or 0.00406 if it was moved out that far. That gives it a Stern-Levison parameter value of 6.22 ?? 10^2, which is comparable to the value for Mars (9.42 ?? 10^2).		So yes, if we put Earth in Pluto's orbit, it would definitely have enough mass to clear its orbit. If Mars is a planet by that criterion then so would Earth-in-Pluto's-orbit also be.		Pluto, I should mention, has a Stern-Levison parameter of 2.95 ?? 10^???3. So it's at least five orders of magnitude below Mars in its orbit-clearing capability. If you look at the table in that article you'll note that there's nothing with a value anywhere in that five-order-of-magnitude gap, since orbit-clearing is a self-reinforcing process that tends to make objects grow much larger once they get big enough to clear their orbits. Plato once said that  successful theories should "carve nature at its joints," and there would appear to be a prominent joint between objects capable of clearing their orbit and those not capable of it.","depth":2,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FaceDeer","name":"t1_ctgdx0n","parent_id":"t1_ctgcm88","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437888605,"created_utc":1437885005}

{"body":"Definitions get changed when new, and hopefully better, data is taken into account. When DNA analysis came into use, some creatures that appeared to be closely related were found not to be, and moved to different genuses or even families. Similarly, some creatures were found to be more closely related, and were moved into closer relationships in the tables of organisms. The most extreme examples were in the single celled microorganism, where accurate data changed our fundamental view of life.		Similarly, less than 10 years ago, about 150 astronomers hijacked an IAU meeting on the last day, and voted to demote Pluto, based on the evidence of new KBOs found in the previous 10 years. NH was already on its way to Pluto, and the smart thing to do would have been to hold off on a final decision until NH got there, since _every time a space probe has visited a planet for the first time, it has revolutionized our knowledge of the planet._ If the full 2000 or so astronomers at the conference had been polled, Pluto would most likely have remained a planet, or at least the decision would have been announced as provisional, pending the data returned by NH in 2015-2016.		We now have about 100 times as much data on Pluto as we had last year, and there is at least another 10 times as much data that is yet to be downloaded from NH. What we see is that Pluto has far more in common with the other 8 planets, than it has with any asteroids, comets, or 99% of the Moons in the Solar system.		The third element of the definition adopted by the IAU is garbage. Many convincing arguments can be made against it, most especially that it is not clearly true for any of the 8 other planets, and that is demonstrably not true for the few exoplanets where it can be tested. In particular, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune appear to have a lot of uncleared junk in their orbits. Conversely, the smooth surfaces on Pluto argue that Pluto has somewhat cleared its orbit. 		The third element of the definition should be changed to something about the observed features of the surface of the planet. That's where the evidence is. If you are going to define things based on observable evidence, that is the place to do it.		---		I actually hope that Ceres and maybe Vesta get back into the planet category. Ceres has something slowly smoothing its surface, that appears to be related to the bright spots. It is also very round. Vesta is a differentiated body, like the 8 planets, Pluto, and Ceres. Geological differentiation is the most clear cut dividing line between asteroids and planets, and Vesta, Ceres, Pluto, and the large KBOs all fall on the planet side of that line. You can draw lines based on atmosphere, weather, surface geology, or tectonics, that include Mercury and Pluto, or include Pluto and exclude Mercury.

Categorizations are fluid, and are updated as our knowledge base grows.		Short history lesson: Ceres was once considered a planet. So were Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. They were called planets for over 40 years, until technological advances allowed us to see that they were only large representatives of a new class of objects - asteroids. So does that mean that we should continue calling these four objects planets, despite only Ceres being something that we would conceivably label a planet if we saw them in a lineup? They were called planets for nearly 60 years, after all.
