{"body":"These are not sounds. Please, please use the right terms before people start getting confused. There are no sounds in space. These are electromagnetic waves (ie radiation, not sound), which have been CONVERTED into sound. Space does not actually make these sounds, and there are still no sounds in space.","depth":0,"score":27,"ups":27,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GryphonGuitar","name":"t1_ctaq4vb","parent_id":"t3_3e1zq3","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437476319,"created_utc":1437472719}
{"body":"Right, the article says "vibrations". What we call sound is caused by the displacement of the atmosphere, or vibration. Think about it, space has no atmosphere, so there's no medium for the sound to travel through. But since we understand electromagnetic *radiation* as a wave, it's easy to put it into a computer and convert it to audio. 		It's a shame because it's still incredibly interesting, but so many of the random sites that people share on social media rarely bother to get the details right.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"stungungun","name":"t1_ctatlol","parent_id":"t1_ctaq4vb","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437487605,"created_utc":1437484005}
{"body":"I've always wondered though...  if you put a planet into a place with air so we can hear it (I realise it's impossible for so many reasons), would it make a sound?  I'm assuming a rocky planet like ours would not (after all, we can't hear it)...  but what about a gas giant such as Jupiter?","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OneGeekTravelling","name":"t1_ctaqdn0","parent_id":"t1_ctaq4vb","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1437477339,"created_utc":1437473739}

{"body":"Well you basically would hear what happens in its atmosphere, except you'd be in "space", and far away from it.		Not for long though, as a giant rock moving at very high speed through sea-level pressurized air would start to get its own atmosphere ejected behind it in tremendous winds, fires and mass destruction through friction, plus an incredible planetary-sized sonic boom audible twice a year, assuming you would stand "still".		And some time later, a huge deflagration sound as your planet would sink into the sun due to friction removing all of its orbital speed.		But yeah, minus all these, basically you'd hear the same stuff you can usually hear in an atmosphere.
