{"body":"Jeez, why are we still having discusssions about this. I get it, the definition is rather ambigous, but it has been established that we have 8 planets and everything else is a dwarf planet, asteroid a moon etc. I think the definition given by IAU is just a formality to shut up people. 		Take a look at continents. There is no single definition. It's mostly: large landmass seperated by oceans. Which is obviously stupid, because that creates 4 continents (America, Afro-euro-asia, Australia and Antarctica). So instead you will see: large landmass seperated by ocean (Eg: list of continents here).		So I guess it's the same with planets. There are 8 planets. Get over it. Nothing changed about Pluto when it stopped being a planet. Planet is just a bracket, nothing else. No need for discussion about it.","depth":0,"score":21,"ups":21,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KSPReptile","name":"t1_crxgptk","parent_id":"t3_38sf83","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1433597762,"created_utc":1433594162}

{"body":"The difference is that Neptune (and all othe  planets) make up more than 99% of the mass in their orbit.  Pluto, obviously, does not.		Side note:	Neptune and Pluto also have an 2:3 orbital resonance.  So even though Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit, it is still strongly subject to Neptune's gravitational influence.  Pluto was "pushed" into its current orbit by Neptune, so it essentially counts as "cleared".		Many asteroids (the trojans and the hildas) have similar resonances with Jupiter as well.		Also interesting is that it was recently found that Earth has at least one resonant asteroid as well.		All this considered, there's plenty of objects that cross orbits and are not in resonance, but these make up such a small fraction of the planet's mass (<1%)  that it isn't grounds for revoking planethood.		No hard line is set for what percentage is required to be a planet, but when the line is between Ceres (~30%) and Neptune (~99%), an exact definition isn't really necessary.  Note that the mass of moons is not considered in this percentage (or if you prefer, they can be considered part of the planet).","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PointyBagels","name":"t1_cry26ig","parent_id":"t1_crxuvrp","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1433646000,"created_utc":1433642400}

The reason for this has been explained several times elsewhere in this thread.  The "clearing it's orbit" criteria is not about magically moving objects to different orbits and then making a judgement based on the number of nearby objects.  It's about how that object shaped the population of objects sharing its orbit *as the solar system evolved*.  The objects in our Solar System weren't created fully formed in some sort of astronomy factory and gracefully dropped into their current orbits, everything formed together over time.  The "planets" - their formation locations, their composition, their rate of accretion of proto-planets, how they migrated through the early solar system following continued perturbations from other objects - all played an important role in carving out the Solar System we see today, including the population of planets themselves.  It's a [*path function*](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Thermodynamics/Path_Functions), the order of formation/evolution is important, both for the object itself and for the larger Solar System.  		So you can arbitrarily move the Earth out to Pluto's orbit, and vice versa, via thought experiment.  But it doesn't actually suggest anything meaningful.  "Clearing it's orbit" relies explicitly on the evolution of the system, so coming up with a magical scenario in which the evolution of the system is removed is a moot point.		That said, is this an ideal criteria for defining something as a planet or not?  Maybe not, and this is a fine discussion to have.  But missing the point of it doesn't help your cause.  "A house is a house is a house" doesn't help you when we're not talking about houses.  I could come up with a thought experiment where I suggest we move all the water from a "lake" into the ocean, then crow about how we should therefore call all lakes "oceans" because the lake water blends into the ocean.  But that defeats the purpose, doesn't it?		>Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are tiny compared to the gas giants and yet you don't call them dwarf planets.		Which is silly.  When Alan Stern introduced the idea of "dwarf" planets, this is exactly how he meant it to be used.  And that would be entirely consistent with the rest of astronomy, where we use "giant" and "dwarf" extensively (for stars, galaxies, etc).  That the IAU decided to use "dwarf" so inconsistently here is certainly a dumb move. 		>Eris and Pluto appear to be a huge KBO and yet people persist that they are just like the tiny KBO's. How do you know that it is even like a KBO? Because of its orbit?		You're underestimating our knowledge of TNOs here.  Especially Pluto, which has been fairly extensively studied by KBO standards.		Additionally, your argument here is inconsistent.  If you're happy to lump in the "small" and "large" planets into one category, despite obvious differences, why is it suddenly an issue that there are small/large KBOs?  There are reasonably large differences in scale for objects where-ever you look - tiny moons and giant moons, tiny asteroids and giant asteroids, tiny stars and giant stars, etc.  There's nothing inherently wrong with there being the odd large KBO, similarly to how there's nothing odd with there being relatively large objects (like Ceres) in the asteroid belt.		>When science raises more questions than solving then we have a design flaw.		Ha.  Talk to the folks who routinely try to come up with a consistent definition of "galaxy".  The planet debate is a trifling matter in comparison. ;)		We're talking about fuzzy populations here.  Rigorously, there is no such thing as a planet, and there is no such thing as an asteroid, and there is no such thing as a star, etc.  They're all part of the same continuous populations of objects, some just did better at the mass accretion race than others.  Some "planets" have many features in common with some "asteroids", and some "asteroids" have a lot of features in common with "planets", etc.  Drawing the line is always going to be arbitrary at *some* point.  You'll do yourself a favour to come to grips with this sooner rather than later.		>SF people know that a planets is a big round thing in space you can land on. This is simple to understand.

That might be the case if these objects were to suddenly teleport into these new orbits; but the point is that *if* an Earth-like object had formed in a Pluto-like orbit, the Kuiper Belt would look quite different to how we see it today, if it was to even exist at all.

{"body":">yet you agree with me on the subject		Here???s what I believe:		Words have definitions. Definitions of words matter. The word ???planet??? has a definition. The definition of the word ???planet??? matters. The current ???definition??? of the word ???planet??? is not valid, as it is only situationally applicable to the items supposedly under it.		Eric is a planet, *even under the definition designed to keep it from being one*, as it is round, not a star, and has cleared its neighborhood (given the known peri- and apoapses of its orbit and the lack of items there between). Until such time as other items are found in its orbit???if ever???there???s no reason not to call it a planet.		Now, I notice they seem to have ???amended??? the definition to mean ???planetesimals??? rather than a simple ???cleared its orbit???. This, likely, is because under the original ???definition???, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune weren???t planets. However, this still does not fix the problem, as Earth in Jupiter???s orbit (say??? at L2) would not be a planet, comparatively. It would only be a planetesimal. Nor Mars in Earth???s orbit, nor Mercury in Venus???, etc.		Since nothing can ever ???clear the neighborhood???, they???ve decided to go by proportional size. By that metric, it???s possible that Pluto, then, isn???t a planet, but we???d have to compare all the KBIs to see.		If we???re comparing masses, then the only relevant definition we need is one of the size of a ???neighborhood???.

[And Jupiter, comparatively](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Masses_of_the_planets.png), makes all other planets look titchy.		So what???s a ???neighborhood????

{"body":"Finally we can have a normal discussion. I... mostly agree. 		My point about the word planet not really having much use in science is that for a scientist it doesn't matter very much if it's a planet or a dwarf planet or whatever. If a scientist is studying Pluto it doesn't matter if it's a planet or not for him. What matters to him is if it's part of the Kuiper Belt or not, if it has similar neighbors etc. 		Plus there are objects like brown dwarves that blur the very line between a star and a planets. There are planets that don't orbit anything. 		It's much more reasonable to split the word planet into categories like: terrestrial planets, dwarf planets in the asteroid field, gas giants, Kuiper Belt objects, brown dwarves, rogue planets etc.and let the word planet go. It's a relic from time where we had no idea how different these objects really are. That's my point of view.		Now if we really *need* a definition for the word, than we have a shitty one. It does't make much sense and well you said it yourself. On the other hand before 2006, we really didn't have a clear definition of a planet and nobody really cared much.
