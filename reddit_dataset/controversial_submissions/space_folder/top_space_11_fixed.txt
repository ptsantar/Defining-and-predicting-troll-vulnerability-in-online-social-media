{"body":"Could you explain why (this sub-) reddit is convinced MarsOne is a scam?		The guy visited our university a couple years ago, just before enrollment started, during a symposium organized by the Mechanical Engineering studies association. At the start of his speach the hall was filled with a hundred engineering students (up to Masters and PhD level), most of whom quite sceptical regarding the project.		Most of our scepticism targeted the social aspects of the program, I mean, who'd seriously consider boarding one of his rockets for a one-way trip. And, who'd front them the money.		After two hours of explanation, and some quite pointed questions, most of us were convinced the project was at the very least plausible. Up until now things appear to be going as planned; there are more than enough volunteers who do not want to live on this planet anymore, he's got a television company to buy (part of) the rights, and money seems to be flowing their way, albeit slowly.		Technology-wise it will be a challenge. There may be a couple of potential points of failure (finding water for instance) which have yet to be bridged, but I see little reason to call it impossible.","depth":1,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"breintje","name":"t1_cjy8t5e","parent_id":"t1_cjy6xwd","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1408792955,"created_utc":1408789355}
