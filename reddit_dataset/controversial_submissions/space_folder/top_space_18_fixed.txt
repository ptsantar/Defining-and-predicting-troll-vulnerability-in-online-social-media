This is because if said object was moving out of the atmosphere at exit speeds, the gasses in our atmosphere would ignite around it. In space there are no particles to cause friction, so (i assume) it would be very hard for an object moving at speed in space to be covered in flames.

{"body":"> Rockets leave the atmosphere about that fast		Without knowing how far away the objects are (and I suspect they're not very far away at all - as in, a few metres...) it's impossible to ascertain their speed or size.		However, since the operating assumption seems to be that they're somewhere in the last quarter of the distance to the horizon, and coming from the surface... then they'd be going about 100 times faster than any rocket launch in history, and would have to be a great deal larger or more luminous than anything we've ever launched... in short, if they were what these idiots think they were, they'd have been seen by much more than the ISS' camera. 		And yeah, there would have been a lot of fire as they punched out of the atmosphere at that insane speed.		However, I suspect these are pieces of ice or detritus knocked off the station by some internal activity, hidden by the bright bloom of the Earth until they cleared the limb from the camera's point of view, and became visible in contrast to the inky space beyond.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Destructor1701","name":"t1_csw8tlb","parent_id":"t1_csmwyru","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436371958,"created_utc":1436368358}

{"body":"We don't see that because it doesn't happen. Rockets leaving the atmosphere are going much slower than space vessels returning from space.		That's because they're starting from zero, and fighting the Earth's downward gravitational attraction, as well as the resistance of the atmosphere on the way up. It's only once they're above most of the atmosphere that they can accelerate to orbital speeds. In fact, many rockets [reduce thrust as they leave the atmosphere to prevent an unsafe increase in acceleration in the absence of drag](http://s21.postimg.org/4doi338k7/SRB_thrust_distance.png).		I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but it seems rockets don't break 1km/s in speed until they're above 60km in altitude, where the atmospheric pressure is something like 10-20% of sea level, or less.		By contrast, something returning from space will be travelling at anywhere between 7km/s and 18km/s! The air molecules in their path simply cannot slide out of the way fast enough, and so they get squeezed and smashed apart, releasing a metric shit-load of energy and heat.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Destructor1701","name":"t1_csw8aqc","parent_id":"t1_csoubbf","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436371107,"created_utc":1436367507}

{"body":"wtf man? Do you know what "evidence" actually means? Check the dictionary please. How the actual fuck..  	I am going to ask a few questions now so you can understand.  	If you were the president (and there were aliens) why would you hide their existence?    	If you were an alien capable of interstellar flight ( I hope you know what that means ) why would you hide from humans ( you would basically be a god around here with the technology ) while letting yourself be discovered by some government and by "conspirator's" claims, being expiremented on?    	Now, there are two possible scenarios of what would happen if aliens really came to Earth:  	1. We are blown to bits, milked or whatever.   	2. We make contact (all the governments together I suppose) while actual media,  actual scientists and the internet spread the news on rational proof. Not some goofballs sitting in their mom's trailer fapping their whole days on "green tailed chick with boobs hentai" on pornhub.   	3. If they are "spying and experimenting" on us, we wouldn't actually know.   	P.S. Get into really! Chances of developed aliens (Kardashev 2 or 3) reaching Earth are very very very slim. If some do exist and visit I am sure they would be unlike humans and with different reasoning, logic, thought process and whatever. It would be unlike anything we humans can imagine or think of because we have not seen other intellegent conscious beings other than the apes we are. They would surely be more evolved and uninterested in our matters.
