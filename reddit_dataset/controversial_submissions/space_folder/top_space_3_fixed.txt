{"body":"The *Pale Blue Dot* is a photograph of Earth taken by Voyager 1 at a distance of about 6 billion km (beyond the orbit of Pluto). The Earth is a tiny dot in the photo, less than the size of a pixel.		[small image](http://i.imgur.com/wno8NX6.jpg)		[large image](http://i.imgur.com/qstcj28.jpg)		The photo was taken at the request of Carl Sagan and here are his somewhat sobering words on the subject: 		>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there ??? on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.		>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity ??? in all this vastness ??? there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.		>The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

Think something along the lines of Bill Nye in the 90s or Neil DeGrasse Tyson more recently. I don't know of any Europeans that played similar roles. 		He also wrote books and articles on similar subject matter - my personal favorite is what he said on the ["Pale Blue Dot"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png) photo. It's a picture of the Earth through Saturn's rings. In it, our entire planet is no more than a few pixels across. 		>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.		>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.

Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.		>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.		>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.		>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience.

I find that the most efficient way to google a simple question - questions in the likes of "What's an x?" or "X explained" - yield far better result than asking it on reddit.  I do hate 'hand holding', I believe people miss out the experience to learn on their own and, most of all, the ability to search for information. I always find that the same people who view Google as a last resort instead of the first option tend to have trouble finding what they are looking for which leads them to ask even more questions. It always stuck to me when my software engineering professor called us the post-"Google generation" , a generation that expects the gratification of getting your answer served to you. We have so much options that we forget the one that binds all of them. People who know how to gather information using Google tend to be the ones that ask less questions. Not because they are too proud but because they just need the answers to fill the missing pieces.		So when I tell someone to Google something, it's not because I feel superior but because I already did the Google search and found 3 links in under 5 minutes.

A lot of interaction with law enforcement. But that rare time when they aren't all together, they might hear some amazing fact in class like that there are more atoms in the human body than stars in the known universe. And that intrigues them. They want to learn more, but before their newfound intellectual curiosity can take hold, the class ends and their disfunctional friends drag them back into willing ignorance, happy to give up the pursuit of knowledge for a 'badman' reputation amongst their friends.		So imagine when these people, free from having to adhere to their stereotypical behaviour come to us or others with basic questions, only to be mocked or shunned. They withdraw, they feel stupid and less comfortable following the pursuit of knowledge. 		A general rule of thumb is, there will always be someone who knows more than you; if you have yet to learn something, would you wish to be mocked and derided by those who know the answers?

I'm going to look that up and I'll get back to you next class!" And I do - I look it up and then we talk about it. A single question like that, showing connection and critical thinking, is easily worth 20 naive questions, and often I learn things I've never considered before!
