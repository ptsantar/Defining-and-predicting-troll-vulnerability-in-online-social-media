{"body":"No research whatsoever, huh? For shame.		> A team in China, an inventor in Britain and a third person, Guido Fetta, have built three separate versions of the EmDrive. All three versions supposedly give different results varying by a factor of ~500 from one another.		China used 2500W of input energy, NASA used 17W. Maaaaaaybe this can account for the difference in results? Nah, must be fake because the absolute output is different.		> The ???test??? performed at NASA was sensitive to a minimum thrust threshold of about 10-to-15 microNewtons, and the ???positive result??? claimed detection of somewhere between 30-to-50 microNewtons of thrust.			Numbers from your ass. From your own link: "Testing was performed on a low-thrust torsion pendulum that is capable of detecting force at a single-digit micronewton level". Both 15 and 30 contain more than one digit, so it seems above the margin of error. I don't have a PhD in Mathematics, but I can surely tell that. 		> And finally (and most damning), there was a ???true??? version and a ???null??? version of the EmDrive that were both tested at this facility, with the anticipation that the true version would produce this thrust and that the null version wouldn???t. But both versions produced the same thrust.

{"body":"> In fact, the 'Null Drive' was a modified version of the Cannae Drive, a flying-saucer-shaped device with slots engraved in one face only. The underlying theory is that the slots create a force imbalance in resonating microwaves; the 'Null Drive' was unslotted, but still produced thrust when filled with microwaves. This may challenge the theory -- it is probably no coincidence that Cannae inventor Guido Fetta is patenting a new version which works differently -- but not the results.		But there still remains the point that the 'Null Drive' produced thrust when it wasn't supposed to.  That seems like what a spurious device would do such as the N-rays in OP's article.		Sure, it's possible that this EM Drive actually works and does what it's supposed to, but in order to be reasonably certain about a result that apparently breaks the known laws of physics, you need to have very good supporting evidence.  This is not enough.  Just because the researchers who tested it were from NASA doesn't mean that it was a conclusive, exhaustive test that confirms the result.		Not to mention that wired article doesn't seem like the best source...

{"body":"> But there still remains the point that the 'Null Drive' produced thrust when it wasn't supposed to. That seems like what a spurious device would do such as the N-rays in OP's article.		The hypothesis was "These fins cause microwave magic that somehow produces thrust". The null hypothesis was "these fins are junk and don't do shit."		The null device was to see whether or not the fins mattered. Since the hypothesis was testing whether or not the fins mattered, the null device simply proved that the effect of the fins merely boosted the thrust by a small amount but were not absolutely required. It wasn't just a soup can with some wires, it was still a fully functioning drive with just one component removed.		There's a full paper out there, but it seems that junk science authors are more than content to write diatribe based on a two page abstract without actually checking the actual test parameters.		> Sure, it's possible that this EM Drive actually works and does what it's supposed to, but in order to be reasonably certain about a result that apparently breaks the known laws of physics, you need to have very good supporting evidence.

This wasn't the first test (not even the first NASA test) and it won't be the last. As with all science, people will burst forth from every crack and crevice trying to prove or disprove all of the results. They will nitpick and deny and scream to everyone that will listen how it's awesome/garbage, and then a new set of tests will emerge. With these new results, it will skew a bit in one direction, and more testing will happen. Then again, and again, and again. Somewhere in the middle, someone will be called to Oslo to eat some doughnuts and get a medal. Then more testing, more shouting and arguing. The scientific method is pretty sweet.","depth":2,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"orochidp","name":"t1_cjjydk3","parent_id":"t1_cjjx4z4","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1407454078,"created_utc":1407450478}

It's like the discovery of superluminal neutrinos by the CERN team.

The people saying this device violates any laws of any physics just don't know. This isn't free energy, this isn't perpetual motion, this isn't some crackpot theory. Okay, it's really, really strange, but it's still backed by a wall of math. I doubt this violates any current law of physics, but it sure might confirm some fringe theories. Just as [quantum fluctuations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuations) violate the conservation of energy (for a while at least), this will be neatly explained away under some weird quirk that, in the end, does nothing permanent to our fancy laws.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"orochidp","name":"t1_cjk1ukk","parent_id":"t1_cjk1anq","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1407461189,"created_utc":1407457589}

I agree in the need to be exhaustive when unexpected results are encountered. However this is one of multiple tests that have all shown similar results and NASA designed this as a confirmation test to be as exhaustive as possible.

The idea of a spacecraft flitting around the solar system on nuclear power, running for decades or longer without needing to refuel, is incredibly tantalizing. But my desire has no bearing on the truth, and the problem of how that thrust actually arises given the conservation of momentum is a big one. It's too early to pass judgement either way, IMO.		I think the ultimate test would be to build a small emdrive and put it up on a CubeSat or something like that.
