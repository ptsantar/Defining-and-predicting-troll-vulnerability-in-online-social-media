{"body":"If someone says that they have a FLT engine except that it does break the law of conservation of momentum then I hear a little siren go off.

{"body":"No one is saying it's FTL, just that it is somehow producing low levels of thrust. Also, just because something seems to violate one of our ideas about the fundamental workings of the universe, doesn't mean it doesn't work. Who knows, maybe conservation of momentum only appears to be because reactionless momentum changes only occur under very constrained and fine tuned circumstances, and therefore would not be present in the universe at large.			I don't mean to say we should just accept it's true and redo physics, i'm saying we need to take something like this seriously, because there is real data being collected by multiple sources that all claim positive results one way or the other.","depth":2,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Norose","name":"t1_cqy0j4v","parent_id":"t1_cqy097i","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1430756412,"created_utc":1430752812}
{"body":"I don't "believe in" the em drive. I'm *interested in* the em drive.		One can be properly skeptical while still allowing for the possibility that something like this just might actually have something to it. So I follow the news and go "oh, neat" every time the effect passes another test with a bit more significance. I have fun pondering a world where the em drive has proven out as a practical technology. I also have fun pondering a world where I have a lightsabre.

{"body":"Not a great article, not that I expected more from Popular Mechanics. They said "Previous tests of emDrive haven't held up to scrutiny." Then didn't provide any source for that claim. As far as I know, every test done so far has show that the drive produces thrust, just not the amounts of thrust claimed by Shawyer.","depth":0,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"FloobLord","name":"t1_cqy3jkq","parent_id":"t3_34tms7","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1430761474,"created_utc":1430757874}
{"body":"May or may not be true, but this part of the article is misleading:		*"And the NASA agency investigating the EmDrive, informally known as Eagleworks, is specifically devoted to investigation of fringe or far-future ideas such as the Alcubierre Drive, a futuristic warp drive that is both (marginally) technically possible and completely unfeasible due to bonkers energy demands. So just because you hear that NASA is intrigued by an idea, don't assume that it's going to work tomorrow."*		This implies that the credibility of Eagleworks is suspect, because of "*... investigation of fringe or far-future ideas...*".
