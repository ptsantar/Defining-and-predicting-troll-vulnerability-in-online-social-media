{"body":"> You guys do realize the hullabaloo is about much more than one employee getting canned...right?		Very, *very* much so. I'm a mod here, and on 2 other large default subreddits. The other 2 I help out in have gone dark (TIL, Videos). I won't speak for the other mods here, but personally, I am extremely intimate with the problems everyone is up in arms about. The bright side is that the admins lack of communication and general inaction has helped us grow and become better mods as we figure out our own solutions to the problems we face. We become better problem solvers and it becomes a learning experience. 		Beyond that, I think many of us old timers are frustrated with being promised more mod tools and functionality. They're always saying "it's coming, we're hiring people for that". Well, the first time I heard that was back in 2010. I've heard it every year since. It's been *a half a decade*. Where are these tools? Reddit sees 170 million unique hits a month and has less mod functionality than a phpbb forum. It's frustrating to say the least.","depth":1,"score":45,"ups":45,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"relic2279","name":"t1_csqsf9f","parent_id":"t1_csqqwwv","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1435910228,"created_utc":1435906628}

While we appreciate all you do here, we know and see that Reddit has been on a giant asteroid crash course in recent times, and we need to send a *strong* message to the admins.  /r/pics had admins begging within an hour to go back up.  		If we all join the blackhole, Reddit will be forced to do something.  No one minds subs going super nova for a bit, in fact, I think we'd be happy about it for the most part.		Remember, *we* are the community, the mods and contributers.  Not the admins.  We don't have to pander to them.  They have to pander to us, and they've forgotten this one key point.
