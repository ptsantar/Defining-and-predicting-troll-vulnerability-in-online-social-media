I personally expect us to be alone out here, but I honestly cannot figure out whether it's my religious views or the Fermi paradox that brings me to that conclusion (I hope we are not alone; the universe is more interesting that way).  In the event that we do meet intelligent aliens, I won't be all that surprised.		I do think the Church has a lot of questions it needs to answer between now and then.  However, our response really does boil down to "preach the gospel to all creation".  Implicit in our worldview is that humanity is intrinsically screwed up, to the core (look at the news for examples); the gospel -- or good news -- is the idea that Jesus, through some unexplained mechanism, has offered to take that screwed-up-ness out of the individual, if we accept him.		So there'd be an awkward moment where we ascertain whether sin had affected the aliens' culture (maybe they aren't all screwed up like us).  And then, ask if they've heard of this guy named Jesus.  They likely wouldn't speak English, and Jesus/Yeshua/Isa/whatever name he goes by in their language, likely would have a different name, which would make communication harder.  But in the end, that's probably the path we would take.		If there are aliens, that's not going to make a significant difference in our worldview, other than giving us an opportunity to learn from an entirely different culture -- but that (rather dramatic) change is not limited to religious people.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kd8azz","name":"t1_crnivft","parent_id":"t1_crljeju","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1432816008,"created_utc":1432812408}

Also remember, in my worldview, every force of evil in the world is somehow tied to the concept of sin -- a somewhat contagious incurable disease (which also passes from parents to children), and has already infected everyone.  Also remember that we believe that God instituted a supernatural cure, through the person of Jesus.
