{"body":"Click bait. First off, this is unconfirmed. Secondly, it's cool that they're up there, but we've known that our atmosphere harbors microbes so this makes sense. If it turns out they're proliferating up there, then that's definitely more interesting.		I'm just so tired of overly sensationalized headlines.","depth":0,"score":22,"ups":22,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"justSFWthings","name":"t1_cjxr19v","parent_id":"t3_2eat5i","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1408741256,"created_utc":1408737656}
{"body":"I wonder if this is unconfirmed because it isn't true. The statement from NASA seemed to indicate that the proper paperwork had not been filed or protocols had not been followed. The spokesperson didn't seem to point-blank say that it wasn't true. 		>  If it turns out they're proliferating up there, then that's definitely more interesting.		Serious question: Could this have anything to do with the oceans heating up?","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"element777","name":"t1_cjyr2s3","parent_id":"t1_cjxr19v","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1408845808,"created_utc":1408842208}

{"body":"If there's one thing I hate more than sensationalized headlines, it's people's tendency to treat "the media" as if it were one monolithic conspiracy. The media you're talking about is thousands of different organizations comprising tens of thousands of journalists. Some of them are good at what they do, some of them suck. By all means, let's call out the bad ones. But don't let your perception of bad journalists lead you to the assumption that they *all* suck, unless you want to be uninformed the rest of your life.","depth":2,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"danman_d","name":"t1_cjxu85o","parent_id":"t1_cjxrd0p","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1408747650,"created_utc":1408744050}
