{"body":"The Guardian reported this first. The original story is here: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/06/philae-comet-could-be-home-to-alien-life-say-top-scientists		EDIT: And an update to say that it's probably wrong (thanks to GeoGeoGeoGeo for the link): http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/jul/06/no-alien-life-on-philae-comet		I'm not a biologist, so I'm very eager to hear some comments and speculations from those who are more familiar with the field. Regardless, this is very exciting (and potentially disturbing) news. If there really is microbial life riding on 67P, how common must life be on comets and meteoroids? And how often do they introduce new lifeforms on Earth (and other planets)? Does life originate on comets, or is the comet merely a fragment of some other body which harbored even more life?		I know these aren't new questions, but it seems they might become more important in the very near future.","depth":0,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aetherlung","name":"t1_cstuhdm","parent_id":"t3_3cb1nn","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436198352,"created_utc":1436194752}

{"body":"As someone who's worked in the field , i've done extremophile genomics work in deep sea vent microbes, it's possible but unlikely microbes could exist on comets.  More likely it could be macromolecules possibly proteins but it's hard to imagine long chain nucleic acids let alone cells surviving.  Since they don't have instruments on board to test the hypothesis it's just speculation.  Also keep in mind this claim could have been made to drum up support for funding a project to test for microbes on comets. Not that that's wrong to do but sometimes claims are made for purposes of getting a program started rather than on the completeness of the current observations.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"malcontented","name":"t1_cstvyv8","parent_id":"t3_3cb1nn","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436200955,"created_utc":1436197355}

{"body":"Active life on a comet is just about impossible, this article is bad science from fringe scientists. Comets are too cold even for the -40 extremophiles mentioned, most of a comets life is spent in the deep freeze barely above absolute zero. There is no liquid water on the comet, let alone lakes, there is no pressure so water goes from ice directly to gas.		The odds of finding DNA based life active or inactive are probably quite high at least in the solar system. Major impacts of earth have ejected millions of tons of debris into space, some of that debris ends up crashing into the other planets and moons. There are some papers that predict upwards of a million kg of earth are now on Titan, look up a paper by Worth for some figures. So its possible that if there is life out there it is a distant cousin.		But since comets have less gravity and a smaller cross section the amount of earth debris they are likely to collect is minimal.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"phryan","name":"t1_csu0l45","parent_id":"t1_cstuk7u","subreddit":"space","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh87","created":1436208340,"created_utc":1436204740}
