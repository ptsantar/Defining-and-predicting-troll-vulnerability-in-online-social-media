{"body":"I assume by 2/3rds majority you mean that two branches of government are controlled by Democrat majority, or Democrat leadership (the Presidency and the Senate). This has not been true since 2007, in 2008 Democrats had majority control of all three branches of law makers, and lost that majority in the House of Representatives in the mid-term elections in 2010.		For laws to be made they must be passed by all three branches of government; the House of Representatives and the Senate in any order then the President.		Holding two of the three doesn't matter, because a bill must pass all three.		This is not a Democrat/Republican issue, it is how the Constitution structured the government to uphold minority rights. Despite the lack of action and "left-leaning" journalists bitching about it, this is how the system is supposed to work. If you can't get the full majority, you don't get the law. This prevents the "tyranny of the majority" that people only desire when they are in that majority, and are too quick to forget that they will be in the minority some day.		So in essence, *it is* the minority that are preventing bills from passing, but that is the role they are *meant to play*.		The American government is still operating the way it was designed.		I think I have deviated from what you wrote by quite a bit there, maybe I read into your statement too much, maybe you're only stating that tribalism isn't helping anything, I only somewhat agree with that assessment. I think this problem was accentuated by attempting to eliminate "pork barrel" sweeteners, that were used to buy minority support, now it requires changing actual laws, which people cannot abide.

{"body":"Flash in the pan movements are nice but long term awareness and cultivating of long term giving habits is preferable. 		*Nothing* is ever 100% good and everything comes with a downside. This downside is that slacktivism inoculates people against real action in the future. Since 4/5 people who did this in my facebook didn't know where you could donate and just told me to google it or ask someone else it makes me wonder (this is a small sample, doesn't really matter except to irritate me) just how many people are going to think that dumping a bucket on your head equates to giving up a meal out to donate.		If you develop a consistent trend where individuals are given the sense of contributing sans any sacrifice leading to tangible contribution whatsoever they will become accustomed to that and when you propose actual contributions later without a game or pat on the back by the interwebz a whole cohort will be more likely to tune you out.		That said I don't think this movement started that way. Initially it was "$100 or take the ice bucket challenge *and* $10" but that's not the version I've seen in anything to read my small sample of friends and family. Somewhere someone removed the $10 and made it an "impossible donation or useless act" proposition. Typical viral behavior that can't be blamed on any one person but setting dangerous precedent nonetheless.		Tl;DR	Donating isn't bad. The original idea of the bucket challenge wasn't bad. Encouraging people to engage in an altered version of the movement that lowers the bar to give them that sense of contribution is very bad in the long run.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cjsqqey","parent_id":"t1_cjsq1zk","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1408293779,"created_utc":1408290179}

The core thing that makes it a good movement is that it has increased the donation rate 4-fold. More people are donating to them than without the publicity.		Sure, if 80% of the people on your Facebook do the challenge but don't donate that might look bad - but it discounts the fact that its sending awareness through the roof so that it cancels it out anyway.		If awareness raises 500% but donations only increase 20%, then its still worth doing. The publicity this trend has brought to ALS has probably increased awareness by a few orders of magnitude - a 500% increase is probably tiny compared to reality.		But still, the main point is that you are fixated on a problem that doesn't exist - because those that aren't donating now weren't going to donate in the first place; and who gives a fuck what they do as long as donations generally increase anyway?

Could just be my general disgust of the monster social media has become. Maybe I'm just cynical. But it just bothers me.
