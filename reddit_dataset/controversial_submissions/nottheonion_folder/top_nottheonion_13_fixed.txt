{"body":"I'm mates with the guy, but I don't find this close to being 100% accurate. Went to high school with him and found out about his accident on my 20th birthday.		One of the nicest and most genuine guys you'll ever meet. His family the same.		Ben had just came back from china after teaching English to school kids. He was pretty bloody good at mandarin before the accident, chatting to the Chinese students at school daily in mandarin.		I spoke to him last year about it and he said once he woke up from the coma (about a week) he had no recollection of returning to Australia and the first nurse he say was Asian. Naturally, from waking up in a coma, he thought he was still in china so he started to speak in mandarin. His mum said she freaked out pretty heavily from it.		I don't doubt he might've seemed like he spoke incredibly fluently (after thinking he's still over there) but waking up to be suddenly be able to speak fluent mandarin is pretty bullshit. He had been learning to speak it since 2005 (I was in the same class as him for it).		Take what you want from that, by he's definitely the nicest guy you come across if you ever get to meet him.","depth":0,"score":2713,"ups":2713,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bbbeeennnyyy","name":"t1_ckfeku7","parent_id":"t3_2g3l75","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1410454328,"created_utc":1410450728}

I don't think I asserted this, at all, though there are scholarly works that do in fact make that assertion.

But I digress.		All I said was you can learn things at *night*, which I implied, boldly perhaps, would be the likely period preceeding sleep.		No, not all hormones act the same way (though I've never heard of cotisol having a relationship with long-term memory building, I'd only heard it has detrimental effects on the brain - but I have little to know knowledge of cortisol), and the relationship between sleep and memory is far from static.  I only provided my anecdote as part of this discussion where /u/DesertstormPT related a learning experience and you laughed at them, and then provided a blanket statement of your own.  I suggested that your statement,		>You generally remember the things you study before falling a sleep a lot better in the morning.		fails to take into account the fact that stress, like that of an upcoming exam or performance, can be a significant impediment to memory storage.

{"body":"I'm Vietnamese and can offer some insight on that. 		Once you learn the pronunciation of the letters and symbols, learning to spell is mostly straightforward. The spelling of a word exactly corresponds to what the individual letters/symbols that make up that word sound like. 		This is completely different from English where you have the often see different pronunciations for words that are spelled similarly (e.g. "choose" sounds like CHo??oz while "loose" which sounds like lo??os) or in some cases the exact same spelling becomes a whole different word/meaning (e.g. "I like to read before bed" vs "I've read that book before" or "the bass line to this song is sick!" vs "he reeled in a 10 pound bass fish"). 		The biggest obstacle to Vietnamese is that it takes a while to master the sounds, but once you do, you can master building words. Then your next hurdle is figuring out the meaning of different words and phrases, which requires a lot vocabulary memorization, and discerning the subtle differences in sound. And the different sounds have huge differences in meaning, e.g. ma = ghost/monster, m?? = but/however, m??? = tomb/grave, m?? = horse, m?? = mother, m??? with a dot/period symbol under the a (it doesn't show when I copy/pasted) = plating.","depth":5,"score":13,"ups":13,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AeroGold","name":"t1_ckff8xs","parent_id":"t1_ckfdzmc","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1410455634,"created_utc":1410452034}

Given my knowledge of Chinese characters and Cantonese phonology, and given its proximity to Vietnam, it's not hard to see connections between the Sino-Vietnamese and Chinese pronunciations.

Mandarin merges -m/-n into -n and also loses the ng- initial. Additionally h- palatalises into x-. Cantonese changes -ue into -ai. Korean also loses the ng- initial and tones.

{"body":"My opinion is that this is one of the reason they learn faster/easier.  It has nothing to do with differences in acquisition, but everything to do with how adults treat child learners versus adult learners.  When an adult is learning something new, especially something academic like a new language, the instructor expects perfection -- perfect grammar, perfect spelling, perfect recall.  When a child is learning something, they get sooooo much more leeway and freedom to experiment and "play" with new sounds, words and constructs, which strengthens the impression in their brain and speeds overall acquisition.  		But, learning languages like a child does will result in child-like writing and grammar, only to be perfected over years of schooling.  It's a trade-off, but there is no doubt in my mind that oral fluency is far more valuable for the vast majority of foreign language learners than written fluency.		(My firsthand experience with this is as someone who studied Latin for 5 years in grade school, then 2 years each of Spanish & German in college, and 1.5 years of Portuguese in grad school after spending about 10 years working with Brazilians.  The Portuguese was by far the easiest for me to pick up because, by that time, I was basically just learning grammar rules.

They all have some tie to the language they woke up speaking.

This is what fucks with me though, none of them were fluent. I totally agree with your point, the brain *is weird* and it could be distant memories. Particularly in the cases of the American and Australian man because they'd lived in the respective countries where they would be surrounded by the language and encountering a large chunk of it on a subconscious level. The Croatian girl less so, but I don't know how much these articles exaggerate their fluentness anyway.		This means there's a way to access the subconscious information we encounter. I'm not saying crash your car and you'll ace that French exam, but there's clearly a way it can be done. I wonder if we could learn to control that? Forget the context of these cases, if we could learn to access that subconscious information think about the implications. We could perhaps improve distant memories to make them more reliable in court rooms, perhaps help people with amnesia, perhaps we could just *remember everything we encounter*.
