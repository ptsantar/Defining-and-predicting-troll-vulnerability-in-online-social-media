{"body":"This is taken out of context. The real quote was relating to him moving to a new city for a year to play for a different team but keeping his family where they're currently at and not being close to them.		Here's the full quote 		"[i]t wasn???t about the money because of the Detroit situation. But at the end of the day, you know, I do have a family. So, it is going to be a little harder on me this year. But I???m going to push through it and try to do long-term after this year. But I think, this year, focusing on doing something special with this group of guys ??? we have the opportunity to do something special. Right now, this is what I want to focus on."		It's quite easy to misinterpret but I'm positive he is referring to being away from his family because 	1. He is moving away from them going to LA. 	2. His new contract is only one year and he says he wants a longer term contract in the future.","depth":0,"score":215,"ups":215,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sphincterlicker","name":"t1_ctftf88","parent_id":"t3_3ekaal","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1437872464,"created_utc":1437843664}

{"body":"Yes, and no.  In reality, you're correct.  However, athletes should only be spending a very small fraction of their annual salary.

The very nature of their jobs means even under the best of circumstances it will be a short career (relative to a non-athlete, who may work for 40 years).  In the worst of circumstances, their careers end suddenly and very prematurely.  		Sadly, I think the HBO series ballers is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of what happens.
