Overall wacky hair etc could devalue the image of the school and threaten its revenue stream, so they crack down hard on things like this. It is a pupils role to push the boundaries as much as possible, but in the end if this girl wanted to stay at the school she should have capitulated. This does sound like a repeat offence though, they wouldn't expel her first time round for something like this.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"peck112","name":"t1_cqeauor","parent_id":"t1_cqe7v2e","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1429195724,"created_utc":1429192124}

{"body":"If you think that's a good idea, well... I don't know what you're thinking.		High school is all about individuality. It's the time in your life where you're meant to discover what kind of person you want to be - and teenagers need a school environment that embraces that, that offers them a lot of different opportunities and variations so that they can decide which one suits them.		As for uniforms, they're ridiculous. You don't just wear a uniform for most jobs, you are expected to fucking dress yourself at the very least. Uniforms are useful for one thing - making a class divide irrelevant when it comes to dress. However, students alter their uniforms as much as possible, they find any way to express individuality they can - and class divides are still a problem at any rate, uniforms don't fix anything. This is more a problem in the UK than the U.S.		Giving a child the opportunity to wear the same thing day in and day out is a terrible idea. Not that everyone needs to have keen fashion sense, but they need to at the very least learn what is appropriate and what is not. Kids who wear uniforms/have dress codes DON'T learn these things, or at least not as easily. I went to two high schools, one with uniforms and one without - kids with uniforms are desperate to get out of them the moment they can, to show off leg, to roll up sleeves, to create any amount of sex appeal they can out of it - and it's a BIG concern to them, less so than it is for their fashion-permitted counterparts.		Uniforms are a product of a bygone age, and I really hope they disappear. They're more about school unity and pushing a school's visibility and brand more than anything else. There's often a level of cronyism that enters into it as well as schools will often give friends or family contracts to sell uniforms if possible since they are often expensive and mandatory. It creates an illusion of discipline where there is none and an air of conservatism that students frequently and actively push up against as a result.		Most employers respect their employees' individuality. You're not necessarily a unique and special snowflake but wearing a uniform doesn't teach anybody that, it doesn't teach discipline, and it doesn't teach respect - it only makes students angry when they are forces to obey rules that seem pointless and arbitrary that exist solely for others' benefit.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"caninehere","name":"t1_cqebkmy","parent_id":"t1_cqeaobe","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1429197093,"created_utc":1429193493}

{"body":"I agree that there are a lot of other ways for schools to add structure to kid's lives, and I truly believe kids should be able to express themselves, it's good for them.  However, that doesn't mean a school shouldn't be able to enforce whatever rules that they want to.  It's in their right to do so, and if a child and their parents want them to go to that school they have to follow the rules.  Strict religious schools often have rules like this for their own reasons, and asking a child to not dye their hair isn't that absurd.		There are plenty of schools that may be more suitable, but I also understand that there are extenuating circumstances for a child to want to stay at a certain establishment.  I believe that the school should allow the young lady to dye her hair, but I don't run the school.		If you believe that structure is only there to create obedient little worker drones, you may want to revisit why it's so important to train soldiers before they go to war, or doctors before they operate.  Under intense pressure, it's the structure and training that takes over.		I agree with you more than I disagree with you, I really do, it's just that rules are rules for a reason.  You either need to follow them, or face the consequences of not following them.  I break rules all the time because I don't believe in them, but I also own up to it and accept the punishment for it.

{"body":"I agree that preparing for war and civilian life are completely different.   And now that I think more about it, it was silly of me to even throw that in there.  Even the doctor reference was a bit off target, as you point out there is premed available.		A better explanation that I was driving at is that a school is an institution that can set rules as they see fit.  Arbitrary or not, the school has obviously deemed it necessary to have that rule in place.  While I don't know much about this particular school, Trinity School seems to imply that it's a religious institution in the UK.  When you enroll, you're essentially signing a contract and agreeing to those rules.  I know it's unfair, and expression is important for children, but you need to pick your fights.  Hair color doesn't seem to me to be one of those fights to pick.  Reading lists, class sizes, food programs... those are the fights to pick, not hair color or being able to wear a hat to class.  Is that reasonable?		I've already acknowledged the fact that there are extenuating circumstances that would warrant a child wanting to stay at a school (friends, teachers, etc.) but there are other options available.		It seems as though Trinity School takes a "different, individualistic approach" to schooling.  That in and of itself tells you their end goal.  It's going to be more strict.		Again, I think we're on the same side.  We just differ on what a school should and shouldn't do related to individual rules, which I still contend is up to them.

That exact situation actually happened in my hometown after I graduated. A new principle and vice principle turned what was a very good public school into something much more like a prison by adding more rules and taking away freedoms from both the students and faculty. Then the school board got rid of the arts programs and stopped providing busing for after-school activities. Standardized test scores dropped for the first time in over a decade.

{"body":"I had many good teachers, but I also went through some rather touchy situations.  It took me over a decade of adult life lessons to finally understand my  teachers.  When I figured it out, I decided that these things are ultimately true about school.		1. Teachers, like most other groups of adults, can often have a surprisingly high rate of petty childishness occurring in their ranks.  Some of this is determined by the hiring process, some of it just pure luck of the draw because a lot of people know how to bullshit their way into a job and there's just no stopping them.		2. When a childish teacher doesn't like you, it's often based on insecurities and events stemming from their own high-school experience.  Some of them have never really left high-school emotionally and psychologically, they're just on a different tier of the social structure now.  BE CAREFUL.		3. Like most other workplaces, there are teachers in the faculty who will presume to know you better than you know yourself, and they will also presume to have the right to personally take you to task.  When you can't quite figure out what their problem is, they probably think that you *think* a certain way, *feel* a certain way, and *believe* certain things that you don't.  In fact, none of it has crossed your mind and that is why you are so confused.  You have *no* fucking clue what they're talking about, and you likely never will, but they will tell you that you know *exactly* what they're talking about...you little liar.  		4. The politics of the teachers' lounge will invariably determine how students are treated.  This is because, much like a judge will always take a cop's word over yours, your school's administration will take the word of their teachers (the ones they like) over yours every time.  If they can get away with taking subtle shots at you and your family, some of them will take that opportunity every time.  I'm not saying there are a lot of these, but they're out there. 		5.  Much like any other management team at work, the teacher faculty is an echo chamber.  Once one teacher has a problem with you (or your red hair), pretty soon they're all talking about it.  And "something needs to be done."  Why?  Because something needs to be done, that's why, duh, you can't just show up with red hair and get away with it, my god, what lesson does that teach you, *something must be done*.  		6. Much like most of the bosses you will have for the remainder of your life, if you call your teacher out or correct them, even politely, there is a possibility that you just invoked the wrath a vindictive, egotistical little shit.  Two weeks later you are apparently in violation of the dress code.  SURPRISE!    		Now, don't use this as an excuse to be a jerk or skip your homework.  Do your best, try to avoid pissing off your teachers, and choose your battles wisely.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cqefj2d","parent_id":"t3_32se4c","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1429203750,"created_utc":1429200150}

Scientist are working hard using genetics to understand whens and where this evil arose!		> Red hair and associated freckles are caused by a variation in the MC1R gene.		Even if the hair is removed or dyed, gingers can be identified by freckles - wigs and dyes lie disguise!		> Research suggests redheads have a remarkable capacity to produce higher levels of vitamin D from less sunlight.		Bastards have ferocious nails and claws because of it!		> They feel pain differently (ie: they are tougher than you) and need more anaesthesia to knock them out on the operating table.		It is hard to knock one out - go for instakill if you can!		> The variation in pain sensation could also account for their ability to chow down on spicy hot food.		They will devour anything and everything!		> Redheads are also fabulous in business.

Since CEOs have a disproportionate amount of psychopaths among them, comparing to general population, you can draw a conclusion here yourself...		> Throughout the ages, gingers have been victims of horrific social outcast as a result of their luxurious, wild manes.		People have always known... 		> In the 15th century, they were deemed to be witches and burnt at the stake. Around 45,000 were tortured and murdered.

Subconscious repulsion, that is what it is!		> The article cited research in France that suggested redheads were approached less in mating not because they were less desirable but because they were highly desirable.

After all, as you stated, the reason the school did this was to create a "distraction-free environment," so it matters very much what kinds of physical variances between students constitute a "distraction" and which ones don't. 		The logic behind school uniforms is based on a wonky and unrealistic concept of what is "distracting" for teenagers. When I was in school, girls would leave the house wearing t-shirts and baggy sweatpants so that their moms wouldn't raise a fuss, then change into hanky tops and short shorts in the locker room once they got to school. There were the metal kids with their gauged ears and septum piercings and black clothes, the hardcore kids with their gauged ears and septum piercings and cuffed straight leg jeans, the punks with their gauged ears and septum piercings and blue hair, there was a group of girls who all had the "Chelsea," a hairstyle where you shave the whole head except for the front of the hairline, grow that part out, dye it blue and comb it down over your face. Guess what, it wasn't distracting! It wasn't distracting because it was just they way people looked, it was unimportant compared to the issues teenagers are actually dealing with. 		Do you know what was distracting? Indifferent or incompetent teachers who couldn't keep their classes under control, like my science teacher who wasted a lot of class time one day indulging a creationist student, or the history professor who was too mild and gentle to stand up to the kids in the back of his classroom who never paid attention to the lessons and constantly disrupted class by making sex jokes and then bursting out laughing. Then there was the study hall teacher who was so terrifically incompetent that she let her classroom turn into a noisy bro-room where students from the football team would talk loudly and constantly about which female student had the nicest ass and guffawing at hilarious jokes about gay butt sex, occasionally interspersed with naked racism directed at the Ukrainian immigrant students* who were universally referred to sneeringly as "stupid fucking Russians." 		These were real distractions. These were actual disruptions of class time, not something as trivial and inconsequential as how everyone dressed. 		*My town had a sizable Ukrainian immigrant community.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HerkDerpner","name":"t1_cqfx4k9","parent_id":"t1_cqfvlxz","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1429310149,"created_utc":1429306549}

The other which is believed to have originated near the border of Norway and Sweden doesn't freckle or tan, it only sunburns. and they are at higher risk for skin problems from repeated sunburn than even blondes. 		The one that originated in North America originated with the Cherokee people before European settlement. 		The area the Cherokee people originated in has hot summers with a lot of sun beating down  most days. Some amount of tan is necessary to protect the skin. Those of us who live in that area and are light skinned have to expose the skin gradually on the first sunny days in the spring.  The winters are largely cloudy and overcast, with very little sun, and a good amount of rain.  Therefore if the skin were permanently dark, it could not have absorbed enough vitamin E to remain healthy all winter.  If it stayed light permanently it would be seriously, and in a dry year, perhaps fatally damaged by the unrelenting sun. The only ones who survived were the ones who's skin could darken in the summer to block more of the UV and lighten in the winter to absorb more vitamin E, so if you find a redhead who can tan, that is actually a marker for Cherokee bloodlines.
