If after the first read through the third grader is disinterested or not fully understanding they just mark an answer. I think asking third graders about politics is going to be difficult without some high degree of control. 		On the other hand if they were to make sure to explain to the third graders the difference between a democracy and a dictatorship immediately before the survey then it would skew the results. If they've been taught about basic political systems in the past (which I'm sure they have) then the individuals that didn't retain the info are just gonna guess.

A given action by POTUS might be enough to seriously anger the populace (like the NSA spying scandal) but not enough to get him run out of town.

{"body":"There are little in the way of checks and balances with a majority government.   Given the near ceremonial nature of the governor general (appointed based on the recommendation and support of the sitting government) and completely ineffective senate, people could be forgiven for thinking we live in a democratically elected dictatorship.		What's worse is public voting of MP's and the existence of the government whip means the will of the party on issues nearly always trumps the people the MP's were elected to represent (aka: Gun registry voting which saw little support in ridings buy representing MP's voting for it out of fear of party reprisal) .		This was summed up nicely in a book from 2001, The Friendly Dictator (http://www.amazon.ca/The-Friendly-Dictatorship-Jeffrey-Simpson/dp/0771080786)		The only line of defense is a rather fiercely independent judiciary that strikes down laws that have been passed based on constitutional incompatibility.   Parties have attacked the judiciary in the past by referring to those decisions as "activist" judgements and have openly talked about passing laws to curb that power. 		The last minority government that referred to a liberal/NDP coalition proposal should a vote of no confidence fail against the Conservatives as a Coup, and the general public agreed. That scares me.		I think Canada, with increasing power being vested in the PM (the actual head of state, the executive and the military technically work for the GG, not the PM), we're flirting more and more with the erosion of democracy.

As a Canadian born and raised in British Columbia and has spent a lot of time everywhere in the country (I was in the military for a while as well as worked and lived in Ontario for years), I can honestly say that you sound like you're basing your opinions off of what most Canadians consider the "worst of us": a) Quebecers, who, as a group, are so notorious for their snobbery and "holier than thou" attitudes that even French folks from France find them arrogant), b) Toronto/Oakville residents which, honestly, as Canada's largest metropolitan/urban centre you cannot seriously consider it as being representative of most people in the country, and c) Alberta, which is basically Canada's Texas (cowboys and oil), and are not exactly known amongst Canadians for their humility and approachability.		If you're interested in my opinion, I'll say this (and again, it's just an opinion, but I think it's a well-informed one based on my own extensive experience in many areas of the country): if you want to find the friendliest, most approachable people, you need to go to the coasts. Being born and raised in BC I have to give it a bit of a shout out in this regard (with the notable exception of the Lower Mainland... Greater Vancouver, being a large city, is rife with the urban attitude that Toronto suffers from although to a lesser degree).		Despite that, however, if you REALLY want to see what friendly Canadians look like, you need to get yourself to the Maritimes, particularly Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. You won't find friendlier, more hospitable, fun-loving people anywhere. I love me some Maritimer! So much so, in fact, that I'm marrying one!		Good luck!

Make a point of seeking them out, talking to them, ask them questions that show genuine interest in what they have to say. Keep in mind that YOU are the one looking specifically to make new friends... the people that you are seeking out likely aren't in the same position and are happy with their day-to-day and social circle.

I was just surprised because I also have moved a lot and never had a hard time settling/making local friends but had a particularly tricky time of it in Ontario. I've been in Alberta with a new job the last month and some change, and I'm finding everyone to be much warmer :) And the thing about the edginess with americans and being mistaken for americans and whatever, I understand you see as a healthy rivalry but it's one-sided, for one, and two, very over-the-top in Toronto at least.

{"body":"Pun aside, you're conflating a couple versions of it: the version claimed in 1978 "Je me souviens/ Que n?? sous le lys/ Je cro??s sous la rose" (which didn't hold up to historical scrutiny), a slightly different version of the aphorism that Tach?? wrote for another monument that was never built, and a third version also from Tach?? that was included on a commemorative coin.  None of them match the exact wording you wrote (the differences are minor: sous vs. dans, grandi vs. cro??s, the omission of "Dieu aidant"). Remember, the first record we have of je me souviens is carved into the Quebec Parliament right below the coat of arms of Quebec and above the main door--this was explicitly and universally credited to Eug??ne-??tienne Tach??, who was the architect of the building.  The first record we have anything about lilies and roses is from is from a separate project by Tach??, many years after the parliament building, and was apparently originally apparently meant as a motto for all of Canada, not merely la belle province.  This one used the phrasing "N??e dans les lis, je grandis dans les roses".  [Wikipedia tell me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je_me_souviens#Controversy_and_.22The_second_motto.22) it was revived for a " commemorative medal for the 300th anniversary of the foundation of Quebec City, [also] created by Tach??, on which is written 'N??e sous les lis, Dieu aidant, l?????uvre de Champlain a grandi sous les roses' ('Born under the lilies, God helping, Champlain's work has grown under the roses')."

{"body":"While we don't know what exactly Tach?? meant when he had the words inscribed, there are several old traditions of what he meant by it.		>Thomas Chapais, during a speech given for the occasion of the unveiling of a bronze statue honouring de L??vis, on June 24, 1895, said: "???the province of Quebec has a motto of which she is proud and which she likes enough to carve it on her monuments and palaces. This motto has only three words: "Je me souviens"; but these three words, in their simple economy of expression, are worth more than the most eloquent speeches. Yes, we remember. We remember the past and its lessons, the past and its misfortunes, the past and its glories."		A 1934 explanation reads: "M. Tach?? is also the author of the beautiful poetic and patriotic motto which accompanies the official coat of arms of the Province of Quebec ??? 'Je me souviens' ??? the full significance of which cannot perhaps be readily expressed in English words but which may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning 'We do not forget, and will never forget, our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past'."		The historian Mason Wade wrote in 1955, "When the French Canadian says 'Je me souviens', he not only remembers the days of New France but also the fact that he belongs to a conquered people."		There are of course a million other interpretations and things (those were all taken from Wikipedia for convenience), but for the most part they all have the same emphasis: the distinctness of French Canada (and, in particular, of Quebec) in relation to English Canada in terms of culture and history and, by extension, present and future.  The interesting question is in the next generation: whether the Portuguese and Spanish-speakers of Montreal will se souvenir in the same way as the generations of Quebecois have--whether the memories will be a distinctly cultural one, based on the French language within Canada, or it will be an ethnic one.  I would guess that the immigrant French speakers will remember just as the children of immigrants to English Canada are called to "true patriot love" in their "home and native land", but there's going to be a very interesting transition in French Canada over the next 30 or 40 years.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yodatsracist","name":"t1_crhkc75","parent_id":"t1_crhjegh","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1432316986,"created_utc":1432313386}

{"body":"Not really.		Oligarchy is a form of power structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, education, corporate, religious or military control. Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who typically pass their influence from one generation to the next, but inheritance is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.		Dictatorship is a form of government where political authority is monopolized by a single person or political entity, and exercised through various mechanisms to ensure the entity's power remains strong.[1][2]		A dictatorship is a type of authoritarianism, in which politicians regulate nearly every aspect of the public and private behavior of normal people. Dictatorships and totalitarianism generally employ political propaganda to decrease the influence of proponents of alternative governing systems, as is the nature of nationalism of any governing system.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ender-of-Bart","name":"t1_crhqpfd","parent_id":"t1_crhqmdy","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1432327307,"created_utc":1432323707}

{"body":"I would be willing to bet that most of the 8th-graders who answered this way weren't thinking of all the nuances about Canada's political system that are being brought up by others in this thread, but I do think there could be a cultural explanation behind this (based on my own casual observations, nothing really reliable albeit???). American culture tends towards highlighting in a critical way the things which we feel are wrong and need to be noticed/talked about/fixed, while simultaneously not paying much attention to the things that seem to be going okay. So, putting myself in the shoes of a young American who doesn't know much about the countries listed, I would probably guess that, since the question is being asked, there must be something to criticize (remembering that American teenagers would probably be steeped in our country's rhetoric, so in their heads "freedom=good; any other system than ours=bad"). The students who answered this way don't necessarily believe that Canada is a dictatorship, they just don't know. Their answers say more about the critical nature of our socialization and communication, as opposed to their actual views of Canada (or Austria or France, as the question referred to all of them). That said, I do think the answers speak to the lack of education we (Americans) get throughout school in regards to world history/world affairs???an issue that the article skims in favor of "Americans are willfully ignorant".","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"probs_wrong","name":"t1_crhk9kw","parent_id":"t3_36vj9e","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1432316871,"created_utc":1432313271}

But it was always kind of implied that our system was the best one and only one that really worked. In actuality, it's the oldest functioning government and many nations are thriving under very different governments than ours. Perhaps if more people were taught that as a child, we may have a more progressive government.			I don't want to imply that our government is terrible. I just think that there is a lot of room for improvement. And way too many people blindly follow "what this country was founded on" makes this the greatest country in the world.
