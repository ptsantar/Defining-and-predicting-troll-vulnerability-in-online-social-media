{"body":"You know what, the way I wrote this was very wrong.  I accept that.  I was wrong to react the way I did and to focus on an out-of-context quote that was inserted by the article rather than the judges.		I fully understand the desire to tighten up the wording of the law.  Poor legislation should be changed.  I completely agree with that.  But I still think the decision was bad, and here's why.		It seems quite clear to me that his behaviour would have fallen under the law even if it were well written. He was taking surreptitious photographs of children in swimsuits with the intent to sexually gratify himself.  Stopping that sort of thing was exacly the point of this law.  But his appeal was upheld due to the concern that *maybe* somebody else doing something different could have been interpreted as falling under the law.		I think that's a bad decision because judges have the power to make distinctions about things like this under case law.  They are not slaves to literal interpretations of legislation, and they are well aware of this.  Under US law, they are given the scope to state the reasons for their decisions, and to advise future judges on how to handle similar cases.		In this case, the judges had the ability to uphold Thompson's conviction while simultaneously outlining that the the law should not apply to general photography and also commenting that the wording of the law should be changed.		They let a convicted criminal walk free because of a *hypothetical* possibility involving an innocent person, despite having the tools at their disposal to go a long way towards preventing that happening.  I think they made a mistake in this case.		~~>Criticising an anti-???creepshot??? law as a ???paternalistic??? intrusion on a person???s right to be aroused...~~		~~What in the actual fuck, Texas?~~		~~I can certainly understand wanting to tighten the wording of the law so as to protect people appearing in general photography.

Their problem with this law is that it makes no clear distinction between invasive photography and public photography.

So while taking actual upskirt pictures are a violation of someone's privacy, taking normal pictures of someone in public (which is what the defendant was doing) is fine.

I agree that it's irrelevant whether or not Thompson would be aroused by looking at the pictures.  I never argued otherwise.  My position is that the photos of children in swimsuits ???with most of the photographs targeting the children???s breast and buttocks areas??? are not normal pictures of someone in public.  They are no different to upskirt photos in terms of being an 'intolerable invasion of privacy' (as the judges put it).  Having those sorts of photos taken of our children is not something that we tacitly consent to merely by being in public with them.
