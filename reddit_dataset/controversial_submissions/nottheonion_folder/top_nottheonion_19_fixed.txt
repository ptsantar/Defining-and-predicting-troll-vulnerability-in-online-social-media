The kind of disparity we're talking about would be something like this.  If we imagine people trapped on an island with limited resources, then those resources are divided up like this:  one rich guy who is 1/43,750,000 of the total population gets a little better than half of the total resources.  If you had 1000 coconuts available to eat, that one guy gets 501 coconuts to himself (much more than he can eat or even justify getting for himself) while the other FORTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE have to share 499 coconuts amongst themselves.  That means each of the remaining individuals gets a microscopic fleck of coconut, which is not even big enough to see let alone enough to eat.		But still you see no problem with it.

Socialist revolution, the general population rising up against the oligarchs, demanding them to step down and redistribute their wealth properly so that the means of production are in the hands of those actually doing the production (e.g. [common ownership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership)), meaning that those actually doing the work are the ones who gain the profits generated through that work, establishing a proper welfare state, strengthening labour laws, high and highly progressive taxation in accordance to what's needed to steadily increase the standard of living for all citizens, providing a basic income to all citizens, etc.   		You know, all that kind of crap.

Nope. They were always violently suppressed. The examples of countries usually cited as "communist" such as Maoist China or the USSR are cited as part of anti-Communist propaganda. No other way to put this. They were as "communist" as North Korea is "democratic. These countries called themselves communist and they implemented certain socialist ideas because socialism and communism are pretty cool ideas that anyone would agree with... which means that if you called yourself a communist in the past, people gave you their support. It was such a great idea that they started fighting for you. And some assholes abused that blind support to get what they want. 		In the history of humanity, no country ever implemented any sustainable form of Marxism. People like Mao and Stalin all violated basic principles of communist socioeconomic development. The "Great Leap Forward" is called the great leap for a reason. It was such a great leap because it violated several necessary stages of socioeconomic development outlined by Marx. Mao wanted to skip those. And he did. And millions of people died. Marx would have never supported Mao's politics. The same way he would have never supported Stalinist politics. It's ridiculous that so many people pretend they are a representation of Marxism/Communism.

{"body":"Well, in the most simplified terms possible, just look at what I already linked to:   	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx's_theory_of_history		Marx tried to establish a natural progression of history. This is basically an outline of how countries naturally develop. Not only theoretically but practically. And, in Marxist economic theory, not only under certain circumstances but *necessarily*.		With the Great Leap Forward Mao tried catapulting his country from a de facto feudalist agrarian society to a socialist industrialized one. 		Mao tried to *skip capitalism*.		That's in direct contradiction to natural socioeconomic progression under Marxist doctrine. Marx recognized capitalism as a necessary evil that promotes stable and rapid growth until that growth becomes unsustainable leading to a progressive escalation of socioeconomic inequality, culminating in a revolutionary progression into socialism.		That's why modern China is so much more Marxist/Communist than Maoist China. Modern China embraces capitalism (in the form of state capitalism) while promoting socialism (e.g. Socialism with Chinese Characteristics) while endorsing Marxism (i.e. the state doctrine upheld by the Chinese Communist Party).		And this is exactly what should be done.		By the way: You should try and get away from the false assumption that the decision between capitalism and socialism and communism is an "either/or"-question. It isn't. Capitalism *naturally* leads to socialism which ultimately leads to communism. Even the US will ultimately develop into a socialist state and at some point in the future progress into a communist one (except it destroys itself before that happens). 		The only difference is whether you embrace and support the development (in which case you can speed up the process) or reject and fight against that development (in which case your society will drift deeper and deeper into inequality until its collapse or violent socialist revolution).		Case in point: American ideologues chose to aggressively fight communism. That's why - despite its level of development - it is still a staunchly right-wing conservative and highly religious country. The US went to great lengths to eradicate communist economics in their country, including the murder and imprisonment of every communist they could find. They promote capitalism at all costs and don't care about it being unsustainable. It should have started making socialist progress a long time ago, but people were indoctrinated into fearing and hating everything related to communism and the US found away to sustain its completely unsustainable capitalist systems a bit longer: At the cost of others. 		However, as a consequence of these policies, you see severe problems arising. The US is the developed nation with the least amount of social mobility and it ranks at the bottom of the list of countries when it comes to socioeconomic equality. The only thing that keeps American society from collapsing is that Americans are apathetic and complacent. They still see themselves as the winners. They look at the citizens of other countries, see that those people are worse off than them, so they are happy about their situation, regardless how exploited they actually are. As long as the leaders of the US keep the rest of the world weaker than them, they will be fine with it, but eventually the US won't be able to do that any longer in which case you will see the poor rising up against the rich. Violently. And I'm pretty sure that will happen in my lifetime if the leaders of the US don't start embracing more socialist politics.		>Also, how do you pair this with the fact that if all wealth were equally distributed(which would be impossible given how supply & demand works, but for the sake of debate provided the exchange rate of whatever asset is frozen in time) we would all be only marginally enriched?

What money does is let you remove obstacles that would prevent you from being happy. The very poor people who are very happy have exactly as much money as they need to be happy, but for others since we all have different wants and needs, some need more money to achieve the same amount of happiness.		You are also correct, your standard of living would be quantitatively higher than the fisher in Mexico, but he will have more wealth than you. But if you had no debt like the fisher, then you would be considerably more wealth than him. Which in and of itself isn't bad, but when you have people who have negative $200k because they had to keep taking loan after loan just to keep a roof over their kids head and food on their table or families that have to make a decision between feeding themselves or having a home to live in. It shows that there is a very large problem that money takes a part in.

Every single small item takes hours to produce, which means you just can't afford more than you desperately need. You need large mutlinational companies to mass produce goods at their cheapest level. While some cooperatives do this, generally this is done by one driving individual, and this person, who sets up a really effective wealth creation system, benefits massively from the business.

Most people just think theres a pre existing pot of wealth and its being unfairly distributed. It's not the case. These billionaires mainly organise massive wealth producing systems.

Third world poverty is down to lack of industrialization, poor organisation, local corruption and political oppression.

This argument is predicated on the idea that generating more wealth in such a fashion is beneficial to a majority of people.

Why do you presuppose the alternative is to place power in the hands of "kings or elected officials"? The wealth you are referring to is based largely on the wild speculation of markets, designed to bet on increasingly ethereal market activity. The wealth we want comes in the form of food, clothing, shelter, and potable water. This wealth is best served by divesting it of markets *and* the influence of politicians, who of course are merely mouthpieces for the same corporate interests which operate in global markets.		>Wealth inequality between the investor class and everyone else isn't a bad thing.		Hmm, well, a majority of humans on earth disagree with you. Let me explain to you why it is bad. The "investor class", as you put, are *uneducated* and *unqualified* to invest. They do no understand what wealth is. Accumulating currency, and long and short term investments which represent future currency, improves the lives of ZERO people not directly profiting from those investments. Oh, wait, I forgot someone has to fuel up the yacht 'copter. Well, aside from that guy...What it is doing, is concentrating wealth that can then no longer be used in exchange for *real* wealth people need access to. That wealth comes in the form of healthcare, education, and a functioning infrastrucutre, all things which the "investor class" has no interest in maintaining, or ability to comprehend the value of. They are the blind leading the blind through a serious is laughably silly games they think are somehow clever and "wealth generating".

People who fit that profile lose their wealth.  In case of massively wealthy inheritors, it may take a few generations. But it will disappear.

Save for a handful of notable exceptions, capitalism has been very unkind to family dynasties relative to every other economy in the rest of human history.		> The reason the poverty and inequality exist is because of the "investor class".		There has been more progress in the last 50 years of worldwide adoption of capitalism than in the previous 10,000 years.

{"body":">No. Your mental concept of this class doesn't match reality.		Have you seen films and pop culture in the past 30+ years? The debauchery of the "masters of the universe" is so ubiquitous as to be fodder for shit you watch while munching pop corn, let alone tell-all books and constant scandals from Berlusconi to sub prime loans in the news cycle. You're just incredibly naive if you aren't aware of this.		>People who fit that profile lose their wealth.		You misunderstand. I didn't say uneducated with no qualifiers, I said uneducated in matters outside of finance, and thus, uneducated in any practical or useful sense. You seem to harbor a very naive fantasy about smart investors having earned their money fairly, through informed, careful decision making. This is not how multinational corporations, governments, banks, and markets operate. Success on this scale comes from unfairly, and until recently illegally influencing government to enact or repeal legislation such that unethical or otherwise far too dangerous to be allowed activities may transpire. This is the world of high interest rates, payday loans, sub prime loans, and the like. This is entropy and failure on the highest level.		>There has been more progress in the last 50 years of worldwide adoption of capitalism than in the previous 10,000 years. China went from an 85% poverty rate to a 33% poverty rate in 30 years after becoming capitalist. That amounts to a few more than the zero people who you say their lives improved because of capitalism.		Certainly you're not going to imply that capitalism invented the infrastructure we enjoy today. That would be an outlandish distortion of reality. 		Science produced those advancements, and it would produce many more were it not for the *confines* of capitalism and the machinations of the power hungry. Those improvements you refer to were *allowed to occur* be the wealthy and powerful, for their own personal gains. Many technological advancements occur because scientists are able to get funding for weapons research. *This does not mean we need weapons or war to justify research*. That's just capitalism's indirect, extremely inefficient, violent, stupid way of allowing some scientific progress as a *bi-product* of its function. It was also necessary to crate a consumer base for cheap consumer goods after WWII, thus a temporary middle class. Again, a bi-product of their activity, not their goal or interest.		>I'm all for universal government provided necessities of food, shelter, sewage, health care and education.

No, you're not. You're all for a system which forces wealth inequality upon us. The third world is the product of global corporate hegemony. Consumer culture requires large swaths of uneducated customers and laborers. Countries are destabilized for these purposes. 		Why are there villages in Africa who's wells have been appropriated by corporations such that they must now pay hugely inflated prices for water that was once free? Why were pharmaceutical companies allowed to sell infected medication to the third world? Why is predatory lending allowed? Why is the defunding of public schools allowed? Why are payday loans allowed? Why is flouridated water necessary? And so on, and so on, and so on...		The free markets you are advocating for represent a fundamentally entropic system. It is neither designed for, nor capable of managing infrastructure. To assert otherwise is to deny science, reason, and a history of mass chaos and death created for the purpose of lining the pockets of a small minority.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"notmathrock","name":"t1_cnwh3vu","parent_id":"t1_cnwep1l","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421875184,"created_utc":1421875184}

I feel your sentiment, but I think it needs fleshing out. 		Firstly, ask yourself this: At what point should someone "spend it on something other than yourself"? 		As an example, you are $17K in debt - so at what point from there to above $0 do YOU personally bear the responsibility to "spend it on something other than yourself"? Is it after you own a house? After you have paid for your retirement? If you have a net wealth of $X?		Secondly, what does "spend it on something other than yourself" even mean? Larry Page and Bill Gates employ Thousands DIRECTLY, and INdirectly help employ millions (every Microsoft and Google employee buys SOMETHING, pays taxes etc with that cash). Look at Detroit after the car makers stopped being so relevant.		Some specific questions: Is investment "spend(ing) it on something other than yourself"? If not, what is an investment in something that LOSES money, but might have humanitarian benefits (think drug research for a clear example, Space X or Tesla for a more obtuse example), if not very precisely "spend(ing) it on something other than yourself"? What about investments in towns where there is poverty? I hope you can see how what defines "other than yourself" gets tricky.		Now for the REAL kicker. While these are the two very broad problems - what wealth is required, and what does the requirement being fulfilled look like - it is made worse by the all important third: will spending have any effect? This is the part that dictates everything else, because there are people starving, and dying, that we just can't help, no matter how much we try, for a whole raft of reasons (political instability, their societal setup 	hunters and gatherers still exist, and some societies don't really use $$	, wars etc) and the idea that $1 is better spent on some humanitarian cause is often misguided at best, and creating of bad incentives at worst.

I want this to really sink in to anyone who has *ever* **taken any loan in excess of $1,000 that was not backed by a tangible asset, congratulations, you are $1,000 poorer than the people National Geographic shows balancing water on their heads to drink for the day**. This fucking stat just totally glosses over "oh hey, the bottom 25% of Americans average out to -$10,000 in "total" wealth each." Hell, I would think that if you changed "world" to "America", the 50% figure would actually go *up*, which for the world's strongest economy, is really, really dumb.		I ***love*** that they even fucking acknowledge this and then are just like... meh...		>Critics have attacked Oxfam???s methodology. The charity uses data on net wealth???assets minus debts. Whether a deeply indebted American homeowner is poorer than a destitute African farmer is indeed a leap. Another charge is that adding up the wealth of the poorest people doesn???t make sense in the first place, because poor people are poor in different ways (few assets or debts) than rich people are rich (lots of assets and debts). Oxfam has defended the assumptions behind its ???killer fact,??? including how it???s much easier it is to count the wealth of the super-rich???there are only a handful of billionaires, after all, which is also Oxfam???s point		Please note that the only counter-argument they provide is entirely nonsensical, which is hardly what you would expect from any self-respecting writer		As for the falling number of Billionaires it takes to equal whatever fucking number they pick, note that the combined sum of their wealth is inconsequential to even the GDP for one year of the USA alone. That is a terrible metric, it is entirely a result of the majority of them quickly gaining money within the past twenty years, and you now how have their wealth increasing exponentially because that's what people smart enough to amass 60 Billion dollars do with 60 Billion dollars, thus, they gain something like 7-8% yearly while the negative figures also have 7-8% interest *owed*, thus obviously pushing the two further apart. If someone in the bottom 50% manages to get their head above water, another underwater homeowner takes their place. The Top 80 stay as they are		**None of this is to say that rising income inequality is not an issue**		All I am saying is that this bullshit statistic is completely counterproductive to anything that can actually effect change. These super-rich people are not the enemies here, hell Bill Gates basically wiped out Polio. The problem is entirely within the governments and pointing peoples rage towards this bullshit directs attention away from intelligent issues with fucking one-liners they can spout off in whatever they consider a discussion. 		>you ... need 80 of them ... to equal everything owned by the poorest 50% of the rest of the world combined. Back in 2010, you???d have needed 388		And in 2018 you will need ~40, then in 2021 maybe it will be the top three. In 2023, Bill Gates alone. Then, in 2025 guess what happens, a newborn baby will be worth more than 50% of the world combined. Then, sometime before 2030 we get the really fucked up paradox that *literally* every single person on earth will be worth more than 50% of the world combined. Why? Because this is a fucking bullshit, sensationalized one liner.			____		**Did some math, heres a really, really, really fucking funny joke**		So, the way this worked is [according to bbc](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26613682) they just magic'd up a figure that is "the sum of the wealth of the bottom 50%" combined. That figure ended up being, again according to BBC, $1.7 Trillion. This number is really important, because they just started adding up Billionaires until they got to the same $1.7 figure, thats how this worked. Here is where it gets funny. We don't even have to leave the united states before we can *entirely* offset the positive wealth owned by these 80. We have the sum of Student loans which is $1.2T. Yes, the sum of **American** student debt alone puts as at -1.2T, then we subtract, just for shits and giggles, the sum of the total **Underwater** debt owed by again, American's only (this figure represents $2.2T in Debt owed on Homes mitigated by the $1.5T value of the homes) to get $.77T		**TL;DR**If we add these two figures up, we now have "Wealth" of +1.7T for the top 80 AND another -$1.9T just from wha t ends up being the very bottom 1% of the world. The important thing is that the positive wealth of the 80 will offset an insignificant portion of the negative wealth of the bottom 10%, the we just add the 30% of the world that has ~$0 wealth, then from there we just keep adding until we hit the original 1.7 figure			_____","depth":3,"score":53,"ups":53,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tury345","name":"t1_cnw8hqe","parent_id":"t1_cnw6drw","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421862129,"created_utc":1421862129}

{"body":"That's more specific than what the title said, but the title isn't wrong-- the poorest 50% of humanity *is still* 50% of humanity. In fact, your specification is kind of pointless, because of course it's implicit that it's the poorest 50%. To compare this way, you have to start from the bottom. It wouldn't mean anything to compare the top 80 people to the *next* 50% of humanity... Because if they had more wealth than the NEXT 50%, they'd have more than everyone below it as well... Anyway, I don't know why you point that out as if it justifies or explains such absurd disparity-- when 80 people have as much wealth as 3.5 BILLION, it doesn't matter whether the 3.5 billion are dirt poor or middle class-- the point is the extreme inequality of the situation. 		The fact that the bottom 50% of humankind is living in extreme poverty, struggling to live day-to-day while a few hundred possess almost all of the world's wealth should be a disturbing reminder that the actual outcomes of US-capitalism-in-action do not match the rhetoric about *prosperity* and *strong middle classes* at all. In reality, our global system is enriching and empowering an extremely exclusive elite (far beyond the wealth and power that any other ruling class in history has even dreamed of) at the expense of the vast majority, who are suffering in virtual slavery with almost no chance of upward mobility in their lifetime. 		And, as it so happens, the living standards of the majority are continuing to decline, throughout our world empire, and at home. In the US, we're actually witnessing the third-world-ization of the world's richest country. It's quite a historical development when the global hegemonic economic/military power (which has stolen the majority of the world's resources and wealth) is also basically the most unequal and widely-impoverished country in the developed world; we could easily feed and house every American-- even provide them with comfortable circumstances, education, etc.-- but the multi-billion dollar fortunes of a few super-powerful plutocrats take priority while children starve and homeless die from exposure). 		It's a pretty nightmarish legacy for which these 80 people (and maybe another .5% of the population) are primarily responsible. Not only is a society designed by the rich (what they call a "polyarchy," but what is most aptly described as a plutocracy or an oligarchy) fundamentally undemocratic and oppressive, but it's proving utterly unviable as well. It's ONE area of success is generating enormous fortunes for the few who control it, and that's nothing to be proud of when the social costs are as devastating and economically unsustainable as they are.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sex_Drugs_and_Cats","name":"t1_cnwgmxo","parent_id":"t1_cnw0fpc","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421874477,"created_utc":1421874477}

{"body":"I was providing an extremely basic analogy as to the principle of why you can't just throw money at a problem. There are even bigger reasons (and real world examples) of why redistribution of wealth doesn't work.		The problem is that Africa/poor places have nothing we want, or nothing that we want that we can't find easier elsewhere, or nothing we want that we aren't able to essentially take.		In the 10 shoes analogy, if you are the seller, would you sell 2 pairs each to 5 people who pay you $100 dollars a pair, or one pair each to people who can pay $10?		Remember, money is just an abstraction of "value", and the fact that these people have no "money" is nothing but a reflection that they aren't providing anything that anyone else wants.  You could give everyone in Somalia $1000 dollars, but after a messy economic shock, things would revert to the way that they already are because they would ship that money overseas and have no way of getting more. It would take a major structural change, where they would have educated professionals and physical infrastructure and proper resources for any long-term improvement to occur.

{"body":">Whereas, spending money expands the economy by transferring wealth to other people, I don't buy a chocolate and then get two chocolate bars back at a later date, spending money is different to investment on a fundamental level.		Let's think about how your chocolate bar driven economy would work without investment, to see how purchasing a chocolate bar will not grow the economy unless someone then invests the money you used to purchase the chocolate bar.		In this world, there is one chocolate bar factory that can produce 1,000 chocolate bars per day, which are then purchased by 1,000 people. In a weeks time, 1,100 people will want to buy chocolate bars every day. However, no matter how many people want to purchase chocolate bars, the chocolate bar output of the factory cannot increase by itself, and it does not increase just because people give the factory money.		To expand the factory, it requires investment; the funds to purchase the machines that would raise the production to 1,100 chocolate bars per day. Those funds can come from the factory owner or an external investor.		That is why investment grows the economy. Long-term economic growth just cannot happen without an increase in supply and investment increases supply. Increased demand can only bring economic growth until we reach the limits of what we can supply.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tophattingson","name":"t1_cnw7kup","parent_id":"t1_cnw77ll","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421860706,"created_utc":1421860706}

It absolutely does when the GOP keeps claiming that is the only successful business model to fix the economy. Which in principle would work but the investments are not going anywhere.		Using the chocolate factory, to keep the example, now that's a very successful business so rich people invest in it because they made it successful and are keeping it as such. But the Taco factory can be just as successful and so can the burger factory, but they are not being invested in, so they can't grow at the same time.		That's the problem the ultra rich are not investing their money in other places.

Because if Taco Factory and Burger Factory can get invested in they can grow faster. Sure Chocolate factory won't grow as fast, but spreading the money to more investments can lead to the sum being greater than the parts.		That's part of the problem, the general public doesn't have enough money to make the investments count as much as the ultra rich can.		Though the other problem is that businesses fail because of one reason, no one buys their shit. And many times its because either the product was crap or people didn't have enough money to buy it. I know I personally would buy more stuff, more than just necessities, if I had more money as I am sure you would as well. But for us we don't make money as fast as the ultra rich so we can't influence the economy as quickly by ourselves.		A solution is we need more money in the hands of the general consumer, which is a result of higher wages, and we need the ultra rich to invest in other companies to give them an incentive to give higher wages. Otherwise the higher wages come with people losing their jobs and that results in no real net gain.

I'm not even talking about it's real world implementations here; from a purely theoretical standpoint it is inferior too. Communism was developed as a solution to problems in a model that inaccurately modelled how the world worked. 		Example of a problem that was considered to exist in Marx's time which had communism as a solution: The tendency of the rate of profit to fall. This was of massive importance to communism, as it suggested that capitalism would inevitably break down at some point in the future because mean profit margin would hit and then go below 0%. 		This prediction was, however, incorrect. Marxism loses an important justification for implementation. This scenario repeats itself all over communism and it's not something that a few tweaks can fix. The mid-1800s had a lot less evidence and past thought to work with than today, and just about nothing developed during that time or prior is known to be entirely accurate today.		So... back to the drawing board. Do you have any idea for a replacement of capitalism that would function better than capitalism. Here are a few guidelines to narrow your search range:		1. Economies with markets tend to do better than those without markets		2. You cannot, in the long term, make workers wealthier by taxing capital and redistributing it to labour (Chamley-Judd Redistribution Impossibility Theorem)		I suppose the closest thing that is within the realm of being a feasible replacement is Market Socialism. It has had some success in practice within capitalist nations in the form of various worker-owned businesses, but the fact that it hasn't been able to out-compete other businesses suggests that it still isn't going to be an improvement, just a close equivalent at best.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Tophattingson","name":"t1_cnwdlui","parent_id":"t1_cnwaaap","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421869965,"created_utc":1421869965}

Statements like this indicate you don't even understand the first thing about how trade works. Value is subjective and since trade is voluntary in a market economy, people will only agree to a trade if they BOTH get something out of it.		Example for shops. To a shop, a CD is valued at 5 arbitrary units while $10 is valued at 6 arbitrary units. To a music fan, a CD is valued at 10 arbitrary units while $10 is valued at 6 arbitrary units. If the shop sells 1 CD to a music fan for $10, the shop gains 1 arbitrary unit and the music fan gains 4, so both benefit.		>People who are indoctrinated into a capitalist mindset		Actually bringing out the idea of "False Consciousness"?

Of course, not everyone shares the idea that the poor need more help than the wealthy and that everyone should pay the same share.
