{"body":"It may be scripted, but who would put themselves in this vulnerable of a situation nowadays.  Most actors or celebrities take easy success and stand as symbols for easy strength.  In the face of what though?  Making yourself vulnerable is symbolically meaningful.  And perhaps he is not being truthful, but if he is, hes got some serious strength. 	I see it as his way of compensation for being a shill at one time.  I think a lot of people need help who don't let people see them vulnerable, or who sweep their needs under the carpet so that everyone else can live their "important" lives doing the most banal, unthoughtful, or self important shit.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chodaboy808","name":"t1_cmfhhm8","parent_id":"t3_2nnpc7","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1417203112,"created_utc":1417203112}
