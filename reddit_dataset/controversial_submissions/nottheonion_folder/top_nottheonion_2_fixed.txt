It has zero relevance and had nothing to do with Jack White's complaint at all. The writer of the article totally made that part up on his own.

{"body":"From Roth's autobiography:		Van Halen was the first band to take huge productions into tertiary, third-level markets. We'd pull up with nine eighteen-wheeler trucks, full of gear, where the standard was three trucks, max. And there were many, many technical errors ??? whether it was the girders couldn't support the weight, or the flooring would sink in, or the doors weren't big enough to move the gear through.		The contract rider read like a version of the Chinese Yellow Pages because there was so much equipment, and so many human beings to make it function. So just as a little test, in the technical aspect of the rider, it would say "Article 148: There will be fifteen amperage voltage sockets at twenty-foot spaces, evenly, providing nineteen amperes ..." This kind of thing. And article number 126, in the middle of nowhere, was: "There will be no brown M&M's in the backstage area, upon pain of forfeiture of the show, with full compensation."		So, when I would walk backstage, if I saw a brown M&M in that bowl ... well, line-check the entire production. Guaranteed you're going to arrive at a technical error. They didn't read the contract.

Printing private contract details is very different than printing an account of a public performance. Journalists who print negative reviews still get media comps from artists at the next tour stop while journalists who print private details get to buy their own tickets in the future. If you want "access" to big name artists you respect their personal privacy, otherwise that artist will simply choose to speak to somebody who does. That's exactly what's happened here.		> If they didn't calculate the risk of this happening beforehand, that's really their own fault.		You're completely correct, and Jack White agrees. He thought he could do a kind thing without being insulted publicly but didn't realize kindness has such a risk. That's why his booking agent is working to ensure that this high-risk scenario doesn't happen again, and also why we're talking in this thread right now. This risk has been identified and laid bare, so now big name acts will be very hesitant to continue offering lower rates to public institutions.		> If you stop treating the school paper as part of the school and treat it like those in the **Journalism departement** tend to, as part of the legitimate press, you'll get a better idea of the dynamics here.		The journalism department, a part of the school, has a mandate to create a mock professional atmosphere. Of course they are preparing their own children for adulthood. 		Before you get indignant, how many foreign correspondents does this paper have? On average, how many weekly out of city events are covered by "journalists" from this paper? Or are they students doing this part time for less money than real papers because they are students?		I have no doubt that many students will become professionals, but by pure definition, a student in a field is not a professional in a field. But of course all of this is way off topic.... Jack White was insulted and thus no longer engages with those who insulted him. It's quite simple.		EDIT: I re-read your post and it seems you're trying the "different department" schtick.

{"body":"If you honestly believe that these students decided to go look up White's contract, publish all the "interesting bits"(their words, they wrote a follow up) including the financial dealings because they wanted to inform the student population on how their money was being spent that's fine. I can't prove your wrong, or that I'm right.. But I do disagree. I tried to find some more articles regarding how student tuition money was being spend, and came up dry. Their explanation sounds nice, and you can't really disprove it I suppose, but I'll just share my opinion of what happened. 		Some of the guys that work for the paper went and got a copy of the contract, which is all good. They have every legal right to check it out and Jack White is a huge artist so writing a piece on his show makes sense. They read the contract and took out all the "interesting bits"(their words) and decided "hey I bet people would find all these crazy details pretty interesting, let's just publish it all." Now, I'm sure they didn't have any bad intentions, it is free information after all.. Anyone can find it anyway.. 		So it gets published and Jack White made the comment during the show "Just because you can doesn't mean you should", which is perfectly reasonable to me. The paper doesn't have a history of reporting on any other financial stories and while it is free information, publishing people's  contracts just isn't a decent thing to do.. It's not even like it was details from the contract used to support a broader story... They just published the documents they found interesting. Other media outlets start to pick up the story, because why? Because some college newspaper published Jack White's contract in their paper and White told them it was a shitty thing to do. From there it's just spiraled out of control in the classic "24hr news cycle needs conflict and conflict sells" kind of way. Jack White still played a full set, and has said that there is no "blacklist" and that he wasn't furious or anything, just that he thought it wasn't a cool thing to do.. 		The paper realizes that "hey, shouldn't have done that". The egg is on their face now. Instead of just letting it go, the paper shoots back with the whole "freedom of press" and "it's our money being spent" shit. Bullshit. It's the easy way out. No one can make an argument against that, but that's not what the issue is. No one said they didn't have the right to publish the contract. No one said they weren't allowed to inform students how their money was being spent. There issue is there was no story except "look at this", until they got called out. It was lazy journalism and it wasn't appropriate(by that I mean, if you have any fucking manners you know that discussing other people's money is not appropriate).  No it wasn't illegal, or against any written rules.. But there's a reason you don't see people's contracts published in newspapers every day. Sure they could just put a copy of em on the front page, it's public info... It's just something that has no reason to be published. If your pay stubs were public documents, would you want them copied and pasted on the front of a newspaper ? Yeah people could look for it themselves, but there's no reason for it to be shared with the world for the sake of being shared with the world. 		Tl;dr: All in all, it's just rude. And it's all being overblown, no one said that they didn't have the right to publish it.. White just had an opinion on his contract being copy/pasted onto a newspaper, and it's not that unreasonable to say what the paper did was kinda douchey","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IamTheUniverse_AMA","name":"t1_coduo63","parent_id":"t1_codr8by","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423286582,"created_utc":1423286582}

The idea you keep bringing up that anyone who wished could go and find the information, and it's rude and irrelevant for the newspaper to publish it makes no sense.

{"body":"I think this is one we will just have to agree to disagree on. I understand what you're saying and I see where you're coming from. I'm not a student there, so I don't know whether the way the school spends money is a big deal with the students or not. And I fully support the students being informed on how their money is spent and the the paper's responsibility to keep it's readers informed. My gripe, and I speculate White's as well, is that the information could have been presented a bit more professionally. I read the newspaper to be able to get a quick synopsis and clear presentation of the facts, arguments for and against of the topic at hand. I can copy and paste some pictures of a contract or any document onto a paper and put *written by: TheUniverse* at the bottom, but that isn't journalism and it's definitely not informative. Had it been an article written about the university's spending, using information from the contract that could be fact checked if I felt I wanted to read more into it. Along with some info regarding the potential income that could be generated by the show, and  whether or not the school had the money to spend would have been a much more respectable way to get the information out. I mean who knows, $80,000 could be chump change to them.. or they may have a separate budget set aside for special student events like this that is kept completely separate from any academic or athletic money. It wouldn't have grabbed the headlines like it has, but what they published wasn't informative at all.. And crying "freedom of info" and "students have a right to know" aren't valid arguments to defend a story with nearly zero information and failing to let the students know how this may or may not impact them or their education from a monetary standpoint.

Thats a big no no.  The contract was public record but in my mind that was not okay.  #2 I think the article was meant to be light hearted and funny poking fun at some of the silly requests in the contract but came off as rude. That being said, I think White's response was childish and just as rude.  Basically calling for the students to mob the Newspaper which is made up of their peers.  He also called out OU on several other things like the smoking ban.  Being a rockstar, im not surprised he came off as an entitled prick.  IMHO White should have brushed it off and let the entertainment company handle the privacy breach. To add fuel to the fire, the Daily also snuck photographs and wrote a pretty nasty review of the concert to wrap it up.

{"body":"There are several reasons why White is totally justified in his outrage and in his rider clauses.		For starters, leaking the contract and rider makes public knowledge his asking price for the show. According to [this post by /u/theygotsquid,](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/2v0oye/jack_white_bans_future_performances_at_university/codhk5) the asking price is quite low for a musician of his status. This leak makes it very hard for him to ask for a more appropriate value in the future, leaving not just him underpaid, but his entire crew as well.		Additionally, the "crazy things" in his rider are overwhelmingly likely to be in the same vain as Van Halen's "no Brown M&Me" clause, [explained here.](http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp) The tldr is that putting in an insane clause in the rider like no bananas or fresh made guacamole or no Brown M&Ms allows musicians to quickly and easily verify that the venue was diligent in adhering to the rider. If Jack White does find bananas in the building, that means he *immediately* knows that they either were not thorough in sticking to the rider, or did not take it seriously. Regardless, this means that Jack White has good reason to believe that other clauses - which can affect the quality of the show, the security of the equipment, or the safety of the musicians and crew - were also not followed.		All Jack White has to do is take a bite of guacamole and keep an eye out for bananas, and he'll know that everything should go according to plan.","depth":1,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mfranko88","name":"t1_codkknp","parent_id":"t1_codirg1","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1423264654,"created_utc":1423264654}
