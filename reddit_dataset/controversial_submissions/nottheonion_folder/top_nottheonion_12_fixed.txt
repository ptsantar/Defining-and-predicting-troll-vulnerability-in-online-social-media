I didn't intend it to be political, but apparently, people are reacting as if it were.  There's a reason why I posted to /r/nottheonion, rather than /r/politics.  		All that said, to me, the joke was obvious.  If Etsy wants to grandstand about anything that could be even potentially offensive, it's inconsistent to simultaneously allow swastika material on their website*.  You're pointing out that Etsy's swastikas are the "non-offensive" kind because they aren't Nazi-related.  I'd agree, but I'd counter that a Redskins bag with a football crocheted on it is also the "non-offensive" usage of the term.  I have "non-offensive" in quotes because the "to who?" question matters.  Reasonable people can disagree on whether the Redskins logos are offensive today, just like reasonable people can disagree on swastikas today.  Historical context matters in both situations, and to me, Etsy's stance considers that context for swastikas (some are non-offensive and okay, while others were apparently removed), but does not consider it for the Redskins (always offensive regardless of context, and furthermore so offensive that it deserves a site-wide ban).  The absurdity of that line of reasoning made me laugh, which is why I posted it here.		*As an aside, there's a difference between banning specific products (a data flagging / moderation process that is challenging to implement when millions of products are sold on the website) and taking a passionate stance disallowing said items.

Then you'd be an idiot.  The Redskins logo is something specific.  It's not an ancient cultural and religious symbol that was co-opted.		Now, if you want to talk about, say, crocheting a generic Native American-looking head on a bag, I say go for it.

Because while they aren't "equal", they are without a doubt similar, and applying logic to similar things is something that's done a lot in the world to figure out philosophical dilemmas.		To say that they "aren't really similar" is ridiculous.  They're both symbols with a mostly benign history, later adopted by bad people to use as they wished, but eventually used in benign ways to this day.  That's "similar" even if it's not equal.

It's also should be considered, that for Nazis it's was also "oldest symbols known to man, to Scandinavian and Germanic tribes", because Nazis as any nationalist like to make cult out of their ancestry. 		So, in my opinion, use of "The swastika is one of the oldest symbols known to man" argument, in every case swastika mentioned - is wrong, because you need to investigate each case specifically, before saying that this is really have nothing do to with Nazis or racism.

{"body":"I think that it still holds great religious significance to many and swastikas being interpreted as hateful has more to do with ignorance than anything else. Therefore, due to the religious weight it still holds, and the fact that most interpretation of the symbol being hateful is borne of ignorance, there is no reason for Etsy to ban swastikas on their own, like if they are not tilted the way a Nazi swastika is. In fact, I think it would be worse if they were banned. Also, I don't know about the US or anywhere else, but where I live, you can still find temples and signs with the regular non-tilted swastika, and nobody makes a big deal about it, because they recognise that the two swastikas are different. Obviously Etsy should ban Nazi symbols and such, but majority of the items there aren't of that sort, and if the article wanted to imply that it was unfair for Etsy to ban redskins-oriented items, then they should have compared it to them continuing to allow Nazi symbols, not swastikas.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"glublublub","name":"t1_ckg7dqg","parent_id":"t1_ckg73zz","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1410527317,"created_utc":1410523717}
