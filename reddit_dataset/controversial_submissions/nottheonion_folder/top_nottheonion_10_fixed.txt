{"body":"Sorry, but this article is 100% bullshit. It's not even misinformed--it's deliberately misleading, although I can't tell if this hack is pushing her own agenda or just riding along with this Baltzell guy. Let's break down a couple of claims:		>classical art as well as other curriculum staples will be effectively banned		Meanwhile, the actual bill says:		>it shall be an affirmative defense to any prosecution under this section that . . .  (3) an exhibition in a state of nudity is for a bona fide scientific or medical purpose, or for an educational or cultural purpose for a bona fide school, museum or library. . . 		Article says:		>Oddly, there's a whole section of the bill that seems to be dedicated to 50 Shades of Grey, or, as the bill's language puts it, "flagellation or torture by or upon a person clad in undergarments, in a mask or bizarre costume or in the condition of being fettered, bound, or otherwise physically restrained on the part of one so clothed." 		Uh, this is from the *original*, old bill, not the amendment currently up. Hur durr, learn to read marked-up docs, Mrs. Professional Journalist and Mr. Communications Director. The author has also omitted that it's a statutory definition of sadomasochism. It's pretty standard-looking and was almost certainly lifted from some other legislation. 		This is nothing special, or anything to get excited about--if laws don't define important terms carefully, it leads to confusion, and usually injustice. Even better, these guys know it--the article quotes Baltzell complaining about a missing definition (which isn't missing--more below).		>He also says teachers could be liable if a kid picks a "harmful" book up herself as part of an independent reading assignment. 		This is entirely fictional. Nothing in the law covers this in any way. The closest thing is a provision that if the teacher--while currently in custody of the student--allows them to view harmful material with no educational or scientific purpose. So, yeah, if a kid fishes a Playboy off the teacher's desk, they could be prosecuted, but the scenario given is nonsense. Furthermore, the law specifically offers an affirmative defense to libraries checking out such materials to kids, and retailers are exempted normally.		Edit: In fact, as far as I can tell, this is *entirely* the scope of the amendment. If a primary or secondary schoolteacher *knowingly* allows a kid currently in their custody to view "harmful" material that is unrelated to their education, they can be prosecuted. Previously, they could not, but they could be fired. To me, it seems unnecessary but pretty harmless.		Article:		>Baltzell said . . .that the biggest problem about the bill is that the language is so broad. "And there's no definition of what is harmful. . . "		There are literally four paragraphs defining the phrase "harmful to minors". It's one of those wishy-washy "community standards" definitions, but it's exquisitely detailed.		>[Baltzell said] You may think Harry Potter is completely reasonable or the Teletubbies, but if one parent finds something objectionable, a teacher is vulnerable to criminal prosecution." 		This is not how criminal prosecution works. 		Edit 2: Wow, crazy--thanks for the gold, person who gave me gold!

{"body":"I know what a chilling effect is. So what? I can't see anything in this amendment that would cause such an issue. Now, if some damned fool teacher reads and believes this pack of nonsense, it may cause them concern, but that's not a fault of the legislation. 		It sounds like you're calling for a heckler's veto of sorts. Anyone can lie about any piece of legislation, then claim the law will have a chilling effect based on the lie. For example, did you know that H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, includes a section that requires minority students to endure an actual trial by fire before they can enroll in a publicly-funded university? We'd better nip that bill in the bud right now--whether or not it's true, this rumor could cause the law to have a chilling effect on minority enrollment. It's a bad law!		The point is that Vice is stirring up controversy over very little. Would I support this law? No--I have a problem with overcriminalization, largely because it gives prosecutors powers they should not have, such as the ability to effectively determine sentencing.

It is certainly true that a prosecutor could refuse to indict an individual because they believe an affirmative defense clearly took place (e.g. the individual obviously reacted out of self-defense) and the police officers also have discretion as well to enforce violations (e.g. a police officer deciding not to give a speeding ticket to the parent taking an injured child to the hospital), but those are not written or required by the legislation.		Think of it this way, the law could limit itself by, for example, saying, "This law shall not apply to materials offered by teachers in the course of classroom instruction."  At that point, a police officer and/or prosecutor who arrested the teacher would theoretically be liable for false imprisonment.  Under the current iteration of the law, the police officer and/or prosecutor could pursue the indictment to a full jury trial.

You mean, where you perfectly exonerated my claims that the majority of all welfare recipients are white and rural and just as conservative as not (you literally claimed, straight up, that welfare recipients feel like victims and "are not conservatives"). 		>The survey also finds that most Democrats (60%) and Republicans (52%) say they have benefited from a major entitlement program at some point in their lives.		You realize this means that democrats are more likely to admit to using a program, not more likely to use a program?		Republican stigma introduces answer bias, you should have realized that when you posted it.		>Please note I only addressed the black / white issue because YOU brought it up, I did not. And your ad hominem attack on me just makes you look ignorant.		So, when I accurately call you out, pointing out that the majority of all welfare recipients are white rural and almost assuredly republican, I'm ignorant?		And when you used racist code hints insinuating that welfare recipients are victims and are not conservative, you're not being ignorant?		It's not an ad hominem to accurately describe your incorrect preconceived notions about welfare recipients as stereotypically conservative (they are), ignorant (they were) and offensive (they were).		You had the audacity to assert: " I think there are many more welfare recipients who consider themselves victims. And they are certainly Not conservatives."		And when I called you out, you found the truth: Rural, white and mix of ideologies with republicans being underrepresented due to the same cultural shame you're peddling right now.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"elneuvabtg","name":"t1_cp6gxpw","parent_id":"t1_cp6gomd","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1425666367,"created_utc":1425666367}

Answer bias in polling along party line isn't exactly a conspiracy, rather it just implies you are ignorant about polling. 		I apologize if reality offends you so, but everyone is biased and conservatives are less likely to admit to welfare usage due to an ideologically founded shame that is derived from being supported by a progressive/liberal program.

This bill puts the burden of proof on the accused, not the accuser. So all that has to happen is one helicopter "my kids won't know what sex or gays are until one of them are inside them" parent gets huffy about a school putting on the Laramie Project, or talking about sex ed, or discussing gay rights, and boom, the teacher is in court fighting to not have a misdemeanor for doing their job. What school is going to allow the Laramie project in the first place now? What school is going to push for more inclusive teaching for homosexual students?

{"body":"Here's the thing about that, Brownback KNEW he would get "credit" for eliminating taxes for LLCs.  He also came out at the same time and said he wanted to give "more local 'control'" to school districts and the like. 		Local Control basically means he wants each individual school district and any other public entity to raise its own mill levies.  		An example, our School District recently passed a rate increase for our Local Option Budget from 30 to 31 percent, up to 33 percent for 1 year with school board approval.  ANOTHER mail ballot had to go out for that 33 percent to become permanent.  That passed, too, thankfully.  		In my district, which is fairly wealthy, people have high valuations that have kept going up for the last several years. This means that there is kind of a built in increase for the school district due to increased property valuation even thought the mill rate stays the same.  HOWEVER, in many areas of Kansas this is obviously not the case.  Districts that are poorer are going to lose a lot more money. Districts (like Blue Valley) that are rich and one mill generates a crap-ton of money keep their tax rates low.  		1 Blue Valley Mill = $50,000		1 Jetmore Mill = $6,000 		Guess what happens to the mill rate at Jetmore?  Their property taxes go through the roof, and they *still* don't raise as much for the school as a 1 mill increase at Blue Valley.  This is what "local control" looks like, because people can always choose not to pass a mill levy increase.  People can choose to have shitty schools, too.  If they don't want shitty schools, then they have the right to raise their own taxes. It is all a way to look like a tax-cutting hero, when you've actually shifted that tax burden onto the people who can't afford it and on to the folks who bought houses. It is all one giant mess.

{"body":">Basically the Bill of Rights amendments are ideally supposed to go to 10, and the rest are in the hands of states. SO theoretically, states could teach their students whatever the fuck they want as long as it doesn't infringe on the first 10 amendments. Ideally each state is in some way it's own country bound only to the Bill of Rights, but this of course has changed a lot over the years.		That's not really accurate, as far as an ideal goes or in the sense of your reading of the 10th - the latter part because you ignore the possibility of further amendments to the constitution as well as assign too much intent into the bill of rights, something some of the most influential members of the constitutional congress held in disdain. 		The former isn't accurate for a few reasons. First, in terms of general ideal, ignoring founder's intent, a large republic is actually theoretically more stable and better for the people than a small one. Second, though it's true the constitution was passed that way, it doesn't mean that the founders held it as their ideal. It was simply the best that was going to happen at the time. In many ways we're closer to an ideal now than we were then, though in others we are far from it. 		There were some people who felt that your stated ideal was the correct one, but that was disregarded with the failure of the articles of confederation and in early arguments at the constitutional convention. Sure, Jefferson and to a lesser extent Madison wrote in defense of State's rights later, but as someone that studied Madison extensively I can tell you that a literal reading of his contributions to the cause of state's rights is too shallow, and Jefferson was writing in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, which are generally held to have been unconstitutional and unconscionable. 		Honestly, I love this stuff, I studied it and wrote my thesis on the development of the constitution post-ratification so I'm a bit obsessed. I don't want to blow you out with a novel here though so I'll stop with that unless you want to keep discussing it.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"MajDPearson","name":"t1_cp5q0lw","parent_id":"t1_cp5l8iv","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1425599945,"created_utc":1425599945}

{"body":"Wow, there's a lot of misinformation ITT.  First, most of the text of this bill is found in existing state law,  K.S.A. 21-6402:  (http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2015_16/statute/021_000_0000_chapter/021_064_0000_article/021_064_0002_section/021_064_0002_k/)	SB 56 would amend only a few sections of K.S.A. 21-6402.  The bill's additions are appear in **bold**, and the bill's deletions appear in ~~strikethrough~~.  		The added or deleted sections are the ones to study, then, if one wants to evaluate SB 56's impact.  		Existing law applies to owners, controllers, or supervisors of commercial places.  SB 56 would make the existing law against displaying, distributing, or performing material that is harmful to minors applicable to owners, controllers, or supervisors of **public** establishments.  		SB 56 would also remove from existing law the affirmative defense available when a public, private, or parochial school purchased the allegedly harmful material. 		That's it--those are the proposed changes.  		So yes, it's fair to describe SB 56 as targeting elementary, middle, or high schools, since those are SB 56's only changes to existing law.  College professors would still enjoy the chance to prove the affirmative defense applies in their situation, but high school teachers could no longer avail themselves of that defense.  		FWIW, the section described as applying to "50 Shades of Grey" couldn't possibly be about "50 Shades of Grey" because that section would remain unchanged from the original law, which took effect in 2010--one year before 50 Shades was published.  		It's worth noting that having an affirmative defense written into the law is not the same as simply defining the crime to exclude the same conduct.  As a defendant, you'd face a burden to prove the affirmative defense, whereas the prosecution would take on the entire burden otherwise.   That's a big difference--one that seriously benefits the State at the expense of the defendant.  Additionally, it's cold comfort for the teacher who was just arrested and likely lost any reasonable hope of employment ever again that they *might* escape conviction based on an affirmative defense:  "Great.  But I'm still fired, right?" 	"Yep."		Someone else alluded to the chilling effect SB 56 could produce.  They're right to point out that effect, but I would go one further and say that the entire point of SB 56 is to convict teachers who violate this law.  Everyone else would already be covered by existing law.  Try to put yourself in a teacher's shoes; would you even *consider* discussing a subject that certain members of the community might consider "harmful to minors?"  Would you risk your entire teaching career on your best guess as to what some parent might find offensive, and therefore complain about to the police?

Also note that in many cases, the entire work will not be studied, but rather, selected passages.  Similarly, a carefully considered edition of a certain sex ed lecture might be designed in a way to protect the school from litigation.		Edit:  No, in no way am I a supporter of this bill.

{"body":"Kansan here--former teacher, now lawyer.		I read through most of the comments here, and one of the issues created by this bill appears to have slipped by most redditors.  		To be certain, there is a furor over the text and affect of the bill itself, and for good reason.  While the bill defines many things, it fails to adequately define "harmful to minors".  It goes to great lengths to define the *sexual* aspect, but doesn't include a limiting principle.  This is troubling from a teacher's perspective.  I knew better than to put *2 Girls 1 Cup* up on my smart board, and I do not believe that any teacher would be willing to provide the types of imagery that this bill describes.  		However, I don't know where the line is with regard to being *harmful*.  I taught English, so I'll use an example from that discipline.  With juniors, I spent a few weeks surveying American short stories; this included Hemingway's "Hills Like White Elephants".  **Now, if you haven't read it, READ IT.**  [SPOILER ALERT.](/s "It's about a man trying to convince a woman to get an abortion")  It is conceivable in this conservative state that someone would find that offensive, even though the purpose of teaching the story is to highlight the use of simple imagery to foreshadow...not to mention its an easily-accessible introduction to Hemingway.		**But that isn't the main objection that most have to the bill**.  If you're from Kansas, you know that two things are true about this current legislative session: (1) we have a massive budget deficit that isn't being addressed; and (2) the state GOP is proposing bill after bill to denigrate public education--this bill included.  Among others, they've also proposed: (1) a ban on former educators from running for school board once they retire/resign; (2) to defund AP, IB, and Common Core curriculums; and (3) attempted to throw out current school funding formulas (which equalize funding between wealthy and poor districts) and replace with a stop-gap measure, rather than comply with a state Supreme Court order to increase education funding--the third-such order in the last 15 years.
