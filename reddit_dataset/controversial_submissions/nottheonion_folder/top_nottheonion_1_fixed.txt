This one doesn't like this gun, this one wants to be the last to have to fight, this other one over here is stuck in his freshman history course and can't get over his teacher's outline.  Of course, most find all kinds of reasons to blame others, pontificate and frame everything as a clever response. But they don't get the job done - even if the purpose is right they aren't an outfit to carry out a necessary duty. 		So, he and most others are heroes for 1) doing their job very very well 2) doing their job regardless of whether they personally agree with it  and 3) doing their job knowing that idiots such as ourselves will armchair quarterback them for years to come from the comfort of our favorite social media.  		They also put their life on the line everyday with the above in mind knowing most out there don't give a damn how they come home or if they come home.		But you sleep well tonight and keep clicking on your threads because whether you know it or not, you are not worried if someone will protect you and your family from the next threat.","depth":4,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Boojy46","name":"t1_cnudfl0","parent_id":"t1_cnu7fhc","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421712018,"created_utc":1421712018}

{"body":"It does glorify war, while also sort of depicting the effects it has on Americans who go. It still paints the Iraq war as a noble war fought by heroic Knights on a mission to save the world from the evil savage jihadi's. It ignores the realities of the conflict, and shows the other side as nothing more than 1 dimensional evil monsters. Only a handful of Iraqi's even have speaking parts in the movie, all of whom serve to only paint Mr. Kyle and the rest of the Americans as brave heroes. It does nothing to humanize the other side (which I can assure you was made up of humans, especially in those early says when the fighters were Sunni's who felt cut out of the government), it only serves to glorify the war and "highlight" some of the negative effects it had in the troops. But even then it trivialized that by making it seem like Kyle got over his PTSD through his massive gaping hero complex, and nothing more. 		It ignores the reality of a highly complicated conflict by conflating dozens of different opposing factions into one broad "savage moslems"  death army, ignores Chris Kyles problematic history of racially charged statements, and ignores how often he celebrated killing and stated how much he enjoyed it. American Sniper is very much a propaganda piece, all the worse because Clint also made two of the best war movies in recent history (*Flags* and *Letters*). It's a white-washed charactuer of not only the Iraq War, but of Chris Kyles life in general, and of what PTSD is like. *American Sniper* is without a doubt one of the most insulting and plain awful war movies I've ever seen. 		EDIT: So this sort of took off. I wasn't really expecting anyone to read this comment, I just threw it together ten minutes after I woke up in no small part because I've been super fed up with a lot of the responses to the movie. I wasn't expecting so many responses, and I really wasn't expecting people to react so violently towards what I said. I figured it might rustle some feathers, but man I didn't think I'd make people sick. Sorry? I mean, I don't think anything I've said here makes me any less American or whatever, but oh well.		Also, I'm not really gonna respond to most replies at this point. A lot of people are bringing up the same points (some in nicer ways than others), and I really don't feel like retyping the same shit. I encourage you to read through the comment thread, I or someone else has probably addressed in one way or another your counter.		And if anyone is interested, these two articles from the Guardian provide some more context for my issues with the film and Kyle.

{"body":"> These redditors have no fucking clue how many soldiers, engineers, Muslim civilians got back to their family because Chris Kyle using his skills shot a terrorist with an RPG or vest or AK.			See, here's the problem with trying to criticize the movie. You can't gain any footing because any Chris Kyle supporter immediately reverts to the argument via sense of patriotic duty; i.e. "you're not supporting your country by not supporting this movie!" Did Chris save plenty of people? Sure. Do I have respect for the armed forces? Yes. That's all beside the point, so don't keep bringing it up in lieu of the discussion at hand:		Yes, Chris Kyle painted himself as a humble man, but he's also a [compulsive liar](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/384176/justice-jesse-ventura-was-right-his-lawsuit-j-delgado), which was proven in court and in multiple appeals courts thereafter. His claims were so fabulously wrong that entire portions were removed from the *American Sniper* novel. If he was willing to lie about his own accomplishments, how trusting you can really be towards the attitude he gives himself in his autobiography? He openly depicts other SEALs as being cocky assholes; who's to say that he isn't?		There's no argument that he was an excellent killer, as if he considered it his God-given purpose to wipe out the "savages" (quoth the novel) that conveniently showed their heads. But, his attitude in the novel is very nonchalant towards who he's killing. He's very one-dimensional in his patriotism. He simply [doesn't understand why some Iraqis don't want to be invaded](http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/02/pseudo-courage-of-chris-kyle.html). His one-dimensional American global supremacy is reflective of America's narcissism as a whole, but that's a topic that could be expounded upon in future discussion.		He revels in his killing, and shows no remorse for it. That's the reason he is so heavily criticized: He has no remorse for killing hundreds, if not thousands of people. While you stand behind him and try to justify his actions to yourself, you can use the same excuses I'd expect you would: He was defending his countrymen! He was doing his duty! But the fact of the matter still remains, he was a cold-hearted killer. I get it. I've heard it. But if you asked an SS officer the same thing in 1940, he'd give you the same answer.","depth":8,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"INGWR","name":"t1_cnujcya","parent_id":"t1_cnudokm","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421722405,"created_utc":1421722405}

{"body":"I didn't think that American Sniper was the super-jingoistic movie that some people here seem to think it is... but it has a few major problems. Firstly, it didn't examine the man Kyle *really* was - in order to do that, it would have to call its own content into question since it's based on his autobiography and the man was a known liar.		Second, it of course continues questions of *how war changes people* and the struggles of Kyle and others with what they experienced/possible PTSD, but talking about PTSD is NOT a new conversation anymore. The film didn't do anything new or interesting and as someone else pointed out, its portrayal of the condition is pretty much what a kid would perceive - it doesn't go very deep at all.		Finally, the movie simply wasn't as interesting. It wasn't *terrible*, but I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good. The reason there's so much talk about it is 1) the big box office draws because the movie is drawing in a ton of crowds who otherwise don't go see movies and 2) its several wholly undeserved Oscar nominations. This was a great year for film with a lot of really good movies, and American Sniper was not one of them.

I know your no longer responding to posts due to the volume you have received but I thought I'd leave you with some additional prospective that you may have thought of yourself or maybe it is a bit different.		The movie is based on his book which is based on his experience. I think that if you believe the 'other side' to be loving and peaceful people it makes it extremely hard to 'shoot a child with a grenade' for example. He convinced himself (right or wrong) that every shot was saving lives (I am killing 1 to save 10). We will never know if he truly hated or if he was really convinced that he was saving lives, that goes with him to the grave.		He DID have a hero complex and it is obvious he never got over his PTSD based on the fabrications in his book (truck jacking for example). However, his hero complex made him believe he was over PTSD. It was probably easier to make believe he was a hero who got over PTSD then to admit he still had it.		Those 2 things being said, if you are looking for an 'accurate war movie' you are looking in the wrong place because this was his account of war and his life. That being said, I think it does an excellent job portraying his view of war, which was the point.		I for one didn't feel like it glorified war because I came out of it thinking 'fuck that noise, that shit sucks'. But that was my personal experience so I understand it is subjective.

The sniper, known only as the 'Cobra,' had already killed several Marines and was believed to have been sent specifically to kill Hathcock.[10] When Hathcock saw a flash of light (light reflecting off the enemy sniper's scope) in the bushes, he fired at it, shooting through the scope and killing the sniper. Surveying the situation, Hathcock concluded that the only feasible way he could have put the bullet straight down the enemy's scope and through his eye would have been if both snipers were zeroing in on each other at the same time and Hathcock fired first, which gave him only a few seconds to act.[10] Given the flight time of rounds at long ranges, the snipers could have simultaneously killed one another.[14] Hathcock took possession of the dead sniper's rifle, hoping to bring it home as a "trophy" but, after he turned it in and tagged it, it was stolen from the armory.[15]**","depth":1,"score":65,"ups":65,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Morning_Star_Ritual","name":"t1_cnu4jsy","parent_id":"t1_cnu1d9k","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421697751,"created_utc":1421697751}

It still paints the Iraq war as a noble war fought by heroic Knights on a mission to save the world from the evil savage jihadi's. It ignores the realities of the conflict, and shows the other side as nothing more than 1 dimensional evil monsters. Only a handful of Iraqi's even have speaking parts in the movie, all of whom serve to only paint Mr. Kyle and the rest of the Americans as brave heroes. It does nothing to humanize the other side (which I can assure you was made up of humans, especially in those early says when the fighters were Sunni's who felt cut out of the government), it only serves to glorify the war and "highlight" some of the negative effects it had in the troops. But even then it trivialized that by making it seem like Kyle got over his PTSD through his massive gaping hero complex, and nothing more.		>It ignores the reality of a highly complicated conflict by conflating dozens of different opposing factions into one broad "savage moslems" death army, ignores Chris Kyles problematic history of racially charged statements, and ignores how often he celebrated killing and stated how much he enjoyed it.

It's *partially* the truth -- the part where he's great at killing people. The rest is not who Chris Kyle is. 		The movie portrayed him as this "decent man asked to do indecent things" admirable hero who is traumatized by the war. That's not him. He's not a decent man. He's a goddamn psychopath. I encourage you to go read his book for yourself. Half of it talks about how much he enjoyed his job overseas, and then he justified his existence by the notion that protecting American freedom requires horrible people like him. That's the real Chris Kyle -- a war junkie who took genuine pleasure in killing people. The movie version of him is thoroughly sanitized, so as to not offend the patriotic American consciousness.		I get the feeling like the vast majority of the people who went to see this movie are not familiar with the source material. It really has nothing to do with Chris Kyle. The story it's telling is a fictional soldier's life, based very *very* loosely on Chris Kyle (mostly in terms of what he did during deployment). They attached it to Chris Kyle basically to cater to the hard-on that Golden Globes committee has for biopic movies. Otherwise, there is no need for the association, because the movie just isn't honest to who the real man is in real life.","depth":1,"score":19,"ups":19,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cnufw4c","parent_id":"t1_cnu0pmh","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421716350,"created_utc":1421716350}

{"body":"It's interesting, because I thought you were going someplace completely different than where you ended up. You've made me think.		In reading your hypothetical movie, my thinking was along these lines: most Americans don't know very much about that war, so the majority of people wouldn't have expected any kind of political statement about that war itself, but instead would probably have seen the movie as a very personal picture of how war effects an individual and his family, without going into wider ramifications of that war specifically. Because Americans don't know (or care, even if they do know) about that war very much, being in a far-away place involving political entities that are very changed from that time, the movie would probably be seen as being about 'modern war' as a *concept*, and how it impacts soldiers, more than actually that *specific* conflict. Similar to how *All Quiet on the Western Front* got flak when it came out for showing the German side of WWI without really criticizing it, but we now view it today as a great portrait of the modern soldier and modern war.		I'm wondering if that's what 'American Sniper' is seeking to do. I haven't seen it (I plan to), but judging from what many on here are saying, it doesn't say very much one way or another about the war itself, but merely takes that war for granted and then explores how it effects a soldier.

{"body":"OK, I'm extremely liberal, and fairly "anti-gun", if that is such a thing.  I'll probably never own a gun (though I support your right to, within reason), and I'll never join the armed forces.		That said, I saw "American Sniper" yesterday, and overall it was a very neutral film.  I went to see it in part because I was looking for answers to how to live with guilt, even though I'm not a veteran, and I was a bit surprised at how the film really offers no answers at all.  Whether you are "pro-gun" or "anti-gun", you see what you want to see in this film.  That's probably why it's selling so well.		To call it a propaganda movie is strange, since it's about someone who gets so messed up in the head he almost loses his family -- and then is killed by another veteran he's trying to help.  Perhaps it's my existing beliefs speaking, but there is no way I'd ever want to go to war, after having seen this.  Your life could be over in the blink of an eye, from someone a mile away -- or in the next car over.  Even if you survive with all your limbs intact, and your wife doesn't leave you, you're probably not going to be able live a normal life back home.  This is not like any propaganda war film I've ever heard of.  There are no winners here.		I would agree that the film did seem to spend too much time on battlefield scenes, and not enough on his recovery back home.  The battle scenes were not fun movie action scenes, though.  They were tense and terrifying.  I was reminded of "Platoon", another film that doesn't exactly take a position, but is generally regarded as an anti-war film.		Compare "Black Hawk Down" or "Pearl Harbor", both of which portrayed, to me, a story of "American forces get an ass-whooping, and then eke out one tiny positive moment at the end, which becomes a celebration of America Fuck Yeah".  Those are propaganda movies.  Big catchy soundtrack at the end to let you know that America won, even if they lost!  "American Sniper" is nothing like those movies, and is better for it.  It ends in dead silence, and the whole theatre afraid to make a sound.		To see "American Sniper" as a propaganda movie, you either have to have your mind made up ahead of time, or you have to be looking to create controversy.  It's a film that should inspire in any sane person a great fear of war, and pity for our veterans.","depth":0,"score":87,"ups":87,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"antigunny","name":"t1_cnu6v6j","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421701389,"created_utc":1421701389}

{"body":"I wouldn't call his depiction "affable".  More like "brooding".  Was he ever happy?		Most depictions of war in film are one-sided.  I think it's largely a matter of time: even at 133 minutes, this film was too short to cover even one man's short life, much less the different perspectives of the war in Afghanistan.		Books have much more opportunity to tell a complete story, and I recommend "Black Hawk Down" as an amazing book that covers characters and motivations on both sides of that conflict.  Unfortunately, the director turned it into an action movie, and showed only the American side.		The only films I can think of offhand that try to show more than one side of war are exceptionally long ones: "The Longest Day" (178 minutes), or "Lawrence of Arabia" (222 minutes).  I don't think there's anything wrong with a 2-hour movie trying to show just the perspective of war for one person and his family.  There can be artistic merit to a 4-hour movie, but what good is it if nobody sees it?		I haven't read the book "American Sniper", but it sounds like an autobiography that doesn't tell multiple sides of this conflict, either.  I have no problem with them removing some less-desireable parts of his character, in order to tell a more universal story about the horrors of war.

{"body":"> People forget that when you watch a movie you generally want to be like the protagonist of the film.		Right.  You naturally associate with a protagonist *because* you see their side of things, and yet, for most of this film, we don't really see his motivations.  He doesn't talk much, as his wife laments.  He grew up in a strict household with guns, but so did his brother ("Fuck this place!").		If you go to the theatre with questions like "Why does one become a killer?" or "How does one cope with one's friends dying?", you're not going to find anyone else's answers in this movie.		> He only seemed to be comfortable when he was in Iraq, that doesn't seem like something you would glorify.		Yep.  It's almost like they were pointing out that he was always a slightly disturbed individual, and found in war a place where he was not so crazy.  But it was never a place he could stay.  Towards the end, I actually found myself wishing he would get killed (I did not know his story beforehand) just so his family could get some closure.  I didn't see any way he could be content leaving the war.		Maybe I'm alone in that feeling, but if not, it's definitely not glorifying the man's profession if the audience wants the protagonist to die, just so he'll stop hurting his family.		> I get it, the movie didn't highlight some of his views/opinions.

What I got from it is that it was not necessarily about Kyle-the-man, since he never really explained himself, but about veterans in general.  Even in the *best possible scenario* -- a soldier at the top of his field, who never made a bad kill (that we saw), and came home without a scratch on him (as far as we can see), to a loving wife and happy children -- every soldier will come home from war struggling to deal with the fact that he's driving to the mall on a sunny day while his friends are still out on the field dying.  Everyone else we saw who came home from the war was strictly worse off: they had severe physical injuries on top of their emotional ones.","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"antigunny","name":"t1_cnufw3u","parent_id":"t1_cnuckap","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421716350,"created_utc":1421716350}

Yet any viewers would think that he came from nowhere. Mossadegh was replaced as Prime Minister by Fazlollah Zahedi, not the Shah, who simply retained his position and was not installed.		A few quotes from Mossadegh's wikipedia page that explain how misinformed people are about him:		*"During the royal approval of his new cabinet, Mosaddegh insisted on the constitutional prerogative of the Prime Minister to name a Minister of War and the Chief of Staff, something the Shah had done up to that point. The Shah refused seeing it as a means for Mosaddegh to consolidate his power over the government at the expense of the monarchy. In response, Mosaddegh announced his resignation...After five days of mass demonstrations, frightened by the unrest, Shah re-appointed Mosaddegh, granting him the full control of the military he had previously demanded."*		*"Mossadegh convinced parliament to grant him emergency powers for six months to "decree any law he felt necessary". With his emergency powers, Mosaddegh tried to strengthen the democratic political institutions by limiting the monarchy's powers, cutting the Shah's personal budget, forbidding him to communicate directly with foreign diplomats, transferring royal lands back to the state and expelling his politically active sister."*		*"In January 1953, Mosaddegh successfully pressed Parliament to extend his emergency powers for another 12 months. With these powers, he decreed a land reform law that established village councils and increased the peasants' share of production...during this time Iranians were "becoming poorer and unhappier by the day" thanks to the British boycott. Mosaddegh's political coalition began to fray, his enemies increased in number."*		*"the already precarious alliance between Mosaddegh and Kashani was severed in January 1953, when Kashani opposed Mosaddegh's demand that his increased powers be extended for a period of one year...On or around 16 August, Parliament was suspended indefinitely, and Mosaddeq's emergency powers were extended."*		*"In August 1953, the Shah finally agreed to Mossadegh's overthrow, after Roosevelt said that the United States would proceed with or without him, and formally dismissed the prime minister in a written decree, an act that had been made part of the constitution during the Constitution Assembly of 1949."*","depth":3,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"valleyshrew","name":"t1_cnui5ty","parent_id":"t1_cnu5x1l","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421720283,"created_utc":1421720283}

{"body":"You keep using that word obtuse, but I dont think you know what it means...	what is derogatory about a political stance about the size of the government? You seem to confuse actual english words with slang and colloquialisms.	Fetishist is implying there is something wrong or abnormal with the attachment one has with his or her fetish. It is inherently negative and implies there is something wrong with them.	The n word is a racial slur, it is slang it is derogatory by nature and by invention. 	There is no better word to describe someone who is in favor of a large state government than statist. Why deny that? Those who are in favor of a large central government are statists in the same way those who are politically left are leftists or those who practice Buddhism are Buddhists.  	The only reason anyone would think thats a bad word is if you think that being associated with those who would push for a bigger centralized government is insulting to you and your stances. If that is the case then it is not as much a problem with someone who can identify political stances from what people are saying as much it is cognitive dissonance between what they want to see change in the world and what those policies would cause in actuality.	I am a right winger, I see nothing wrong with self identifying as such or having other people call me a right winger. Why throw down the offended card when a political system is called statist? If it is not, it should be easy to show, and if it is then that is it. Its a political view, its an opinion, why get pissed off at someone having an opinion. 	Lastly when someone lead off with "The government should..." that is a statist view, not saying its wrong but it is someone who thinks that the responsibility should be moved to the central government. 	You do see how "gun fetishist" is an insult and statist is a point of view right? if statism is such an incredibly bad word to be labeled as, then why continue to act and espouse statist tendencies? Is it the labeling process that is unwanted? We need these labels especially in politics, as they nail down what people intend to do on the large scale.

{"body":"Its actually the idealists who seem to suffer the worst of it, because they go in thinking they are going to do great things for the world. In some cases this actually comes true like with those in the WW2 generation who were able to do specific things that helped people like liberating a concentration camp for example. Or the soldiers & sailors who got to respond to civilians in south east asia following the big Tsunami 10 (?) years ago.		But in other situations, the cold hard reality is in direct conflict with what they had hoped to do for the world. And *that* adds a whole other layer of duress on top of the fact that they killed people. Take April '91 for example. The first Gulf War had been a just war, if we base that decision on the fact that it was to repel a dictator from another country he had attacked in a war of aggression. But at the end of the war we promised Iraq's minority groups that we will aid them in defending themselves from Saddam's regime, instituted no fly zones to help them, and with Saddam in power we.... abandoned them. Sat by idly and watched as Saddam commit genocide against them. There are fighter pilots from the months after the war that will talk in tears about how they flew missions over Iraq after the war, watching Saddam's forces kill civilians without being able to do anything about it because it went against their orders. So fast forward to 2003, it is really not so surprising that so many lifers (who had been in back then) were totally onboard with going back even if the justification for doing so was dubious. But there are some wrongs that simply cannot be corrected, so even Saddam's execution does little to elevate the duress of those who witnessed what he had done there.		PTSD is usually thought of in association with Vietnam. Even if we ignore how these veterans came home to be spit on and called baby killers. Even if we ignore how we lost the war and all of Vietnam ultimately fell. Even if the asymmetrical fighting is ignored for the time being, just[ what the war ended up causing in Cambodia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/) weighs heavily on the minds of many who were there, and its undoubtedly worse for those who were actually in Cambodia under orders to train their forces & talk about how safe they were with the all powerful United States as their ally to help them.","depth":5,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sg92i","name":"t1_cnu7xbm","parent_id":"t1_cnu3ki8","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421703004,"created_utc":1421703004}

I mean, a prime example of this are all the efforts to revitalize your shitty downtown areas like Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, etc. Problem is, the middle class, upper class Republicans are OPPOSED to any sort of serious mass transit.

Problem is, your city becomes a clusterfuck of inefficient highways, jammed and incredibly dangerous.		Then the police and ordinary citizens claim they need to hide behind their guns for everything.

{"body":"I kind of fall somewhere in the middle on this whole controversy. I personally think people are freaking out WAY too much over what Rogen said. He's a comedian and a satirist. By no means did I think his statement was made to blatantly disrespect Kyle. Overall, if you actually consider what he said, the statement makes a good bit of sense. Of course, that only happens when you quit considering that he's simply comparing the movie to Nazi propaganda and more questioning the fact that we are putting Kyle on a pedestal. 		I certainly think that it has become an unhealthy obsession of many right wing Americans to flash their "patriotism" by praising our veterans like they are some sort of god's. I, personally, believe this is the position Rogen was coming from. Was Kyle an exceptional sniper? Of course. Was he a true hero? Depends on what your definition of a "hero" is. Personally, as a soldier and someone who enlisted in the army for his country, I definitely would consider the man a hero. However, it is good to remember that our soldiers are human. There are many shithead men and women out there who get into the military for less noble reasons other than fighting for their country. For instance, I have known plenty of idiot douche bags that enlisted because they simply wanted to drop some "rag heads." Do I consider  them American heroes? Hard to say. I honestly don't even know if I could, especially if their heart was in it for their own insane sociopathic reasons. If Kyle's reasons for enlisting were the same, then that kind of blood lust and blatant disregard for human life would certainly make me question his actual "heroism." However, that's not to say that there aren't  even MORE who enlist because they DO want to fight for their country. There are. I have truly known some great men and women who have enlisted for the right reasons other than their own selfish ones. 		Whether you believe in the cause or not, these men and women are doing something I certainly wouldn't do myself. I have a great respect for that. I am truly thankful for the ones who will take up arms to protect our country, no matter the cause. However, they are not infallible and I think that is something that many people compare them to being. As well, I know plenty of vets who hate having that unrealistic godlike status applied to them and I certainly can't blame them.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"shredziller57","name":"t1_cny4cqp","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421998951,"created_utc":1421998951}
{"body":"American Sniper is either rated FT, for Fairy Tale, or P, for Propaganda.  It's either fantasy, created by a mind that only sees black and white, or propaganda, an attempt to distort reality so audience too start thinking in black and white.		Despite the war in Iraq having "officially" ended couple years ago, US involvement there is very much ongoing.  Not only that, it was only a few weeks ago that CIA documents became declassified and people learned way more than they wanted to, about the horrifying prison tortures in Iraq, the icing on the cake that was the preemptive and illegal invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11, a war that led to over one million Iraqi deaths, millions of Iraqis displaced and jobless and homeless, and a country that is in more chaos and instability than ever.  Thank you Mr. Bush.  		Oh, and did I mention the several thousand American soldiers killed or the  thousands of American soldiers suffering from PTSD and drug problems?  The irony is that the racist "hero" of the story got shot and killed in real life not by evil "savage" Arabs, but by a vet suffering from PTSD.  Reality has a way of intruding into fantasies.    		Clint, you should have waited a few more years before you decided to make light of the war and turn it into a mindless glorified shooter computer game where we kill the "bad guys" with only minor moral struggles, and emerge victorious.  Hell, the blood on the walls of those prisons' torture rooms has not been wiped off yet.  Vets are still struggling with fresh nightmares.  The multi-trillion dollar war was real, complex, and not a battle of good vs evil.  Show some respect, if not to Iraqis, at least to Americans who put their lives on the line.  		What happened to movies that actually meant something?  Movies that helped people think about issues deeper?  Film is the seventh and richest of all art forms.  There are paintings in museums in Europe, that engage people emotionally and intellectually and help them develop deeper appreciation for reality, new levels of perception and abstraction.  And we do THIS with the money we have to make movies?   		Not every tragedy or social problem should be food for Hollywood.  Hollywood should wait till people have forgotten the facts of biggest tragedies before it rushes to cash in other people's sufferings, be it 9/11, invasion of Iraq.  And just stay clear of complex social issues like racism or sexism or religion.  Stick to what you know, car chases, things exploding, objectified women, gaudy display of wealth and "success", and black and white morals.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Harmyon","name":"t1_cny60p1","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1422006050,"created_utc":1422006050}

{"body":"A movie about a sniper could be incredibly insightful. Unlike most soldiers, a sniper cannot help but be aware of the personal responsibility of every life taken. When not in an active combat scenario, a sniper probably studies and watches potential targets for a relatively long period of time in an intimate fashion not possible for others.		Flip these around and it's the reason snipers are often reviled by their enemies. Except for the case of a sniper, it can be hard to pinpoint a particular other person to blame for the death of a comrade and/or friend in the chaos that war elicits.		Using these themes, an audience could be far more enlightened about the psychological toll incurred by the training, actual taking, and personal reflections on the taking of life than may be possible in a typical war movie. I think this is especially the case because a sniper can in some ways represent the non-war-going public, being more immune to retribution than the average soldier, while watching and causing death from afar.		If I believed American Sniper were more like this I would see it. But watching [trailer 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99k3u9ay1gs) and [trailer 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bP1f_1o-zo) it comes across more about the personal cost associated with having to make hard choices when one's sense of duty and morality potentially conflict in situations of incomplete information that necessitate quick decisions.		I don't want to make light of this man's story without actually knowing much of it, but that can be achieved (1) in most war movies, (2) without putting in the trailer "deadliest american sniper in history. It seems like it veers more towards tragic hero worship, than a movie with a balanced statement on war. For that reason I will not be seeing it in theaters.		Having not seen it, it's hard for me to say if Rogen is wrong to make the comparison to a fake Nazi hero glorification propaganda film, but it does appear to have too many surface similarities for my taste.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Phobophilic","name":"t1_cnu5x30","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421699897,"created_utc":1421699897}

However, do you really think it's fair for you to put down this person because of everyone else that can't behave?		As for nuance, I think you are wrong there. I think Eastwood's film is entirely nuanced, subtle. To throw a drunken rampage in there would have wrecked the tone of the film in its entirety. Perhaps it's the nature of this war compared to previous ones, but there was no Saving Private Ryan glory moments. And, Chris Kyle didn't seem like the brightest bulb, so maybe that's why. The opening scene (when put together) where he picks off that little boy and his mother...hardly glorified. The marine on the roof with him deserved to be strangled. Bradley Cooper's performance was nuanced. He didn't need to flip out to show the mental problems. It was real, though. Have you met any of the vets with PTSD? One of my closest childhood friends did a few tours over there. He has it. He's not some...drunken hurricane destroying all he sees in sight. He's fine 98% of the time. And then something sets him off and that's it. That's what Bradley Cooper did. I repeat: one doesn't have to be beaten about the head to get the message that something wasn't right anymore there...and maybe never was. I got it, easily. I don't think Clint Eastwood was calling Kyle a hero. I think he made it a point to say the only reason why he was able to do what he did was because he lacked something. Empathy, emotions. And when those things finally reared their ugly head, he suffered. Also consider that this is the same director who did *Letters from Iwo Jima.* To say that it's not nuanced and is biased is to ignore the directors' long-held style entirely in favor of what you've already decided the movie was about. I suggest you re watch it with a different mindset and really pay attention. If you can't do that, I'm afraid I can't take you seriously. I've met far too many idiot movie goers that either can't do their research before walking into a film, or have such biases that they can't evaluate the movie on its own merits.

{"body":"I went and saw American Sniper yesterday. I enjoyed the movie but I also felt like it felt like just a remake of Enemy at the Gates and missed out on a lot of the depth of the story in Iraq. It feels too much like the dueling snipers just in Fallujah instead of Stalingrad. That was just part of the book but it became the whole movie. 		It almost seems like a way to make Chris Kyle's story one of clear victory in spite of the larger story of the war in Iraq which is vastly more complex. This almost cheapens Chris Kyle's story.		It also focuses a lot on his relationship with his wife. In the book his wife was really just a minor character, his teammates were far more important to him. Again it seems like a way to just make him more human, but it kind of takes away from the book, or the story of his life as Chris Kyle himself saw it.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"flyingchipmunk","name":"t1_cnu9u45","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421705949,"created_utc":1421705949}

We must have watched different movies, cause that's not what I took from it. The movie definitely doesn't glorify the war, and I can't possible see how it would make people want to enlist. If anything, it shows you how horrific war is for everyone. 		People seem to want to create so much controversy over this movie, when there is none. It's obvious that Chris Kyle enjoyed homicide, I mean he voluntarily kept going back to fulfill his interest in killing people. Another thing people keep making note of like it's news is that he was a pathological liar. Well duh, all sociopaths are, this shouldn't be a surprise. A lot of the "lies" in his book was just him writing out his homicidal fantasies when he could't get his fix, and I'm pretty sure that's how he intended it to be perceived.		People boycotting the film because Chris Kyle was an "asshole" and a "liar" is just stupid. I really don't understand what kind of character traits you expected from a guy that made homicide his career. You expect him to be like Bruce Wayne? Whether he went nuts before the war or after, I don't know, but I will say this, when you sign up to be a SEAL it's pretty clear that there's going to be a lot of killing involved, and it takes a special type of person to want to do that.		If he didn't become a SEAL, who knows, but an innately violent person like that is not good to have in your community. My point is is that these types of people have value in war. I hate to break it to you, but the people that shine the most on the battlefield, the most efficient killers, are all probably sociopaths.

The CIA has been in Afghanistan since '87 and they are still there.

They have propped up the Karzai government with US taxpayer money, they have paid off the drug bosses with US taxpayer money - factions of the CIA co-opped Afghans have even started small civil wars between themselves!

They influence where troops get sent in the world and they insidiously are using OUR military to fight THEIR enemies.  European bankers are doing the same fucking thing.

Stephen Hawking comes across as an arrogant asshole, albeit incredibly brilliant, though still human. This movie shows nothing even remotely critical about a guy who was a notorious prick. He still saved lives in Iraq, he's still an historical soldier and a war-hero by many accounts, but that doesn't make him a saint, nor does it require that his memory be distorted to ignore the parts of his life that would be less than flattering. 		Overall, I would not recommend this movie, and feel there was a huge failure on the writing/directing. The movie was acted very well, Bradley Cooper does a great job.

Most states also grant the right to privacy in torts you can understand if you look it up. Besides, we're not just talking about the digital age where things get murky...the patriot act allows the government to basically 'kick your door down for being suspicious.' The government can do warrantless searches without even informing the property owner they were there. No cause needs to be proved and there's no limit to what can be searched or seized (section 213).		Moving on from that, the patriot act also takes away Amendments 5 and 6 - the right to a public and speedy trial by jury. The government doesn't need jack shit anymore to throw your ass in jail. Well, maybe not *your* ass. Non-citizens. Immigrants, legal or illegal.

He always has the brave sidekick which has been a burden for too long sacrifice his life holding position but you'll never see him die because it's propaganda if you see the hero die then you realize war is kill or be killed","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"occupythekitchen","name":"t1_cnudgnb","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421712072,"created_utc":1421712072}
{"body":"American Sniper does a decent job of showing the internal struggles and conflicts in Chris Kyle's life, but what gives it an uncomfortable nationalistic feel is that there are (almost) no sympathetic Iraqi characters. Almost every Iraqi shown in the movie tries to hurt or kill innocents or American soldiers, or if they aren't personally violent, they are complicit in aiding others who are. The trailer was so good for this movie not only because it was tense, but because it hinted at the complex and morally-difficult decisions that soldiers have to face in war. I just wish the film would have been equally subtle in its depiction of the Iraqis - an identifiable, likable Iraqi character would have assuaged the "propaganda" feel that I think Rogan rightly notices.","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"grads_cool","name":"t1_cnudy40","parent_id":"t3_2sybyg","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1421712933,"created_utc":1421712933}

That father and his child were the only Iraqis one could possibly sympathize with, but I would argue that the only reason they are in the movie is to give the "Butcher" character an opportunity to show how ruthless and evil he is. Once that man and his son are killed, they never pop up again in the story - their function is to create the "hero vs villain" relationship between Kyle and the Butcher.		And of course, there are Kyle's repeated references to Iraqis as "beasts" and "savages."
