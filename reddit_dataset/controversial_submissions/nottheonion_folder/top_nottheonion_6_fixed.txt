{"body":"All the headlines I've seen for this story are very misleading and I'm surprised they haven't been corrected yet. Then again, this is perfect reddit circlejerk material. DAE le wrong generation? DAE slut money > education degree?		I just found out about this girl yesterday and I was highly skeptical that anyone could make six figures just by putting up Vines of themselves twerking. If it was that easy, you'd see a lot less pornstars and strippers. Why bother with the long hours and dancing for creepy dudes when you can just throw up five second videos of yourself shaking your ass and make bank?		Well, turns out you actually can't make money as a professional twerker on Vine. Also, Jessica Vanessa was never a kindergarten teacher nor did she quit her day job to twerk. All it took to get this information was browsing her Twitter feed and Vine page for five minutes.		So according to Jessica Vanessa herself:		1. Despite the news reports, she was never a kindergarten teacher or kindergarten teacher's assistant. She was a [day care assistant](https://twitter.com/_JessiVanessa/status/521815231673012224). Huge difference. There's not a whole lot of money or opportunities for advancement in escorting toddlers to the bathroom and making sure they share their snacks.		2. If you go to [her Vine](https://vine.co/JessicaVanessa), most of the content is actually comedy. That isn't any different from other big Vine names like [King Bach](https://vine.co/KingBach). This girl made like what? Maybe 12 twerking videos out of a hundred comedy skits? Meanwhile, Bach takes his shirt off for every other skit, but you don't see him getting labeled as a male stripper or quitting his day job to "strip on Vine".		3. She's already getting featured on E!, MTV, and she's all over the radio. She has millions of followers and now mainstream media exposure. She quit her day care gig because she's killing it as a social media personality and an event promoter, not because Vine gives her magical twerk money.			**TLDR**		She never taught kindergarten. She didn't quit her job to twerk for a living. She quit because she has 2 million followers on Vine, 509k on Instagram, and 88.2k on Twitter. Gee, work at a day care or make six figures a year from ads, promotions, and appearances? Real tough choice.		**EDIT**		Thanks for the gold, yo.","depth":0,"score":3192,"ups":3192,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"metsuken","name":"t1_cl98a8l","parent_id":"t3_2j7pvb","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1413305605,"created_utc":1413302005}

First, let's take a look at how this story is making its around on the other subreddits:		/r/FloridaMan: [Florida woman quits job as kindergarten teacher to twerk professionally on Vine for six-figures.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaMan/comments/2j5c16/florida_woman_quits_job_as_kindergarten_teacher/)		/r/FacePalm: [Florida teacher quits job to twerk professional on Vine for six-figures.

[Just check this](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=teacher+twerk&sort=top&restrict_sr=off&t=week) for the next two days and see what the headlines and articles within keep saying.		Now let's look at the Fox news story:		> The 22-year-old Florida woman quit her job, and began twerking for a living making six figures!" Not true. She quit her job to become a social media personality for a living.		Even the Bancroft video painted her out as someone who solely gets her income through twerking on Vine when she already came out and said it's not true. I'm not saying it doesn't contribute to her popularity cause it certainly does but to categorize her as a "professional twerker" when most of her Vines are comedy-based is a pretty gross double standard.		King Bach has a bunch of Vines where he strips off his clothes and I can't recall the last time I saw a vine of Marcus Johns with his shirt actually on.

A lot of day cares provide preschool education but not all of them. The primary purpose of a day care is to acclimate kids to an education environment: interacting with other kids, going through a structured day with routines, being separated from their parents, etc. However, depending on the day care you send your kid to, it doesn't mean they'll be learning their letters, numbers, colors, and so forth. It's also completely voluntary. The state doesn't require you to send your children to day cares or preschool like they do for K-12.		We're a big country so day cares vary based on where you are.

Only have 30 desks, but the 31st student comes in the door? Better figure it out. 		 We get more money for a special education student, but that student could cost a LOT more for the services we are legally obligated to provide than we get back from the government. For example, we had a student with an emotional disturbance and physical issues. They required a therapist, a speech pathologist, and an aide on top of all the regular teacher and school psychologist.  Sure, we get 10,000 more for them, but that barely covers the cost of the minimum wage aide for the student. Your private school show that kid the door, we can't. We have to abide by numerous regulations and that is **fine** because we must meet the needs of every student. Your private schools don't have to consider IDEA or deal with the horrendous societal impacts of poverty. And if they do, they get to pick and choose, how  many and who, whereas we don't. So we should rightly be compensated for it. (Also, private schools do not have to take the many hours of formalized testing and they never have to take standardized testing, nor are their numbers and data tracked or held in the same way public schools are.)		I do think my formal education is very valuable and should not be underestimated or devalued. Our pay should be living wage on top helping to pay back our loans.

Your education is valuable, but far too expensive to go through for the average pay, and often times outright silly requirements.  There is no reason a middle/high school math/science teacher should be required to go through highly theoretical math/science courses many tiers above what they will ever be teaching in a high school classroom.  I understand there is some value to knowing what's next, but those teachers are going to spend the next 30-40 years teaching Algebra 2, not Applied Linear Algebra or Abstract Number Theory.  Those credits could be spent more functionally toward the teaching certification requirements.		Our education system needs an overhaul of priority in order to try and keep pace with other nations.  As a nation we don't spend nearly enough on education, and could easily pay for it with even a tiny scale back of military spending. I feel we should adopt a robust trade school split as seen in Europe, with a lot more availability to choosing and learning a trade instead of the more traditional academic path if the student wants.  Let students graduate with skills to improve society.  Teenage kids are more capable than we credit them for.  They could graduate high school with the skills to start a career in anything from plumbing or welding, to electronics and computers.  The current demand for "college prep" at the high school level assumes all people must go to college to succeed, and this is not the case.  Many careers justify a college education, but we also need honest blue-collar work too.

{"body":"Jobs are worth what people are willing to do them for.		Sorry to say it, but teaching kindergartners is not an especially difficult job.  Lots of people CAN do it, and lots of people WANT to do it.  This drives the price down.		Teaching is an intrinsically rewarding profession that many people want to pursue, and thus it keeps the price of labor down.  There's always someone willing to do those jobs for less money because they love it.		That's not to say there are no downsides to this arrangement:  it creates an environment where cost-reduction pressures encourages letting go of more senior teachers in favor of younger ones who have lower salary expectations, leading to a brain drain among faculty.  It also leads to an environment where schools are willing to hire dumber teachers because smarter ones want more money, knowing they could work elsewhere for a lot more.		There's no easy solution to this...you can raise standards and force out teachers who don't meet them, but that rarely seems to work, and usually ends up negatively impacting the kids.  You can use tenure programs to make it harder for experienced teachers to be let go, but this creates yet more new problems with teachers who no longer have any incentive to work hard.		Long story short, if she's the kind of person who would rather shake her ass for money than educate children for low pay, then you probably don't want her educating your children anyway.

It's not at ALL something that some random male teacher could just decide he wants to go do instead of making fuck all at teaching.  It would be inspirational because of the effort he would've had to put in to achieve that climb.		That is starkly different from looking down, realizing that you have a nice ass and know how to move it, and suddenly making unfathomable amounts of money for doing so.  In fact there are essentially no similarities here other than the fact that the two activities are both for the entertainment of others.

{"body":"Only if she lives at home and has daddy pay for 100% of her life, and she literally saves every penny, she could potentially have 1 million dollars after a decade.  Now you tell me, what money account lets you put 1 million dollars into it and keep withdrawing all the interest every year and pays at least 5% interest living wage of $50,000.  CD's dont have nearly that much interest and you can't touch the money for 5-10 years.  Savings account / money market accounts are about 1%.  The only thing she could do is put them in a good growth mutual funds and pray the stock market doesn't keep collapsing, and even then, that kind of investment is meant for longterm growth (letting it sit still for 30 years).  In short, lets snap to reality, she's not retiring any time soon, and she's not going to have a million dollars in 10 years, she's probably not living with daddy, and instead living off her income and probably spending at least half of it every year.  Stripping doesn't provide health insurance, that's not cheap either, and I've never known a stripper to drive a modest vehicle.  If this woman thinks shes retiring in 10 years on 100k, she's dreaming.  And also, she's not making 100k a year **after** taxes.  If she works 5 days a week (unual for strippers) every week, even through christmas, no breaks, she'll pull $96,000 before taxes, probably ~$69,000-$70,000 after taxes, and she's living off that income, meaning a big hunk is getting spent.  She'll be *lucky* to have $200,000 in the bank after 10 years.  Do you realize how much money you need to retire in your 30's?  When responsibly calculating retirement, the first rule is you have to assume you'll live until your late 90's.  Having a retirement fund that provides 50k a year is a modest retirement plan (especially considering 50k wont be shit in 30 years of inflation)  She would need at least 3 million dollars invested to successfully retire *modestly* in her 30s, while keeping in mind that 50k in her later years probably will **not** pay the medical bills and medication she's going to require.  In short, **even if** she tripled her income to 3 million, and didn't spend a penny of it all 10 years, she's still going to spend her later years of that fund in a very modest living situation without much to live on unless she's perfectly healthy until the moment she dies.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mrzisme","name":"t1_cl98z16","parent_id":"t1_cl98i2y","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1413306931,"created_utc":1413303331}

He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip To Be Square', a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics - but they should!

As far as opportunities go, it does sometimes come down to luck I understand, but in America it's not difficult to make your footprint.
