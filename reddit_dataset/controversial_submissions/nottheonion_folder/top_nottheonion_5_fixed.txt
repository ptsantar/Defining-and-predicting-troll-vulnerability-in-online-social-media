Yeah, that's not a blacklist.  	  	One who said he hasn't decided. That's not a blacklist.  	  	One who says that he has privately decided not to work with her. One person. That's also not a blacklist.  	  	And one guy who says that it's all about business. If she'll sell, they'll use her. That's the OPPOSITE of a blacklist.  	  	Right now, I don't give a holy fuck about Gary Oldman or Mel Gibson or anything that isn't this misleading bullshit headline.

Those things Ayalet Shaked said are pretty fucked up, and they fit right in with what I said about there being extremists on the Israeli side that are calling for the total destruction of Palestine.  However just because that person is in government does not mean that they represent a majority of the Israeli people.  If her views are popular with the majority of Israelis then I would expect her party would have won the majority in the elections and would have put one of their own in as Prime Minister, but that is not what happened.		You see this same thing with the right-wing extremists in the US, the republican party is fractured deeply between the far right and the moderate right, but the far right forms a critical base for the moderate right so the moderate right is constantly stuck paying lip-service to the far right despite the fact that the far right really is a small minority in the US and most on the moderate right don't agree with them.  I would imagine that the the same thing is going on in Israel, as much shit as Netanyahu gets for being the hawk that he is he also knows that there are people on the far right worse than him who would gladly decimate Israel's international reputation and trade for the sake of their absurd and frankly monstrous beliefs.		>As for PM Netanyahu, its hard to imagine a "more hawkish" player		Well you say that, but in the paragraph above that you quoted an Israeli who appears to be much more hawkish than Netanyahu is, at least publicly.		For the record I really do think Netanyahu is an idiot and a pretty shitty guy, not just on the obvious issue of killing hundreds of innocent civilians in the name of protecting his own civilians that are not even in very much danger (seeing as Hamas has barely killed anyone with their rockets), but also in a strategic sense.  Hamas does set him up so that if he hurts them by bombing then he hurts himself by killing civilians and hurting his international support.  I don't believe that Hamas likes to see those people die as some would claim, but they do setup the trap for him because that is how asymmetric warfare often works, and he is consistently stupid enough to fall for it when he should just keep negotiating with Fatah and ignore Hamas.		Keep in mind though that there are extremists in the Gaza government who say they want Israel wiped out too.  We can spend all day pointing fingers at the extremists as evidence that one side or the other is really the worse side but the facts don't bear out that the majority of either side want to see the entire other side wiped out.  If that was the case then the elected leaders (and I mean *THE* leaders, not cabinet or parliament members) would have to be publicly calling for that or they'd be removed from office.  If a majority of Israelis or Palestinians really wanted the other side wiped off the map then the Israeli PM would be saying so just as the leader of Fatah would be.","depth":5,"score":29,"ups":29,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"uuuuuh","name":"t1_cjmnt9s","parent_id":"t1_cjmnfvi","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1407721509,"created_utc":1407717909}

Thats the whole point of a popular vote.		You don't seem to understand how their system works over there, so here you go:		>[Israel uses the closed list method of party-list proportional representation; thus, citizens vote for their preferred party and not for any individual candidates. The 120 seats in the Knesset are then assigned \(using the D'Hondt method\) proportionally to each party that received votes, provided that the party gained votes which met or exceeded a 2% electoral threshold.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Israel#Electoral_procedure)		What this means is that a political party could get just 10% of the total vote and still get them selves at least one seat in parliament.  So how exactly do you think that someone getting elected to parliament demonstrates that a majority of Israelis agree with them?  I understand that she is part of the ruling coalition but that does not mean that a majority of Israelis voted for her party, just that her party was aligned on the side of the political spectrum that did get the majority. This fits in well with what I was saying about more moderate elements of one side of the spectrum paying lip service to the extremist elements to protect their electoral base.		>I think you're a little naive if you really believe that. Even Hitler didn't publicly make a part of his campaign platform the idea that Jews should be exterminated, he just did it. 		Well there's the Hitler reference, had to come up sometime.  I'm no fan of the way that Israel is handling things but if you think they're on the cusp of whisking people off to extermination camps then I think you need to calm your tits, man, that is a little out there.  If they really wanted to do that they've had ample opportunity with the occupation/siege of Gaza and previous invasions of the West Bank.  Assuming that the international community would ever let them get away with that (we have satellite surveillance now, didn't have that in WWII), then what do you think it is that they're waiting for?

{"body":"That's what makes the term difficult to use "properly."		The Holocaust or other comparables (Cambodia, various examples in Africa) are what seems to be the common definition because it's the easy one, where one group enacts a systematic elimination of another. There's no debate or virtually no debate as to who was in the wrong.		It also holds a lot of weight in that respect, so tends to be used for hyperbolic effect to emphasize how horrific a situation is. I mean you hear genocide used in reference to slavery often, and in that context it does seem to meet the 1948 definition, however in respect to the more common definition (referring to an intent like the Holocaust) it doesn't really seem accurate as the systematic elimination of Africans was the last intent of slavery.		The intent of the word however in respect to Israel seems to be one where it isn't simply about territory because the land in question holds no practical value for either side (and in this context it isn't Jews fighting Jews, or Arabs fighting Arabs). The conflict seems to be very much about momentum but is based on ethnic and religious reasons.		(But if I'm talking out of my ass, then so be it.

{"body":"There's a lot of a domino effect where no one single event can really be said to blame for the entire scenario.		That aside, as I interpret it anyway, the element of the 1948 definition seems to be a discriminatory element.		Where if this was Jews fighting Jews over claim to a territory, it may be illogical if the land has no practical value, but it at least has no basis in fighting a group simply because they're of different ethnicity/religion/etc.		For example of all the immoral aspects of the US invading Iraq in 2003, the motive was not based on any reasons mentioned with the 1948 definition. Even Russia and the Ukraine, there are aspects specifically pertaining to the geographic value in certain locations. Whereas with Israel and the Palestinians, there seems to be no practical aspect to the boundaries beyond ethnic or religious-based reasons. It's also not two groups of the same ethnicity or religion fighting each other over territory.		So if ultimately you're killing thousands of a group or displacing thousands of a group ultimately only because they are of a specific ethnicity or religion that differs from your own, I imagine that is the intent of th 1948 definition.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"seroevo","name":"t1_cjmrffe","parent_id":"t1_cjmq569","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1407729760,"created_utc":1407726160}

{"body":"I am not sure why you're pressing the idea of being inside certain political (nation-state) boundaries as a linchpin of apartheid. 		Apartheid is also not necessarily about majority/minority (and how will you define that anyway? by what geographical bounds?) as much as it's about domination. The word has very specific legal meaning, as defined by the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1973 and ratified by most United Nations member states (Israel and the United States, to no surprise, are exceptions.)		In that convention, apartheid is referenced as acts that are committed "for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them." Some specific examples of apartheid (as legally criminal) mentioned in that convention are: subjecting people to arbitrary arrest, expropriating property, depriving right of freedom of movement and residence, creating reserves and/or ghettos for different members of different groups, preventing marriages across groups, depriving people of the right to leave and return to their country. 		Some people jump on the fact that the convention refers to 'racial' groups here - mostly those who think that 'race' is narrowly defined by (supposed) biological differences, or skin color - which is pretty old-fashioned. But, as Lavar Burton says, you don't have to take my word for it. The 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (which even Israel signed!) (which the aforementioned convention is partially based on) defines 'racial identity' and 'racial discrimination' to include difference based on race, color, descent, and national and ethnic origin. 				I think there is plenty of grounds for an argument to be made that this is an apartheid, legally. 		One book which lays out many ways in which this is so is written by (surprisingly, perhaps) an architect and Israeli author Eyal Weizman. It is called Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation. However, he doesn't use the term as a descriptor or make the suggestion.

The IDF has slowly, methodically, deliberately clamped down on Gaza because of the violence that was being perpetrated against the Israeli civilian population.  Violence that has no place in any struggle.  You can clearly see that the IDF has very strict rules of engagement and goes way out of their way to minimize civilian casualties.  They're just not willing to unduly expose their own citizens, and most definitely not willing to return to the conditions that allowed all the bombings that occurred a decade ago.  In the end, it really comes back to the jihad.  The struggle.  The belief that the Jews have no right to exist, and certainly not in the Levant.  That time has long passed; Israel is far too well equipped, and will _not_ allow themselves to be pushed into the sea.  It's a ratchet effect, and one that has the civilians of Gaza in the crossfire.  If the leadership in Gaza had an end-game that included peaceful coexistence, they wouldn't be committing the actions that they are.  I don't know how to fix it, aside from within.  At some point, the Palestinian people have to say "enough is enough, we will work to show by our actions that we are after peace and coexistence," and so far (unless you can show otherwise, and I would love more knowledge about it) that hasn't happened.  Hamas brutally culled Fatah, and in their charter and rhetoric show clearly that living next to the Jews is simply anathema.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"GoldenBough","name":"t1_cjo3y22","parent_id":"t1_cjnuw0q","subreddit":"nottheonion","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnts","created":1407860583,"created_utc":1407856983}

They, so far as I have gathered, have always existed in a desperate situation and a lot of their actions seem to be out of absolute desperation.

{"body":"> a lot of their actions seem to be out of absolute desperation.		No doubt.  I just find that to be no justification for the _deliberate_ targeting of Israeli civilians.

They did 70 years ago.  Anymore...?  I certainly agree that they have the right to their _own_ territory, but given the proclivity of the "elected" government to utilize strikes against Israeli civilians in pursuit of their goal, it's easy to see why Israel and the IDF keep things under wrap.		> your telling me that Hamas can target a heavily defended airport in the best defended country on the planet from many miles away with home-made rockets? But the IDF can't hit the correct target from literally feet away?		That's... simply incorrect :/.  An airport is a large, fixed area, that's been there for a while.  Hamas deliberately commingles with the civilian population, in order to bait the IDF into causing civilian casualties to prop the narrative.  I encourage you to research and read some of the first-hand accounts of actual IDF members describing what engagements are like, and what they can and cannot do, and how restrictive it is to operate in Gaza.  If the IDF was truly indifferent to civilian casualties among the Palestinians, the death toll would be _way_ higher!

Israel have acted disgustingly in their actions and also in their propaganda which just adds further insult to horrific injury.		It seems that you're only getting half of the narrative then.  Have you looked up the kind of violence was happening in Israel, purely against the civilians, all through the 80/90/00's?  Bombings in pizza parlors, bombings of busses?  The infitada's were a real thing.		> I get what you are saying about how they might fear Palestine having freedom because that might lead to more sophisticated attacks but this is entirely the wrong way to go about it.		Then how should they?  How do you deal with a militant organization that cares nothing for the lives of their own people, much less their opponents?  And is more than happy to blend in with the actual civilians, and strike from their midst, indifferent to the causalities that will result from the return fire?  A people that will _blow themselves up_ in order to cause death and mayhem against their enemies civilians?  I don't know if you fully grasp how terrifying suicide bombers are, people who hate _so much_ that they'll gladly trade, with guaranteed mortality, their own lives in order to send a message against _civilians_.		> Israel should stop bullshitting everybody and give the Palestinian people a fair deal. At the moment they wont even speak to Hamas.		Well no shit, has Hamas shown themselves to be a trustworthy organization that will negotiate in good faith?  Negotiation can only work when both sides are able to trust the other, and hold them accountable.		> I'd just like to point out that Hamas leaders have previously said that they would recognise Israel as a country and that their charter still exists because of historical and political reasons and it is not a list of rules that are set in stone.		First, that's an awful excuse, if they were _really_ after peace you'd think they could give a token admission and go ahead and change their charter that calls for the death of every Jew in the Levant, and two, listen to their rhetoric.  The sermons are all over YouTube, the speeches as well.  I encourage you, don't believe me.  Go look up what they say _themselves_, and exhort their own people to do and think and believe.		I understand that I'm not going to change your mind, and I'm ok with that.  What I would like is for you to become better educated about what Hamas is, and what they believe, and what lengths they're willing to go to in order to achieve their objectives.

There are videos of the "border" authorities calling them animals while keeping them waiting behind a fence. Other videos literally show them using Palestinian civilians as human shields. News reports have came out recently of Palestinians returning to their homes during the cease fires to find that the IDF had defecated all over their homes. And lets not beat around the bush here it is still not acceptable to kill children even if they are being used as "human shields" - a claim that comes from Israel. Also, in that documentary about real estate in Gaza it gives some insight into what these "human shields" actually are. Basically, there are buildings in Gaza in which the population do know that Hamas use to launch rockets from. Israels logic here is that the population know this so by being in the same building as them they are acting with Hamas. The truth is that Gaza is small and these are tactical locations. The rent in these buildings is cheaper because of the known risk of Israeli bombings. So the poorest people in Gaza who have nowhere else to go have to rent these places. These are the kind of people who cant go stay with family when Israel drops a leaflet in there area telling them to leave - they simply have nowhere to go. So basically its Hamas who are there first for tactical reasons and the civilians are there for reasons of poverty. Other places to find cheap rent are beside police stations because these are targets too. Hamas can be critisised for being over -authoritative in Gaza but at least they keep law and order.

I have zero doubt that there are individuals who do such things.  I happens, and I would be a fool to deny it.  What I was speaking to was the _policy_ of the IDF, and the overall actions of the force.  You can find asshole scumbags among every large group of people, but don't let individuals distract you from the larger picture.  The IDF is a modern military, with a real, accountable chain of command, and they have courts that can and will investigate claims and lay down judgement accordingly.  There is freedom of press, due rights, and all the other convinces of a modern democracy.  I'm definitely not saying it's perfect.  Not even close.  But it certainly isn't the bloodthirsty, genocide-bent, indifferent to casualties that they're often painted as.		> And lets not beat around the bush here it is still not acceptable to kill children even if they are being used as "human shields" - a claim that comes from Israel.		That's a tough one.  What if the child is standing directly in front of a person aiming an RPG at your squad?  Just a thought experiment, not trying to claim any particular action.  What if the kid themselves has an explosive?  What if you don't know that they're hiding in the next room over, and the grenade you throw through a window to clear the dude with an AK firing at you and your fellow soldiers kills the child as well?

That is a super shitty situation, and one I was not aware of.  Thank you for the information, that's horrible but interesting to know.

Israel is trying to take all of that away from Gaza and it is just wrong on so many levels.		Oh, be very very careful with that one.  Hamas keeps law and order similarly to how Saddam kept law and order.  Hamas is accountable to no one, and they are well known for heavy-handedness.  Look up how brutally they culled Fatah after the 06 elections.  Throwing people off roofs, executing the daughters of a rival general.  Rocket strikes against their own people.  Hamas law&order isn't like the NYC police force, it's much more Gestapo.  If the IDF was magically the police force instead of Hamas in Gaza, the citizens would be much safer, and treated much more fairly.  Trust that.		> Simply give Gaza, Palestine and Hamas a really good and fair deal.		So hard to do!  Hamas has not, at any level, demonstrated willingness to peacefully co-exist.  They've paid it lip service when convenient, but nothing in their actions or exhortations to their own people.  The wall and movement restrictions exists because it has been _highly_ effective at stopping the bombings.  The Iron Dome has done wonders for the rocket strikes, but it's not invincible and relies heavily on Hamas not having unlimited access to munitions to throw at it (it can certainly be overwhelmed), nor do I find "but they can stop most of them!" to be much of a validation of Hamas's rocket strikes in the first place.  Death&destruction is the goal, but they'll settle for disruption and fear.

What was happening was so horrific, that people would be told, but not believe it. Here are 3 examples:		 a.  Before the USA entered the war, a New York Jewish judge presided over a court-case where escapees from Europe described in detail the extermination of the European Jews. The judge refused to believe them, as it was just too incredible.		 b.  A Jewish man escaped from Treblinka (one of the main extermination camps). He managed to return to his home town in Poland to warn the remaining Jews. They put him in a mental hospital, because they thought what he was saying was crazy.		 c.  A BBC reporter was one of the first to give a dispatch from a recently liberated concentration camp. The BBC in London did not believe him, and ask that I chaplin speak with him because they thought he was delusional.		 2.  Millions of other people were also dying - it was not just Jews. Millions in Russia, the Far East, Poland, Italy, London. Communists, gays, Slav prisoners of war, gypsies etc. Why only single out the Jews for something "to be done about it"? Didn't *all* those people deserve to be saved?		 3.  What *exactly* would you have done?
