{"body":"It's easy to blame this on Snowden, but if the NSA hadn't betrayed the trust of Americans then Snowden would never have leaked the information. Snowden wasn't the only one within the NSA who was against this. There was an exodus of senior staff as more and more people discovered what was going on. 		The US government only has themselves to blame, they weren't compromised by Snowden. They ignored internal criticism of the program and compromised themselves.		There's a really good PBS documentary that interviews people from all sides of the issue [here.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/united-states-of-secrets/)		It's quite clear that the NSA overstepped and many people inside knew about it, as much as the higher-ups tried to keep it a secret.		I don't like how Snowden leaked certain information, but he's a symptom of a larger problem, not the cause. You're spying on Americans and betraying the constitution using *other* Americans, sooner-or-later, someone was going to say something. To think otherwise is extremely short-sighted.","depth":0,"score":340,"ups":340,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"wildkidau","name":"t1_ck9j0n0","parent_id":"t3_2figra","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1409885884,"created_utc":1409882284}

{"body":"Theoretically breaking the current crypto primitives may be very hard, but most systems don't implement crypto correctly. In practice, many crypto systems can be circumvented, not by theoretical attacks but by implementation flaws.		For example, from March 2012 to March 2014 OpenSSL was vulnerable to the [Heartbleed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) bug. It's a "catastrophic" flaw - it leaks not only encryption keys but anything in memory of the affected program. Tor was also vulnerable for the entire period they used vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. The NSA denied knowing about this bug, but they have been caught lying before.		After the bug was fixed, the Tor network started to ban nodes that didn't upgrade. Not even Tor node operators would bother upgrading after a security issue was discovered. But they still use OpenSSL, which is a clusterfuck of library - and it is bound to have many other vulnerabilities.		NSA has been using [Firefox vulnerabilities](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html) to target the Tor Browser Bundle. TBB is the "state of art" because it would give more anonymity - any well researched terrorist would recommend it - but it also makes exploiting users easier.		It's actually very hard to choose secure crypto solutions.

{"body":"Most systems don't implement crypto correctly? Is that based on any research, are you an expert in the field, or is it your speculation?		I agree that the weak point of a crypto system is the implementation, but that doesn't mean all, or even most implementations or fallible. For example, its pretty hard to goof up PGP as long as you don't use a default private key and keep the private key secret. 		Even using something like HTTPs is hard to goof up and it only takes a few clicks to set up. Just make sure you are not using a weak encryption algorithm (~2 minutes of research).		Im not sure your experience with cryptanalysis, but from my experience if you don't want to wait years, breaking a crypt (even an amateur one) is hard. Even finding a short cut that can shave off 10% of the time still results in decades of computing necessary to crack a message. I don't know, maybe you're some god damn genius that can spot patterns in shifting bits. There's a reason why the NSA is the largest employer of mathematicians in the world - because its hard fucking work to break an encryption, or even an implimenation of encryption. Hell, if cracking the implementation is so easy, why hire hundred of mathematicians? Hire more vulnerability researchers and give them all the source code. But I guess according to you all they need is a handful. I'll go ahead and let the NSA know they should fire all those mathematicians and recruit you because you can compute that shit in your head before breakfast is done. 		The Tor/Firefox vulnerability relies on a website being vulnerable to cross site scripting and the user with has to visit a link supplied by the NSA (or an informant) or view a malicious website. Its not a crypto attack. Its not a permanent method to key log (aka get information), and is mainly used to get a user's real IP address.		I agree that heart bleed was a serious vulnerability, but that doesn't mean every crypto algorithm has critical flaws in it. 		Point being, Snowden leaks caused terrorists to focus on improving their opsec. This would obviously cause at least some level of visibility loss for intel agencies.

There's evidence they tapped some phones of people who ended up travling to America and there's evidence they heard some phone conversations on overseas calls that Americans happened to call.  But there isn't much evidence outside of Snowden's accusations that any content of American's was reviewed by actual people. 		The only evidence of that kind of abuse came from the NSA's own audit and was the result of individuals who violated the internal NSA rules.  		>how would you feel about being put on a no-fly list, or put in a secret prison as a result? 		That would be shitty.  Is there any evidence that such a thing occurred from Snowdne's leaked NSA programs?

If targeting foreigners no warrant is required.  There is always a context for any wiretap in order to get the FISA warrant and mass data collection is done by every major corporation on the planet and is perfectly legal and constitutional.  		>It's a time bomb waiting for the right storm of world events and a leader happy to be the triggerman.

Good thing Reuters didn't get any of the information from this story from the NSA.  		>On that note, the CIA was caught spying on congress		That's a nice completely irrelevant fact. 		> So, no, I don't put it past any of those agencies to lie about their tactics.		No one's asking you to.  That link was from REUTERS.  Do you seriously think that the NSA gave Reuters information about a highly illegal program?  		>If they were legal than why would they need to hide them and reverse engineer evidence?		Parallel construction is probably illegal.  They are hiding the true source to protect intelligence assets.  Since you're so dense, I'll indicate again I do not support the practice. 		>Based on the integrity of these agencies in the past I simply don't believe that they are not sharing information gained through mass surveillance with law enforcement. 		Great.  You don't use evidence based reasoning.  You should believe in Santa Clause and the tooth fairy while you're at it.  I bet you're sympathetic to numerous conspiracy theories.  Your shitty reasoning will make you believe all kinds of horseshit. 		>Just because I don't have evidence to back me up doesn't mean it's not true		Right, but it does mean you can't prove it, you have no good reason to believe it, and you have poor reasoning skills.  		>it's possible that no one else has been willing to ruin their lives in order to bring these transgressions to light.		You fucking idiot.  The story is full of people talking about parallel construction, risking the ruination of their lives.  		What's crazy is that you actually have to be kind of smart to be able to construct these arguments.  		It's crazy.  When the ego is confronted with the obvious conclusion that it is wrong, it takes over the rational part of your brain by ignoring the evidence and then using your reasoning process to construct all these terribly illogical arguments. 		Dude, you should be happy to know the truth now.  Who cares if you're wrong to some dickhead on the internet for 2 seconds.  Now that you know that parallel construction and the mass-surveillance programs are unrelated you'll be right from now on. 		And as you point out, you can still be right, you just have to cage your answer in this evidence. 		"I have no evidence to support this, but the NSA has shared traditional intelligence with law enforcement in drug cases and then assisted in hiding the true source of the information; given this precedent I'm sincerely concerned that they may use the mass-surveillance data to similarly prosecute people with unconstitutionally gained evidence." 		That's a reasonable argument and you don't have to look like an insecure kid, and you still get the accuse the NSA of using that stuff to prosecute.  I hope you're young.  This is the kinda shit I used to do when I was 16, when I highly valued my intelligence but didn't really know shit about dick.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"YouShallKnow","name":"t1_ck9qgb1","parent_id":"t1_ck9pvm2","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1409906165,"created_utc":1409902565}

Unfortunately, while you talk about how people "ignore the NSA", the real ignorance here is how you guys are looking at this issue. You're ignoring the meaning of the constitution. It's not "unreasonable blanket privacy..." It's "reasonable expectation of privacy." 		When a lawful court issues a subpoena to aid the NSA investigations, they did not "violate everyone's privacy." They have constitutional authority to help gather evidence for an investigation after lawyers from the NSA show probable cause. That evidence gathering is called truth-seeking. Why would you advocate that people hide the truth? The only people you end up helping is ISIS and other terrorists and Russian spies. No one cares about you and your boyfriends emails.

And again, the remedy to a warrantless search is that the evidence is suppressed, since no evidence has been collected or used against them, I don't see a significant violation. 		>You do realise that if you were of consequence, that enemy or not, you could just as easily be in the crosshairs?		I'm a socialist american.  Of course I could be in the crosshairs.  But I also know that literally no one would even KNOW about this program absent Snowden.  If you need a leak in order to appreciate your "harm" it's not real harm. 		>Sure, email data couldn't be used, but if the fact that it can happen without the need for a warrant (not specifically on about this case) to anyone, citizen or not, we're on very different ground.		Yeah we disagree, I know.  If you think meta data should be protected, good for you.  I happen to agree.  I just don't get all worked up knowing that the Supreme Court decided it wasn't protected decades ago.  		>Tell me someting. If this is all well and good with you		I wouldn't say that.  I just think what police do when the violate your rights, which is much more common and actually affects people, is something we should be worried about.

How did the Boston Bombing happen? If these five people could be listed on what seems like such flimsy ground, how did something that big get through the filter?		1) the Boston Bombing wasn't big.  It was tiny. 		2) Because we SUCK at preventing terrorism, since it's so fucking difficult to stop, which is exactly why I support these kinds of programs. 		3) I don't think anyone's rights were violated in any significant way.  When we actually start causing harm from violation of rights, I get worried.  For example, I am actually critical of the no fly list (although not very worked up over it) since that actually affects people (albeit in a relatively minor way). 		>All of these other plots that are claimed to have been stopped, how cab anyone ever validate the significance of the threats?		We shouldn't validate the significance of the threats.  I don't think our intelligence agencies conducting anti-terrorism programs should have to justify themselves to the US public.  That's why we elect a commander in chief, to make difficult national security decisions.  		>Do you mind that?		What?  That we don't prove to the public that we stopped terrorism with this program?
