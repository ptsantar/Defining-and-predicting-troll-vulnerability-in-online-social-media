Warrantless home searches makes it seem like the police are going to kick in your door and tear your house apart as if its a fucking drug raid or something.		The police have no new powers of entry to your home. You do not have to let them in and they cannot force their way in. They can ask to come in and check your safe, but thats it. 		Previously, the police would call you and say something along the lines of "Hi, we're doing some security checks for gun owners, would you mind if we stopped by for a few minutes?", and if you didn't mind you could arrange a time for them to visit. They have a quick look at your safe, say "Thanks very much, everything seems fine here" and they're gone. The only difference now is that they don't call ahead. If you're not home or its not a good time for you or whatever, they go on their way. 		To give you an idea of how rare visits like this are, I own nearly 30 firearms and I've had two visits like this, and one of those was because police had received some information that gun owners in the area might be targeted for burglaries.

{"body":"I wouldn't know, I've never read the NRA's web site, nor do I particularly care for their talking points (they're kind of dumbed down).		Assault weapons, [a term which was literally coined for the purpose of getting people to confuse them with select fire weapons](http://www.quotes.net/quote/17826) are used in less than 1% of crime.  Criminals by and large just don't use them because they're large and can't be concealed.  This is why long guns in general only account for about 2% of gun homicides annually.  The only thing an assault weapons ban is useful for is as a stepping stone for further regulation.  In terms of gun safety, it just doesn't make any sense.		Second, you say that *you* can't possibly defend yourself, therefore no one can.  I'd say this is a logical fallacy, but it's not even logic.  There are as many guns as people in this country.  To say that wouldn't cause a problem for any occupying force is just silly, given that we've seen our own army demoralized and effectively forced to retreat by armies equipped with little more than small arms (the Viet Cong for instance).  The whole point of asymmetrical (guerilla) warfare is that it allows a weaker force to hold back a stronger one by not engaging them directly.		However, that was mostly in response to your claim that there's no way anyone can stand up to the government.  Frankly, I'd rather it not come to that, which brings me to the most important reason to oppose any further restrictions on firearms ownership.  In the past 20 years, we've seen nearly every amendment in the bill of rights pissed on by our government, and always in the name of "safety" and "security."  As of late, it's been exposed that our government quite literally spies on all of us and really doesn't care that we have a problem with that, as both major parties are more than happy to carry water our intelligence agencies.  Why you'd want to make a group like that the only one with the guns is beyond stupid, but that's besides the point: at some point you have to fight back.  If we don't start now, fighting back for every right, not just the right to own guns, then there's going to be a time when we literally do have to use our guns to fight back.  I'd rather it never came to that.  The 2A is about the only case I've seen where people have successfully blocked legislation intended to infringe upon their rights, and we ought to keep at it, at the very least in hopes that the defenders of the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th amendments might draw strength from it.","depth":11,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cllgaw3","parent_id":"t1_cllfo79","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414444996,"created_utc":1414441396}

There are currently, as of September 2014, 65534 FFL holders in the US. [(source here)](http://www.atf.gov/content/firearms/firearms-industry/listing-FFLs)		Numbers of total gun owners is harder to pin down but most estimates seem to put the current percentage of households owning at least one firearm at 35-40% (again, harder to find a good source, but [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/us/rate-of-gun-ownership-is-down-survey-shows.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) or [here](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/) or [here](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/01/09/Poll-Household-Gun-Ownership-On-Rise)).

In doing so, I have seen that not all gun owners are Ted Nugent, and most are quite responsible (I know of four deaths: a guy we grew up with accidentally discharged a shotgun while carrying it up the stairs of his house and shot himself in the face [very unfortunate, but the result of improper handling of a weapon]; my friend's brother committed suicide using a handgun; and my nurse's son also committed suicide using a gun, and his girlfriend followed less than a week later). 		I don't believe in outright "banning," either, but would you agree that some states make it too easy for irresponsible and otherwise "unfit" individuals to become gun owners?		Personally, I do not have direct access to a gun at the moment: we *did*, but my mother had to remove the family Mag from the house after my brother's bipolar disorder (which my father and I also suffer from) manifested itself most severely. And honestly, I am glad, because if I had had access to it before my bipolar II was controlled, I guarantee I would have committed suicide. Statistically, almost all other methods of suicide [that one can utilize in their own home] are absolute crap and most likely to fail.  			I keep this period in mind when I talk to people about gun rights, because it disturbs me knowing that I could simply cross the state line, go to a gun show, and walk out with a weapon that would guarantee my death in the time it would take me to pick up a pizza. My criminal record is spotless; shy of a speeding ticket when I was 17, I am as clean as a whistle. But my psych folder is two inches thick, and that should make the process harder for me and people like me. 			I believe people should be able to own guns. I don't believe people should be armed with AKs and bazookas, but most semiautomatic weapons, yes. But I earnestly believe all gun owners should have to prove their competency via testing, much like individuals must before they are allowed to drive. Imagine how much safer things would be if people had to clock in supervised training hours under a professional, and take classes in proper gun safety. They could learn everything from how to properly clean, maintain, and store their weapon to proper stance based on which type of gun you are using, what gun is appropriate for your individual needs, how to properly aim, different gun accessories and their functions, and of course, the repercussions of improper handling. But unlike driving (unfortunately: I believe people should have to do this for *that*, too), every 5-10 years after, a written test would help assure that they are still staying informed and practicing proper procedure.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TogepisGalore","name":"t1_clkgzyz","parent_id":"t1_clketa7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414358698,"created_utc":1414355098}

{"body":"> What are you basing your opinion on? Absolutely nothing? That's what I thought.		Being that I haven't stated an opinion here, it's hardly reasonable to ask me to support the opinion which I haven't shared. 		> It does address opinion vs fact based reporting		Sorry, but it doesn't. Not on those terms, anyway. It addresses the ratio of *news* content to political commentary and opinion-based content. Presenting this as an issue of "opinion vs fact"- which I might mention the article he linked *does not do*- suggests that the two are mutually exclusive. The term "false dichotomy" comes to mind. This requires two suppositions which I believe are false:		Assumption One: Opinion pieces cannot be based upon facts. I don't think this is the case. Most pundits, when giving their opinion, will support their opinion with data. They will cite quotations, actions, legislation, events, and all manner of factual elements.		Assumption Two: News Items are never subjected to political bias. Again, I don't think this is the case. The political bias of a company can  effect news stories in all manner of ways, from the tone to the time spent on it, to the specific details they choose to report, to the stories they choose to run in the first place. 		So, lets go back to the comment. The point that they were trying to make was that MSNBC is *more* politically biased than Fox News. The article he cited compared how much content the networks produce is news, and how much is opinion and political commentary. 		Now, if opinion and political commentary is perfectly capable of being factual, and if news is perfectly capable of being politically biased, do you see how this is a poor source to cite in an attempt to make a point about bias? A hypothetical media company could produce 100% news content, but if all of that news content is subject to a political bias, they are *not* an unbiased company. 		Finally, 		> Bashing evidence		I'm not bashing his source material. There's nothing *wrong* with either the article or the data in it, at all. I'm just saying it doesn't support his point in the way that he's insisting it does. Hell, the article isn't even *about* bias, so much as it's about MSNBC billing itself as a politically-centered channel, and how their ratings have been negatively effected by cutting back on their coverage of big news events.

This guy was going at it all fisticuffs, and I could see the officer was really struggling, as well as having to put up with the verbal abuse being spouted by this guy's other half, so  from a rolled-down window I asked the officer if he needed a hand, to which he replied "yes! ... yes, please!".		I jumped out the car to help the officer, with the girlfriend warning me that "I wouldn't if I was you." My reply was that if they continue then people are going to get hurt, and that the officer doesn't deserve to be put in that danger for doing his job. I approached closer to get at the guy, but luckily, at this moment, from the far side of the car, like a bat out of hell, _flew_ a much ... rounder policeman and rugby-tackled them to the ground, out my current field of view, landing in front of the next car down the line. 		As it happened, the guy at been pulled over for being in a vehicle that was not roadworthy and not insured, then after a person check it was determined he had 2 warrants for his arrest. 		Edit: I should add that this wasn't something I actively thought would be awesome to do - in fact I was indeed scared a bit - but I felt compelled to do and mostly thought about afterwards.

{"body":"How many years have you spent living abroad?  I lived 5 years in Germany, and a few more years in different countries in Asia.		From my experience, I would say Denmark is the freest country that I have visited.  But, it's not so much the freedom that the government respects among the people-- it's more the freedom that the people are willing to give each other.  In Denmark, you can do almost anything that does not harm someone else.  Do you want to walk naked down a public street?  You can do that.  No one will take much notice.		I remember an afternoon in April in Copenhagen.  I was in a large square, near a statue.  It was one of those April days that starts off cold and cloudy, and then the sun comes out and it gets nice and warm.  There was a girl who had been wearing a sweater.  She had bought a t-shirt from one of the shops in the square, and decided to sit on the steps of the statue and change from her sweater into her t-shirt.  She did, and she wasn't wearing a bra.  I noticed.  She was lovely.  I also noticed that I was the only person around who paid any attention, at all.  I was the ugly American.  I was intruding upon her privacy, by not looking away.  I felt bad.  I learned my lesson.  Freedom isn't just the freedom to get your tits out when you want to, but also the freedom not to be ogled when you do.  People have to give each other that freedom, and that comes from mutual respect.		In a country like that, where that level of mutual respect is taken for granted, it might be possible that civil servants will rise in the ranks, politically.  Denmark is also notable for having the best-educated population in the world.  Denmark is also notable for having the happiest population in the world.		I would love to live there.  I would leave my guns in America, and go, if I could get a job there.		But Denmark is not America, and Danes are nothing like Americans.  They are a racially-monochrome and geographically isolated population.  If you want to find a history of socially-accepted violence among Danes, you have to go back many hundreds of years.		You can't look at what works for another country and think you can make day/night changes in our country just by having the laws they have.  Freedom in the US is political freedom-- but there is very little social freedom.  Freedom in Denmark is social freedom, even if there is less political freedom.		What we are talking about, here, is a careful management of cultural attitudes that will take hundreds of years to be successful.  Once the culture has changed, that new culture will necessarily and easily change its laws.		That's why I'm in this debate with you.  I hope you can succeed in changing our culture.  A Danish America would be a lovely place to live, if we could manage it.  But first, you have to change our people and how we regard each other and what we value.  Right now, we value money and racial and gender dominance over anything else.  Those are the prizes we fight over, every day, year after year.  Danes don't fight about these things.  They just try to make a nice life for themselves and their countrymen.		I'm all for that.  But so long as there are people sneaking guns into this country, so long as there are people trying to take control of our government through the power of money rather than popular support, so long as police shoot dogs and black people for no reason, so long as our military fights all over the world to support corporate interests, so long as we, as a country, can agree that a certain number of lives are worth a certain amount of money, I will need and want to keep my guns.","depth":34,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cllxcdw","parent_id":"t1_cllx1rw","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414478929,"created_utc":1414475329}

I am not saying whether the US system or the UK system is better, they are different.  There are different histories in the 2 places.  What works here would not necessarily work there and vis versa.		Most countries never had a right to bear arms.  In a place where there are hardly any guns a single gun can be much more dangerous if it were to fall into the wrong hands.  Most of the standard arguments against gun control in the US do not apply in a country where there is not already a supply of weapons in circulation.  The best argument against banning guns in the US is it would not take them out of the hands of criminals, only law abiding citizens and that would cause an increase in crime.  In the UK there are not very many guns in circulation so keeping them out of the hands of criminals is mostly possible but it does mean they make certain sacrifices.  		You cannot look at the entire world from the view of the US constitution.  We have rights that are not present everywhere, and for the most part this is a very good thing for us.  But what works for us in the US won't work everywhere.

If suddenly guns were readily available in the UK I suspect violent crime would increase, ironicly you would see a similar increase in the US if guns were banned tomorrow.

But the *assumption* is that he is doing so improperly. Again, guilt is assumed. This is not ordinary in most laws. There are plenty of other procedures that can occur to ensure he does so without resulting to such measures as a surprise inspection. 		As for "clarification", the same thing happens in any country that operates under common law. Clarifications are laws themselves, regardless of whether or not they are clarifying something previously on the books. As far as the law is concerned, they are new laws.		I see no problem in the police obtaining a warrant to search these owners homes because at the very least it would provide cause beyond the fact that they simply fall under a category based on the fact they own a gun. It is not assumed that a driver cannot drive after they receive a license, for example. Again, the party in question is assumed guilty, this is a problem.		As for your last point, aside from the idea that I believe entering such an agreement may not be inherently virtuous given that you are not really given a choice, the key point you said is "scheduled".

Again, I dont think this is a fair comparison. In your example, you can completely refuse entry until a warrant is issued. In the case regarding the gun owners, they should be presumed to have followed the law unless it can be proven otherwise. Just like getting a warrant in the previous example. There are other measures that are not as infringing that can accomplish the same task without being intrusive.

{"body":"You really should stop being an asshole and making fun of people you disagree with. It's disrespectful and childish.		I am not from the South, but just because you're not from a place and/or disagree with the way they do things, doesn't mean you should act like an immature little kid about it.		Remember that when cops show up at your door and they suspect something or hear something (such as yelling/screaming) they can barge in and make your life miserable. Remember that when they show up at your door, maybe their intention is only to do a simple security check but it can escalate from there. Once they barge in the room, the gun-owner has to protect his house from what he thinks are armed-rapists or armed-gangsters. If the cops fail to announce "We are the police!!" then the owner may have to shoot. If the cops do announce "we are the police", what if the homeowner thinks they are lying? Because gangsters, burglars, rapists, murderers can all lie. It could be a bloodbath. Hence the danger of "unannounced visits".		Since you don't own guns or anything, you don't care about such nuanced issues. You may even brush it off as "well he shouldn't have bought guns; he got what he deserved", but that would make you an immoral disgusting person. So what is the real reasoning behind why you can't think at a higher level and consider different scenarios?

I don't think anyone argues for a complete prohibition on firearms, and the utility arguments are preserved even if heavily regulated.

{"body":"Many redditors, being American, have difficulty understanding why/how Europeans view their gun-culture frightening/appalling/ridiculous. They have grown up with this idea of freedom of being armed to protect one self since they were children, as there is much violence and not being able to protect one self is makes one a vounerable target. Though largely depending on where you grew up, in general only a minority of Europeans grow up with the concept of having to arm yourself against criminals. People have a higher trust in the police, and they experience far less gun-related crime, as having a gun in society is unusual unless you're in law enforcement, or have strong connections to the military. The Europeans who grow up with the concept mentioned formerly, do so however not because of crime, but often because they live in the more wild parts of Europe (fx. Svalbard), where wildlife can be a serious threat. The point however is, that most Europeans have never seen any need to own a gun, as a combination of relatively low crime, and higher trust in authorities. Therefore, when they look at America struggeling with rampant gun-related crime, while desperatly clinging on to their right to be armed, they find it odd. For them, the gun makes crime easier, and is a far too powerful and potentially dangerous tool to be let into the hands of any citizen. To put it this way: While many people might not be crazy, and are able to hold a responsible and secure attitude towards their weapons, there's also a considerable amount who are either unstable, irratic, irresponsible, immature, violent, mentally unstable, or a mixture of several of those. While a minority, they cause a far larger danger when they can get hold of a weapon with the potential power to kill dozens of people within a short time. Essentially, many Europeans don't consider the freedom to easily arm yourself "worth it", considering the myriad of issues and dangers that arrise with it. Many Americans might point out a lack of immigrants, or smaller numbers to be the reasons of lower crime in Europe, but that's not true - Denmark fx. has a high number of burglaries, and a considerable amount of immigrants (as does Sweden), but you'd be hard pressed to find a single Dane who'd consider more liberal laws relating to guns a good idea. To get back on topic, the main reason why Reddit takes a sharp right-turn regarding guns is because that while many political ideas typically placed in the left wing (universal healthcare, free education, paid parental leave) is more easy to see the benifit of in society, the right to arm oneself is ingrained itself into the American identity, caused by and effecting the large amount of violent crime (fight fire with fire). Europeans grow up under different circumstances, and it's a completely different viewpoint of guns they grow up with than americans, seeing guns as unessecary when regarding the protection of one self, and thereby don't see strict laws regarding it as a threat to their freedom.		**TL;DR:** The circumstances of where you are born, and in what society you grew up in/live in makes an enormous difference.","depth":2,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"N7Crazy","name":"t1_clkatrh","parent_id":"t1_clk5z0u","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414347494,"created_utc":1414343894}

{"body":"I find it suspicious that the entire "militia" clause of that sentence is held to be completely inoperative, to my knowledge. As if the amendment read "Militias are cool. Oh, in unrelated news, every American can own and use any gun they want at any time." The clause in that amendment is an example of a nominative absolute phrase. Another example is "*The weather being rainy*, we decided to postpone the trip." You can't tell me that they didn't mean anything by *well-regulated militia*. In fact, an earlier form of the amendment read "A well regulated militia, **composed of the body of the people**, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person." Suggesting it's a collective right, not an individual right.		Also, the second amendment only applies to the states ironically because of the doctrine of Incorporation of the Bill of Rights through the 14th amendment. A liberal set of Supreme Court decisions that conservatives, to this day, hate and would like to overturn. It's part of what's led to objectionable decisions on abortion and school prayer for conservatives. For most of our history, the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. So California would be 100% able to restrict gun rights in any way they saw fit, as long as it didn't interfere with their constitution, as judged by their highest appeals court.

{"body":"I'm afraid I can't agree with you. I feel that d.c. v. Heller sums the entire thing up rather well.  		In more modern english it would have been phrased closer to 'As a well regulated militia is required for the defense of the nation, the people, from which any such militia must draw, shall not have their right to bear arms infringed.'		Given the historical context, particularly the explicit descriptions given by those that wrote it, it's not academically honest to claim they intended the right to apply only collectively or to the states.		It is, though, a subject of debate brought often before the courts.		I'd argue that the more interesting question would be 'how could the second amendment be altered to better reflect the concerns of the modern age?'  More so than most amendments, it does not fit as nicely into a modern context.

{"body":">  A militia, however, is formed of non-government forces, and is not funded by the government. The ability to form a militia was the intent of the second amendment. A militia without arms is fairly useless.		Sure of that? Read about the Militia Acts of 1792. They were used to suppress Shays' Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion. George Washington himself rode at the head of the state militias to crush a rebellion that was opposing an unfairly distributed federal tax that was foisted on them without local representation. The Acts themselves, among other things, decreed that every able-bodied white male was to provide himself with a gun and equipment and report for duty, essentially. The Revolution was fought with "militias", and many people, like Washington, had low opinions of the "citizen" militias vs well-regulated state militias. The citizen militias were disorganized and would often just turn tail and run.		> The rights of the many is nonexistent without the right of the individual. If each individual doesn't have the right to protest, then how does assembling suddenly become legal? How many constitutes an "assembly"? That hole in your argument is so blindingly glaring I'm surprised you typed it out.		Protesting can mean many things and take many forms of expression. You're trying to conflate two types. The individual has a free speech right, listed earlier. If it weren't specifically mentioned, they arguably wouldn't have a right to assemble. The government frequently finds assembly to be irritating for one reason or another. Could be the attention it draws to an uncomfortable issue (Civil Rights), or it could be traffic congestion. In naming "assembly" as a right, it specifically gives you a right to coordinate and stand together in close proximity with people for a common cause in mind, among other things, which is not an exercise of speech itself (though it may involve exercises of speech). The law frowns on certain types of assemblies, like those involved in a conspiracy.		Even if I took this part of your post seriously, the abstraction of a "group" provides distinctions between actions undertaken as a group and actions undertaken as individuals. For example, maybe if only religious groups had a right to assembly, you could assemble somewhere for a prayer vigil. But that same group of people likely does not have the right to assemble for a gun show after the vigil, if that gun show was not organized as part of the worship. It would take a court to decide whether it was a valid "religious" assembly then. Just by being in a group, you don't gain the power of that group as an individual. The group has to be legally constituted somehow and possess some kind of governing body that sets the institution's agenda. Then, in connection with that agenda, the people in that group could assemble.		Oh, and an "assembly" undeniably consists of at least two people, if not more. The point is that there's a right in the Constitution which can only be exercised as a group, contrary to what you were saying. The protection of the press is also a "group" right. Even by the standards today, it's been ruled that amateur bloggers aren't journalists and don't receive journalistic protections. The press is something altogether different from an individual talking about the news or telling people about it.		And look at all the restrictions on the right to peaceably assemble. Permits, fire codes/inspections, fees, proper time/manner/place scheduling, etc. etc. All because things get a little chaotic and maybe even dangerous if people are allowed to assemble willy-nilly. Gee, I wonder what would happen if people were as passionate about spontaneous bake sales as they were about guns.		>  Nor does the word "Human" appear naturally on any human. It's merely a descriptive name for a series of constitutional amendments that limit the government's ability to control the populace, namely in prevention of tyranny.		That's your chosen way of construing it. Those rights were all implicitly understood to only refer to white, heterosexual, (usually) Protestant males, at the pleasure of their state governments. The second amendment, as far as the law is concerned, exists apart from all the others (broadly speaking). The 1st, and the 21st. Any argument you can make about it is only valid if it would make sense if the amendment existed in isolation. You can argue about historical interpretation by its contemporaries at passage, but conservative legal philosophy would say that you reject the legislative record, as it's often manipulated to try to color the meaning of a law in a certain way that would not survive a voting process. Only the exact letter of a law can be considered. And if you did consider the record, it would show that in addition to "well-regulated militia", it used to say "composed of the body of the people".		>  As has been said before, there are countless examples of where historians, English Majors, and the laws of this land have supported my belief. There are exactly none that support your argument.		It's not even clear what you're talking about here. What's your belief? About the second amendment in general, or the Bill of Rights? And you're kind of begging the question by saying "the laws of the land have supported my belief about the laws of the land". Unfortunately, the only people who matter on this point are judges. And as we've seen before, virtually any interpretation can be constructed to withstand scrutiny. If Republican presidential aspirations remain as dismal as they have been lately, we'll see another swing to the left as people like Scalia, Kennedy, and maybe even Thomas retire or die.		> I don't know who these "conservatives" are, but I have never heard this ever be the case in my life.

Obviously the five conservative Supreme Court justices, though with roles for others on lower courts as well...

And now you're modifying your own thesis on the fly, turning "openly carrying firearms in public places" into "carry weapons literally anywhere". These two things are not equivalent.		But in case you want to know my position on allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns in restaurants and schools -- I think there is nothing wrong with that. The law-abiding citizens aren't the ones who you should be scared of. A mass murderer will clearly disregard any law that forbids him to carry a firearm into such a place, no matter how severe a punishment for breaking that law is. In fact, a place like that is EXACTLY the place he or she will want to go to, since the chances to encounter effective resistance are much less there, allowing the murderer to kill a lot more people.

And you can't protect your kids from other parents who are louse with their guns which can lead to your kids beeing endangered by their kids.		That is something YOU can't keep them safe from, and therefor I personally would argue, that stuff like backgroundnchecks etc. are necessary, and MAYBE even checking if the guns are stored properly, not with no knockraids or whatever, but the police just checking if your gun is store properly wouldn't hurt no?

{"body":"Yeah. I don't have a problem with it. I've had a check once and the guys were nice. Made sure they were in the safe and the safe was sturdy. 		The cops here are pretty reasonable about the laws if you're reasonable too. They're super helpful throughout the licensing process, and rego is totally painless. 		I made a pretty big mistake once, I moved house in a rush once and it had skipped my mind to change my registration for where they were held - my license address was different. I went in about a year late and they didn't mind, as long as you're upfront with them and being responsible it's not as issue. 		What is an issue is people being irresponsible; unsecured firearms or ammo is bloody dangerous and I've seen plenty of people do it... Don't mind if the cops knock on their door to take a peek. A lot of the time you'll get a warning if it's unintentional or not too bad, but it sucks seeing people flaunt the rules when you've got something that dangerous lying around.  		edit:		Thought this comment would concern some of the US contingent. See, there's a prime difference here. In Australia we don't cream ourselves over an outdated constitution. There's nothing sacred in our laws - which can cause problems - but also means we can move on from the past and realise when things aren't relevant anymore.		When I want to own a firearm, that's not a right - it's a privilege, and it comes with responsibility. If I go through the process of getting my license, I'm essentially entering a social contract. You can do this - as long as you're responsible and don't put other people in danger. My rights don't shit on other people's. And look: it works. It's no different to driving and owning a car. If I drive a car like an idiot, I can get my license taken away. If it's not roadworthy, I can get it defected. Social contract.		I bought my rifles to shoot pests and do a bit of target practice when I lived in the hills - not because I consider it my god-given right, not because I consider myself a bastion of civil liberties. It's a dangerous tool, and that's it. If a policemen knocks on my door, I don't give a shit. Come in and have a look. I'm doing right by you and the rest of society, you do right by me. Heck, I'll make them a drink and ask about what's happening in the local community. 		Have I been shit on by the cops before? Sure. And they were polite while doing it, they regretted the situation, I understood what was happening, and it all went down without an incident. I don't get this mentality that every interaction has to be adversarial. You're people; don't be rude. The amount of times I've had interactions with the police where perhaps I should have been in trouble and I wasn't because they're reasonable, decent people - well, that's just about every interaction I've had with them.

If I walked down the street wielding a kitchen knife, waving it around, you can be certain the cops would take an interest. 		A kitchen knife is rarely inherently deadly enough to kill without intent. A loaded firearm is, and it happens. If I have a loaded firearm in my house and my kid finds it an unloads it, that's on me. 		The social contract here is that 99% of people in this country have no reason to own a firearm. I don't have a reason anymore. They are not for defence. They are a tool, and a dangerous one. I used to use them for pest control. Now I'm lucky if I go target shooting a couple of times a year. So if you want one, you submit to certain conditions.		The social contract is the fact that your rights don't shit on other peoples. Unlike the US, where I've spent plenty of time, we do not want people walking the streets with weapons. The concept of concealed carry (moreso than open carry, which fucking horrifies me as well) is so out there in this country... and the thought alone makes me look over my shoulder in goddamn fear. The social contract is that I agree not to fuck with anyone else, or impose myself on anyone else, and they pay me the same respect.		If I want the privilege to own a firearm, I submit to certain conditions. Those conditions are there to make sure I don't fuck with anyone else's rights - to life, safety, etc.		They are:		- Training, so I can handle it properly, know the risks and dangers of it, know the capabilities of them, know how to resolve problems with it.		- The cool down period (3-6 months between licensing and owning a firearm), because the vast majority of gun murders prior to strict laws were a spurned lover or heated arguments which resulted in someone buying a firearm that day, coming back and shooting the other person. And look, our murder rates dropped significantly.		- Safe storage, because having loose firearms is not a good idea.		For us, firearms aren't a case of civil liberties, they're a privilege. I don't call that getting fucked over, I call it being responsible and not being a firearm-burdened society like the US. Fuck your open carry, fuck your school shootings, fuck your entitledness.

I get stressed because my sister and nephew live in the US and she's had a weapon pulled on her (in a restaurant of all places!) which is a pretty worrying thing to happen!		I agree that fear mongering is a load of bollocks and plenty of shitty laws and infringements make it through that way - tonnes of that happening here now with the terrorism laws being introduced, online monitoring, metadata retention etc and people are totally rolling over on that count.		But I think we just view firearms differently. There's a cultural and historical background to it in the US - whereas we don't really have that here (of course, it was legal in the past, but there's not the same attachment to it as the vast majority of us are urban dwellers without much use for them). 		Like I said, here it's viewed as no different to driving a car. If you're going to get a license there, you have to expect you'll periodically be pulled over and your car will be checked or you'll be breathalysed to make sure you're doing the right thing. That's the expectation and you submit to that, because if you go around drink driving and 'causing trouble then you're putting other people in danger - it's the same thing. I would argue of course that cars are more dangerous than firearms - statistically, they are - but I don't have to pick one or the other issue. 		As for stats regarding the effect of Australian gun control, it is debated. There is a [decent article here](http://theconversation.com/faking-waves-how-the-nra-and-pro-gun-americans-abuse-australian-crime-stats-11678) regarding the manipulation of stats to make Australian gun control look ineffective - more importantly though, there has been a pretty significant reduction in suicide and homicides using firearms, and our general homicide rate has been dropping for a long time. There has also not been one mass shooting in the country since the laws were implemented. Again, it's debatable what effect the laws have on the overall stats of crime, but certainly firearm use has dropped, and when it comes to something like homicide or suicide on an impulse, a gun is about the most effective, sudden way to do that - so there are a lot of arguments that taking that option out of people's hands, giving them more time to think etc, lowers the chances of those things happening.

{"body":"Nah all good man. I know it's a polarising thing - I don't think I've ever been in a discussion (not just on Reddit) about firearm control between the Australian way / American way where anyone changed their minds.		I remember I was at a gun range in Orlando and the owner told me how someone could walk in with a clean police record and walk out with a concealed carry license 40 minutes later. I told him to get my license for a bolt action rifle (semi-autos are harder to get, and handguns are nearly impossible unless you're regularly competing) it took me 9 months, and we were both wildly against the injustice of each other's situation haha. Completely opposite.		Both sides usually walk away shaking their heads at the other side haha. That's fine; I think there are valid points to be had either way. And I know it's probably impossible to change the US view because it's so enshrined in history and the consciousness there, and the prevalence of firearms change the equation quite a lot.		Whereas here, we don't mind not having it as an enshrined right and don't consider it trampling on our rights because for the vast majority of people, firearms don't take up much of their thoughts at all. Our 'historical heroes' weren't revolutionaries shaking off the oppressors, they were criminals like Ned Kelly and all that... who shot up a bunch of cops and ending up dying in a hail of gunfire. They're still revered in some circles, but the context is a bit different, you know? The ideas and I suppose culture behind it all are different.		When they introduced licensing and banned certain things, there was a kerfuffle but the majority didn't own them so it wasn't a huge issue - most people prefer to walk around knowing there aren't many guns on the street, and since there haven't been any big incidents since (still a shooting here and there, but no mass shooting or anything), they're happy with that. 		They had a grace period when the laws were instituted, allowing people to hand in illegal firearms. In fact, you can actually do that now - call up a police station and hand in an unregistered firearm, or an illegal one, and they'll take it off you without any charges or issues, even years and years after the laws. I guess that's what I mean by social contract in this case... if you're up front about it and you're not seeking to screw with other people, you won't get in trouble. Hopefully not anyway.

{"body":">First off, just want you to know it's not me downvoting you. 		I appreciate that. It's funny to see how downvotes are supposed to be used when someone is not "contributing to a discussion" but, in actuality, the downvote option just gets used to hide contrary opinions.		>You say that Christopher Dorner and Eric Frein caused chaos, and now you're saying that after a week or two life will go on as normal?		Yes, the reason life will go on as usual is that, in both cases, it's only one criminal who is causing chaos. The people are not on their side. Frein will either die in a shootout with police or will be captured and put before a jury of his peers and brought to justice. Both Dorner and Frein were acting out personal vendettas. They are individual aberrations, whereas the vast majority of Americans see no reason to commit the kind of violence that they have perpetrated. Like Dorner, Frein is a temporary problem that will soon go away because he does not reflect the will of the people.		The way that they have shut down life in their respective regions, though, is the reason that I brought them up as examples. If one man who likes camping outdoors can kill one police officer and bring his part of Pennsylvania into a state of siege, with police officers on edge everywhere in that area, one can only imagine the kind of chaos that would ensue if a large enough number of Americans felt that their rights had been trampled so severely that they would decide to do the same. One criminal going on a shooting spree will not change the status quo. Life will always go back to normal. If the people see their freedoms under such a great and imminent threat by the government that a mass uprising occurs, however, then life will not go back to normal soon and that government will be under a very real threat of losing its grip on power.		If police officers across California were nervous about Dorner, so nervous that they even opened fire on some civilians by accident, imagine the kind of panic that a well-organized revolt would set off. I can only imagine that police officers would quit en masse, preferring to go home to take care of their property and families instead of getting killed for an unpopular government, and that there would be mass desertions and defections from the military (especially if the government deployed it within the United States). My conclusion is that firearms ownership breaks the government's monopoly on force and keeps the balance of power between the people and their authorities on a much more equitable level. Throughout history, people have fared very poorly when they have been at the complete mercy of their government. Besides, in the U.S., the police are only tasked with upholding the law and are not necessarily obligated to protect citizens or their property in times of civil unrest, so if looters are smashing into your home after a hurricane devastated your state, calling 911 will not always be a good last resort.		>I'm not sure anything massive enough to incite a mass gun-toting uprising would ever happen as democratic governments tend to be inherently stable and slow-moving. 		I understand this sentiment, but it's easy to become complacent when living in a developed, democratic country. I hate to invoke Godwin's Law here, but Germany fell under fascist rule through a democratic election process. In the German presidential election of 1932, Hitler received about 37% of the vote and it was through elections that the NSDAP amassed a significant number of representatives in the German legislature.		To be honest, I can't think of a "flash point" issue, aside from the right to keep and bear arms itself, that could push the people in the United States today to a large-scale, violent reaction (edit:  *Well, maybe if the government slaughtered a bunch of peaceful protestors Syrian-style, but that's unlikely to happen*), although times change and perhaps, decades from now, some other issue---probably economic in nature---will emerge and cause a major disturbance within the country. In the meantime, I cling to my ownership of firearms for more practical reasons than fighting hypothetical tyranny:  I can defend myself, those around me, and my property from criminals and, if the rule of law ever breaks down temporarily for whichever reason (especially a natural disaster like a hurricane, which my state is stereotypically prone to have), I can enjoy the peace of mind that I will not be left completely vulnerable to a physical assault or theft by opportunistic thugs.		>the last time the US had a massed armed uprising?		There was the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921 in West Virginia, which was fought between coal miners in favor of unionization on one side and, on the other, strikebreakers supported by the military and police. The uprising failed but the violence generated enough awareness to strengthen the labor movement.		And I wouldn't call this a mass uprising, but the standoff at Wounded Knee in 1973 could also be an interesting subject to look into here.		The major difference between the U.S. and U.K. here is the fact that, in the former, firearms ownership is a right and, in the latter, it's considered a privilege. That's why some of the pro-gun American redditors here and the British redditors will never find common ground. It's probably difficult to see American firearms ownership as a normal thing if firearms are not part of your culture.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. The US tax system is needlessly complicated because companies like Intuit lobby to continue making taxes difficult so that people will use their software/accountants. I don't see why being part of a shitty system is somehow a good or adult thing.		>I have to consider the fact that if I break something playing the sports I love I may end up with a hefty bill from hospital fees.		Again, being stuck in a shitty system does not an adult make. The US healthcare system, as it exists now, was largely a product of history and chance. I would say it actually makes you less of an adult, as you have very little say in what insurance you buy (or at least you had very little say). Your employer pays you insurance, and they will pick the insurance that is offered to you. It's also a highly inefficient system that lacks buying power, so you and everyone else in that policy are being screwed by the hospitals and pharma companies, as these can get more money at the bargaining table from thousands of tiny insurance companies, relative to say the NHS or Australia's Medicare.		I also don't see why it's good to be slugged with tens of thousands in medical bills because you have cancer and your insurance doesn't fully cover every treatment, but if it makes you feel like more of an adult you go for it.		>I have to think about the fact that if my life doesn't go as planned the social safety nets with regards to my income are no where near as strong as they are back home and they would be harder for me to survive on.		There are very few people who regularly use the social safety net that would survive if it didn't exist (that is, there are very few dole bludgers). The purpose of the social safety net is that it is there to protect you in the case that something unavoidably horrible happens. Become injured and unable to work at the ripe old age of 31? In a recession and you're downsized? You can get insurance for these things in the US, but dozens of individual private insurers are again less efficient than one big one that has everyone covered.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"stjep","name":"t1_clk93b2","parent_id":"t1_clk80cm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414344093,"created_utc":1414340493}

The gun owner can still say no and the police don't have any power to enter the home.		So what you're getting angry about is the police having less paperwork. That's all thats changed. In fact it's no different to american laws on the matter.

This increased right of the authorities to conduct inspections was enacted in 2009 in response to the Winnenden school shooting, and much has been said about the interpretation of this right.	> 	> It appears that the authorities may only inspect for compliance with weapons-storage regulations but not conduct any other searches.[57]  If the weapon is outside of its container and the owner claims to have been cleaning the weapon, the authorities will have to evaluate this claim.[58]  It also appears that a homeowner has the right to refuse entry to the authorities if he or she has a good reason.  A homeowner who frequently refuses entry, however, may be violating the statutory duty to cooperate with the authorities on the safe storage of weapons,[59] which may lead to revocation of the license.  The far-reaching inspection rights of the authorities aim to ensure that gun owners will have an incentive to keep their guns locked up.[60]	> 	> Special safe-storage rules are also in effect for inherited firearms.

Turns out his house was a drug den so the police got to bust that up while also finding the murderers who were apart of another biker gang who also got a very close look into.

They can't record a recital and then post on their private page for family to watch or anything like that. 		Took my daughter swimming in the UK at a public pool and was told I couldn't take a picture of her because it could capture other kids in the pool. I am not making a judgement call here, but I would point out there isn't really a problem with pedophiles looking at pictures of kids in public vs actual child porn. I just don't know who these laws are supposed to thwart, or what bad thing is being prevented by having them.

{"body":"> The real estate bubble will most likely cause significantly less problems for this planet than the one that was created by the US.		It will however cause more problems for China. 65,000,000+ vacant homes and apartments. Many of which are owned by middle class people as an investment they sank almost everything into because they think they will eventually be able to sell higher... the problem with that is all the people moving into the cities are poor as fuck and couldn't even begin to dream of paying for a 600,000 dollar house/apartment in their lifetime.		The Chinese property situation is a house of cards, and they keep adding more and more too it in the name of unsustainable growth.		> The middle class at this point is more satisfied with its government than the US middle class with theirs.		Think that might have anything to do with the ridiculous level of control the government has on the media over there? Its also going to be changing in the coming years.		> unfortunately they allowed religion to prosper once again because of democratic pressure.		Its really not that simple. There are always going to be people who try to go against the ideological grain. You put to much pressure on a huge group of people to follow one ideology and you are going to cause an eventual spontaneous rejection by a large portion of the population. Europe saw that with the reformation, and China has seen flashes of that in the past as well. This current surge of cults is one of them. The answer is not to suppress all religion. It is to have an open society that encourages or is at least okay with multiple legitimate ideologies (like in the US) so that religious people are not forced underground and forced to extremism. Merging a religious faith and the government is also a solution, but its to late for that.		> One reason China was able to deal with these things and develop to the point is at now is precisely because it was not democratic.

You see the paragraph below - I'm loathe to quote Paul Dacre - but the idea of "bringing as privacy law through the back door" is a bad thing to many of us over here.		Because when you actually look into it and consider what a privacy law actually means, it's a lot more complicated than just trying to score points on an internet forum by claiming you are better because you have privacy laws.		> If you go into my room with a camera, I can sue you; if the government does, I'm shit out of luck.

Uh, this software exists for all of the mentioned devices. Granted, it isn't as one-time-setup as on the ISP level, but it's something.

Well for starters, their security agency already has this access (Snowden 2013), and second, the law goes for ISPs just as it does for anyone else. If there is a law that obligates or forbids ISPs to do something, it is so. ISPs are already required to store metadata logs for at least 6 months, possibly even longer. This data is easily accessible by relevant agencies, and the relevant agencies can use this data to determine those who break the law.

{"body":"> Then why the law proposal for it to be, you know, mandatory?		Because that's what one minister in government wants. What parliament and the house of lords wants may well be totally different, but there is nothing incorrect in what I said - it is not mandatory as things stand.		> Uh, this software exists for all of the mentioned devices. Granted, it isn't as one-time-setup as on the ISP level, but it's something. You can also just install a filter to your router to do exactly the same. 		It's fairly obviously that device-based filters are even worse than network-based ones - because no one knows how to reset phones/tablets, uninstall software, use a live CD on a computer. Network-based filters are by no means infallible, but it does at least require a bit more skill.		> That, and ISPs can also do it already. They just don't offer it as prominently, but ISPs most certainly have optional parental control packages. 		Indeed, and this is what the government wants. They want the ISPs to offer the option - and that's what some ISPs have done. You sign up, you get the choice of having controls or not. It's not strictly opt out or opt in, it's "you have to decide".		> Well for starters, their security agency already has this access (Snowden 2013),		The Snowden leaks predate these ISP filters so I'm not sure where you got that from. 		> and second, the law goes for ISPs just as it does for anyone else. If there is a law that obligates or forbids ISPs to do something, it is so. ISPs are already required to store metadata logs for at least 6 months, possibly even longer. This data is easily accessible by relevant agencies, and the relevant agencies can use this data to determine those who break the law. 		What data? GCHQ and friends can already DPI if they care about browsing histories - these filters are perhaps the worst way to obtain data if they really wanted it. Is the paranoia setting in again?		> Oh, and someone else posted something about a guy making offensive statements on twitter and having the police on his doorstep.

{"body":"Sigh, this is why I said the phrasing was tricky.		Since I see you've misinterpreted my definition, I'll be more explicit about the parts I left out, what's common sense in one place, apparently isn't in another.		A slightly more detailed definition of due process: to receive a *fair* trial (by my definition of fair, see below) with the same procedures and rights as anyone else would receive.		This applies to Guantanamo, because they may have received a trial as a normal person would receive in the US, or if they were in Cuba or if they were in the country they are from.		Do you not remember that initially the US government considered Guantanamo to be outside of the US jurisdiction, even to the point that **the Geneva conventions didn't apply?** It took a supreme court decision 4 years later to overturn that idea.		The moment a government decides to house prisoners in a place where they can believe they don't have to abide by Geneva conventions, it's fairly naive to even suggest they're receiving due process.		About plea bargains.		They're horrible, they're a fucking disgrace.		First of all, let's stop with any discussions about courts being overburdened, since **a citizen accused of a crime should not be punished for the court system being underfunded**. Remember the notion of being "innocent until proven guilty"? If the court is unable to have a proper trial, then let the defendant go. Simple as that. Again: it's not the defendant's problem that the court system doesn't have enough budget.		About plea bargains themselves: they're forcing a defendant to gamble with their future. They're reducing a genuine search for the truth to game theory with incredibly high stakes *for one party*.		Imagine this: hypothetically, you are accused (but innocent) of a crime for which the *max* penalty is 35 years.Not because it's a big crime, but due to the DA accruing 11 separate counts of a crime with a shorter max sentence. There is some circumstantial evidence, but nothing direct (since you're innocent).		The DA offers you a deal: "only" do 6 months of jail time after which you will be a felon. If you say no to the deal, the DA will be upset and said she'll go after you in court for the full 35 years.		Do you know whether she'll actually do that: pursue those 35 years in court? It sounds unlikely, but what are the actual odds of this? Can you gamble with this?		If it does go to court, how big are the odds you'll be found innocent? Do you have enough money for a good lawyer for a full trial? If the DA drops the demand from 35 to 10 years, will that make her seem lenient? It will mean a decade in jail, which means your life is basically over. But 6 months is technically doable. Although, afterwards you'll be branded a felon, which in the fucked-up US means you'll never find a proper job again.		If someone has no idea whether his chance in court is 5% chance of being convicted or 40% of being convicted, while innocent, but *does* know that they can overcome 6 months in jail, while 10 years or longer means that their life will be fucked up for a very long time... how many of such innocent people will just take the plea, knowing that that is a 100% guarantee that they won't have to do more than half a year in jail?		Do you see how it's immoral to ask people to gamble with their futures? Do you see how plea bargains are preventing people, including innocent people their honest day in court?		I'm too tired to discuss jury selection with you, but the fact that jury selection is such a rigorous process only makes it worse. If a case goes to court, the DA will carefully pick-and-choose jurors that he expects will be helpful in convicting the defendant. The defendant needs a pricy lawyer to help him with that task, to merely balance the scales. If the defendant is poor, meaning he has a shitty pro bono lawyer, he'll have a distinct disadvantage before the trial even started. This manipulative pre-trial tug-of-war of jury slection has **nothing** to do with actual finding of truth. It's mainly there to waste time, money and to make sure that poor defendants have an even bigger disadvantage.		**tl;dr** the US "justice" system is a stinking pile of shit; maybe that's why the US has the [second-highest incarceration rate OF THE ENTIRE WORLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate)","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"TheRufmeisterGeneral","name":"t1_clkul07","parent_id":"t1_clkmeib","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414385318,"created_utc":1414381718}
{"body":">it's fairly naive to even suggest they're receiving due process.		Ah, so basically what you're getting at is that you're speculating.		No point arguing against that then. I could probably dig through my textbook which mentions Guantanamo and its process and then find what it sources... But I doubt that'd really matter to you. 		>First of all, let's stop with any discussions about courts being overburdened, since a citizen accused of a crime should not be punished for the court system being underfunded. Remember the notion of being "innocent until proven guilty"? If the court is unable to have a proper trial, then let the defendant go. Simple as that.		No, let's not stop just because it's inconvenient for your argument... 		Now to begin, [the sixth amendment guarantees the right to a speedy trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_Trial_Clause). It's important courts do not keep someone waiting, as you can't just throw someone who is being charged with a crime onto the street. The general populace also has the right to know that alleged criminals are prosecuted, instead of just being released out into the street because it took too long. So you can't keep them incarcerated forever, and you can't just toss them out. I mean what kind of a justice system lets people charged with a crime go free without trial? That'd *completely* undermine the entire point! Law enforcement works through deterrence, and as soon as you give people an inch they take a mile. 		Unburdening the court system is very important in order to protect people's rights. 		Honestly your solution is a hell of a lot worse than whatever problems you could find with plea bargains. 		Your hypothetical for which was completely absurd by the way. 6 months on a maximum 35 year time? It's usually more like 5 years on a 20 year maximum crime. The plea bargain system could actually allow people to avoid being labeled a felon as you can drop the severity of the charge. Someone who IS guilty but repentant can actually take advantage of it and get a headstart, people who are cooperative can get a better result. And it also actually gives a SAFE option as opposed to gambling it on being found innocent. Try exploring the flip side of the coin before trying to tell me what's on it.		Also your example is even more erroneous because circumstantial evidence in a criminal trial, let alone a felony? Not to mention the "DA gets upset" nonsense? Do you get your information from TV dramas? 		You need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that someone is guilty in case of a felony charge. It's actually quite difficult. You have to get a unanimous decision from the jury. If the evidence were shoddy, of course they'll take it to court. They're practically guaranteed to win. 		And no, I don't see it as immoral as offering people the choice. There is zero punishment for not taking it, they simply move on in that case.		And man, now Jury selection. One second ago it was a problem with it being a bunch of random people, now the problem is it's carefully selected. Do you just hop onto whatever boat best attacks the system? How would you suggest it is done then? Should they not get to choose the jurors? Should it be done entirely by chance? Should they not even be allowed to have a jury of their peers? What, in your mind, makes it more fair? Because it's easy to highlight issues, it's much harder to go into why there is an obviously clearer solution. 		>maybe that's why the US has the second-highest incarceration rate OF THE ENTIRE WORLD		Alright let's first explain something. That's of the people that report the full numbers. Very important distinction. Unless you think North Korea's being earnest with its reports. 		Second, the issue in the US is largely a social problem, not a systemic problem. 10% of the US population is black, but roughly 50% of prisoners are. There's clearly some socioeconomic issues going on that lead to a disproportionately higher amount of black criminals and arrests. Most European countries don't have this issue on account of being almost entirely white. Although damn if they don't make a lot of noise about the small amount of immigrants they get that aren't. 		And finally, can you highlight the problem with people being rightfully incarcerated for breaking a law? Or are you trying to tell me that there is a significant enough number that are wrongly incarcerated?","depth":14,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"LukaCola","name":"t1_clkww9u","parent_id":"t1_clkul07","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414391514,"created_utc":1414387914}

Quoting wikipedia:		> Current and former detainees have reported abuse and torture, which the Bush administration denied. In a 2005 Amnesty International report, the facility was called the "Gulag of our times."[9] In 2006, the United Nations called unsuccessfully for the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to be closed.[10] In January 2009, Susan J. Crawford, appointed by Bush to review DoD practices used at Guantanamo Bay and oversee the military trials, became the first Bush administration official to concede that torture occurred at Guantanamo Bay on one detainee.[11]		Torture while awaiting trial is not in accordance with "due process".		More explanation is in: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp#Legal_issues		If your textbooks acknowledge the opinions of the bush administrations of the time and what the supreme court ruled about that, then that might satisfy you.		In the meantime: 		> In May 2007, Martin Scheinin, a United Nations rapporteur on rights in countering terrorism, released a preliminary report for the United Nations Human Rights Council. The report stated the United States violated international law, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that the Bush Administration could not try such prisoners as enemy combatants in a military tribunal and could not deny them access to the evidence used against them		>  Prisoners have been labeled "illegal" or "unlawful enemy combatants," but several observers such as the Center for Constitutional Rights and Human Rights Watch maintain that the United States has not held the Article 5 tribunals required by the Geneva Conventions.		> The International Committee of the Red Cross has stated that, "Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, [or] a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. There is no intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can fall outside the law." Thus, if the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, this would still grant them the rights of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as opposed to the more common Third Geneva Convention, which deals exclusively with prisoners of war. A U.S. court has rejected this argument, as it applies to detainees from al Qaeda.[57] Henry T. King, Jr., a prosecutor for the Nuremberg Trials, has argued that the type of tribunals at Guant??namo Bay "violates the Nuremberg principles" and that they are against "the spirit of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.		Or basically: the rest of the world called the US out on its bullshit, and the US said: "nuh-uh, I'm not listening".		Since I'm European, I'm more inclined to share the opinion of the UN and the Red Cross in that the prisoners at Guantanamo did not get proper due process.		About unburdening the courts: it's up to the state to make sure there is enough capacity for the courts. If the courts can't handle the workload: hire more people or even build more courts. **To punish a defendant more harshly because the state didn't provide enough capacity to the courts is immoral**. It's *the state's problem*, not the defendant's problem.		> Your hypothetical for which was completely absurd by the way. 6 months on a maximum 35 year time?

Not taking it has zero bearing on their case, hell, every now and then the jury gets them an equal or lighter sentence (the latter is problematic if it's a high profile case because then people who took the plea bargain will actually want a trial whereas before they were avoiding it, thinking they can get a lighter sentence. Oh yeah, you can do that by the way)		>Aaron Swartz link		Yes, and that case was *also* absurd. There's a reason it made news. It is of course the outlier. 		Also, why did you crop out the whole part about him not taking the bargain? If Aaron had lived in Europe and faced a similar situation, the same thing would have played out. He just would not have gotten the option of six months. 		Really, not sure why you chose this to highlight the issue of plea bargaining. It's like the least innocuous thing in that entire article.		I'd also appreciate it if you don't completely ignore my talking points about it. 		>Torture while awaiting trial is not in accordance with "due process".		Like I said, the issue with Guantanamo is primarily the lack of oversight which options up more potential for abuse.		Course, the US government is one that is reactionary.

Over 80 million American gun owners must have defective guns, since they'll never use them to kill a single person with them in their entire lives.

It says the metrics for counting alcohol related deaths in the US are fucked up after decades of pressure from groups like MADD. That US figure includes anyone killed in a crash in which at least one person (driver, pedestrian, cyclist, etc.) was estimated to have any alcohol. 		For example, if a sober driver recklessly crashes into and kills a family whose driver had enjoyed a glass of wine, statistics reflect all their deaths as "alcohol-related." In reality, the figure reflects a much broader spectrum of casualties: people under the legal limit, drunken pedestrians, impaired cyclists and others.

The result: a mere 773 DUI arrests. Roving police patrols caught 10 times more drunken drivers than the roadblocks.		They aren't effective and are a waste of taxpayer's money and should be discontinued for those reasons alone, long before questions of civil rights come into play.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WiseGuy1020","name":"t1_clka3d2","parent_id":"t1_clk9co7","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414346076,"created_utc":1414342476}

I'm sure if every time the Bobbies responded to a domestic violence call someone had a gun on them, they'd shoot a lot more people too. 		tl;dr -> It's a problem with America, not a problem with our police.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clk9ab3","parent_id":"t1_clk8kgm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414344508,"created_utc":1414340908}

People in the UK that own guns are a small minority, unlike people who own cars.

According to the US government figures, guns are used (again very conservative figures) at least a million times in self defense in the US per year (mostly not fired). If even a small fraction of those cases result in a saved life or a woman not getting raped it outweighs the harm done by a very few cases of mass shootings and such.		In any case, for me gun ownership is a matter of principle that the defense of ones life and family is an essential right and that to deny that right is to deny an individual's humanity and treat them as an interchangeable part of a machine, to be sacrificed as long as the "society" benefits according to some statistic.

Those types of assaults are carried out by what the NRA would call "modern sporting rifles" which is just a rebranding of what used to be known as assault rifles.

You're talking about the price of legally owned machine guns and then claiming that that is what keeps them from being used for crime. As I pointed out before, long guns of any type are rarely used in crime. If a criminal wanted to use a fully automatic rifle in a crime they would simply modify a legal semi-automatic rifle.

{"body":">92% supported universal background checks, but that was too much to ask of the tea-party controlled congress.		No, it was too much for people who know enough to know what "universal background checks" actually means. The suggestion that it's just common sense and that anyone who would even question it must be a nutter is why these conversations ***can not*** proceed.		Laws have a lot to do with *context*, and people ignorant of firearms are typically ignorant about firearms laws. "universal background checks" sounds nice, but practically speaking it's a significant departure from the rights and freedoms many enjoy. Someone whose exposure to firearms is limited to movies, TV, and video games doesn't appreciate what this phrase actually means.		Background checks are already universally required during any transaction between a licensed firearms dealer and a buyer -- including *many* transactions at the now infamous "gun shows". "Universal background checks" actually means the prohibition of person to person firearms sales. This probably doesn't mean much to you, but there is a vast culture and market based on the individual sales of firearms, including passing down firearms to family members and friends.		It takes little sacrifice from someone like you who this would not effect in the slightest, but it's disrespectful for you to assume that anyone who doesn't share your thoughts on the matter is allied with some mythological "tea-party controlled congress". You're ruining any chance of a meaningful conversation with that caricature.		>I consider things like background checks, no open carry, and handgun permits to not be against the constitution. 		Then you don't seem to be able to read. There is nothing ambiguous about the word "infringed", and these measures certainly infringe on one's abilities to bear arms, even if you and I think such infringements are reasonable. 		>I still support the constitution		You don't. If you did you would be asking for it to be amended and have the 2nd amendment superseded by further conditions. Instead you want to just throw it under the bus and pretend that the consitution is just a tradition or suggestion that can be meddled with. If you want to change it there is a process for that.		My biggest problem with suggested gun control laws is that it is a terrifying example of the people, once more, *begging* the government to break the law to make them safe. If the people want to change the law, that's one thing, but asking them to break it is another. Such irrationality can be see everywhere from our current, terrible, gun laws, to our current and terrible drug laws -- which have just about as little constitutional authority.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thingandstuff","name":"t1_cll7b16","parent_id":"t1_clkaay8","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414428850,"created_utc":1414425250}

{"body":"Perhaps if you'd read anything other than an elementary text book, you'd know more about your own history than somebody who lives on the other side of the world.  The original constitution contained a number of clauses that *very specifically* protected slavery.  Of course the word 'slave' wasn't used, even in 1787 most of the world was moving away from the slave trade (it was already abolished in a number of European countries) so it was worded carefully to avoid it.  But the phrase "importation of such persons" leaves little to the imagination, right?  The famous 3/5ths compromise officially laid out the status of slaves as citizens (ie, no rights, count as 3/5 of a person in the census), the importation clause "The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress..." protected the right to import more slaves, and finally "No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due" prohibited the free states from effectively freeing slaves from other states.  All pretty clear clauses protecting the right to own slaves, and preventing Congress from stopping it.		These were tested in the Supreme court in 1857 (Dred Scott vs Sandford), with the judgement ruling that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery under the constitution.  In other words, slavery is a right that Congress could not take away.  Other notable things from this ruling is that Americans of "African decent" can never be citizens as defined in the constitution.		Now, of course the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865, which once and for all abolished slavery in all forms.  And you are quite correct, it did require a 2/3rds majority (which was only *just* achieved) to pass.  Which was my point in the first place - all your 'irrevocable rights' are in fact, quite able to be revoked if there is sufficient will.

{"body":"As a British person, the actual wording of this legislation specifies the visits will only be made in the wake of a complaint or evidence/intelligence of a particular threat or risk of harm. 		So if a family called up that Uncle James, who owns a shotgun, was acting off lately, had been acting in a way people were worried about, police might pop over to his house and just make sure his guns and ammo are being stored separately (as is British law) and likely they'll generally have a talk with the gun owner and try to assess any issues which may need addressing. 		Or someone might phone up and say he was at his neighbours home and the guy was regularly leaving a loaded shotgun out, the police can go over and have a talk with him. 		It affects a tiny number of people and gun law in this country already makes it clear that getting and keeping your licence is heavily dependant on your safe storage and use of your guns and ammunition. (which by law you have to keep separate). 		Also, guns in the UK are not used for personal self defence. Those that use them usually have to be existing members of a shooting club, or often times have a specific need for the gun, typically vermin control on farms or large plots of land. Even the rich folks who go and shoot a deer every now and then are subject to the same rules and laws. 		SO, in this instance, 'without a warrant' is true but not true. They can't just turn up when they feel like it. There needs to be a specific concern about a persons guns, but the cop can go over straight away and check on things without waiting for a judge. 		As a Brit(admittedly one who doesn't own and never plans to own a gun) this doesn't bother me too much. 			ALSO, I can not stress enough, it's not a new law or anything. It's our 'gun culture'. We recognise guns as incredibly dangerous if misused. 		ALSO? This wont be some random copper. Most guns in this country are in relatively small communities. You get your certificate from your local police station, sometimes your gun as well.

{"body":"Step back and think for a minute. Logically, rapists, etc. aren't going to be a problem. Also, a weapons stockpile is meaningless. There are a lot of perfectly fine people with firearms. The *only* case where there *may* be the kind of a problem you're worried about is with an *actual* serial killer or mass murderer. The problem is, how do we know they are killers? We don't! Until they are convicted, they are to be presumed innocent. Cops are not guaranteed safety. They sign up for the job knowing the risks. I would rather 1,000 cops die at the hands of *a few* serial killers than even 1 innocent person die at the hands of overzealous cops operating on a crooked-ass procedure. In reality, the way things are now, there aren't that many serial killers and cops use their crooked ass shoot first and ask questions later tactics much more frequently on people not even suspected of being serial killers. They frequently break into the wrong house and kill abjectly innocent occupants because the occupants were understandably surprised and armed. The few times an innocent occupant has shot the cops in legitimate self defense and survived, their lives are turned upside down with legal hassles. So, in reality the way things currently are, you still have cops occasionally killed by innocent folks instead of serial killers and you have cops murdering innocent folks left and right. Also, I am still correct. Lets say a murderer kills a cop trying to arrest him for a previous murder. I am correct in saying that murder isn't any less a murderer. Stuff goes wrong either way. The procedure should be set up so that cops suffer, not innocent or presumed innocent non-cops.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SkullFuckUrBrainHole","name":"t1_cllejiy","parent_id":"t1_clkz144","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414441906,"created_utc":1414438306}

There is too much legal precedent that defines the 4th amendment as requiring a warrant.

The 2nd amendment, however, has always been open to interpretation (pray tell, what does the "a well-regulated militia" clause mean to the "right to bear arms?") but has never been construed, to my knowledge, to be open to a law "takin all are gunz."

{"body":"> A gunowner who believes the second amendment has been weakened by court rulings, probably isn't going to place their faith in the idea that the same won't happen in the 4th.		Well there's a big difference between the two. A lot of left-wing people don't think the second amendment is a "real right" and don't care if it gets deleted, and don't care what happens to people who exercise it. When's the last time you heard anyone say "I support the fourth amendment, *but...*"? When's the last time you ever even heard someone use such silly, waffling language like "I *believe* in the fourth amendment", like it's some sort of faith-based entity? They don't feel that way about the fourth so it'd be easier to rally support against any government attack on it. There's also more organizations who would fight it, and more Supreme Court justices who aren't going to be partisan hacks on the issue.		Also, depending on how the law is phrased, a lot of the reason gun control laws pass in this country is that typically the people who support gun control aren't gun owners, so they're basically supporting outrageous laws they would hate if they applied to *them*, but since they don't own guns they will never have to worry about it. They're supporting marginalizing a minority and don't care what laws pass.		It's the same reason we don't have mandatory breathalyzer interlocks on cars, but people want to force Smartgun technology on everyone: everyone drives a car, so everyone would have to deal with that pain in the ass technology, so they don't want it. But 60% of people don't own guns so they don't give a fuck what the other 40% thinks.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Frostiken","name":"t1_clk83if","parent_id":"t1_clk5rpd","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414341878,"created_utc":1414338278}

When you engage in commercial activity operating as a BUSINESS, and when you open said business to the PUBLIC, you invite additional scrutiny.  You have to obtain appropriate licenses, pay applicable taxes, conform to certain operating procedures like health codes, etc.		A HOUSE - Is not a commercial enterprise, and there are typically zoning laws prohibiting one from operating it as such.  Also, it is PRIVATE PROPERTY NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.		Therein lies the difference!  And basically, this whole thing is just another step in a long line of abusing the right of privacy in one's own home.  And why should any government agent in the UK care?

I think that the usual refrain in response to this is that, statistically, overall, the difference is negligible, but to her the difference was extremely important.

I don't think I've heard of numerous cases like that (the three men breaking into a house to rape a teenager), but I suppose I don't have any statistical knowledge on the subject.		>Its also fact US crime figures higher per head than in the UK, especially involving firearms.		Well, it's not saying much that US firearm crime is higher - of course it's higher, there are orders of magnitude more guns. But the rate of violent crime is quite less divergent, I believe. That's not to say that there isn't a difference. One argument that I've always found difficult to respond to is that it must be apparent that UK violent crime leads to death less often than US violent crime - i.e., less likely to kill someone with a knife than with a gun. That is almost certainly true. So the question of firearm ownership is really more of a trade off than a unilateral effect. The reason that there is so much disagreement is that we're talking about trading off fundamental values, which US and UK people don't necessarily value in the same way.		I just disagree that it can be boiled down so simply to problems with US culture.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DickWhiskey","name":"t1_clk9sma","parent_id":"t1_clk9enb","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414345486,"created_utc":1414341886}

That's fine, and them knowing what tools you have doesn't prevent you from using them.

All 30 break in attempts would be quantified as break ins, and his neighborhood would have police crawling around all day because he obviously lives in a super dangerous neighborhood. Actually I'd investigate him pretty closely too because there's some reason people keep breaking into his house. His suicide would be quantified differently, and I don't see what that has to do with the break ins. So in that case he defended himself 20 times, which would be quantified as 20 cases where guns helped him, and 1 time where it killed him. And if that scenario was the norm, then I don't think anybody would argue gun ownership. But nobody gets their house broken into 30 times and this has never happened in the history of man, so your scenario is bullshit.

{"body":">I have said we are 5 times less likely to die in the UK than the US,		And I never said that. I am talking about the violent crime victimization rate, which is to say, how likely are you to be the victim of any violent crime. You keep trying to make this about homicide alone, and I keep correcting you.		OK, I see a blog post with citations, so let's work from that. Unfortunately, we cannot use his conclusions, but the sources are useful.		(Why can't we use his conclusions? What's wrong with this sentence?		To this end, I have isolated robbery, burglary, homicide / murder,  knife crime, fatal shootings, rape of a female, grievous bodily harm / aggravated assault and theft of a vehicle in order to give us a fair idea of which country is more ???violent.??? 		See the overlaps? Also, burglary is not a violent crime, nor is car theft.)		Off to the addition:		US (2011)	15,265 persons were murdered in the United States (incl justifiable homicide).		Note: The UCR Program does not include the following situations in this offense classification:  deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; and attempts to murder or assaults to murder, which are scored as aggravated assaults.		[83,425 forcible rapes]  (Note: Rapes by force comprised 93.0 percent of reported rape offenses in 2011) So, I'll increase that number to account for non-forcible rapes, to bring it in line with the UK definition.		354,396 robberies		Note: defines robbery as the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear.		  751,131 aggravated assaults	 	Note: defines aggravated assault as an unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. When aggravated assault and larceny-theft occur together, the offense falls under the category of robbery.    				Let's add just those numbers together		1,209,504		Now, let's look at UK numbers: this note from the UK source:		Around a half of violent incidents identified by both BCS and police statistics involve no injury to the victim.		That could be useful. As the FBI says that **attempted** aggravated assault is included in their assault numbers, we can compare those categories directly.		Murder	642 Homicides		Note: I checked the definitions, and I think this is a good equivalence of US murder numbers. Just to be fair, I went back and added 653 to the US murder total, being the number of justifiable homicides.		Rape	11,955 rapes (incl adjustment)		Note: OK, this is tricky. The US and UK define rape in the same way (penetration), but the UK has some reporting problems. 12% are reported as "No Crime," not sure what that means, but I'll take that percentage off the UK rape number, just to be sure. (Note: In every category I am reducing the UK numbers if questions, and increasing the US.)		Robbery	742,000		Note: Both the US and UK define robbery in the same way (A person is guilty of robbery if he steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, he uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force). Note, this is not like burglary. [This document](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227013/Crime_Aug_2013.pdf) gives the rate as 1.4 per 1000, which works out to 742,000.		Assault	338,455		Note: The most difficult. I have numbers from [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_273169.pdf) that:	> Includes homicide, attempted murder, intentional destruction of viable unborn child, causing death by dangerous driving/careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, more serious wounding or other act endangering life (including grievous bodily harm with and without intent), causing death by aggravated vehicle taking and less serious wounding offences.		I subtracted the adjusted murder number, which I think gets me very close to the US definition of assault, which requires actual physical harm.		So, let's total those numbers:		US	1,209,504		UK	1,093,052		Given that the US was 310,500,000 in 2011, and the UK was 53,000, that means the UK had 17% of the population of the US (or US was 5.88x the UK). So I will now calculate the per 1,000 rate for these numbers.		US	3.89		UK	20.62		So, there you go. I have laid out all my assumptions and sources. I have made every doubtful metric adjusted in favor of the UK, and against the US. Sure, there is probably some error in there. But, given the magnitude of the difference, I do not see how you can continue to opine that the UK is less violent than the US.

When you apply for a certificate or have a certificate renewed, it is standard practice to come and inspect your storage arrangements and general environment.

Outside of the standard renewal visits, they can't just call up and say "We're doing spot checks, can we come see you this afternoon?", nor can they rock up at the door with that "reason".	If they are doing that, then StarkyA should be asking them pointedly "WHY?", and reporting the matter to whichever Governing Body they are a member of, because the Police MAY NOT do random spot checks. The Home Office Guidance does not provide for it, and neither does the law.		But if the Police try it on and the person involved doesn't report it, then the NGBs can't take action against it, as they did when one Police Force started asking people to go and get medical certificates at their own expense (which is not a requirement under the Home Office Licensing Framework, and not something a Force Area can arbitrarily start demanding).

But if everyone is diligent in pressing for a reason, and reports it to the NGBs if they're not happy with the way the visit is carried out, then the NGBs will build up a picture pretty rapidly - BASC has 120k members, the other's have thousands of members. They'll be in court rapidly lobbing sueballs at Licensing Offices and backing up certificate holders who refuse entry - just as they did when Durham started asking for [unnecessary Medical reports](http://basc.org.uk/basc-north/durham-police-licensing-move-unlawful). Lawyers fought the public front and dealt with individual cases whilst their lobbyists went through the back channels to the higher authorities and had the Home Office apply top-down pressure on Durham to conform with the standard framework.		There is no problem with the Police having a power, provided there is a check and balance. In this case there is - and shooters have some hefty lawyers on their side to call upon, but they have to call upon those checks and balances. No good whinging that the Police are riding rough-shod over you if you're not talking to your NGB and using the resources available.		The other thing to consider is that a lot of shooters know their local Licensing Officer quite well - much like their local bobby. I don't personally as they keep changing in my area and I don't change the terms of my certificate a whole lot, but some people buy and sell guns regularly and know the licensing staff quite well - especially in rural areas where one officer covers a geographically large area but relatively few certificate holders, and them popping by for a biscuit is no more or less worrisome than a local bobby dropping by to chat about your neighbour having their tractor stolen and discussing a spate of local farm robberies and what you should do to secure your property.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hemmers","name":"t1_cll7zzq","parent_id":"t1_cll7gvm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414430200,"created_utc":1414426600}

Knives can't kill a large amount of people quickly, and a bat is an effective weapon against it. Cars are fast, but bullets are much faster. And there are a **ton** of regulations on cars.

Most people disagree with you. And you should have put freedoms in quotes, not safety. Having fewer guns is actually safer. But nobody is denied freedom because they don't or can't have a gun.

"Then should the police be able to search your house for safe storage of baseball bats, kitchen knives, etc?"		Well if you could show me statistics that having a baseball bat in your home increases your chances of dying because of that bat, then sure. I can show you those stats for guns. Therefore, guns in a home should be regulated for public safety. If you can find the stats for other products, I'll get behind those regulations as well.		"Cars are more dangerous than guns."		Very true. And guess what: We regulate them. You need a license to drive one. You must register your ownership of one. If you have a tail light out, a police officer may pull you over and fine you. So all of the "freedoms" you worry about giving up for guns, you already do for cars. So if you want to make arguments about the safety of cars, then you acknowledge that things that can affect public safety require regulation. Why not guns, then?		"It's my private property; they have no right to search it for anything I'm doing legally."		If I own a restaurant, it's my private property.

{"body":">  In Australia public massacres ended after the Howard government implemented tough gun control.		No they didn't. Since Port Arthur prompted major changes to Aussie firearms law there have been at least 3 arson attacks which killed 10 or more people, which most people would count as a massacre. Lots of ways to kill people, most don't involve guns.		You had a bad spell of shootings from 1987 to 1996, which all came to a head with Port Arthur. That said, many of the big massacres before then were Australian Police and Whites murdering entire Aboriginal tribes in retaliation for a single murder or some such. Sketchy record there at best.		But even Port Arthur wasn't part of a major period of violence. It was a massive outlier, an aberration (in every sense). 35 people died. That's 3.5 times more than the next most deadly shooting (Hope Forest Massacre).		The UK's Cumbrian Shootings involved a bolt action rifle and a double barrelled shotgun - those guns are still legal in Australia, even if you've got rid of semi-autos (like the UK has). If you think the ban on semi-autos was the reason you've had no mass shootings since Port Arthur, then you're wrong.	The reason events like Port Arthur were rare both before and after it are just that - they're rare events that require a certain type of nutjob to carry off.	It's just a matter of time before some nutjob gets a shotgun - white or black market - and goes postal in a shopping centre taking 10 or 15 people with them. If you're concentrating on firearms law, and not on access to mental health provision then you're fundamentally doing it wrong.		Firearms laws didn't help those people trapped in arsoned buildings.		Sensible firearms laws are excellent. But there is a point - which both the UK and Australia have crossed - where you start worrying more about the gun and not the person carrying it. It's at that point you need to step back and look at the big picture.

Let's say you're a Muslim living in the UK, you may not be out spoken, you conduct yourself within the bounds of the law, but you own a gun.

Plenty of people - both with and without firearms and shotgun certificates own airguns, either because they are more appropriate than cartridge firearms for ratting in amongst farm buildings and short range pest control (and they have a cartridge firearm for pest control in the fields and over open ground), or because they are easier to use safely in a back garden setting, a scout hut or in a school hall.		It is entirely fair to count airgun owners amongst "firearm owners", not merely holders of Firearm and Shotgun Certificates.		You may consider airguns to be toys for plinking and not worthy of consideration, but plenty of people use them as a tool of work for dispatching trapped rats and squirrels, ratting in amongst farm buildings, or for serious target shooting. *They are regulated as firearms and should be afforded equal respect as such.*			I do not include Airsoft Guns in the numbers as they are not regulated by the Firearms Act and are not considered firearms provided their muzzle energy is less than 1 Joule.

At the Commonwealth Games this year there were no less than 6 nations who *only* sent people for the shooting events and no other events. Aside from Athletics, Shooting is pretty much the highest flagged event (i.e. number of nations participating).		When Manchester hosted, they bid without shooting. There were no other countries bidding, and even then, the initial vote was *against* the Manchester Bid, because lots of nations would not have had anyone to send in any other event, and lots of other nations would have seen their squad size and medal tally drop.	I know people in the CG Organisation, and it was incredibly close to there not actually being a Commonwealth Games held in 2002. Anywhere.		Hurried calls were made to Downing Street to ensure that Cartridge Pistol wouldn't be a problem and Section 5 permits could be arranged, and with that in hand, the Games went ahead.		Glasgow tried to put the Shooting events on the Isle of Man, to make life easier with pistols, but the Commonwealth Games Federation stipulated that a Scottish games had to be in Scotland, so they had to get Downing Street to sort Section 5s again. I know Wales have been mulling a bid for a future Games, and shooting is again a sticking point - they have to be able to host that. In the case of Wales, they know the government will sort licenses for non-UK-legal pistols (as they did for the Manchester and Glasgow Commonwealths, and the London Olympics), but they don't have a 1000yard range suitable for the Fullbore Rifle events.

{"body":"*Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.* **-James Madison, Federalist Papers No. 46**		When the US constitution was originally passed by the states, the consent came with the understanding that a bill of rights would be passed immediately. That bill of rights included the right to bear arms, so that the federal government could not use its newfound power oppress the freshly liberated United States.		To legitimately repeal that protection requires that the state representatives to the federal government vote in 2/3rds majority in favor of repealing the second amendment. Anything short of that is an act of aggression by the federal government against the states.		The right to bear arms was protected first and foremost to protect the states from the standing federal army.","depth":8,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_clkh1xb","parent_id":"t1_clkgncv","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414358809,"created_utc":1414355209}

Four of my friends have been killed by drunk drivers, and one of my close friends killed a passenger while drunk driving. Two of my family members have died of cirrhosis. Perhaps this can be explained by the fact that I live in a relatively affluent area, and gun violence has been shown to have a correlation geographically with poverty (America's real problem). Still, alcohol consumption causes well over twice as many deaths annually in the US as gun violence.

{"body":"There already are restrictions on gun ownership, and as you say managing restrictions is challenging. 		That is the case right now, and I don't see how the proposal for surprise mandatory checks (adding another law) will solve the problems. 		For my part, I don't think gun ownership in and of itself is a problem, or causes problems. 		Part of the reason so little is done is that the people who want to take away guns propose things that don't affect them, but greatly affect gun owners. Then they complain that the gun owners aren't embracing legislation that infringes on their gun ownership. Or they trot out fudds that won't be affected by legislation to say "look we have gun owners that agree with us, our proposal must make sense. Those that disagree with us are irrational."		But my main point is that to get anything like mandatory checks passed, you'd need a registry of all guns. You'd only get guns that are legally owned, and most gun owners would simply not register and wait until that law was repealed. So if mandatory check ups or registration or similar laws were passed, it relies on the cooperation of people that feel the law is unconstitutional as it infringes on their rights. 		As for what I think would be a compromise. I'd be okay with the background check system being open and accessible to gun owners so if they want to do a private sale they can run a check on the person they sell to. In exchanged I'd like to see the NFA repealed, a national CCW license (so a ccer in one state isn't arrested for carrying in another like shaneen Allen).

There were two deaths by asphyxiation and two by heart attack which have the *potential* to actually be the police's fault (one was a pre-existing heart condition).","depth":5,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Twmbarlwm","name":"t1_clk6gym","parent_id":"t1_clk5jl8","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414337820,"created_utc":1414334220}

{"body":"> And yes thinking that the gov. can organize the seizure of the millions guns in the US is a sign of mental illness.		You must not be listening to them. While a few honestly think the government will walk in (and I assume you're only referring to the US here) and seize those guns.. many people believe it will be *slowly* edged away. I say many... many of the people who believe the government is going to take away their rights.		There was a hilarious sense of irony in the recent ammunition problem we had not too long ago.		Obama said he wasn't coming to take your guns! A shooting or two made him go "well, maybe CRAZY people shouldn't have guns" -- quickly some on the Right saw that as "omg, here it starts... first the crazy -- but how do YOU define crazy.. omg". THEN sequestration hit -- causing the government agencies to lose a LOT of money. The Right, in my opinion was responsible for that but it's neither here nor there. So those agencies realized they NEEDED to stockpile ammo because what if they don't have money next year for it? You HAVE to qualify yearly...		This caused a shortage. Shot-term thinkers went "OH SHIT.. the government is buying up all the ammo! OMG! This is like Australia! They took the ammo and limited it in effect limiting guns!" So THEY bought up everything they could as well. Causing the shortage to become INSANE.		Then another shooting happened. And this made the ammo situation WORSE. All it took is a shooting per year... (which all in all, statistically isn't bad.. really). And The Right went bat-shit-nuts in fear.		It was like a feedback loop of stupid mother fuckers everywhere who didn't look further than two weeks ahead. Everyone was to blame -- but they only saw each other as the enemy, so the loop would cycle again and again.		These people don't have a mental illness. They lack the ability to think things through. There's an important difference. It's still equally as long-term dangerous... but it is NOT the same as a mental illness. It's just being a dumb ass.		There are those who say trusting the government, as completely and as earnestly as you do (ESPECIALLY being ex mil), is a sign of silliness. And there are females who say guns are The Great Equalizers -- as I know a friend who shot her rapist... Since that day she became a *passionate* gun owner. In her mind -- without that weapon, she would have been raped without question -- and people like YOU (as in you personally) are OK with her getting raped so long as the rapist is caught (maybe, hopefully, one day?). These are the people you think you're talking about and talking to. I'm not sure you entirely understand their angle like you feel you do.		But we're not talking about the US here.. this is the UK which has a different group of silliness that I think needs to be addressed. Their fear of guns strikes me as... strange, but I suppose Nazi Germany changed a lot for them.","depth":6,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"PM_ME_YOUR_FETISHES","name":"t1_clkdfl6","parent_id":"t1_clkco8g","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414352115,"created_utc":1414348515}

{"body":"I love watching the well tended product of brainwashing that's been waged on the American public versus our 2nd Amendment over the decades. You are a fine example of their craft, someone should be proud. 		Let's try to get your head out of the cloud. The subject is the UK and how the police can just waltz into people's homes on the pretense of inspecting their registered firearms. You really seem to miss the connection of Western culture and how each nation is a progressive experiment in population control these past decades. 		You seem to miss the obvious such as how our police have become increasingly militarized to the point they are their own standing army pointed at us. Constitutionally this is seriously jacked up when it applies to the US. 		Now back to the "gun issue" and the 2nd Amendment. The 2nd isn't about guns, not primarily it's about power being in the hands of the people. It's what gives teeth to the whole democracy thing. The tell is in the wording and the history around it. "The right to own and bear arms" is something obviously lost in translation, so we have to look at the time in which it was penned. 		We hailed from a monarchy, where only lords of the land had the right to own a bear arms. You've seen the movies where the hero gets "knighted" and the kings dubs him on the shoulders with the sword and says some shit, and part of it is "the right to own and bear arms". 		A quick history of that means that peasants weren't allowed to fight, not bandits, not invaders, nobody.

As far as the "law" protecting it this is an illusion. You need real power to back up law. Do you realize that our Supreme Court once handed down orders and we've had generals on our own soil ignore their rulings and say something to the effect of "lets see them come down here and enforce that." Rules, laws are only obeyed if you can enforce them, note the "Force" in enforce?

Votes, political gain and a cockiness that it doesn't matter if we are armed or not, so throw idiots a bone. It's complicated. 		>Who in America is being lorded over?		Seriously? Well for one, poverty and debt is an modern form of slavery. If you can't look around and see how the middle class is sinking like the Titanic, the massive debt piled up with China holding our pink slip and buying our gold and Federal Reserve, then there is nothing I can point out to you.

We could read tea leaves, or speculate, but I don't know. I do know that things are circling the toilet bowl. We live in a house of cards and the wind is picking up. Look at the world today, we've got problems, serious ones. It's damn near comical the scope of it all.

Frankly, I think it's a "borg" move by the Banksters to infect them with a very sick system of fiat currency and usury. These fuckers play with nations like chess pieces. At some point I worry we are going to be liquidated over this debt thing. You are right about one thing, on the large scale at the moment, it's not about guns, it's about exploiting "laws", rules and other fuckery. 		Ponder this, the Chinese via law call in our debt. By rights, they get to claim what they can for payment. Feature our own militarized police enforcing this "law" as we're kicked to the curb, probably to camps.

Legislative, executive, and judicial all have powers over one another so they keep each other in check.

Again I ask, what governing body gives you the right to attack the federal government? And how many of you does it have to be? And what/who are you attacking? Are you blowing up buildings or killing politicians? And why wouldn't you just vote them out instead of killing them? And under who's authority are you doing this? Don't forget that the founding fathers were elected representatives, lawyers, and military leaders. If you don't like what's happening then vote for people who agree with you. Or run for office yourself. And do you really think you'll have more guns than the opposition? What about the citizens (like me) who will fight against you? I don't work for the government, but I'm not going to let some crazy anarchists take it over. Am I still an American if we're at war, or are you trying to make a new country? 		> When asked about this in history, the founders replied with "any able bodied man of adult age". History, bitch.		Source?		I like how you said "in history" and "the fathers"...real specific.		> The discussion is about history and how we formed our government, try to keep up.		No, it's about gun laws in UK, and how Fox News just convinced you that something like that could happen here and that's somehow a precursor of transforming a democracy into a tyranny. In fairness to Fox News (which I never thought I'd say), you added the tyranny part all by yourself.		> You are all over the place with that looking for a strawman or something. 		Those are called examples. I was giving you a couple historical examples of social change that happened without guns. 		> It didn't happen in a magic vacuum of wishful thinking, it came at a price of blood and conflict.		Right, when we were transforming from a monarchy to a democracy. We had to fight that because we had foreign rulers and wanted a different form of government. But we're not in that situation now. I didn't think we were at least. What type of government are you suggesting we change to? What's wrong with democracy? The founding fathers liked it.		> It's complicated.		Let me know when you figure it out.		> Well for one, poverty and debt is an modern form of slavery.		I think actual slaves would disagree. And poverty and debt have always existed. How would you suggest eradicating them?		> If you can't look around and see how the middle class is sinking like the Titanic, the massive debt piled up with China holding our pink slip and buying our gold and Federal Reserve, then there is nothing I can point out to you.		Our middle class is growing again, and shrinking everywhere else in the world. China only owns about 9% of our debt. France and Great Britain have owned much more at different periods in history. Gold has been dropping for the past year. Federal Treasury Bills are still the most secure paper on the planet. I mean we have our issues, things could be better, but we're doing a lot better than everybody else right now.		> Well there is the fact we have more people in prison than anyone else on the planet thanks to a political war called the "war on drugs".		I agree, but again that was created by conservatives. 		> Start looking around objectively and stop with the "Murica, fuck yeah" mentality which has become pathetically comical.		That's not my mentality at all. I think we have lots of systemic problems. But you haven't even begun to touch on them because Republicans are responsible for 90% of them.		> Look at the world today, we've got problems, serious ones. 		We always have. You just hear about them for 24 hours a day now so it seems like a lot of crazy shit is going on. But it's all media hype. 		> The interests of the uber rich get addressed while the masses eat dog shit.		When in history and where on planet earth now is that not true?		> WTF do you think the Chinese will do with our Federal Reserve once they control it?		Wow, I can't begin to tell you how uninformed that question is. First of all I think you're referring to the US Treasury, not the Federal Reserve. Second, we really don't owe China that much relative to what we owe other countries and ourselves. Third, I imagine if they controlled our economy in some way they'd keep doing what we've been doing because it's working for them pretty well so far. Fourth, that could never happen because we have a stronger military than them and they'd have to take us over to control our Treasury. I could keep going...		> Frankly, I think it's a "borg" move by the Banksters to infect them with a very sick system of fiat currency and usury. 		Usury is still illegal, but it's good that we have a fiat currency. If we didn't, China buying a bunch of gold would be a big problem. But since we do, it's not.		> At some point I worry we are going to be liquidated over this debt thing.		You don't understand national debt.		> Ponder this, the Chinese via law call in our debt.		What?! LOL! What *law*? What does that even mean? It's not poker.		> By rights, they get to claim what they can for payment.		We could just go print more dollars and give it to them. 		> Feature our own militarized police enforcing this "law" as we're kicked to the curb, probably to camps.		What?! So you think the US government, even in this fantasy world scenario where they get called on their debt and for whatever reason choose not to print more dollars, and also choose not to sell the Chinese a few planes or some boats to cover this magical debt call, would begin to take the private property of private American citizens and enforce this illegal property confiscation with local police departments? How much do you think we owe them?		> Are we so retarded and cocky to think it can't happen here?? Before answering that..think about our debt.		Um, yes I think we're all sufficiently confident China can't kick us out of our homes and businesses. Again, I don't think you realize how much we owe China or the reason we want to have a trade deficit with them.		> Is shit like that going to happen while we are all armed to the fucking teeth? 		What?! So you think that what will prevent China from taking over the United States of America is its citizens armed with M16s and .38 specials? Not our military, not our money, not our allies, not China's dependence on our economy, not treaties and trade agreements. Just you and your hunting buddies, huh? Excuse me if I'm not relying on untrained uncoordinated citizens with no combat experience or strategy whatsoever to defend this country against foreign invasion. It couldn't be that gun manufacturers have a vested interest in selling more guns and use their money to influence politics and media to make you buy more guns. It's China. Got it.		> Don't get me wrong, I love your ideal version of the whole thing, but I'm not so naive to think that it's going to be sustained by happy thoughts and wishful thinking.		I said laws and balance of power, not wishful thinking. You're naive enough to think it's going to be sustained by people with guns. I'd actually take wishful thinking over that, because a bunch of people with guns are just going to get themselves killed.		> It's not that fucked yet, so lets try to keep it that way.

{"body":"Sure, there are stabbings and other kinds of physical assault. But take in mind that walking up to a person to stab/hit takes a lot more "courage" than to simply pull a trigger from a safe distance. Additionally, it is generally less lethal.		> Don't kid yourself, every criminal in the UK who wants a handgun has one.		I really think you overestimate the availability of handguns. Sure, if you *really* want one you could probably get one, but you would have to pay a much higher price. Additionally, once you get caught in possession of a handgun you're not likely to get away with it.		> No I would not agree with your last sentence, has outlawing the carrying of knives in the UK stopped stabbings? 		I don't see why this is relevant? Knives are all over the place. People will be able to simply take one from their kitchen drawers. But if (almost) nobody has a gun and guns are outlawed, where are people going to get the guns from? Gun manufacturers are not allowed to sell them to regular people, so all the guns would have to either be stolen from military/police or illegally imported from other countries. This severely limits the supply side of guns and increases the prices significantly.		People will still be able to harm others by different means, but as I said before, they are less lethal and much more physically and emotionally demanding. Just compare the [Sandy Hook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting) shooting to the [Chengpeng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenpeng_Village_Primary_School_stabbing) stabbing.		Sure, if someone really wants to kill you, he will likely still be able to do so without a gun (though, it should be noted that it is far easier to run / lock yourself in / defend against a knife than against a gun). 		A gun would probably allow you to defend yourself against a knife (though this is apparently harder than it sounds). But if you were able to get a gun, the attacker is likely to have a gun as well (who would bring a knife to a potential gunfight?). How is your gun going to help you if someone walks up to you and shoots you in the face? Or if he rings the door and shoots you on sight? Do you open your front door with your left hand, holding a gun with your right?		It's simply a [prisoner's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma)...		This is also why Europeans are angry at the 3D-printed gun nutjobs who apparently think they are saints by giving people in no-gun countries the availability of guns: the first(/only) people who will make use of this are the criminals. Once the criminals are armed and gun crime increases, people will feel forced to buy a gun themselves (????????? for gun manufacturers) to feel safe. The net effect? More deaths, more crime and more money for the gun manufacturers.		I'd rather live in a place where I can walk the street at night without second thoughts, where policemen don't have to treat me like a criminal when I get pulled over, where I can open my front door with my right hand.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Zonnegod","name":"t1_clksm3q","parent_id":"t1_clkqa9p","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414381373,"created_utc":1414377773}

I never asked 'Do you think it's a good thing that you could arm yourself in case of mass invasion across your entire country at once?' 		Wars aren't fought like that any more, and haven't been for a long time, when was the last time the USA was invaded by footmen? And during the last attack on US soil all those guns didn't help you much. So what country could muster an army to invade the US if your army was disabled? Plenty, because yours is a flawed argument because a) citizens are not armies located all in one place ready to follow command and b) it's logistically impossible for you to ever require to defend yourself against an invading army on a nationwide scale guns or no guns.		You're military budget isn't set by defending your home soil, when was the last time you walked down the street and thought "Hey, I wish they wouldn't build those pill boxes on every street corner because that money they could be putting into NASA."? Removing guns from US citizens wouldn't change your military's budget one bit.		And I don't understand your other arguments either, what difference does it make how likely you are do die by x compared to by a gun? When people get old and vulnerable they start eliminating risks, sit down showers, apartments with only one floor or a lift etc. Why not eliminate the risk of being shot too?

What are the innocent bystander - cop vs criminal shooting stats? Cops will shot criminals who both do and do not have guns which will all be included in your stats, but take away everyone's guns and I guarantee that both being shot by a criminal and being shot by a cop will be significantly less. But given the sheer number of people (and guns) in the states taking everyone's guns away is never going to happen.

{"body":"I???m sorry for the delayed response, I was at work when you replied and forgot until I my phone randomly flashed the alert this morning. 		You???re right, I didn't address your question, and I???m sorry about that. I don???t know what scenario would require Americans to take up arms against our government, and I hope I never have to find out. That???s not the point. Many Americans like living in a country where they know the government has to consider this question. I am one of them. 		The USA hasn't been invaded partially because it would be suicide for any country to try. It hasn't worked out well for anybody since the local population started packing guns rather than bows. 	A country can be bombed by planes etc, but it has to be held by armed foot soldiers. This is why an armed citizenry is a big problem for invading forces. 		a)1/3 of American own guns (or at least certainly have access to them). Nearly every state has enough guns to repel any army in the world given enough time. And certainly enough guns to slow any army enough that the rest of the country could mobilize. It would be suicide for any country to try. 		b) I apologize if I've misunderstood you, but I believe what you're saying is that geographically it's nearly impossible for anybody but our allies to invade us. And I agree, which is why I feel so strongly about point a) and think we should be able to cut/shift our military spending quite a lot. 		While I???m not sure what pill boxes are, you are correct that the US military budget isn't set by defending our home soil, as much as I (and, I bet, a majority of Americans) would like it to be. But I do look at how my country spends money and think we do a terrible job of it. In my opinion, our military budget and policy should absolutely be set by defending our home soil. So, while you are correct that it wouldn???t change the military???s budget to remove guns from US citizens, we would have even less of a hope at reducing the military budget, and there would be a much bigger incentive to engage in ???the best defense a great offense??? type wars that we???ve become known for (and I despise). I believe we should encourage US citizens to own guns, as well as be as knowledgeable and capable with them as possible. 		You're exactly right that we will never be able to remove all of the guns (or even most of them). There are too many guns, and too many people want to keep them. It is impossible to eliminate the risk of being killed by a gun. 		The point is that a very very small percentage of the population dies because of guns (literally a fraction of 1%). And most of the people who do die, knowingly put themselves in the dangerous situations that take their life. Yet there is a disproportionately large drive to restrict the rights of law abiding citizens with regard to guns than there is to eliminate stairs, backyard swimming pools, medical malpractice, many other dangers which kill orders of magnitude more people than guns. The priorities are out of whack??? 		The best way to avoid these dangers is to behave in a way that puts you at a lower risk of being hurt. If you don???t want to be shot you are free to avoid gang infested areas. I would encourage you to avoid confrontations with police. I would encourage you to get help if you are depressed, and I would encourage the United States to improve access to mental health care, as well as all other health care (FYI, health care in the US is a joke). There is no 100% safe, but we are better than 99% safe from guns.		I am a law abiding citizen. It feels good to know that I can run down to the store, buy some ale and balaclava for my wife???s birthday party Friday night, and on my way back I can buy my wife a shotgun for her birthday hunting trip that weekend.

{"body":"Reading this thread made me realize that reddit has a hidden patch of backwater libertarian nutjobbery. Seriously, if you think regulating guns is a short step away from Nazis goose-stepping down your street, you're a grade A loon. You should be institutionalized. 		The fact is guns are designed for one purpose: maiming and killing things. They are a tool--as many of you gun rights folks like to point out. Just as a hammer is a tool that bangs nails, guns are a tool that inflicts harm on living things, in particular on people. 		I'm a chemist. There are many tools in the lab, including the chemicals we use to synthesize new molecules. Each tool has its purpose, and many have safety concerns. So we treat each tool in the lab with respect. We think about how to store all those chemical tools so to minimize harm. We think about how we should handle them safely. And we think about how to dispose of them so that they cause as little harm as possible. To make sure we're doing our job when it comes to dealing with the safety of our chemical tools, inspectors come into our lab each year and look around. They take notes and ask us questions. At the end of the inspection, they tell us what we can do to improve safety in our labs. 		This is not a violation of our rights. This is not some grand affront to our humanity. It is part of doing business as a chemist. We use tools that can cause harm. So we expect someone to make sure we are doing our best to protect ourselves and others from that harm.		If you chose to own a gun and store it in your home, you are in the same position as us chemists. You have elected to bring an implement that can cause harm into your house. Therefore, the government has the right and responsibility to ensure that you are storing that tool safely. Don't want those inspections? Then don't own a gun. If I don't like lab inspections, I am more than welcome to go into accounting.		If this is in violation of the second amendment, then I say get rid of that 18th century nonsense. Just because it was written down by men who founded this nation doesn't mean we have to still live by it. Nothing in the Constitution should be deemed sacred, they are just ideas formed by flawed men, subject to the same scrutiny as any other ideas.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"rhetorical_mice","name":"t1_cll6y0a","parent_id":"t3_2kd5dp","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1414428149,"created_utc":1414424549}

In 2008, 13.2% (39.8 million) Americans lived in poverty.[8] Starting in the 1980s, relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations.[9] California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the country.[10]		Though this is difficult comparison to make because, like crime, poverty in the US and UK are measured in different ways.		> Our people trust our government and the police and find the idea of people running around with guns in the name of defence repugnant.
