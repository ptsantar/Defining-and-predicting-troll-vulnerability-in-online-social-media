{"body":"No nation has an embassy there because the Palestinians asked them not to. 		PLO Charter, Article 23:	The demand of security and peace, as well as the demand of right and justice, require all states to consider Zionism an illegitimate movement, to outlaw its existence, and to ban its operations, in order that friendly relations among peoples may be preserved, and the loyalty of citizens to their respective homelands safeguarded.		That's a threat to the world, by the way. 			East Jerusalem includes the old city, Western wall, and Temple Mount. 	Ignoring that, it was declared as neither part of the Jewish state or Arab state, but as an International city in the 1947 UN Partician Plan. 	But in 1948, despite this, East Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan in 1948. Was that occupation illegal or legal? In 1960 East Jerusalem became Jordan's (and I shit you not) "Second Capitol" though it also was not recognized internationally as such a thing. 		But I'm not talking about East or West. I just mentioned Jerusalem as Israel's Capitol.  		As for embassies:		Washington Times:	The issue of Jerusalem has dogged U.S. presidents since 1995, when Congress approved the Jerusalem Embassy Act, requiring the United States to relocate the embassy to the Israeli capital.	However, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have invoked a waiver that allows a president to postpone moving the embassy for national security reasons.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NoveltyName","name":"t1_cjfy4pt","parent_id":"t1_cjfwz6k","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1407102314,"created_utc":1407098714}

Because pretty much every rocket launched is picked up and tracked by Iron Dome.

Weird, seeing as how Truman gave them a few separate opportunities to surrender and they spurned each one in a similar way to how Palestine continually spurns Israel's peace treaties. The Soviets joining the Pacific front scared the shit out of them, but the Japanese refused an unconditional surrender. If you're gonna argue that Japan shouldn't have had to surrender unconditionally you can just fuck off, because yes, they deserved nothing less. They INITIATED war with the every nation they fought, and they had to answer for that. The only options were to a) force surrender or b) invade mainland Japan, which would have killed about a million Allied soldiers by military estimates and over 4 million Japanese.

Not sure what your first sentence's point was. 		After WWI, it is true that Germany was *far* too harshly punished for the war. However, Wilson is commonly known to have fought that. Britain and especially France were the major players that fought tooth and nail to pin the whole thing on Germany. Wilson was trying to push the 14 Points more than anything else. 		In any case, it's apples and oranges. After WWI, Germany was left crippled and fending for itself. The American high command made it clear that part of Japan's unconditional surrender included the US effectively taking over reconstruction ??? a punishment in many ways, but also helpful, as the US was able to afford economic reformation that Japan otherwise wouldn't have been able to, and that is why today Japan is so economically strong. They had basically zero military expense for a long time, plus the full backing of the US economic sector. Now, you may argue that it wasn't worth it as we basically annexed the island(s) throughout the Cold War, but that's a whole other argument. 		The unconditional surrender of Japan was warranted and necessary. Anything less would have been unacceptable. No nation came close to the number of war crimes committed by Japan, even if you buy into the US being an evil juggernaut of oppression throughout its campaign, but more importantly, as I said before, Japan initiated conflict in every aspect. It was Japan's decision to invade China, to strike French Indochina, to to attack British South China, and to make the fatal mistake of bringing America into direct conflict. 		On a final note, there's no need to be degrading. I have a degree in history and don't really appreciate being called naive.

Your second paragraph is entirely correct, yet irrelevant to this argument. The point was that such an unconditional surrender is what causes hate and resentment throughout a period of time and would allow for a situation in which extremists come into power to become a totalitarian state. It doesn't matter who wanted them to surrender unconditionally, the point was that they surrendered unconditionally.		In your 3rd argument you look at the outcome and how it differs from Germany, yet I don't see how this matters. Japan wanted to surrender in the best way possible for them, and would've given up on it as soon as they realized the Allies wouldn't allow for them to do such. They knew there was no way they could pull through, they were just trying to make their situation the least painful situation they could.		The unconditional surrender of Japan was warranted but not necessary or beneficial to us. If America had allowed the emperor to remain as their puppet, Japan would have gladly surrendered and America wouldn't have committed such a foolish act. I am not justifying their actions in any way, Japan deserved to be punished. However, nuking them into submission was not the way to do this.

I'm going to have to disagree with you here when the deathscore stands at Hamas: ~20, IDF: ~600. The military force Israel is using against the Palestinians is a warcrime. They call it "defense" for the same reason Hamas gets civvies near its property; it looks better on paper. But in reality, this "defense" that Israel is using is comparable to a guy "defending himself" from finger-flicks with a flamethrower. Not only is it an inappropriately over-the-top military response that has caused more civilians deaths than Hamas could ever hope for, it psychologically damages people so badly that it virtually fills out all the Hamas recruitment papers for them. Israel requires enormous propaganda to keep their hate machine against the Palestinians going. Hamas just needs to tell people to look outside and watch as each multi-million dollar, American-made, freedom-endorsed warhead destroys an innocent family.

Indeed, specifically targeting civilians is a war crime (This is, as far as I'm aware, not what Israel does). But I would argue that in a military conflict so one-sided, this level of unprecedented "collateral damage" (to the point that more innocent Palestinians civilians are killed than Hamas fighters by several orders of magnitude), indicates a complete disregard for the safety and right to life of non-combatants, and should be considered a war crime. Unsurprisingly, this is very similar to the war crimes committed by the U.S. military and CIA in territories where the hellfire drones operate. 		>The media narrative is much easier to get hits with if you play up the death&destruction angle.		If you have any kind of knowledge of what Israel has done to the Palestinian people, you wouldn't say naive and hypocritical things like this. The death & destruction of innocent people, especially on this scale, should be cause for *any rational, kind, sane person* to demand it's cessation immediately. 	Seriously, look at the civilian damage that has been done. You speak of context-less pictures, but I have seen many pictures from this conflict, in-context, and they are absolutely FUBAR.

I've seen the hysterical, screaming parents holding their murdered offspring swaddled in blood-soaked fabric. I've seen the shelled towns, the destroyed families, the ruined lives, all the result of one psychotic power group trying to kill another.

The "Never Again" doctrine rings soundly among a people that have experienced determined (and hugely successful) attempts at genocide within _living memory_.  The leadership of Israel was around for the Six-Day War, when a multi-nation coalition of Arab countries tried to push the Jews into the sea.  		> Look at the raw pain inflicted on these innocent people by a force that propagandizes it's own people against them, reducing them to animals, and tell me with a straight face that this isn't being done by someone cold and callous.		I sit here with a straight face and tell you exactly that.  The IDF has made it very clear:  they will do what they need to do in order to blunt Hamas's ability to project indiscriminate violence into Israel.  Period.  That's the goal.

Israel doesn't _want_ Gaza or the West Bank, aside from what they need in order to feel secure in their own lands.

{"body":">Being the weaker power offers no excuse for actions that are strictly terrorism.		I'm not justifying Hamas here. 		>Does this look like something you make in your kitchen?		No, it looks like something smuggled into Hamas hands. Hamas has only been able to manufacture the small Qassam rockets that barely do any damage. I'll repeat that these rockets aren't even explosively tipped. These are the weapons that are made in kitchens and garages, and these are what constitutes a majority of the projectiles Hamas sends towards Israel. The bigger, more sophisticated weapons like the M302 and the Fadjir-5 are produced in countries like China and Saudi Arabia and have been smuggled/sold to Hamas only since ~2008. In this regard, Hamas is no different that Israel; buying weapons more powerful than you can build on your own to use against your enemy. This isn't a justification for Hamas or Israel, these are statements of fact. 		>...and you went off the deep end.		No, this is literally what Israel does. There is extremely heavy propaganda against the Palestinian people, as well as propaganda at work in Western countries to justify the actions of Israel. There is the [Luntz report](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/israelgaza-conflict-the-secret-report-that-helps-israelis-to-hide-facts-9630765.html), on how to best manipulate foreign governments and societies, and the [paid "shills" who artificially influence online conversation](http://electronicintifada.net/content/internet-users-paid-spread-israeli-propaganda/8355). Here's an article that discusses, among other related things, [Israel's propaganda towards it's own citizens](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/07/31/inside-israels-and-palestines-propaganda-wars) and how it preserves this sense of nationality and protectionism that it needs to function. Also, have you ever heard of Zionism? No, not the conspiracy world-take-over zionism, but the actual, real definition? It is a common, strongly-held belief in Israel that the Jews must live by themselves, only with other jews, with no threatening enemies. This sounds crazy (because it is), but it's *real*. They *actually* believe this; It is the result of 2,000 years of persecution and the belief that they are God's "chosen people". Again, this sounds crazy, but it is a commonly held opinion among Israelis and many Israeli-sympathizers. This is just one aspect of the sense of nationalism Israel exploits. Honestly, thinking they don't participate in propaganda and jingoism shows an extreme naivety for history and social beliefs. 		>That is all I need to know about who the "bad guys" are here.		If you are still thinking in the simplistic black-and-white terms of "good guys" and "bad guys", then you part of the problem. I am not justifying Hamas *at all*; they are disgusting and evil. Don't feel the need to sell me on how evil they are and all the fucked up shit they do; you're preaching to the quire. 		What I'm trying to say is that Israel's method of response is too heavy-handed. It's like killing a rat with a pound of TNT, or like trying to paint your fingernails with a paint roller used for house exteriors. The cost of Israel's military engagements into Palestine are horrific, and result in terrible civilian:combatant death ratios. In fact, [specifically because Israel's handling of the Hamas situation is so poor and sloppy, most of the rest of the world outside the U.S. is turning on them](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/middleeast/as-much-of-the-world-frowns-on-israel-americans-hold-out-support.html?_r=0). There have been so many civilian deaths, that Israel is going to be investigated (not soon enough) for war crimes!		>Hamas, and Hamas alone, holds the keys to the end of the hostilities.		I feel like, despite my repeated clarifications, you still think I'm some kind of supporter of Hamas. I'm not. But I'm knowledgeable enough to know that it takes two to tango, and Israel is **not** free of responsibility here. Yes, Hamas needs to stand down, respect ceasefires, and at the very least, let the Palestinian civilians out of their grip. 		But you also need to keep in mind which force it was who displaced 600,000+ palestinian people for their own national/racial purposes. When you look purely at the number of deaths each side inflicts, Israel is the clear winner, with hundreds, if not thousands, more civilian Palestinian deaths under it's belt than the number of Jews Hamas could ever hope to kill. 		>I sit here with a straight face and tell you exactly that. The IDF has made it very clear: they will do what they need to do in order to blunt Hamas's ability to project indiscriminate violence into Israel. Period. That's the goal.		So if that resorts to committing war crimes, you're ok with it? You'll just roll over and say it's ok because the Jews *must* protect themselves, regardless of how many innocent people die? That's so sick I can't even describe it. 		> If Hamas insists on mixing their war machine among the Palestinian civilians, then that problem is for the Palestinian people to rectify.		You're asking a poor, modestly educated, and relatively unarmed and untrained civilian group that experiences deadly shelling from an extremely advanced neighbor on a daily basis, to not just ignore it, but to instead focus on removing the people with guns who burst into their homes and schools and force them at risk of death to guard ammunition and soldiers? Either you have zero understanding of human nature, or zero understanding of the Palestinian-Hamas relationship. It isn't some Doran-Oberyn "viper in the grass" kind of deal, it's literally Hamas exploiting local religion, force of arms, and Israeli military strikes to terrify the Palestinians into doing what they want. Out of every group in play here, the Palestinian civilians are the least influential, the least funded, the least well-armed, the least capable, and you're putting the responsibility for fixing this multi-thousand year problem on them? No wonder nothing gets fixed when no one has remotely realistically expectations. 		>The whole mess we're in directly stems from the Six-Day War		The whole mess started with the foundation of Israel by the British, the forced displacement of 600,000+ palestinian civilians, and the immediate military response of nearby nation-state actors.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.  Are you _actually_ trying to conflate Israel's _calling ahead to warn people_ with Hamas' _fling them at whatever we can_?

Sure buddy.

It's not like the "Never Again" doctrine was conjured from thin air.		> If you are still thinking in the simplistic black-and-white terms of "good guys" and "bad guys", then you part of the problem.		I'm not.  I am, however, placing 100% of the _continued_ hostilities at the feet of Hamas, who's own words indicate that their *only* resolution is the destruction of both the state of Israel and all of her citizens.  Is that not true?		> What I'm trying to say is that Israel's method of response is too heavy-handed.		Sure, that is a position that can be argued one way or another.  I personally place more faith in the soldiers and intelligence agencies that actually work and live in the area vs. the picture painted by media sources looking to out-sensationalize each other for page views.  Here, [this article](http://www.salon.com/2014/07/28/debunking_the_myths_about_gaza_the_truth_behind_israeli_and_palestinian_talking_points/) clearly demonstrates my point.  Look at the picture.  A father holding a dead child... and the media just lined up behind him.  How about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaqWqjb4w6s&app=desktop) I saw this morning?  Think you'll see _that_ repeated, and talked about like you do the pictures of dead Palestinians?		> In fact, specifically because Israel's handling of the Hamas situation is so poor and sloppy, most of the rest of the world outside the U.S. is turning on them.		It's interesting that we've not heard much from the Arab countries this time around.  The rest of the world is looking on and condemning the IDF, but what has Jordan said?  Egypt closed their borders already, as they've had enough experience with the Muslim Brotherhood in their own country for a while.		> But you also need to keep in mind which force it was who displaced 600,000+ palestinian people for their own national/racial purposes.		The UN, after WW2, who took the land from the Axis-aligned Ottoman Empire?  Or are you referencing the expanded borders after the Six-Day War, when Israel defeated a multi-nation coalition looking to push the Jews into the sea, and took the land _specifically_ to provide a buffer so troops couldn't be stacked right on their borders?  What have the surrounding Arab nations done to help the people of Palestine recently?		> So if that resorts to committing war crimes, you're ok with it?		Firstly, no, that's not ok.  Secondly, you'll need to be specific with your war crimes.  Shelling schools/refuge areas certainly is not a good thing, but I'd like to hear the _other_ side of the story before I pass judgement, since we've repeated seen Hamas utilizing such protected areas for military purposes (which is _most certainly_ a war crime, I might add).  Relying on news sources all trying to out-sensationalize each other for headline grabs is a quick way to get a very distorted view of the situation, and it's rare when anyone goes back to issue a correction for an erroneous statement.		> You're asking a poor, modestly educated, and relatively unarmed and untrained civilian group that experiences deadly shelling from an extremely advanced neighbor on a daily basis, to not just ignore it, but to instead focus on removing the people with guns who burst into their homes and schools and force them at risk of death to guard ammunition and soldiers?		Instead of throwing themselves against that extremely advanced neighbor that has repeatedly demonstrated nothing but wanting to be left alone?  Yes, I am.  I'm asking the Palestinians to take command of their own destiny, instead of just hating on the Joos.		> It isn't some Doran-Oberyn "viper in the grass" kind of deal, it's literally Hamas exploiting local religion, force of arms, and Israeli military strikes to terrify the Palestinians into doing what they want.		Yes, I understand and agree completely.  Which is why I despair for any real solutions, as long as the leadership is content exploiting the situation to remain in power.		> The whole mess started with the foundation of Israel by the British, the forced displacement of 600,000+ palestinian civilians, and the immediate military response of nearby nation-state actors.		Sure, I can agree with that.  Bear in mind, though, that the nation that controlled the area _did_ side with the Axis in WW2, so that offers some kind of explanation for why the West felt they had permission to do it.  That, and that they felt that the Arabs and the ME was just a sandbox they could carve up as they liked (incredibly shameful).  For the record, I do not agree with how the nation of Israel was formed.  If we could go back and prevent it, that would solve a lot of problems.  But you kinda can't now, and there have been multiple generations born there, so they kind of have a legitimate claim _now_, wouldn't you agree?		> Further involvement of western military forces has done extreme damage to the sociopolitical and physical infrastructure of many of these surrounding countries.		Don't ignore that without Western support, the Jewish state would have been driven into the sea.  The Six-Day War _was_ attempted genocide, and I don't use that word lightly (I think it's absurd to call the situation in Gaza genocide, and frankly it's insulting to peoples who have experienced it for real.  Rwanda was genocide.  A 1,000 mixed civilian and militant deaths during a military operation in an area like Gaza out of a population of 1.8 *million* simply cannot be viewed as genocide.  Apartheid, yes, but not genocide).		> it is the #1 motivator for young men to join these radical militant groups		That, and the exploitation of the events by the leadership, fanning the flames and whipping up emotions.  Poke around on YouTube for some Hamas sermons, if you've never listened to one, and you'll see _exactly_ why the hatred is so pervasive.		> It looks like you don't even have a proper grasp of the history of the situation.		Oh no, I have a solid understanding of the why and how.  I just draw different conclusions from the evidence.		This has been enlightening, but I don't think that we are going to move each others opinions in the slightest.

{"body":">I don't find this a compelling argument for not being outraged about them.		"Outraged". Yes, be more "outraged". Good media buzz words. Anyways, these are rockets that are little more than fireworks. They don't knock down walls. They aren't accurate. They don't explode. They make up the bulk of Hamas' arsenal, and it's one step above throwing rocks. They might understand that killing women and children is bad PR, but they don't seem to understand that every one of these futile "missiles" gives Israel the opportunity to claim "more rocket attacks from Gaza". This sensationalizes the issue, and makes people believe that Hamas is just churning out powerful fuckin' rockets constantly and Israel is just a few well-aimed shots from being rubble and ruin. It's ridiculous and has no bearing in reality. 		>because anyone paying attention can clearly see that the IDF is trying to minimize civilian casualties		You aren't understanding. Are you aware of the enormous public backlash against Israel and this Gaza invasion across the globe? France is particularly vocal in their opposition. I already linked you to the war crimes investigation into Israel over their brutality and their responsibility for the extremely high civilian death rates their bombing is causing. Israel is objectively not trying to minimize casualties. This is literally the reason the war crimes investigation is launched. Let this sink in for a minute before you rationalize some kind of way to deny it. 		>Sure buddy. And Fox News is a 100% accurate representation of the desires of all of the American people as well.		If you do not believe Israel engages in propaganda on multiple media, just like every other country, and despite the clear links I provided, you are simply naive and wrong. 		>Well, the Holocaust and the Six-Day War, you know, did happen, and not too terribly long ago.		You can't use the Holocaust to justify this. That is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful. The people in Palestine didn't put any Jews in gas chambers. The people in Palestine didn't create the Hamas charter. What are you on about? You're just coming off as irrational and brainwashed at this point, scraping together overused talking points. 		>Is that not true?		It is, but it is also true that the ideology of Zionism that fuels Israeli politics demands a purified holy land for only the Jews. This requires the forced removal of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, and has led directly to the deaths of many more. This is just as true, yet you will close your eyes to it. 		>Sure, that is a position that can be argued one way or another. 		The international war crimes investigation seems to think so. 		>Think you'll see that repeated, and talked about like you do the pictures of dead Palestinians?		Yes. To claim that American media does not only NOT have a pro-Israeli bias, but is actively pro-Palestinian is laughable on it's face. Your argument is rapidly decreasing in quality. 		>The UN, after WW2, who took the land from the Axis-aligned Ottoman Empire?		This is a sick and childish attempt to connect the people of Palestine with Nazis. I'll repeat this again; the civilians of Palestine are the victims here. They are suffering more than the jews in Israel, more than Hamas, more than anyone else. Your repeated attempts to vilify them are just so disgusting and inhumane. 		> Secondly, you'll need to be specific with your war crimes. Shelling schools/refuge areas certainly is not a good thing, but I'd like to hear the other side of the story before I pass judgement,		It doesn't matter what the other side of the argument is when you're bombing women and children and schools. There is no justification for this. If Hamas is using these people as human shields, and is hiding their equipment in these buildings, which I'm not denying, then the appropriate response is surgical strikes and anti-guerilla movements, not indiscriminate carpet bombing. For fucks sake, you act like the Israeli military has no other options besides mortars and missiles. 		>Instead of throwing themselves against that extremely advanced neighbor that has repeatedly demonstrated nothing but wanting to be left alone? Yes, I am.		This is hilarious. You literally have no understanding of history at all. The history of Israel has seen [rapid expansion across the region](http://s2.photobucket.com/user/messiercat/media/zios/map-1.jpg.html), isolating the Gaza strip and the West Bank. Every time Israel gains territory, it requires the forced relocation and confrontation with the Palestinians living there. It doesn't take much more than a quick google search of "Israeli expansion" to find articles on Israeli execution of forced relocation without allowing any kind of response from the innocent people actually being evicted from their homes, under threat of death. 		>Sure, I can agree with that.		See, the problem is, if you agree with this, it undermines everything you're trying to say. At this point, your argument has completely broken down and you're agreeing with things you were arguing against only a few sentences before. 		>so they kind of have a legitimate claim now, wouldn't you agree?		What!? No! Is this a serious question? It was established within living memory for crying out loud. 		> A 1,000 mixed civilian and militant deaths during a military operation in an area like Gaza out of a population of 1.8 million simply cannot be viewed as genocide.		You arguing semantics on what is or isn't genocide so you can win a political debate is sickening. I can't believe how inhumane and disassociated your thinking is. 		>and you'll see exactly why the hatred is so pervasive.		Sermons tend to carry more emotional weight when they speak against the people who bomb your neighborhood on the daily. You speak about looking at things from both angles, but you are apparently oblivious to the perspective of the Palestinian youth; living in fear of Israel's bombs, having had multiple members of his family killed in previous bombings, feeling abandoned by the rest of the world. They are desperate and scared, and hence, when Hamas speaks about retribution and stopping this madness, Hamas finds an audience of sympathetic ears. If you were in the shoes of a young man in Palestine who just lost his family, you would feel the exact same way. 		>Oh no, I have a solid understanding of the why and how.		No, you don't. You are biased over which facts you choose you to accept, and you are ignorant to the political and military history and sociopolitical background of the region (Repeating "but the 6 Day War!" isn't a valid point and doesn't justify current Israeli actions whatsoever). 		>This has been enlightening, but I don't think that we are going to move each others opinions in the slightest.

{"body":"I can copypasta too!		**Via the offical ICRC rules of warfare**	[link to rules](http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul)		1. Hamas??? rocket attacks directed at Israel???s civilian population centers deliberately violates the basic principles of distinction. (Additional Protocol I, arts. 48, 51(2), 52(1).) Any doubt about this is resolved by the fact that Hamas itself has boasted of its intention to hit population centres. It is well accepted in customary international law that ???[i]ntentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking part in hostilities constitutes a war crime. (Rome Statute, art. 8(2)(b)(i)) **No need for a source that proves that Hamas rockets are directed at civilian populations because that is common knowledge and not contested by anyone.**		2. Staging of Attacks From Residential Areas and Protected Sites: The Law of Armed Conflict not only prohibits targeting an enemy???s civilians; it also requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish their combatant forces from their own civilians, and not to base operations in or near civilian structures, especially protected sites such as schools, medical facilities and places of worship. As the customary law principle is reflected in Article 51(7) of Additional Protocol I: '???The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or shield, favour or impede military operations." **No need for a source because it is common knowledge that Hamas fighters dont wear uniforms to distinguish themselves from civilians.** [Hamas uses schools, hospitals and mosques for weapons depots and headquarters](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/31/why-hamas-stores-its-weapons-inside-hospitals-mosques-and-schools/?tid=hp_mm)	[Video of Finnish reporter from Shifa hospital admitting Hamas shot rockets from just outside the hospital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-e5qWXx-k)		[Video via The Washington Post and BBC showing Hamas stores weapons and fights in civilian homes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/world/war-zones/israeli-army-releases-video-showing-arms-raid-in-gaza/2014/07/27/cb307872-1541-11e4-ac56-773e54a65906_video.html)		3. Use of Civilian Homes and Public Institutions as Bases of Operation - see (2) for citations. [Al Shifa Hospital used as Hamas headquarters](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/while-israel-held-its-fire-the-militant-group-hamas-did-not/2014/07/15/116fd3d7-3c0f-4413-94a9-2ab16af1445d_story.html)		"[Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told reporters in Geneva that Hamas was hiding rockets in schools and hospitals and launching them from areas where civilians live.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israel-presses-ahead-with-gaza-offensive-calls-up-16000-more-reservists/2014/07/31/40281e0d-819f-4ebf-9a7c-5f36bda97e36_story.html)" 		4. Misuse of Medical Facilities and Ambulances - Any time Hamas uses an ambulance to transport its fighters it is violating the Law of Armed Conflict: Under Article 23(f) of the 1907 Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which reflects customary international law, it is ???especially forbidden???[t]o make improper use of a flag of truce, ??? as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention.. Article 44 of the First Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (1949) also provides that: ?????? the emblem of the Red Cross on a white ground ???may not be employed, either in time of peace or in time of war, except to indicate or to protect the medical units and establishments??????[Video of Hamas using an ambulance to transport militants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CONdNQOn3Vk)		5. [Booby-trapping of Civilian Areas](http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/IDF-announces-three-more-Israeli-soldiers-killed-in-Gaza-368634) - see (2) for citations. 		6. Blending in with Civilians and Use of Human Shields - As the ICRC rule states, "It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives."**No need to site a source because it is common knowledge Hamas blends in with civilians**		7. Exploitation of Children - Hamas has paramilitary summer camps for kids. There are reports, from this war and previous ones, of children fighting and being used for tunnel digging. violates the Law of Armed Conflict, including prohibitions against allowing children to take part in hostilities. As customary international law is reflected in this regard in Additional Protocol I, the parties to a conflict must take "all feasible measures" to ensure that children "do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces." (Additional Protocol I, art. 77(2))[Children used to dig terror tunnels](http://www.palestine-studies.org/journals.aspx?id=11424&jid=1&href=fulltext)		>"A similarly cavalier approach to child labor and tunnel fatalities damaged the movement???s standing with human-rights groups, despite government assurances dating back to 2008 that it was considering curbs. During a police patrol that the author was permitted to accompany in December 2011, nothing was done to impede the use of children in the tunnels, where, much as in Victorian coal mines, they are prized for their nimble bodies. *At least 160 children have been killed in the tunnels*, **according to Hamas officials**. Safety controls on imports appear similarly lax, although the TAC insists that a sixteen-man contingent carries out sporadic spot-checks."		8. Interference with Humanitarian Relief Efforts - While Israel kept its end of humanitarian truces. Hamas used them to shoot rockets into Israel, including the Kerem Shalom crossing where humanitarian goods are brought into Gaza. All of these actions violate the Law of Armed Conflict, which requires parties to allow the entry of humanitarian supplies and to guarantee their safety. Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention requires parties in an armed conflict to "permit the free passage of [humanitarian] consignments and shall guarantee their protection." Article 60 of the same Convention protects the shipments from being diverted from their intended purpose, something Hamas has certainly done in the past and is reported to have done in this conflict as well. [Kerem Shalom crossing used by Hamas to kill soldiers and kidnap one](http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/The-sound-of-war-instead-of-the-silence-of-peace-369790)	"[The 72-hour cease-fire had been designed not only to allow humanitarian relief for both sides but also to pave the way for a durable truce through the discussion of demands from both sides in Cairo." This **HUMANITARIAN** truce was broken by Hamas when militants used a terror tunnel to attack the IDF and possibly kidnap a soldier](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israel-hamas-agree-to-72-hour-humanitarian-cease-fire/2014/08/01/059f1ff8-194e-11e4-9e3b-7f2f110c6265_story.html)		9. Hostage-taking - The Fourth Geneva Conventions, article 34, says flatly "The taking of hostages is prohibited." This is not an "arrest" as Israel-haters claim, and this is not a prisoner of war situation as Hamas has made clear - the purpose of Hamas' hostage-taking falls under the definition on the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages: "Any person who seizes or detains and threatens to kill, to injure or to continue to detain another person (hereinafter referred to as the "hostage") in order to compel a third party, namely, a State, an international intergovernmental organization, a natural or juridical person, or a group of persons, to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the hostage commits the offence of taking of hostages ("hostage-taking") within the meaning of this Convention." **Already answered in #8. A soldier was kidnapped yesterday.**		10. Using the uniform of the enemy. Additional Protocol I prohibits the use of enemy flags, military emblems, insignia or uniforms ???while engaging in attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations???.[3] Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, ???making improper use ??? of the flag or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy??? constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts when it results in death or serious personal injury.[4] According to some, this is considered perfidy, a war crime. (h/t Joshua) [IDF find IDF uniforms in Hamas terror tunnel](http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/Hamas-gunmen-shoot-at-IDF-from-hospital-prompting-return-fire-368599)		There are also numerous conventions that Hamas violates, but I am not sure if they reach the level of international law if they didn't sign them.		-Edited to add sources	-Edited to reply to WBYO:	**Nothing the reporter said negated the fact that a rocket was fired from the vicinity of the hospital.** Nor is Jpost an invalid source.

Nationalism of the Islamic Resistance Movement is part of its religion. Its members have been fed on that. For the sake of hoisting the banner of Allah over their homeland they fight. "Allah will be prominent, but most people do not know."		Now and then the call goes out for the convening of an international conference to look for ways of solving the (Palestinian) question. Some accept, others reject the idea, for this or other reason, with one stipulation or more for consent to convening the conference and participating in it. Knowing the parties constituting the conference, their past and present attitudes towards Moslem problems, the Islamic Resistance Movement does not consider these conferences capable of realising the demands, restoring the rights or doing justice to the oppressed. These conferences are only ways of setting the infidels in the land of the Moslems as arbitraters. When did the infidels do justice to the believers?		"But the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians, until thou follow their religion; say, The direction of Allah is the true direction. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, thou shalt find no patron or protector against Allah." (The Cow - verse 120).	**There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad.

{"body":"To all the Zionist trolls and sympathizers who continue bringing up their top four most absurd arguments to justify these latest atrocities:		**1) "Hamas fired 1,394 rockets at Israel!"**		How many rockets, missiles, tank shells, cluster bombs, white phosphorous bombs, bullets, cannons and grenades has Israel unleashed on the Palestinians? It's a sad situation and only reflective of the evident bias when you can count to the 3rd decimal point the number of Hamas projectiles but be completely clueless about Israel's arsenal.		**2) "Israel is defending itself. What would you do if someone was firing rockets at your country?!"**		A: If I occupied a people, placed a crippling trade and economic embargo on them, placed them under siege, humiliated them daily via military and police checkpoints, controlled their water and electricity, constructed apartheid "Jewish-only roads", shot their children, bombed their schools, mosques and businsses, illegally seized their lands, destroyed their crops, demolished their homes, threw thousands of them in dungeons and treated them like sub-humans and they fired rockets at me - I would probably stop doing all of the above. Secondly, Israel has been mass murdering the Palestinians for over 60 years - long before any rockets were fired and long before Hamas was even in existence. So this is nothing but a fallacy designed to deflect the reality of the situation and mislead others. Finally, Israel's indiscriminate use of heavy weaponry in civilian areas is a war crime, not self defense.		**3) "This is Hamas's fault, they use human shields. Israel doesn't target civilians!"**		A: Excuse me, when you launch an unbridled, indiscriminate attack from warships, fighter jets, tanks, artillery and helicopters on a CIVILIAN AREA - what do you expect to find there - break dancing hobbits? When you attack civilian areas, you kill civilians. It's not Advanced Chinese Mathematics.		Gaza is the most densely populated place on earth. It's an open air prison. So when Israel fires into these areas it is going to kill and maim people every time.		Secondly, according to the Israeli Human Rights group, Beit Selem which tracks both Israel and Palestinian deaths, dozens of children as young as 4 years old were killed with gunshot wounds to the HEAD AND CHEST. Not to mention the videos coming through showing snipers killing rescuers. Bombing ambulances and hospitals also has to be the most cowardly thing a military could do. So I'm afraid this "doesn't target civilians" statement doesn't hold up the facts.		**4) "Israel is the most moral and humane army in the world. Who else calls/texts people and drops leaflets warning them to evacuate before a pending attack?"**		I love this one.		"Please be notified in 5 minutes, we are going to destroy your home."	In other words, Israel publicly announces to thousands of civilians their full intent to perpetrate yet another war crime and you're asking us to somehow acknowledge this as some type of humane gesture? The gall.	How about a murderer "notify" their victims by sending them text messages/leaflets that they're coming shortly to murder them - does it make it any less perverse? If this is the level of desperation Zionists and their sympathizers have stooped to, then it's little wonder public opinion is God willing, starting to turn against them.		As for "evacuating"...		Have you seen a map of Gaza? If so, could you please explain to me where the Palestinians are supposed to "evacuate" to? To the north and east, they are blocked by Israeli walls and military checkpoints. To the south is Egypt's closed crossing thanks to Israel's slave, Sissy. To the west is the Mediterranean Sea. So what do they do, swim for it and hope they can make it to Cyprus or Turkey before Israel "defends itself" again and machine guns them all in the water?		Go to a UN shelter? Wait, they tried that already TWICE - once in Qana, Lebanon and once in Gaza a few years ago and Israel "defended itself" by bombing the shelters massacring a total of 352 civilians. Add to this, Israel's naval and air forces who have killed thousands of people are constantly patrolling the areas. They are surrounded from every imaginable direction and you sit from the comfort of your sofa sipping $8 coffee then froth at the mouth demanding they evacuate.
