{"body":"They're extremely racist towards non-Han Chinese Chinese minorities, if that makes sense.  Han Chinese are the ~92% majority with the other ~8% made up of roughly 53 officially recognized ethnic minorities.  Even Han-Chinese farming families that move into the city are looked down upon and treated horribly for being poor.		Our permanent guide (1.5 month) basically told us that no one trusts them and that they will lie, cheat, and steal.  Oddly, she treated our half-Han or non-Han short term guides decently, probably because they were professional equals, but she was extremely cold towards our Tibetan guides.  I'm not just going off of our experience with her, but also with the people who jeered and yelled racial slurs at performing minorities at a few shows we attended.		Most people were very accommodating, as you said.  I'd definitely go back.  There were a ton of fun and exciting experiences we had and generally speaking, we were treated very well.","depth":11,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bl1nds1ght","name":"t1_crrwo3j","parent_id":"t1_crrv6up","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433176323,"created_utc":1433172723}

{"body":"Well, I can't speak to the European/Gypsy relationship.  All I can say is that 8% of the Chinese population is a shitton of people, so many of the minorities with whom we interacted were just like normal people who owned shops or were guides, performers, or students.  They may also be from religious minorities, as well (Uyghurs).  It's just that they were also looked down upon.  My very limited understanding of Gypsy culture is that there aren't very many of them, that they typically beg or pester people, and that they aren't necessarily trying to assimilate into the majority culture or contribute to society.  That's the impression I get, anyway.  It could be totally wrong.		I don't think it's a fair comparison, at the very least because there are simply so many ethnic minorities in China and they can be so vastly different from one another, whereas the Gypsies are one specific minority.  Han Chinese may view them in a way that is similar to how the Gypsies are viewed, perhaps.","depth":13,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bl1nds1ght","name":"t1_crryblr","parent_id":"t1_crrxmgb","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433179094,"created_utc":1433175494}

One owner is a smoker and wants to allow smoking in his establishment.  This business owner should be able to allow smoking in his establishment since he owns it.		The second bar owner does not like smoking and he wants to ban smoking in his establishment he should be able to since he owns his business.		Now you have 2 bars that cater to different types of customers.  People that want to smoke in a bar will go to Bar 1, were as people that do not want smoking in the bar can go to Bar 2 were it is banned.  There is a win win for the establishment/bar owners and the people as they have a choice to choose which establishment they want to spend there money in.  This is free market!		Now for the workers.  They also have the freedom to choose were they want to work.  If the worker is concerned about their well being and the health effects of working in a smoking environment then they need not apply and work there.  No one is forcing them to work in that environment.  		Once again this is free market, as the owner of Bar 1 in the example will have a smaller pool of employees to choose from that are willing to work in that environment.  Consequently the owner of Bar 1 may have trouble finding employees which would be market forces acting on his business.  This could cause him to look at changing his own policy to generate more business from non smokers.		As I stated before the government does not need to regulate and make everyone safe.  Let people make their own choices and personal decisions and have personal responsibility take over.  This is just common sense.		>Public perception only influences the profits of the few most famous organisations.		>If a company has to chose between more customers or healthy employees, the free market will punish the company who chooses healthier workers 9 times out of 10.		Incorrect as stated above public perception would be a big influence on bars/restaurants.  Since there are big pushes from organizations to have more healthy lifestyles consumers would pick and choose which establishments that have similar values as your own to visit which would hurt bars/restaurants that still allow smoking since they will not spend their money there(another one for free market).

I'm informed that the law says people aren't supposed to ride bikes on the sidewalk, like this lady was, but they do it anyway, especially during rush hour.		"Well if that's the law, then I should be in the clear. Sure we're in an intersection, but she was going from one section of sidewalk to the next.

For example, it's widely known that sharks are dangerous, but in America more people died to vending machines than sharks.  Does this mean that we should shift our attention to vending machines?

Restaurants had smoking sections, and bars and coffee shops were pretty much free-for-alls when it came to smoking.  		In fact, when Tim Horton's banned smoking in their coffee shops nationwide sometime back in the nineties, it made national news and some people were predicting catastrophic repercussions as smokers fled elsewhere.		The condo I currently live in, built sometime in the late eighties, even had ashtrays built into the walls in every hallway by the elevators, though they have long since been removed.

{"body":">wages aren't all that great		That depends. There are a emerging class of business owners that are wealthy enough to buy multi-million dollar estates in USA, canada, and Europe. For the regular people, [the average annual income is about 56339.00 yuan](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/china/wages), which is brutally low if converted to USD. But it's definitely a [livable wage](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=China&city=Guangzhou). Do remember that unlike USA, nuclear families are the cultural norm in China. Father and mother and grandparents and grandkids all live together or close together and share resources, which include money. For those that are struggling to make ends meet, there are [social safety nets](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21600160-pensions-crisis-looms-china-looks-raising-retirement-age-paying-grey) and government programs to help aleive the burden. It is a communistic goverment, after all. 		Wages aren't great but it makes up that things are cheap. Last time I was there, I can buy a month's mobile service (phone, text and unlimited data) for about 20RMB, a decent meal for about 14RMB, and clothing so cheap that the locals told me buy to wear, throw it away to buy more. It's cheaper than washing it. Also, the lack of sales 	tax really stretches the ~~dollar~~ yuan.		>housing is expensive and small		Housing is expensive and small in NYC too. But with that same amount of money, you can buy a mansion in Montana. Same concept. Supply and demand. But do note that, again, if you are a citizen, there are heavy government subsidization for housing in the cities. And some employers provide their own subsidized or free room and food to the employees. That's something that's uncommon in the West, but very common over there.		>you've got to keep an eye out for artificial food (also, gutter oil)		You ever got diarrhea from eating a hotdog stand hotdog? I did. Not fun. You ever walked into a restaurant kitchen and see how disgusting it looks? Same concept. You have the basic assumption that food is clean and regulated. That is not always the case.

{"body":"One of the most common places to encounter smoking is when trying to enter a large building. Often there will be groups of smokers putting up a moat of smoke around every entrance.		Another one is walking along the street with a smoker walking at the same pace as you 50 m in front and the wind blowing in your direction, leaving you permanently in his smoke wake unless you run to catch up or take a detour.		Or being in a crowd at some outside event. Even if only a few percent of the people in the crowd is smoking, that is enough to cover the whole crowd in smoke. To avoid it, you have to give up attending and push your way out of the crowd.		Or trying to sleep with an open window in the summer, and having the neighbor's smoke coming in and waking you up every 30 min when he goes for a smoking break.		I've also often experienced people smoking just before going on the bus and rushing aboard it with their lungs filled with tobacco smoke, which they then fill the bus with when they exhale.		When waiting at a bus stop I try to position myself such that I'm not inside the smoke cloud produced by the smokers who wait for the same bus, but due to the local wind direction typically changing a few times per minute due to turbulence, that is a difficult task. (What do you mean by "smoking the other way"?)		I shudder at how bad things would be if there were no smoking regulation. Smokers are desensitized to the smell of tobacco smoke, and do not realize how far it reaches. Few think about where the smoke goes, and those who do rarely consider turbulence. 		Tobacco smoke stings my eyes, irritates my throat and sometimes gives me hiccups. It smells worse than farts, worse than shit, worse than a garbage truck, worse than car exhaust and about as bad as raw gasoline fumes. I've been trapped for hours at an african airport where smoking was allowed inside, and it was a very unpleasant experience.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"amaurea","name":"t1_crsuug2","parent_id":"t1_crrssqj","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433247003,"created_utc":1433243403}
{"body":"What are you suggesting then? Ok, you don't like tobacco smoke, but  to want for it to just vanish is highly unreasonable. The fact that there are designated areas (even unwritten) for smoking are a good way to segregate the smokers from non-smokers. I don't see what kind of point you are trying to make, yes, in many cases people were idiots and didn't understand they were bothering you, so what? You can't expect every human being to be reasonable with what they're doing and you can't equally expect other people that have nothing to do with that behaviour to be held responsible just because they share the same activity.		What if you were making that argument about smoke coming from vehicles? What, so no cars anymore would be a solution? I've actually never had anyone in real life complain to me or to any of my friends about being smoked upon. Also, yes, second-hand smoke is a thing, but its relevance is highly overrated, due to people being uncomfortable with other people smoking and wanting to reason with them with a point besides "I don't like it".		I like to have a smoke before classes at my uni, I do. I do my best to not bother anyone with it and I don't think I ever did. Smoking exists, face it, it's an immutable part of Society, so people just need to learn to live in civilization and manage something in between no one smoking nowhere and everyone smoking everywhere. I don't think that the former is the answer to anything, much less tobacco smoking which is a common interest between a big chunk of people. I'm all in favour in trying to avoid other people being harmed by it, I'm all in favour of restaurants being able to choose whether they want to allow people smoking inside them or not, I'm all in favour of places like the subway or any kind of closed spaces in which both smokers and non-smokers coexist to be completely smoke-free.

Very rarely you see someone smoking where he's not supposed to. There are fines for both, the owner of the public place and the smoker himself for around 700 euros. This is a very heavy fine for most people and most decide there's not point risking it even if I've never heard of anyone getting finned. 	The police visit bars at night often, mostly when they're open past the closing hour. They can be and sometimes are really picky so most bars just enforce most laws, the smoking one included. Specifically, should you light one up where you're not supposed to, people will tell you to put it off, insult you or threat to call the cops. Make no mistake, if they do, the cops will come and heavily fine you. Also, you're not ever allowed to smoke in a bar on the counter even if this is a smoking bar. Thats the place where the barman hangs most often. This is to protect the barman from constant smoke.		Smoking inside hospitals or health related places is very much forbidden and expect serious enforcement if you do.		Most smokers don't enjoy having to come out to the cold for a smoke at some places but its a mild annoyance. Most do understand smoking is something harmful so the law errs in the side of what's best for you. If that means smokers need to relocate themselves for a cig, so be it.","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"kaynpayn","name":"t1_crrxvqo","parent_id":"t3_3821qn","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433178365,"created_utc":1433174765}

{"body":"There are 2 thing that simply scare the ever-loving piss out of me:		1) People who went through D.A.R.E. and let the brainwashing succeed. Never had the self awareness to realize that they were chanting taglines to compete for pencils. Never went home and checked on the validity of the taglines they had been chanting.		2) People who know how many outright lies are perpetuated by D.A.R.E. and other prohibition movements, but still support it because they have low self esteem and want to join any movement that creates an underclass they can lord over.		I moved half way through fifth grade and again after 6th. In the school I moved to during fifth, there was an AMAZING campus officer "teaching D.A.R.E." Most of her D.A.R.E. curriculum was on the *science* that opposed D.A.R.E. claims. She went through her D.A.R.E. "factsheet" and categorically demonstrated how, according to research, all of the bullet points were vague approximations of the truth that amounted to sensationalism and lies. Made sure to express "they have their hearts in the right place, but they allow their emotions to carry them away, and that causes them to start lying, which is not right."		Then she went on to teach us about the reality of drugs. How *because of prohibition* drugs were a terrible thing to get involved with because you would likely be dealing with criminals and getting yourself involved in criminal activity to get the drugs.		She went on to teach us about addiction. How it isn't some plague that needs to be beaten out of people with an iron fist and lies, but rather, a common human condition that everyone deals with in one capacity or another, and that a good person always works to keep their addictions under control and supports others in the same effort, and that the first step to do those things is to realize that addicted people aren't evil, they are addicted which is a sign that they need *more* compassion than others, and berating them is only going to make the problem worse.		She then went on to tell us about her mother, who smoked like a chimney her entire life. It ruined her voice, it made her home smell like cigarette smoke, but that she was overall relatively healthy until she got hit with severe clinical depression. That is when she developed cancer and died. 		She taught us that for all her experience as a police officer, and for all she had seen in her life, while cigarettes clearly didn't help, she truly believed that the root cause of virtually all cancer was low self esteem and depression, because while she met a ton of smokers, some old, some young, some with cancer, some without, the common thread she saw with all of the cancer patients she had known was severe depression and self-deprecation issues.		After laying out all of these lessons, and expressing her deep seated disagreements with D.A.R.E.'s tactics, she spent the remainder of the lessons doing exercises for us to realize and remember how awesome we are, because she felt that was the best way to help us avoid cancer.		I have spent a good chunk of my life researching various drugs. Cause and effect of those drugs in a true, non-propaganda, scholarly research sense. Just so I can offer compassion and accurate insight to try and combat all of the mindless, ignorant, hateful prohibition zealots out there.		I would nominate that woman for sainthood if I could.		TL;DR: Went through D.A.R.E. every year starting in kindergarten. Ate it up. Then I moved half way through fifth grade and an amazing police officer actually taught some kids the truth of the matter instead of reading the lies off of the D.A.R.E. curriculum sheet.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Melkath","name":"t1_crrzhhr","parent_id":"t1_crrw654","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1433180973,"created_utc":1433177373}

The problem with statistics they push like "45 times more likely to die of lung cancer" is that if your baseline chances of getting some disease are almost nil it doesn't take much of an absolute risk to come out with a massively increased risk over baseline.		Anyway, I tell myself this because I smoke, and this leads me to believe that in fact, the odds are that I won't get cancer. I tried to quit several times and it just wasn't worth it.
