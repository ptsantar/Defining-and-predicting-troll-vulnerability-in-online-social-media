{"body":"Ya know I think Islam Is a pretty sweet religion but I think a lot of people are missing the point. My dad told me a relevant story about when Chinese laborers where immigrating in large amounts into British Columbia. A lot of people in Victoria and Vancouver didn't like them because whenever they bought land they would cut down trees because back in china it was considered a sign of poverty to have a tree on your land. The problem was that if they moved into a neighborhood they would get rid of all the trees and shrubs making the place unappealing and debeatifying. So people complained and yelled saying things along the lines of "they don't want to integrate!" and to an extent it was true. So they got harassed to high hell until eventually the Chinese community got together and decided on what course of action to take. Here's the kicker, instead of going "You should respect our rights." or "We are being oppressed!"(Which they most definitely where) They gathered and said "what can we do to make these people like us and accept us." Lo and behold Chinese families started replanting trees, hedges and shrubs all over the place. I'd say that the Chinese had every right to complain and do what they please with their land but instead they reached out and took into account what the local community wanted. Despite all the hate that they received they just wanted to come here and appreciate all the benefits of their new country. They had deep seated cultural perceptions and thoughts but at the end of the day they wanted to be Canadians. They realized what was acceptable back home isn't acceptable here. So Instead of complaining and not accepting their new countries values they whole heartily integrated them into their own and creating syncretism. Now B.C has very proud and vibrant Chinese community. I???m not saying that all Muslims refuse to integrate; a lot do and are prosperous. However when we talk about values that you bring from another country/ brought up natively that clash with values and customs of your host country but take full advantage of the benefits that such values bring you cannot complain about being ostracized. It???s a give and take. Here in Canada this has worked well and I think the Muslim population here is not only very forward but also an exceptional benefit. It???s important to realize that they and many others do what I think some Muslims and other groups should do: identify yourself as a Frenchmen, German, Canadian, American etc. first and as a Catholic, Baptist, Shia, Sunni, Buddhist or Hindu second.

Just like not all Russians are anti Americans and all Americans aren't anti Islam, all French aren't bakers... goes on and on haha, but seriously. The issue is Islam right now, and allow me to explain before you hate and downvote. Religions, all religions go through phases, birth, unification, expansion, division, re-birth. Currently it is in a state of division, much like the Catholic Church went through during the great schism. These periods are often violent, in the past far more then the current one. However, until Islam grows out of this phase and the other non radical sects stand up to this issue, someone addresses the problems in the book that leads those to believe in radicalism, or the entire religion matures. The problem will not go away. There needs to be reform in Islam, but not like this, what radicals are trying to do is go backwards while others want to make progress into a more Modern Islam. It takes people to make this change though, until non-radicals stand up to snuff out those who are trying to maim and hurt others over their beliefs Islam will not know peace, and the world will continue to have to deal with the problem child in the room. The fact of the matter is this isn't the Middle Ages anymore, woman should be able to work and live their lives, people should be able to make fun of your religion without taking offence, you can't cut someone's head off with a sword as PUNISHMENT.

{"body":"People will easily condemn Islam or immigrants or Muslims, with a few nuanced descriptors, in the aftermath of a tragedy.		The more intolerant and ignorant among us will use that rhetoric to incite and commit unjustified retribution against an entire religious group. However, that doesn't mean the first group doing the initial condemning was actually exercising hate speech, because generally that requires a reasonable person to interpret the language as inciting violence when the reality today is that such violence is being committed by unreasonable people.		The smarter response would be to tighten immigration policies to permit those willing and able to work and integrate (or assimilate), and implement more comprehensive post-arrival programs that encourage further integration and employment for immigrants. These are things that any country should be entitled to do, and many do and, as a result, are not so at risk of this growing global extremist problem.		Oh, if all countries that are part of the EU alerted eachother when an EU citizen traveled to a god damn war zone... Not pointing any fingers. Is it some kind of human right to allow a citizen to fight in a war elsewhere in the world that is not in anyway affiliated with your home country? Is it a human right to allow an immigrant to go fight a war and then return whenever they want (I hope this isn't allowed already)? Is it acceptable that militants can go abroad and kill people, as citizens or immigrants, and be allowed to return? I think not. I think the West have waken up to these loopholes though, and are starting to close them.		Is it too late for the immigration reforms I mentioned earlier? Probably. Europe may be in for a very rude awakening resulting from their historically more relaxed policies, and I'm not sure it is going to end pretty for Muslims... Recent European history isn't exactly representative of a measured or rational response to rising ethnic or religious tensions and growing intolerance.		Merkel may be right, the multiculturalism approach is looking like a failed experiment. You should be allowed to restrict those who move into your country to only those willing to live in a multicultural society that is governed by secular laws.		Not doing so has given extremists a foot-hold in European countries, which is threatening the way of life for everyone, including moderate Muslims. It takes very, very, few violent actors to create conditions that necessitate the need for increased security and surveillance, and a reduction in freedoms and rights.		So while there needs to be a response to domestic jihadism, an equally pronounced response needs to also be made targeting those who are literally attacking Muslim communities, because such attacks only foster more anti-Western attitudes which creates a vicious feed-back loop.
