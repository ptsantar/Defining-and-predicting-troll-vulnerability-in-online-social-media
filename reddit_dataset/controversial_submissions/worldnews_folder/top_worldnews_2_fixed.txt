And come on, I'm a white Jew from New York who always wears a condom... I highly doubt I was gonna catch HIV just for having my whole penis...		Edit:		Since my comment got so popular, I'll cite my source		"Another medical myth out there is about how people seem to think that circumcision prevents HIV.  There were three methodologically flawed studies done in Sub-Saharan Africa years ago that showed that after a circumcision, a man had a slightly smaller change of contracting HIV.  The actual changes were from numbers around a 2.3% to 1.5% chance, which is a very unimpressive change.  This chance in absolute risk is actually well within the margin for error in medical studies, but to get around this, the publishers of the studies used relative risk calculations, and called changes like these ???a 60% reduction.???  On top of that, the publishers of the studies failed to account for the fact that the recently circumcised men had to abstain from sexual intercourse for a long period of time, in at least one study they received free doctor-patient counseling about safe sex practices and condoms at every wound checkup visit, and that the studies were so short in length.  It is a fact that therapies become statistically less effective as time goes on, and the fact that these studies were self-admittedly cut short is alarming."		http://barreloforanges.com/2012/07/17/the-unspoken-aspects-of-having-a-foreskin-a-guest-post-by-life-intact/		It's a great read actually","depth":1,"score":147,"ups":147,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"awesomedan24","name":"t1_cmdjp0o","parent_id":"t1_cmdj32d","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417010458,"created_utc":1417010458}

It detracts from the mental aspects of sex and also the connection with the other person that can add a lot to the experience. 		I don't have to worry about any of that and can fully immerse myself mentally and physically without any concern to what I'm concentrating on by attempting some diversionary tactics to prolong sex. I mean, if I'm really turned on I can still cum quickly and the strongest orgasms usually cause the most sensation at the base of my penis, then my balls and then throughout my body. So I can't imagine that sensation really changing (being that it is neurological) and would go as far to say that those orgasms really only happen because I've got more freedom to become mentally centred in the moment instead of trying to divert my mind away from what I'm actually doing... or whom I'm with.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ignore_me_im_high","name":"t1_cmdmpl6","parent_id":"t1_cmdlytx","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417017512,"created_utc":1417017512}

Not to mention that PC exercises only work as something to prevent an imminent ejaculation and do nothing to allow you greater freedom leading up to that point.

{"body":"> Myth: Circumcision prevents HIV/AIDS.		>Reality check:  Three studies in Africa several years ago that claimed that circumcision prevented AIDS and that circumcision was as effective as a 60% effective vaccine (Auvert 2005, 2006). These studies had many flaws, including that they were stopped before all the results came in.  There have also been several studies that show that circumcision does not prevent HIV (Connolly 2008). There are many issues at play in the spread of STDs which make it very hard to generalize results from one population to another. 		>In Africa, where the recent studies have been done, most HIV transmission is through male-female sex, but in the USA, it is mainly transmitted through blood exposure (like needle sharing) and male-male sex.  Male circumcision does not protect women from acquiring HIV, nor does it protect men who have sex with men (Wawer 2009, Jameson 2009).		>What's worse, because of the publicity surrounding the African studies, men in Africa are now starting to believe that if they are circumcised, they do not need to wear condoms, which will increase the spread of HIV (Westercamp 2010).  Even in the study with the most favorable effects of circumcision, the protective effect was only 60% - men would still have to wear condoms to protect themselves and their partners from HIV. 		>In the USA, during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, about 85% of adult men were circumcised (much higher rates of circumcision than in Africa), and yet HIV still spread. 		>It is important to understand, too, that the men in the African studies were adults and they volunteered for circumcision.

If you think they shouldn't be allowed to do that (and I'm pretty sure they aren't in most jurisdictions), keep in mind that the foreskin is much more sensitive than those, and that circumcision is the removal of a functional organ, not piercing one.","depth":3,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Steppdeckenwolf","name":"t1_cmdko6z","parent_id":"t1_cmdjxzf","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417013047,"created_utc":1417013047}

Removing the male equivalent of the clitoris would be to remove the whole head of the penis. To other cultures a female circumcision means to remove the labia minora and majora as well as sew the vulva closed thus making sex impossible and only leaving the ability to urinate. These types of female circumcision can result in infection, chronic pain and infertility. So it really makes sense for their to be a ban on female circumcision while imo not so much male.

The cost of postneonatal circumcision was 10-fold the cost of neonatal circumcision63. There are also studies showing very marginal cost-effectiveness.	A 2010 study estimated that newborn circumcision reduces a U.S. male???s lifetime risk of HIV acquisition through heterosexual contact by 15.7% overall, by 20.9% for black males, 12.3% for Hispanic males, and 7.9% for white males. In this model, the number of circumcisions needed to prevent one case of HIV was 298 for all males and ranged from 65 for black males to 1,231 for white males.

{"body":"From your own source.		Studies of whether circumcision of males reduces HIV transmission to their female sex partners overall indicate no protective effect.		A RCT of male circumcision in Uganda found no evidence of reduced HIV transmission to female partners. In the study, 922 HIV-infected men with uninfected partners were assigned to either immediate or delayed circumcision. Overall, 18% of women in the intervention group (partners in the immediate circumcision group) acquired HIV during follow-up, compared with 12% of women assigned to the control group (partners in the delayed circumcision group). There was no difference in HIV incidence between the circumcised and control groups when the couples waited to resume sex until the wound had healed, which in 93% of male subjects was within 6 weeks of circumcision.20 However, women appeared to be at somewhat higher risk for HIV acquisition when the couples resumed sex before the circumcision wounds had healed, although this difference was not statistically significant.		A systematic review and meta-analysis of male circumcision and risk of transmission to women identified 19 studies from 11 populations.21 The meta-analysis of data from the one RCT and six longitudinal analyses showed little evidence that male circumcision directly affects the risk of transmitting HIV to women (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.53-1.36).

In circumstances in which there are potential benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to the child???s current well-being, parents should determine what is in the best interest of the child.		Meaning that it procedure isn't recommended as a standard.  But isn't at all harmful and can be safely performed at parents discretion.		Equating this to Female Genital Mutilation is unequal in ALL regards as the number of females born with a clitoral hood that would cause the need for its removal is extremely low.  And the wide ban on all FGM prevents backward attitudes about women's sexual proclivity from allowing people to have procedures done that would adversely effect a girl's sexual development.  By that I mean parents from a sect of belief that women should never be allowed to experience pleasure in sex cannot take their little girl to a doctor to have the clitoral hood removed and maybe the doctor take's a little too much off "accidentally".","depth":10,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"buddascrayon","name":"t1_cmds3kt","parent_id":"t1_cmdoa1r","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417028406,"created_utc":1417028406}

{"body":"> Banning of religious symbols and traditions no matter how "barbaric" it may seem to you is stupid and causes more mistrust and hate within a population.		Well, I agree that this will be unpopular with a lot of people but so where other things. E.g. a lot of people were in favor of slavery and we still got rid of it. I don't see why we should give so much freedom to religion. Religion tends to cause problems, so it should be regulated more strictly. I don't mind if people want to pray to what every they pray in the living rooms but I do mind if the do and demand things that affect other people without having any proof that these things are useful. E.g. none of the religious people can proof that cutting of parts of your penis helps you get in to heaven or is appreciated by some god. In fact, they can't proof that heaven or a god exists and if they could it would still be very questionable to support a god that makes people cutting of parts of the penis. Why does god even care about penises? And why didn't god create men without foreskin in the first place? So basically god screwed up and now god is blaming us for not fixing god's problems? It makes no sense...		> It's easy to look at religion as a primitive set of codes and ethics but then you are doing the same thing that led to the genocide of millions of Native Americas. 		What?! I'm not proposing that we murder anyone!? I'm just saying we should stop with the penis cutting. I highly doubt that anyone would die from not having his foreskin cut off... Also there was no 'genocide of millions of Native Americas', they mostly died of disease (and it's not that the Europeans could have known that in advance), from wikipedia:		> From the 1490s when Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas to the end of the 19th century, the indigenous population of the Western Hemisphere declined, mostly from disease, to 1.8 million from around 50 million, a decline of 96%.[36] In Brazil alone, the indigenous population declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated 3 million to some 300,000 (1997).[37][38] Estimates of how many people were living in the Americas when Columbus arrived have varied tremendously; 20th century scholarly estimates ranged from 8.4 million to 112.5 million.[39] However, Robert Royal stated, "estimates of pre-Columbian population figures have become heavily politicized with scholars who are particularly critical of Europe and/or Western civilization often favoring wildly higher figures."[40]		> Epidemic disease was the overwhelming direct cause of the population decline of the American natives.[41][42] After first contacts with Europeans and Africans, the death of 90 to 95 percent of the native population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases such as smallpox and measles.[43] Some estimates indicate that smallpox had a 80???90% fatality rate in Native American populations.[44]		> British commander Jeffery Amherst may have authorized the intentional use of disease as a biological weapon against indigenous populations during the Siege of Fort Pitt.[45][46] It was the only documented case of germ warfare and it is uncertain whether it successfully infected the target population.[47]		> Some historians argue that genocide, as a crime of intent, does not describe the colonization experience. Stafford Poole, a research historian, wrote: "There are other terms to describe what happened in the Western Hemisphere, but genocide is not one of them. It is a good propaganda term in an age where slogans and shouting have replaced reflection and learning, but to use it in this context is to cheapen both the word itself and the appalling experiences of the Jews and Armenians, to mention but two of the major victims of this century."[48] Holocaust scholar and political scientist Guenter Lewy rejects the label of genocide and views the depopulation of the Americas as "not a crime but a tragedy".[49] Likewise, Noble David Cook writing about the Black Legend wrote "There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact."[50]		> By contrast, David Stannard argued that the destruction of the American aboriginals from 76 million down to a quarter-million over 4 centuries, in a "string of genocide campaigns", killing "countless tens of millions", was the most massive genocide in world history.[51] Several works on the subject were released around the year 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Columbus' voyage.		> In 2003, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch??vez urged Latin Americans to not celebrate the Columbus Day holiday. Chavez blamed Columbus for leading to the alleged genocide.[52]		> David Quammen likened colonial American practices toward Native Americans to those of Australia toward its aboriginal populations, calling both genocide.[53]","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"whitepalms85","name":"t1_cme23cv","parent_id":"t1_cmdqflu","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417049019,"created_utc":1417049019}

The point is no children's genitals should be being mutilated. I don't think the question of degrees is necessary.

The procedure may be recommended in older boys and men to treat phimosis (the inability to retract the foreskin) or to treat an infection of the penis.		This is a very vague and deflective statement, and I am sure someone will point out the first sentence. Yes, some uncircumcised men need to be circumcised for medical reasons, and there are a lot of circumcised men with no medical issues (besides having mutilated genitals); that does not mean circumcision should be the norm. It is, in most cases, an unnecessary surgery.","depth":6,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"serious_sarcasm","name":"t1_cmdo1ub","parent_id":"t1_cmdmrda","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417020088,"created_utc":1417020088}

Did you come to that conclusion on some website against circumcision I assume?  I was a nurse, I have seen a fair amount of penises in my day and I can tell you first hand there are a lot more issues involved with infections / bacteria and other issues in an uncut penis.

Army urologists stated ???Had these patients been circumcised before induction [into the Army] this total would have been close to zero???.  In the Second World War Australia had to send urologists to circumcise all of its troops fighting in the North African campaign who were not already circumcised [Short, 2006]. Similarly sand was a problem for uncircumcised men during the Gulf War in Iraq (???Desert Storm???) in the early 1990s [Gardner, 1991; Schoen, 2007e].  		Yeah no hygiene problems there.		You are probably not circumcised unless you honestly care that much to have foreskin. I have sex, it feels good, whats the problem? 			2. My second paragraph is about you saying "archaic religious doctrine" you base this off of some thing thinking it deals with religious when in its routes it didnt and in many cultures it was done for hygiene.

Yes, it's an elective procedure a baby can't consent to. It's also extremely low-risk and imparts some well-evidenced benefits. 		I do agree I could have some kind of bias I'm unaware of, but that doesn't just go one way, and physicians in other countries where it isn't routine may have a bias in the other direction. At the end of the day, I really think it depends on where a physician places the most value: on the ethical responsibility to ensure personal consent for elective procedures (particularly those on one's genitals) or on inferring health benefits that may be lost by the time consent for the procedure may be obtained. I think it's *very* possible that societal biases may strengthen a physician's conviction in either direction, but I don't know what I can do to ameliorate that effect beyond what I feel is the most ethically responsible decision based on the literature. 		As for the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes: we don't actually routinely screen newborn girls for it, or screen at all unless there's a family history indicative of the possibility of a heritable cancer. A preventive mastectomy would also be impossible in an infant, since there's essentially no breast tissue to remove. All that aside, in a hypothetical situation in which it were possible, I'd refer to the literature, and if it conferred a benefit over a mastectomy at a later period in life, I'd absolutely choose it for my child.

{"body":"I was talking about my future children, yes, and i will absolutely be vaccinating my female children. Unfortunately, I have no impact on other women's choice to vaccinate THEIR children for HPV beyond medical advice, and their risk can still be reduced by being circumcised or having circumcised partners, which was my point. If I had my way, the HPV vaccine would be nationally mandatory, but politicians have a bad track record of listening to doctors wherever topics even tangentially related to sex are concerned.		I discussed the theories behind why the cancer risk is lost with adult circumcision with my teachers at school, because I had the same question. You're right that infection (both HIV and HPV, and presumably other STIs as well) is associated with increased risk, so part of it may have to do with the onset of sexual activity. However, inflammation also can increase the risk, so another hypothesis is that chronic inflammation from poor hygiene (and resultant smegma accumulation) in childhood and adolescence contributes to cancer risk, such that the 'damage has already been done' by adulthood in the absence of young circumcision, and can't be undone by having the procedure as an adult. 		On my phone now, but I recall reading a paper last year that analyzed the 'cost-benefit' of the procedure and found it to still be beneficial (it compared rates of penile cancer cases preventable with circumcision to rates of severe botched circumcisions). I will look it up later. The clear shortcoming of the paper is that, on the one hand, it didn't include rates of STI contraction preventable with circumcision, and on the other also failed to include sexual quality of life for those who didn't have botched procedures. And this is why I admit that this issue has serious compelling arguments in either direction. 		I agree with you that it is unethical in the absence of compelling circumstances, and an area with high HIV rates is so undeniably compelling that i would actually actively recommend the procedure in such areas. However, I don't think the health benefits should be minimized even in first world countries, and I think it's appropriate that each set of parents decide for themselves whether those benefits are compelling enough to outweigh the ethical issue of performing an elective procedure on a person too young to consent. I myself am uncomfortably aware of the prevalence of unsafe sex even among people who should know better, and a procedure that might decrease my future child's risk of getting or spreading STIs is pretty damn compelling. 		An earlier reply to my comment pointed out that the reduced rate of transmission is unhelpful in monogamous relationships with a partner who had a silent STI. I noted that it complements sex ed and HPV acclimation rather than substitutes for it, so in first word countries it is actually arguably most helpful for those who practice safe sex some to most of the time, as it can reduce the risk of transmission on the times when, for instance, a condom breaks or a person engages in uncharacteristic unsafe sex.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"littlebutmighty","name":"t1_cmdqlad","parent_id":"t1_cmdpagm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417025626,"created_utc":1417025626}

Lots of people have babies that won't fall asleep. They don't assume the baby is in pain. 		It's extremely common to use sugar water as an infant pain reliever.

"We consider it to be an assault on these boys," said Staffan Janson, chairman of the committee for ethical issues and childrens' rights. Children are unable to form a decision in the matter. Circumcision is an attack on boys' integrity. "It's such a complicated and difficult question, but even so, we've decided that this is a procedure to be done away with," Janson said."It's a mutilation of a child unable to decide for himself." 			2006 BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION		"The BMA does not believe that parental preference alone constitutes sufficient grounds for performing a surgical procedure on a child unable to express his own view. Parental preference must be weighed in terms of the child's interests. . . . The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it. . . . Some doctors may wish to not perform circumcisions for reasons of conscience. Doctors are under no obligation to comply with a request to circumcise a child." 	2010 ROYAL AUSTRALASIAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS		"Ethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it is recognized that the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the infant is unable to consent. After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand."	"The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."	"The potential harms include contravention of individual rights, loss of choice, loss of function, procedural and psychological complications. . . . A boy circumcised as an infant may deeply resent this when he grows older; he may want what he cannot have -- not to have been circumcised. . . . The option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered. . . . The ethical merit of this option is that it seeks to respect the child's physical integrity, and capacity for autonomy by leaving the options open for him to make his own autonomous choice in the future." 		2010 ROYAL DUTCH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION		"There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds. . . . Contrary to what is often thought, circumcision entails the risk of medical and psychological complications. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity. . . . Complications in the area of sexuality have also been reported as have extreme pain experiences in newborns causing behavioral changes which are still apparent years later. Similarly, the high social costs of circumcision as a result of complications have been cited. . . . The foreskin is a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation. The many attempts by men to restore their foreskins by mechanical or surgical means also contradict the idea that the foreskin is a useless part of the body." 		2008 DOCTORS OPPOSING CIRCUMCISION		"We recommend that the genital integrity of boys be preserved.

{"body":"> and it's not a mutilation		How is it not? Sorry, you might find circumcision to be a non-issue, but you have never had a non-circumcised penis to compare it to. I am sure the girls who are circumcised at a very early age probably wouldn't care too much either, because that's how they grew up, it's what they know. They never had a chance to experience life without the mutilation. While a circumcised male can still get pleasure from sex you are still cutting off skin and nerves, as well as desensitizing the head of the penis. Men who were circumcised later in life after having had sex uncircumcised  generally report a lose of sensation, so it's not like it doesn't happen, it just isn't enough to cause sex to be unpleasurable. 		If you have a son and there is no medical reason to circumcise I dont see that you have any right as a parent to force it on your child, he is not making the choice, why WOULD he make the choice? It's a cultural/religious thing that has no real benefits, back 1000+ years ago it was used to help keep bacteria down, but with modern showers that is NOT a concern.

{"body":"Circumcision can impact sex enjoyment for men too. I've had it, it's really hard for me to reach orgasm through penetration. In the beginning when I started being active, I had no idea why it wasn't working and it's really the kind of concern nobody should have to go through.		For almost a year my girlfriend and I tried to figure it out. We were wondering if the condoms were too thick (extra-thin ones made no difference and we ended up doing it without a condom before getting tested, out of frustration and worry).		When not using condoms didn't help much, we started wondering if she was too loose for me (she really felt bad about that and tried finding ways to tighten herself such as kegel exercises, etc.), if I was addicted to masturbation and the real thing just couldn't do it for me, if my penis just wasn't working...		I also had concerns this could indicate I had other problems, especially that maybe I was sterile.		After about a year we basically went "Ok, so what? Let's just have sex, and if I have to finish by hand to have an orgasm, so be it". It was OK, I wished I could finish inside her sometimes for the intimacy of it but oh well... We were together 4 years the first time I orgasmed only from penetration. And it's still a rare occurrence, I need a lot of psychological arousal.		Also, blowjobs are painful. There's just no way around it, I'm too sensitive for those because there's no protective foreskin. My girlfriend felt so bad about this, she told me I should get one from a prostitute or if I ever had the opportunity to get one from any woman who might be good at it, to go ahead. She'd try to get over her jealousy and pain just so I could get the chance to have one pleasurable blowjob in my life. I won't do it (it's not a matter of skill anyway), but my point is it's not just my life that this 'little snip' I got when I was a toddler is impacting.		Finally, something I want to be clear about: I could have had problems without having circumcision, that's also a possibility. And some people get cut and don't have the problems I do. But if I wasn't circumcised and it caused me problems, then I'd still have the option to get cut as a solution. Right now, I don't have any options left because someone made the decision for me even though my penis was working properly as far as everyone knew. It's not something you can go "Let's just cut, and if it's giving him problems we can always just reverse it". It's permanent, there's no going back if it turns out to be a mistake.		That's why I think circumcision should not be forced on children and everyone should choose for themselves when they're old enough (except in cases of medical necessity of course).","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IGropeBoobies","name":"t1_cmdkx0l","parent_id":"t1_cmdhp4y","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417013634,"created_utc":1417013634}

We typically never use 'mutilation' or 'torture' to describe these operations because those words carry particular connotations as to damage and intent.

My opinion is more ascetic; regular circumcision may have positive social ramifications. One reason circumcision exists to the extent is does is because of biblical support (in Genesis). Many people believe this to be archaic, but I think that many of the rules in the early books are, separate from religion, good for society.		Here is the thought process: Sex feels good and all, and is of course natural, but one has to admit that sex or lack of it is the source of much strife in many people's lives. Furthermore, sex can exist apart from stable, monogamous relationships, which form the backbone of our society, and can cause rifts in those relationships.		Therefore, sex being less appealing can possibly be positive for society. There are better ways to happiness than only through sex. And therefore, topically, circumcision in males may be justified, not only for its health benefits, but because, by reducing sexual incentive slightly, it increases the well-being of our society.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mamazing","name":"t1_cmhrqer","parent_id":"t1_cmdj5te","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417424577,"created_utc":1417424577}

Those guys out of line, and shouldn't tell you how to feel about your family.		___		But we shouldn't distract from the topic of the ethics of the continued practice of infant circumcision with personal anecdotes of how it hasn't been bad for you.		The discussion about circumcision is not about you, but about the thousands of infants who will have the choice taken away from them now, and the millions who will in the future. There are plenty of people who feel robbed of their freedom to decide the fate of their own body. Why insist on doing it to infants, when one can instead let people make the choice by themselves when they are of age? That way, those who prefer circumcision may have it, and nobody's freedom is robbed from them.		When it comes to an unnecessary surgery that is permanent, one must consider the person not just as an infant, but also as the adult they will become. While children don't really have freedom over their own lives, as they need limits from their parents in that stage of life, that is no excuse to rob them of freedom on a matter that will persist into adulthood. The surgery doesn't just take the foreskin of a child, but also take the choice on the matter away from a future adult.

{"body":"It is worth bringing up though that there's a fair amount of research that seems to indicate that there are a lot of nerves within the foreskin that enhance the feelings of sex/masturbation, and that by circumcising the person you are lessening the experience they may have when they are of age to experience it.		There's also a lot of research that indicates it's not really as unhealthy to have foreskin as people were led to believe.  I don't have any hard links but it's worth a google if you have time.		It's just a worthy discussion to have so parents make more informed decisions today.  I wouldn't outlaw it entirely either, I think if you just present the facts that "Hey, foreskin really aint so bad so long as you clean it in the shower" there will be a natural cultural shift away from it.

Just like anything else, the parents -- *given reasonable boundaries*. Like any other complication. I don't see how this is any different. 		Think of any other complication. Think heart disease. A child has a heart disease and a procedure is possible. The procedure will solve the problem but might cause others, while not having the procedure might lead to other (worse) complications but might also solve itself in a few months. How is this decided? The parents? The government? The medical doctor? The answer is: all of them. There is a very complicated network in place, in any civilized society, that looks for the child's interest. That includes the parent's/guardians, the law, medical ethics, and so on.		Again, I fail to see how complications in the penis are different from complications anywhere else.		> This is a social issue, not a legal one imho, as you said with "if there would be indeed no way".

Why can the government get involved when we are talking about removing a girl's clit, if not the whole vulva? Now I know, I know, it's different. But it *still* invalidates your argument that it's not a government's business what goes in one's pants. When it's a child we are talking about, it is. Because the government represents the society, and thankfully any civilized society will be concerned with the well-being of their children (who can't look after themselves).		> Then he gets an infection or something from the foreskin being too tight to pull back properly?

With the same logic (I feel bad calling that a logic!), you could say that people in Swaziland seldomly stand on their head an wiggle their feet *and* have an epidemic of HIV infections.

Vaccines are medical procedures that have been proven to work and to have a major benefit; I think almost everyone can agree that the benefit far outweighs any potential idiocy the child might get into his or her head later in life.

Not monstrous by any means, but looking past all the minor, if they exist at all, benefits that a parent could latch on to, all you have is someone who either blindly follows tradition or who doesn't respect the child enough as a person to understand that it's not a pet, but a person who will grow up to have their own thoughts and opinions.","depth":4,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"km89","name":"t1_cmdlpkw","parent_id":"t1_cmdjpf2","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417015424,"created_utc":1417015424}

I forget where I'm paraphrasing this from, but we're talking about the difference between persons and people. A person is intelligent, reflective, and reasonable.

The reason for this is because the evolutionary advantage of living in a group also had a cost: going against the group can have very negative consequences. Even if you don't switch your brain off and you quietly disagree, you keep quiet because depending on your group it could have dire--even lethal--consequences for you and those you love.

{"body":"Hey Reddit,	These comments are pretty intimidating, but I wanted to input my two cents. This post is crazily applicable to my life, because today at 18 years old I was circumcised. Some backstory: My parents whom I love deeply told me as a child that I should practice pulling back the foreskin from the head of my penis. However, being the naive and uninformed child that I was I never did, and never would. Fast forward to high-school, having been sheltered my entire life I never saw what an uncircumcised penis should look like with the foreskin pulled back or a circumcised penis for that matter. So when my mature friends started drawing penises on the whiteboards or on each others papers, I started to feel self-concious. I thought " Why doesn't mine look like that" and "Is mine wrong in any way?". Then talks of masturbation began amongst my friends, having never been able to pull back the foreskin I never have masturbated and I was (and still am) completely clueless when it comes to that topic. I began to feel like less of a person, like what I had was wrong in some way. After doing some research and attempting to pull the foreskin back I realized that I had severe phimosis. I talked to my parents and I elected to be circumcised. During the operation today the numbing meds wore off half-way through the  procedure. The doctors were applying the sutures and could not give me any numbing meds at the time. I was clenching my teeth, shaking and sweating profusely for the entire rest of the operation as I could feel damn near everything. To make matters worse the doctors told me that I was bleeding about 5x more than the average patient. Finally, after the procedure was over I sat up, puked and was extremely dizzy. Right now I'm on oxycodone, and the pain is fine but when it wears off it sucks. So how do I feel about circumcision? I feel that parents should NOT force their child to undergo this procedure. If I had not had phimosis I would have been perfectly happy. Also, parents of young uncircumcised boys: please check in with them on this issue it will save you and them, money, time and pain. 	TLDR: just had circumcision at 18, hurt like a motherfucker, would not advise it.

{"body":"That's not necessarily true, It really depends on the seriousness of the phimosis, Sometimes by that age the skin has directly fused to the penis and the only option is surgical intervention.		It's really just dependent on the circumstances, My S/o's little brother had severe phimosis and he was only 13, The doctors said his foreskin had completely fused and that it was quite out of the ordinary even for someone with phimosis, they had to surgically intervene and he has also had to use steroid creams even after.		The only type of phimosis that can be treated with ONLY steroid cream and exercises means it's only partial phimosis as FULL phimosis is the direct fusing of your foreskin to your penis. 		What a lot of people don't seem to understand is that the scientific research behind circumcision indicates that there is only temporary physical harm and that it doesn't effect your reproductive organs negatively, yes it's a rather strange procedure when thought about, but at birth circumcisions, no matter how "awful" you may think they are, are really posing no harm to the childs future or health.		The problem with all this arguing over whether Circumcision is okay or Not Okay is ignorant and pointless, In todays world people should be learning to accept who and what they are and worrying about themselves instead of maliciously attacking those that differ in opinion or physicality.		By instigating arguments on whether one or the other is correct is simply opinionated belligerence. There is a medical value behind MODERN CIRCUMCISION but there is also value in not. Most people still think circumcision is some dumb fucking rabbi biting your dick. No, It's a procedure done when you're incapable of understanding pain or even remembering the most simple of things.		Basically, There is pro's and cons to both side and they're both perfectly reasonable. Uncircumcised or circumcised, It's a god damn penis and that is a mans private business.		If you choose to circumcise your child, you're not a vicious beast, You're not stupid, You're not ignorant. You just want a life of ease for your child.

It does affect your sexlife negatively, 20.000 highly specialised nerve endings and a complete mucous membrane are removed.

{"body":"You literally just spewed out everything the anti circumcision booklets talk about, Show me the basis and scientific studies showing that males that are uncircumcised enjoy sex more simply because of the increased nerve endings, There is no scientific evidence that sexual intercourse is more enjoyable because you're uncircumcised.		Secondly, Incapable of understanding pain doesn't mean they're not feeling pain, It means they're incapable of the physical or mental memory of the event. It's literally non-existent to them because they're not mentally aware enough to comprehend whats happening, When was the last time you asked a child "Do you remember when you got circumcised at birth?". That's what I thought.		Thirdly, If you choose to circumcise an infant, You're doing it at yours and your doctors discretion, I didn't circumcise my son even though my doctor suggested it as I'm aware of my family history and that my father had me circumcised due to his sever phimosis as a child, What this means is my son and I are most likely genetically predisposed to such an issue unless it's consistently taken care of.		Fourthly, You have no idea what it's like to be uncircumcised thus your innate desire to be uncircumcised because you think you were wronged even though you have no direct memory or issues as a result of the circumcision is fallacious logic. You were not abused as a child, I was 6 years old when a 42 year old man sexually abused me, so when I see idiocy such as Circumcision is child abuse when it's done with the intention of preventing something and making your physical hygiene simpler related to the word "Abuse" it infuriates me.		You have no idea what it's like to be abused so to say you were abused simply due to circumcision is like me saying my Older Brothers poking fun at me at home is "Severe Bullying".		It's completely fucking mental to say it's abuse, I suggest you look up the definition of abuse, To be abuse it has to be done with the intention of malice or misuse, Your circumcision was done to prevent a possible medical issue.

According to wikipedia it's only useful in areas with high HIV risk:		> A 2009 Cochrane meta-analysis of studies done on sexually active heterosexual men in Africa found that circumcision reduced their acquisition of HIV by 38???66% over a period of 24 months.[10] The WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV program in areas with high endemic rates of HIV, such as sub-Saharan Africa,[11][12] where studies have concluded it is cost-effective against HIV.[11] Circumcision reduces the incidence of HSV-2 infections by 28%,[13] and is associated with reduced oncogenic HPV prevalence[14] and a reduced risk of both UTIs and penile cancer,[5] but routine circumcision is not justified for the prevention of those conditions.[2][15] Studies of its potential protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been inconclusive. A 2010 review of literature worldwide found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a median complication rate of 1.5% for newborns and 6% for older children, with few instances of severe complications.[16] Bleeding, infection and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited.[16][17] Circumcision does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.[18][19]		Also there can be negative effects, even though the seem rare and/or minor:		> Neonatal circumcision is generally safe when done by an experienced practitioner.[56] The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin.[5][17] These complications occur in less than 1% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States.[17] Minor complications are reported to occur in 3% of procedures.[56] A specific complication rate is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification.[5] Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age.[16] Significant acute complications happen rarely,[5][16] occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States.[5] Severe to catastrophic complications are sufficiently rare that they are reported only as individual case reports.[5] The death rate due to circumcision is estimated at 1 in every 500,000 neonatal procedures conducted within the United States.[17] Other possible complications include concealed penis, skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis.[57] These complications may be avoided with proper technique, and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.[57]		> Circumcision does not appear to decrease the sensitivity of the penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction.[18][58] A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not appear to affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time to ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm.[59] The Royal Dutch Medical Association's 2010 viewpoint mentions that "complications in the area of sexuality" have been reported.[60] Additionally, the procedure may carry the risks of heightened pain response for newborns and dissatisfaction with the result.[28]		However, even if it's medical zero sum game, it's still a violation of the freedom of religion of the child.

People still defends this procedure as a preventive method for HIV and STDs, but The [U.S. has the highest rate of STDs and HIV of any nation in the industrialized world,](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/02/14/1593021/health-officials-severe-std-epidemic/) and thats because circumcision doesnt work as a preventive method, condoms and sexual do it. All the benefits from circumcision could be achieved from showering and using condoms. 		Also, lets not forget that many hospitals dont even bother using anesthesia during circumcision and its a VERY painful and horrible experience for a new born baby. Not to mention you are forever changing his body, this cant be undone and many men would like to have this choice. 		Thats why so many people are against it.","depth":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mrsdoralice","name":"t1_cmdoind","parent_id":"t3_2ngsmx","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417020953,"created_utc":1417020953}

{"body":"**Myth:  Circumcision makes sex better for the woman.**		Reality check:  The function of the foreskin for women in intercourse is to seal the natural lubrication inside the vagina and provide a gentle internal massaging action.  The intact penis moves in and out of its foreskin, which provides a frictionless, rolling, gliding sensation.  Intact men tend to make shorter strokes that keep their bodies in contact with the clitoris more, thus aiding female orgasm (O'Hara 1999). On the other hand, the circumcised penis functions like a piston during intercourse - the head of the penis actually scrapes the lubrication out of the vagina with each stroke.  As the man thrusts, his skin rubs against the vaginal entrance, causing discomfort, and sometimes pain (O'Hara 1999, Bensley 2001).  Far from making sex better for women, circumcision decreases female satisfaction.		**Myth:  Women don't want to have sex with uncircumcised men.**		Reality check:  In a landmark study of US women, 85% who had experienced both circumcised and intact men preferred sex with intact men.   Sex with a circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).  In another study, women were twice as likely to reach orgasm with an intact man (Bensley 2003).  Even when a woman said she preferred a circumcised partner, she had less dryness and discomfort with intact men (O'Hara 1999). 		http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/circumcision-social-sexual-psychological-realities","depth":1,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"quzbuz","name":"t1_cmdli52","parent_id":"t1_cmdj5oj","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417014963,"created_utc":1417014963}

{"body":"**Myth:  Circumcision makes sex better for the woman.**		Reality check:  The function of the foreskin for women in intercourse is to seal the natural lubrication inside the vagina and provide a gentle internal massaging action.  The intact penis moves in and out of its foreskin, which provides a frictionless, rolling, gliding sensation.  Intact men tend to make shorter strokes that keep their bodies in contact with the clitoris more, thus aiding female orgasm (O'Hara 1999). On the other hand, the circumcised penis functions like a piston during intercourse - the head of the penis actually scrapes the lubrication out of the vagina with each stroke.  As the man thrusts, his skin rubs against the vaginal entrance, causing discomfort, and sometimes pain (O'Hara 1999, Bensley 2001).  Far from making sex better for women, circumcision decreases female satisfaction.		**Myth:  Women don't want to have sex with uncircumcised men.**		Reality check:  In a landmark study of US women, 85% who had experienced both circumcised and intact men preferred sex with intact men.   Sex with a circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).  In another study, women were twice as likely to reach orgasm with an intact man (Bensley 2003).  Even when a woman said she preferred a circumcised partner, she had less dryness and discomfort with intact men (O'Hara 1999). 		http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/circumcision-social-sexual-psychological-realities","depth":1,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"quzbuz","name":"t1_cmdlpxb","parent_id":"t1_cmdj41m","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417015443,"created_utc":1417015443}

{"body":"**Myth: Circumcision prevents HIV/AIDS.**		Reality check:  Three studies in Africa several years ago that claimed that circumcision prevented AIDS and that circumcision was as effective as a 60% effective vaccine (Auvert 2005, 2006). These studies had many flaws, including that they were stopped before all the results came in.  There have also been several studies that show that circumcision does not prevent HIV (Connolly 2008). There are many issues at play in the spread of STDs which make it very hard to generalize results from one population to another. 		In Africa, where the recent studies have been done, most HIV transmission is through male-female sex, but in the USA, it is mainly transmitted through blood exposure (like needle sharing) and male-male sex.  Male circumcision does not protect women from acquiring HIV, nor does it protect men who have sex with men (Wawer 2009, Jameson 2009).		What's worse, because of the publicity surrounding the African studies, men in Africa are now starting to believe that if they are circumcised, they do not need to wear condoms, which will increase the spread of HIV (Westercamp 2010).  Even in the study with the most favorable effects of circumcision, the protective effect was only 60% - men would still have to wear condoms to protect themselves and their partners from HIV. 		In the USA, during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, about 85% of adult men were circumcised (much higher rates of circumcision than in Africa), and yet HIV still spread. 		http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/more-circumcision-myths-you-may-believe-hygiene-and-stds","depth":2,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"quzbuz","name":"t1_cmdl9t7","parent_id":"t1_cmdj1pi","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417014450,"created_utc":1417014450}

A substantial protective effect of male circumcision on risk for HIV infection was noted, along with a reduced risk for genital ulcer disease. After adjustment for confounding factors in the population-based studies, the relative risk for HIV infection was 44% lower in circumcised men. The strongest association was seen in men at high risk, such as patients at STD clinics, for whom the adjusted relative risk was 71% lower for circumcised men.		>Another review that included stringent assessment of 10 potential confounding factors and that was stratified by study type or study population was published in 2003.13 Most of the studies were from Africa. Of the 35 observational studies in the review, the 16 in the general population had inconsistent results. The one large prospective cohort study in this group showed a significant protective effect: The odds of infection were 42% lower for circumcised men.14 The remaining 19 studies were conducted in populations at high risk.

[Here's a source](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/malecircumcision/)		>A systematic review and meta-analysis that focused on male circumcision and heterosexual transmission of HIV in Africa was published in 2000.12 It included 19 cross-sectional studies, 5 case-control studies, 3 cohort studies, and 1 partner study. A substantial protective effect of male circumcision on risk for HIV infection was noted, along with a reduced risk for genital ulcer disease. After adjustment for confounding factors in the population-based studies, the relative risk for HIV infection was 44% lower in circumcised men. The strongest association was seen in men at high risk, such as patients at STD clinics, for whom the adjusted relative risk was 71% lower for circumcised men.		>Another review that included stringent assessment of 10 potential confounding factors and that was stratified by study type or study population was published in 2003.13 Most of the studies were from Africa. Of the 35 observational studies in the review, the 16 in the general population had inconsistent results. The one large prospective cohort study in this group showed a significant protective effect: The odds of infection were 42% lower for circumcised men.14 The remaining 19 studies were conducted in populations at high risk. These studies found a consistent, substantial protective effect, which increased with adjustment for confounding. Each of the four cohort studies included in the review demonstrated a protective effect, and two were statistically significant.		>Ecologic studies also indicate a strong association between lack of male circumcision and HIV infection at the population level. Although links among circumcision, culture, religion, and risk behavior may account for some of the differences in HIV infection prevalence, the countries in Africa and Asia with prevalence of male circumcision of less than 20% have HIV infection prevalences several times higher than those in countries in these regions where more than 80% of men are circumcised.15","depth":3,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sativan","name":"t1_cmdjk21","parent_id":"t1_cmdinsn","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417010053,"created_utc":1417010053}

Previous studies showed that circumcised men lowered their risk of transmitting HIV by as much as 50%, making the operation an important tool in preventing infection with the virus. Why? A high burden of bacteria could disrupt the ability of specialized immune cells known as Langerhans cells to activate immune defenses. Normally, Langerhans are responsible for grabbing invading microbes like bacteria or viruses and presenting them to immune cells for training, to prime the body to recognize and react against the pathogens. **But when the bacterial load increases, as it does in the uncircumcised penile environment, inflammatory reactions increase and these cells actually start to infect healthy cells with the offending microbe rather than merely present them.**","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sativan","name":"t1_cmdl7ti","parent_id":"t1_cmdkkdh","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417014330,"created_utc":1417014330}

{"body":"Ok, I'm going to regret this, and I'm going to be downvoted to hell, but here goes:		I'm American, and circumcision is a pretty common thing over here. [About 30% of men worldwide are circumcised](http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf), but, [in the US, about 60% are circumcised](http://www.webmd.com/children/news/20130822/us-circumcision-rates-drop-by-10-percent-cdc). The American Pediatric Association, the preeminent organization for pediatrics in the US, officially says that newborn circumcision should be the choice of the parents/guardians, but [it does still recommend circumcision to prevent risk of urinary tract infections and the contraction of STDs](http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Newborn-Male-Circumcision.aspx).		Despite all the nonsense that will undoubtedly be spewed in this thread, it is a well accepted fact that [circumcision does statistically reduce your chance of contracting these diseases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477524/), albeit very slightly. It also makes cleaning the penis much easier, which isn't a problem in adulthood but is during infancy, because a newborn baby's foreskin cannot be pulled back for cleaning and, as a father, I can say it isn't uncommon for a baby's fecal matter to get on his penis due to his diaper shifting. As well, there is little if any scientific evidence indicating that circumcision either increases or decreases sensitivity during sex later in life. The chance of complications from newborn circumcision do exist but they are very rare, so rare that there aren't any reliable statistics on it except to say that [complications occurs in less than 0.1% of circumcisions and less than 1% of those are serious complications](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/malecircumcision/risks.html).		There is a valid argument to be made that a child cannot consent to a circumcision, which makes it ethically dubious, but it is worth note that adult circumcision is not as simple and straight forward as people on reddit seem to think it is. The chance of complications in circumcision increases by orders of magnitude for adults, because an adult penis can grow and shrink a lot more due to erections and temperature than a baby's penis. This increases the chance of the wound being accidentally reopened which can be very serious. Newborns simply don't have this problem, and that's why most parents choose to have their children circumcised upon birth, as to reduce the chance of complications.		In my opinion, circumcision is a lot like vaccines. A child cannot consent to a vaccine, but it's best to give children their vaccines when they're young to reduce the chance of complications. Vaccines hurt and, to someone with little knowledge of them, they seems very weird and cruel, but ultimately they are given for the child's health. There is a risk of complications with all vaccines, but it is very small. You probably don't need most of the vaccines you're given, but it's better to get them and not need them than to not get them and then need them. However, everyone is different, and ultimately the decision to vaccinate or not should be a discussion between parents and their pediatrician.		I'm not saying that everyone should be circumcised or everyone shouldn't. I'm just saying it does have a valid medical purpose and ultimately the decision to do so or not should be left up to parents and doctors. My father is circumcised, I am circumcised, and my son is circumcised. We are all happy, healthy and have never had any issues with our circumcisions. I'm sure there are some people that aren't happy with their circumcisions, and I'm sorry for them, but that doesn't mean they should restrict others from doing so.		So, that's my two cents. I'm sure this will be downvoted to the bottom of the page and plenty of people will comment on it with all sorts of bad science and emotional arguments, but I'm going to comment any further on this issue. I have work to get to.","depth":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cmdl40g","parent_id":"t3_2ngsmx","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417014086,"created_utc":1417014086}

Except that US is the only developed country that still supports this procedure and the reason other countries dont do it is because the benefits are too small.

It destroys more than half of the nerves in the glans as well as removes the protection of the glans, which leaves the organ calloused and rough, impacting its sexual function. This is why many medical associations worldwide have called for a ban on the practice, or at least stated that it's harmful. (Want a list of the medical associations that have stood up against infant circumcision? I always ask first, since it takes effort to get it together, but I can provide it.)

{"body":"http://prostatecanceruk.org/news/2014/4/not-enough-evidence-to-suggest-that-circumcision-could-reduce-risk-of-prostate-cancer				Press comment: New research carried out at the University of Montreal which has recently been reported in two national newspapers suggested that men who are circumcised after the age of 35 could have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.		It is possible to access the full research paper online here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655933.		Dr Matthew Hobbs, Deputy Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK says:		???Although this study appears to show that circumcision after the age of 35 could reduce your risk of prostate cancer, the evidence presented is nowhere near strong enough that men should begin to consider circumcision as a way to prevent the disease. While the total sample studied was large, the number of men who had been circumcised after the age of 35 was very small, so this should not be seen as strong evidence of an association. There was no statistically significant association between prostate cancer and circumcision for men circumcised at all other ages. No reason was collected for circumcision, so we can???t say if the association is with circumcision later in life or with whatever causes men to have circumcisions after that age. It is also highly likely that diet, lifestyle, socioeconomic status and healthcare behaviours may have played a role in skewing these results. All of these issues weaken this evidence.		"The most important thing is that all men are aware of their risk of prostate cancer and talk to their GP about it, particularly men who are over the age of 50, of African or African Caribbean ethnic origin, or those that have a family history of the disease."

{"body":"There are plenty of these, It's really a situation issue and whether or not it should be done is chosen by the parents as they're the ones making the decision for someone they're supposed to have the best interest in.		Circumcision simplifies sexual hygiene and prevents phimosis which can be excruciatingly painful, But it also effects some people like /u/Merari01 negatively where they're so discontent with the look of their penis that they use fallacious reasoning to try and exemplify the cons of circumcision. Now I'm aware this last statement was a tad malicious but I'm really just trying to make this fool understand that circumcision isn't a form of mutilation or abuse, it's that it's a medical procedure with medical reasoning behind it, just that's its not always 100% necessary.		Any doctor would tell you the same, Circumcision has it's theoretical positives and negatives but if the person who is circumcised takes issue with what happened to them when they had no control over it and that someone with their best interests chose for them and they still hold malice towards the situation then nothing can be done because at that time they're unwilling to understand or comprehend that what was done to them wasn't out of malice or abuse or mutilation but because your parents didn't want you to experience the possibly terrible side of an uncircumcised penis.		So really, There is Pro's and Cons to both sides and they're really all just a matter of possibility. I'm circumcised and it really doesn't matter to me, I understand the reasoning behind circumcision but I also understand the reasoning behind not circumcising, My son is uncircumcised because I'm going to tell him to play with his pinky-winky all the time to prevent such issues and teach him that sexuality is a part of life and that its not to be frowned upon or overdone, it's another vice of pleasure in this world and that everyone is different and that if he wants to be accepted he has to also be willing to accept others.		Just because you get dealt an awkward hand in poker doesn't mean you've lost the round. Saying you're getting the shit end of the stick in life because of a procedure that doesn't physically effect you later in life is a blast of poppycock. I know plenty of dissatisfied men that are circumcised and uncircumcised but I also know plenty of satisfied men of both stature as well.		Basically, What I'm saying is, If there is proven phimosis in your genetic line, albeit a strange genetic history question, circumcision may be the way to go for you, sometimes people don't even have to play with their foreskin to prevent phimosis. Some people get it regardless, Some people don't.		It's something that really doesn't negatively effect the person until they choose to allow it to effect them negatively.

But they strictly say their stance on circumcision is being reverted because they don't believe EVERYONE needs to be circumcised.		You post a website that only proves what I've been saying the whole time.

So essentially, Their opinion on the matter is "It's your opinion whether or not you think it's best for your child and we'll act accordingly.".		So, There are proven medical benefits but negatives that come with uncircumcised penis' aren't statistically valid enough to deem every person should be circumcised.		So again, as I said earlier, Genetic history plays a part in phimosis, as does pure chance. If one knows their family line is predisposed to issues with an uncircumcised penis, Then the logical conclusion is to circumcise them at birth.

I really feel like you're not getting this.		The other person who's shoes you'd put yourself in is someone who has had it done, but *does* mind.		Whether or not you're OK with it is subjective. You don't mind, and that's based on your subjective position. You seem to be talking as if you being OK with it isn't subjective, but because you've objectively assessed the situation and concluded that it's factually not a big deal. Just because it isn't a big deal to you, doesn't mean it isn't fair that it's a big deal to some other people. You're confusing subjective and objective conclusions.		Your subjective position of not minding is no more or less valid than their subjecting position of disliking that it was done to them, but the difference is that their view isn't respected. Even with this law, your view would still be respected.

{"body":"This is something I rarely think about, until the idea of having children comes up. 		There have been times where I've wondered what having a foreskin would be like,  but I've never felt embarrassed or ashamed that I'm circumcised.  		It was done to me when I was an infant (father catholic, mother Baptist of Jewish lineage),  for non religious reasons. I'm atheist,  and feel that any permanent decision in life shouldn't be made for a child to young to understand, out of religious belief. (Ya did good, mom and dad)		Obviously I was too young to remember any of it, and that's where the problem in my mind comes in. 		On one hand, I feel that had I been given the choice to wait until I was 18 I would've let it be, only because I'm lazy, and why bother? On the other, doing it when they're infants (<3) generally ensures they won't remember it, or experience much discomfort (imo). 		I've had girls tell me they find uncut sexiest,  and girls tell me they find cut better.  But I've also only heard horror stories from girls about guys who are uncut (be they lazy, or very active,  shit accumulates under the foreskin). 		Basically,  for me, I'm glad my parents made the choice, curious as I may ever be about what's on the other side of the fence. But when I debate what if do to my child, I can't think of any real "pros" for either side of the debate,  than win over the other. 		Circumcised is healthier!  (less chance of infection,  idk how true that is) 		Uncircumcised feels better!  (I don't understand how skin in the way of nerves would allow this) 		Circumcisions risk being botched, and ruining your child's sex life/confidence! 		Uncircumcised has afflictions that can stunt their sexual development,  and the child may be too embarrassed to ever tell someone they need help, or may not understand. 		Etc. 		But fuck female Circumcision, THAT shit is horrific,  permanently disfiguring,  and intended only to prevent them from feeling pleasure. 		TLDR: I was cut for non religious reasons,  and am perfectly happy. The is obviously always a risk of mutilating the cold,  which is a great concern when thinking of becoming a parent for me,  but Uncircumcised is not without since drawbacks as well.

(I don't understand how skin in the way of nerves would allow this) 		I am uncircumcised and I actually did experiment as a young boy (when I first discovered masturbation and was all sorts of curious with my body) and tested it myself. You see - when I wash the head of my penis (and by washing, I soap up my hand and vigorously rub my penis, including the head with foreskin retracted) more often - like twice a day - it becomes less sensitive to my own touch. Don't get me wrong, I can still masturbate perfectly fine (and as a young boy, I did just that, several times a day) and there is no problem. But... if I stopped this rubbing of the head while in the shower for a few days - the head would become much more sensitive to my own touch and would result in glorious feeling of weaking in the legs when I washed it again. There is a big difference in the level of sensitivity and I will tell you why. While under the foreskin, the head is kept warm and a little bit moist, and when you retract your foreskin, you can observe the head glistening sometimes, and while it's out - it dries up quickly and the head is beggining to get w little bit wrinkly (not like grandma, just a little bit like the tiny wrinkles on the skin of your hand if you look close). If you don't put your foreskin back, it can stay that way just fine. Those are my experiments, performed between the ages of 11-14.

{"body":"**Myth:  Circumcision makes sex better for the woman.**		Reality check:  The function of the foreskin for women in intercourse is to seal the natural lubrication inside the vagina and provide a gentle internal massaging action.  The intact penis moves in and out of its foreskin, which provides a frictionless, rolling, gliding sensation.  Intact men tend to make shorter strokes that keep their bodies in contact with the clitoris more, thus aiding female orgasm (O'Hara 1999). On the other hand, the circumcised penis functions like a piston during intercourse - the head of the penis actually scrapes the lubrication out of the vagina with each stroke.  As the man thrusts, his skin rubs against the vaginal entrance, causing discomfort, and sometimes pain (O'Hara 1999, Bensley 2001).  Far from making sex better for women, circumcision decreases female satisfaction.		**Myth:  Women don't want to have sex with uncircumcised men.**		Reality check:  In a landmark study of US women, 85% who had experienced both circumcised and intact men preferred sex with intact men.   Sex with a circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).  In another study, women were twice as likely to reach orgasm with an intact man (Bensley 2003).  Even when a woman said she preferred a circumcised partner, she had less dryness and discomfort with intact men (O'Hara 1999). 		http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/circumcision-social-sexual-psychological-realities","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"quzbuz","name":"t1_cmdlihz","parent_id":"t1_cmdj4rk","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417014985,"created_utc":1417014985}

{"body":"I'm honestly kind of surprised by the reaction here. I never realized how many people are so strongly against circumcision. I understand most people's arguments here about the infant not having a say in if he wants the procedure or not, but being an infant you obviously cannot make your own decisions. Any procedure done to you as an infant (shots, fixing clefts, anything else cosmetic) is also a decision made by your parents and the physician. Are you all mad about other things your parents did for you as an infant that you had no say in? I'll admit it does seem strange to remove it especially since it is a very sensitive part of the penis for arousal and sex (seems almost mean to deny people that stimulation). I'm circumcised and don't consider it mutilation or anything like that, and living in the US it seems like it's cultural to have the procedure done or at least most of the guys here I know are circumcised. Maybe it doesn't have the science behind it like previously thought except for less bacteria which isn't an issue with proper cleaning, but I don't see why people are trying to turn this into a giant human rights issue. I'm not freaking out over other cultural practices in other countries/cultures.

Just like the rumor that Spinach is exceptionally good for you, started many decades ago, and only because some dietician who made tables for nutrients fucked up, and put the comma in the wrong place, resulting in Spinach being deemed one of the healthiest vegetables out there, and for decades this made into a common culture (Popeye) and that is why so many children were forced to eat spinach (mostly tasteless vegetable) which has about the same level of nutrients as common salad). It took a long time before anybody double checked and corrected this issue, but still, decades later - people think actually Spinach is more healthy than other vegetables, which is simply not true.   	I would guess the same goes for circumcision in the US and the huge gap between the US and most of Europe. This is a hypothesis only, not fact-checked whatsoever, but let's say some highly religious doctor decided that all babies should be circumcised. He may even write a paper on it, citing some figures, which nobody bothered to actually double check. He published his paper and the medical community widely accepted it, and performed more and more circumcisions. Now it's "common" knowledge that circumcision is healthy and hygienic, but actually - most modern countries have a good level of hygiene, due to proper education at an early age, and access to modern hygienic products, and better sanitary conditions then let's say: pre-world war cultures had. It may have been better to circumcise children back in the 1900 but today? It makes no difference at all. But, let's get back to the subject. Why is it performed today? Well, ask a basic doctor or nurse, and he or she will tell you, that they learned in med school that it's hygienic. Probably from a 60 year old professor who learned this many years ago and is just doing his job teaching it. Medical books explain the procedure to students and being probably reprinted since the 1950's don't provide any accurate data that it's either right or wrong. So why not just do it - the professor said it should be done, let's just do it and if parents asky why should it be done? Tell them they just have to. Just like you "have to" remove your wisdom teeth. But Europe didn't follow that particular paper since each country has mainly it's own medical society, and sure, information circulate between countries, but no doctor worth their salt will just take anything for granted from another country - they would probably like to check for their own, or just do it the other way around just out of spite. Some countries did double check, and found no actual merits one way or the other - and since there is no significant benefits to health in a modern society - they don't recommend it and perform it. The religious community (Jews and Muslims mostly) don't really care, since they do it on their own and not in the hospital. And this is why, in my own opinion, there is a huge gap between Europe and the US in number of circumcisions performed.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Makonar","name":"t1_cmdkyvz","parent_id":"t1_cmdjabo","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417013755,"created_utc":1417013755}

{"body":"You make two arguments here, and I think they are both weak.		1. It went fine for you. I do not doubt this - in fact, the vast majority of circumitions are unproblematic. However, a certain percent of those operated on experience complications, all because of a highly unecessary procedure. Why should we accept that?		2. You can avoid a good number of issues or diseases. This is true, but preemptive operation on a national scale just to avoid unlikely (and mostly non-severe or easily cured) health problems down the line is outright ridiculous. No one believes it's wrong to do an operation if you have a health problem that requires circumsicionm so why not wait until you actually have a health problem before you operate. Secondly, basic hygiene makes diseas even less of an issue. In developing nations with little awareness of personal hygiene/sexual health and/or lack of clean water, an argument can be made for circumsition, but this is Denmark we're talking about. If you can't pull your foreskin back when you shower, I think there are other things you'll have to worry more about. 		Of course, there's other ethical dilemmas as well. Circumsition makes the penis less sensitive, as well as making you far more reliable on outside sources of lubrication during sex/masturbation. Also, mutilating children without their consent is clearly a poor idea.		I think it's horrible that circumsition is so widespread, and hope that bans will be introduced in more countries.","depth":1,"score":16,"ups":16,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Errorizer","name":"t1_cmdhx57","parent_id":"t1_cmdhiv9","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417003705,"created_utc":1417003705}

{"body":"Of course, that is why I said that it is rare, and is mostly the result of a mistake on the part to the person performing the circumcizion.   	When you actually look at it, the "simple" procedure is not that easy... in hospitals, it requires strapping an infant to a specialized board, and restraining it's limbs.. It requires anesthesia (which it didn't in the past, due to wrongly conceived idea that infants don't feel pain) - almost all circumcizions are done this way. It requires specialized tools (and the knowledge and practice to use them) and it requires stiches or a proper dressing. Any stage of this procedure can fail, and pose a risk. It's not simple pull the skin, and snip it off as many people think.    	The tools are also faulty. There is no one, risk-proof, tool out there that is 100% safe. In fact, the most commonly used tools have been developed in the 1930's! Gomco Circumcision Clamp was introduced by Goldstein Manufacturing Company or the Mogen Clamp Invented by Rabbi Harry Bronstein (see a strange pattern here?) or the Plastibell method which has a higher risk of complications. One tool was introduced in 1994 and by 1995 - there was a case of male penis amputation with this tool (fortunaterly, the following surgical reattachemet was a success). These really don't sound like risk free tools. Any procedure, anesthesia carries a certain risk. It may be small, but I for one would not risk it at any chance - there is no need to do it to every infant - only when there is a medical reason for it. 	I agree, that most circumcizions are not performed by doctors, but by religious people designated for this task. Most complications result from unsanitary conditions and the lack of knowledge and proper dressing of the wound. Still, the ban is supposed to stop those people from doing circumcizion in this more, risky way, and only do it when it's deemed medically necessary.

{"body":"You are a slow one arent you?		I guess your version of a slam dunk is missing the fact I pointed this out, or how you thought the clit was like the head of a penis. You are aware there are more parts and the closest related to foreskin is the hood right and not the clit?  Vast EMT courses? You mean having my 68W in the army, A nursing degree and my PUNS (Pediatric Urology Nurse Specialist while I worked in the NICU with my RNC cert since it gave me a bit more money), my EMT / EMS, yeah I would say I am pretty qualified in dicks.  I could tell you were one right away.		Show me where I am wrong, PLEASE show me with my statement and proof from a credited scientific research group where I am wrong. I beg of you. 		You just thought foreskin was a clit. The fuck is wrong with you?  You just said you can feel a vagina but not your dick being slammed in a door.  Now you change your story to "Oh yeah I do have feeling in it, just the tip"  do me a favor, take some icey hot and rub it up and down your penis aside from the head. Please report back. 		No I have no clue what a hotshot is unless its a term for a guy who has total lack of understanding about basic anatomy.  "Dirty clits" The clit doesnt get dirty on its own its the result of other factors regarding the vagina, you just said you could cut off the clit when you meant the hood.

{"body":"Okay so now you are trying to make a valid point while drunk, already confusing several pieces of anatomy and hitting a home run with information I already provided then saying "Slam dunk"when you just proved the point I was trying to make.		Everyone has to take the same test. The schooling does nothing more than prepare you to pass the exam. The education you get comes much later once you are actually in the field.   "Blah blah blah your a nurse"   You're you mean? 		Actually you did say foreskin was a clit "I read some where that the foreskin has as many nerve endings as the clitoris. Even if it doesn't but was close it still is a sensitive part" you are comparing the clit to the foreskin right there. 		That isnt a scientific study, for someone who has gone to college I am surprised you are unaware that this is not a study. It's an opinion by Paul Fleiss off of a website which follows the direct narrative you believe in.  You are aware who he is don't you?  		Here its actually VERY VERY short and will take you 10 seconds to read on who he was.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_M._Fleiss     I would give you the small details of it but its no more than a few, very short paragraphs. 		Also you're not understanding exactly the differences between male and female anatomy.  Unless you see testosterone use in a female the clit tends to stay roughly the same size while in mens penises the size of the Glans can greatly vary. 		The clit is the size of a Pea on a normally hormone balanced woman. How many Pea's do you think make up the size of your Glans? (or the head).   I assume the head of your penis is larger than 3 Pea's?  Assume you have a micro dick, a reaaaal small micro dick and it is 3 Peas.. Thats 24000 nerve endings according to the math you gave me when compared to the same sensitivity as a clit. 		I will assume you are a teen regardless of what you tell me but still you probably have the size penis you will for the rest of your life.  If you have a normal sized penis you could probably fit around lets say 15 Peas flaccid, I understand you probably have a huge 10 inch penis but say we are dealing with an average size.		That would mean for your penis to be equally as sensitive as a clit (according to the math you pulled from Dr. Quack.)   that means you would have 120,000 nerve endings on the head of your penis.		So I fail to see your point.   You are discussing the removal of foreskin not the Glans, compared to female mutilation which is the removal of items for NON medical reasons. While there are still several medical reasons to remove the foreskin and why some doctors still suggest it. 		You are 16 or very close to it, that part is overly obvious due to your basic lack of knowledge.   "Genital mutilation of females involves cutting off the clit... and hood I suppose. I don't know why your so hung up on the hood. Does your boy not know what to do with it? ha ha."     ???? who the else would think that joke is even remotely funny unless they are around your age.  No one in their 30's says shit like that, hell no one in their 20's says shit like that.  I am "hung up" on the hood because you thought removal of the foreskin and the clit were similar on some levels when it snot even close.  Removal of the foreskin and KIND OF the hood would be similar but barely. 		"PS: Hotshots are who you wished you could be. We are your heroes, but no worries we like to work behind the scenes."   Yeah, thanks for the cringe.  		Once again I am not a nurse anymore I already explained what I did and you have fucked that up twice.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"DurrDurrDurrDeer","name":"t1_cme8smo","parent_id":"t1_cme5lng","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1417065106,"created_utc":1417065106}

BACKGROUND: Ecological and observational studies suggest that male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV acquisition in men. Our aim was to investigate the effect of male circumcision on HIV incidence in men.	METHODS: 4996 uncircumcised, HIV-negative men aged 15-49 years who agreed to HIV testing and counselling were enrolled in this randomised trial in rural Rakai district, Uganda. Men were randomly assigned to receive immediate circumcision (n=2474) or circumcision delayed for 24 months (2522). HIV testing, physical examination, and interviews were repeated at 6, 12, and 24 month follow-up visits. The primary outcome was HIV incidence. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, with the number NCT00425984.	FINDINGS: Baseline characteristics of the men in the intervention and control groups were much the same at enrollment. Retention rates were much the same in the two groups, with 90-92% of participantsretained at all time points. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, HIV incidence over 24 months was 0.66 cases per 100 person-years in the intervention group and 1.33 cases per 100 person-years in the control group (estimated efficacy of intervention 51%, 95% CI 16-72; p=0.006). The as-treated efficacy was 55% (95% CI 22-75; p=0.002); efficacy from the Kaplan-Meier time-to-HIV-detection as-treated analysis was 60% (30-77; p=0.003). HIV incidence was lower in the intervention group than it was in the control group in all sociodemographic, behavioural, and sexually transmitted disease symptom subgroups. Moderate or severe adverse events occurred in 84 (3.6%) circumcisions; all resolved with treatment. Behaviours were much the same in both groups during follow-up.	INTERPRETATION: Male circumcision reduced HIV incidence in men without behavioural disinhibition. Circumcision can be recommended for HIV prevention in men.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of male circumcision for HIV prevention over 2 years has been demonstrated in three randomized trials, but the longer-term effectiveness of male circumcision is unknown.	METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of male circumcision in 4996 HIV-negative men aged 15-49 in Rakai, Uganda. Following trial closure, we offered male circumcision to control participants and have maintained surveillance for up to 4.79 years. HIV incidence per 100 person-years was assessed in an as-treated analysis, and the effectiveness of male circumcision was estimated using Cox regression models, adjusted for sociodemographic and time-dependent sexual behaviors. For men uncircumcised at trial closure, sexual risk behaviors at the last trial and first posttrial visits were assessed by subsequent circumcision acceptance to detect behavioral risk compensation.	RESULTS: By 15 December 2010, 78.4% of uncircumcised trial participants accepted male circumcision following trial closure. During posttrial surveillance, overall HIV incidence was 0.50/100 person-years in circumcised men and 1.93/100 person-years in uncircumcised men 	adjusted effectiveness 73% [95% confidence interval (CI) 55-84%]	. In control arm participants, posttrial HIV incidence was 0.54/100 person-years in circumcised and 1.71/100 person-years in uncircumcised men [adjusted effectiveness 67% (95% CI 38-83%)]. There were no significant differences in sociodemographic characteristics and sexual behaviors between controls accepting male circumcision and those remaining uncircumcised.	CONCLUSION: High effectiveness of male circumcision for HIV prevention was maintained for almost 5 years following trial closure. There was no self-selection or evidence of behavioral risk compensation associated with posttrial male circumcision acceptance.

AUBailey RC, Moses S, Parker CB, Agot K, Maclean I, Krieger JN, Williams CF, Campbell RT, Ndinya-Achola JO	SOLancet. 2007;369(9562):643.	 	BACKGROUND: Male circumcision could provide substantial protection against acquisition of HIV-1 infection. Our aim was to determine whether male circumcision had a protective effect against HIV infection, and to assess safety and changes in sexual behaviour related to this intervention.	METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial of 2784 men aged 18-24 years in Kisumu, Kenya. Men were randomly assigned to an intervention group (circumcision; n=1391) or a control group (delayed circumcision, 1393), and assessed by HIV testing, medical examinations, and behavioural interviews during follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. HIV seroincidence was estimated in an intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, with the number NCT00059371.	FINDINGS: The trial was stopped early on December 12, 2006, after a third interim analysis reviewed by the data and safety monitoring board. The median length of follow-up was 24 months. Follow-up for HIV status was incomplete for 240 (8.6%) participants. 22 men in the intervention group and 47 in the control group had tested positive for HIV when the study was stopped. The 2-year HIV incidence was 2.1% (95% CI 1.2-3.0) in the circumcision group and 4.2% (3.0-5.4) in the control group (p=0.0065); the relative risk of HIV infection in circumcised men was 0.47 (0.28-0.78), which corresponds to a reduction in the risk of acquiring an HIV infection of 53% (22-72). Adjusting for non-adherence to treatment and excluding four men found to be seropositive at enrollment, the protective effect of circumcision was 60% (32-77). Adverse events related to the intervention (21 events in 1.5% of those circumcised) resolved quickly. No behavioural risk compensation after circumcision was observed.	INTERPRETATION: Male circumcision significantly reduces the risk of HIV acquisition in young men in Africa. Where appropriate, voluntary, safe, and affordable circumcision services should be integrated with other HIV preventive interventions and provided as expeditiously as possible.

AUAuvert B, Taljaard D, Lagarde E, Sobngwi-Tambekou J, Sitta R, Puren A	SOPLoS Med. 2005;2(11):e298.	 	BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that male circumcision may provide protection against HIV-1 infection. A randomized, controlled intervention trial was conducted in a general population of South Africa to test this hypothesis.	METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 3,274 uncircumcised men, aged 18-24 y, were randomized to a control or an intervention group with follow-up visits at months 3, 12, and 21. Male circumcision was offered to the intervention group immediately after randomization and to the control group at the end of the follow-up. The grouped censored data were analyzed in intention-to-treat, univariate and multivariate, analyses, using piecewise exponential, proportional hazards models. Rate ratios (RR) of HIV incidence were determined with 95% CI. Protection against HIV infection was calculated as 1 - RR. The trial was stopped at the interim analysis, and the mean (interquartile range) follow-up was 18.1 mo (13.0-21.0) when the data were analyzed. There were 20 HIV infections (incidence rate = 0.85 per 100 person-years) in the intervention group and 49 (2.1 per 100 person-years) in the control group, corresponding to an RR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.24%-0.68%; p<0.001). This RR corresponds to a protection of 60% (95% CI: 32%-76%). When controlling for behavioural factors, including sexual behaviour that increased slightly in the intervention group, condom use, and health-seeking behaviour, the protection was of 61% (95% CI: 34%-77%).	CONCLUSION: Male circumcision provides a degree of protection against acquiring HIV infection, equivalent to what a vaccine of high efficacy would have achieved. Male circumcision may provide an important way of reducing the spread of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa.

If you are circumcised and lack proper hygiene, you are at the same risks of infenction or disease as any other guy who doesn't keep his junk clean, regardless of the foreskin.    	The problem is, many hospitals perform circumcision as a standard procedure, they don't even ask the parents permission, they just assume it's given, since it's how they do it around here.
