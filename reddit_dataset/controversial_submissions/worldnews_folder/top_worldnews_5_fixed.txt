You may be thinking that this will not be possible because the device is already connected, but a ???deauth??? or ???deassoc??? attack that forcibly disconnects a device from a Wi-Fi network will allow an attacker to reconnect in its place.				>We???re not exagerating here. An attacker with a toolset like Kali Linux can use Wireshark to eavesdrop on a packet, run a quick command to change their MAC address, use aireplay-ng to send deassociation packets to that client, and then connect in its place.
