I'm not trying to be an asshole, but I've been through this debate so many times with so many people, that it gets frustrating seeing the same myths pop up over and over again.		If you'd like a comprehensive explanation of the incident, I recommend reading Michael B. Oren's writings on the matter, such as [this](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/liberty1.html).		Here's a summary:			> The incident began with the ill-conceived decision to send the Liberty to the crisis-torn Middle East, a mere half-mile beyond Egyptian waters, in an area not used by commercial shipping and which Nasser had declared off-limits to neutral vessels. The Americans did not accede to Chief of Staff Rabin's request for the identification of all U.S. ships in the area or Ambassador Harman's request for a strategic liaison between Israel and the Sixth Fleet. The Liberty's dispatchers, meanwhile, overrode naval orders to keep the ship in Spain, and then failed to inform the U.S. attach?? in Tel Aviv of its presence near the war zone. These mistakes were compounded by the navy's communications system, which delayed by as much as two days orders to the Liberty to withdraw 100 miles from the coast.52 Even after it was hit, the Americans had difficulty locating the Liberty, the JCS placing it at "60-100 miles north of Egypt." If neither Castle, nor cinceur, nor even the President of the United States could know where the Liberty was, it seems unreasonable to expect that the Israelis, in the thick of battle, should have been able to locate it.		> The Israelis, too, committed their own share of fateful errors, as the Yerushalmi report points out: The erroneous reports of bombardment at El-Arish, the failure to replace the Liberty's marker on the board after it had been cleared, the over-eagerness of naval commanders, and worst of all, Ensign Yifrah's miscalculation of the ship's speed. Though Yerushalmi's report suggested reasons for these errors - inflexible naval procedures, the inaccuracy of speed-measuring devices - one is still left with a sense of poor organization and sloppy execution. Moreover, there were breakdowns in communications between the Israeli navy and air force stemming from inadequate command structure and the immense pressures of a multi-front war. To these factors must be added Israel's general sensitivity about its coastal defenses, and the exhaustion of its pilots after four days of uninterrupted combat. Yet none of these amount to the kind of gross negligence of which the Israelis have been accused.		> And then there were "bad breaks" that are unfortunately commonplace in war: The U.S. planes that were called back because of their nuclear payload (their mere presence might have warded off the torpedo boats); the Liberty's inability to signal the approaching Israeli boats, and the machine gunner who fired on them; and the smoke that hid the identities of both the attackers and the attacked.		> All of these elements combined to create a tragic "friendly fire" incident of the kind that claimed the lives of at least fifty Israeli soldiers in the Six Day War, and caused 5,373 American casualties in Vietnam in 1967 alone.53 Obviously, these findings can do little to lessen the suffering of those American servicemen who were wounded in the incident, nor can they be expected to offer comfort to the families of the dead. But they should at least permit us to bring to a close what has for a generation remained one of the most painful chapters in the history of America's relationship with the State of Israel.			The incident occurred as a result of a series of screw-ups by both the Americans and Israelis, combined with some elements of bad luck. That's all it was. The idea that Israel would deliberately attack an American ship is preposterous, given that Israel had enough enemies at the time and it couldn't afford to turn the US against it, as well.

{"body":"> The incident occurred as a result of a series of screw-ups by both the Americans and Israelis,		This is bullshit.		The U.S. vessel was in international waters. The U.S. made no mistakes as the U.S. was not violating any laws nor was the vessel located in an area posing a danger to Israel.		> The idea that Israel would deliberately attack an American ship is preposterous...		Unless one is aware of Israel's history of attacking friendlies and blaming the attack on non-friendlies.		> It was an accident and nothing more.		The attack was a purposeful attack. Israel first had knowledge of the vessel around 0600hrs. Throughout the day Israeli Air Force "investigated the ship". There are 3 known instances of Israeli positively identifying the vessel prior to the attack, an attack beginning around 1400hrs.		Israeli fix winged aircraft flew so close to the vessel on 2 occasions prior to the aircraft the pilots and US servicemen aboard the Liberty waved to each other.		You claim "friendly fire accident." Yet as already said Israel knew the vessel was U.S., the vessel was clearly marked, the weather was clear, and the vessel looked nothing like an Egyptian trawler; any Navy and or Air Force personnel Israel sent to reconnoiter the area/vessel would have been highly trained in ship identification and would have been able to immediately identify the most advanced communications gathering vessel in the world as a U.S. vessel.		If we are to believe the accident theory then we must also believe Israeli Air Force and Navy personnel were so incompetent, so ill-trained, so lacking in one of the most basic requirements of air force and navy personnel that these servicemen could not identify a vessel Israel followed from 0600hrs until the attack around 1400hours - and we have to forget Israel identified the vessel on 3 separate occasions prior to the attack - as well as a 4h positive identification which occurs at the onset of the attack.		Israel followed the Liberty for roughly 8 hours prior to attacking the vessel. The attack itself lasting longer than the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. An attack consisting of several sorties by fixed wing aircraft, an attack employing helicopter gunships that came in close enough to strafe lifeboats the sailors were deploying in anticipation of being sunk, and an attack in which torpedo boats were also used.		No accident scenario can explain how Israel follows a ship for 8 hours, attacks it for an hour and a half with helicopters, torpedo boats, and jets. 		No reasonable explanation can be offered as to why Israeli attackers that day were jamming American radio frequencies. If Israel believed this vessel to be an Egyptian trawler, why jam US radio frequencies?		A clearly marked and easily identifiable US vessel, in international waters, followed for 8 hours, then attack for about 1 and a half hours; attacked by jet, torpedo boat, helicopter - yea, just a case of "Oops, I'm sorry - friendly fire, happens all the time."","depth":7,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BobIsntHere","name":"t1_cp16f7s","parent_id":"t1_cp14tqo","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425246496,"created_utc":1425246496}

Moorer](http://www.gtr5.com/quotes/moorer.htm)		* The ship was clearly identified, not only by its unique configuration but by a very large U.S. flag that was flown at the time. The weather was calm and the visibility was excellent. During this unprovoked attack 34 U.S. Navy men were killed and 171 wounded.

{"body":"**tl;dr:** Quantity of quotes does not equate quality.  Most of those folks would have had no first hand knowledge of the case and US congresscritters are hardly credible "experts".  Furthermore, the entire narrative about the Liberty incident as put forward by those who believe Israel intentionally attacked and killed US servicemen and then was helped in the cover up by the Johnson administration and the US Navy fails a wide range of tests including Occam's and Hanlon's razors.  But don't believe me, read the actual evidence, just avoid the commentaries and compilations of one sided information without context from the "truthers".		There's a big difference from Israel not attacking the Liberty intentionally and not attacking the Liberty intentionally all the while knowing that it was an American warship.  That's the crux of the matter.		Of the people you cite there, only 3 of them would plausibly have known all of the details: Inman, Rusk, and Clifford.  So quoting a bunch of incredulous bystanders is actually a demonstration of the weakness of the case.		When I first read about the Liberty incident, my first impression was "wow, there must be more to this story!" since it didn't really add up.  But the problem with that narrative for me was always that there was little motive for the Israelis to destroy an American warship, knowingly kill US servicemen, and then cover it up.  Furthermore, there was practically no motive for the US to behave in this way.		The Israelis never acted as though they were trying to cover things up and the 6th Fleet clearly was having a bad day in terms of getting their shit together.  It would have been trivial to do one of many things such as provide an escort, a CAP or just to tell the Liberty to move further away from the coast but they didn't and that's not evidence of a conspiracy that's evidence of routine military incompetence.  Everybody expects the military to be omniscient but the fact of the matter is that mistakes are made all the time for very banal bureaucratic reasons (e.g.: not wanting to bother your superiors and damage your reputation by pushing back too hard, wanting to save money, routine maintenance, etc.)		The Israelis for their part contact the the United States immediately once they had confirmed beyond a doubt that the Liberty was actually a US warship.  There's plenty of paper trail about this and even if they had hesitated it would be understandable.		Any armchair admiral or historian who thinks that warplanes and warships don't attack friendly forces all together too often and especially so during the era before modern communications is frankly just demonstrating their lack of familiarity with the subject.  There were countless occurrences of this kind before and after the period in question.  It's very plausible that the two sides have different recollections regarding how well marked the Liberty was.  Have you ever tried reading identification markings from a fast moving aircraft at relatively low level?  This is what they man by fog of war.		If you read the WP article about friendly fire, you see that this case meets many of the criteria that are involved in friendly fire incidents: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_fire		Do I doubt that there was secrecy and some cover up after the fact to spare Israel and the USN embarrassment?  Not at all we know that the US and Israel had delicate and evolving relationship at the time, furthermore the US would not want its allies or the USSR to know that they screwed up this badly.  But that's a far cry from claiming there was a conspiracy to cover up an intentional attack and that the US just let it slide.		The problem with conspiracy theories in general is that they don't apply Occam's razor or Hanlon's razor and this example is a case study in it.  It's compounded by the fact that there are plenty of sympathetic and believable victims from the Liberty who can be trotted out to talk about the case, but I seriously doubt that even the majority of the Liberty's crew would have signed up for the full blown version of this conspiracy.		I realize that I'm extremely unlikely to change the minds of people who already know about the incident, that's just how this works, but I'm sharing these points in the hope that folks who are new to the story don't get overwhelmed by the superficially convincing evidence and the cries that everybody who believes otherwise is just a lapdog for the conspirators.","depth":4,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ooburai","name":"t1_cp1tehm","parent_id":"t1_cp17beq","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425306720,"created_utc":1425306720}
{"body":">  Most of those folks would have had no first hand knowledge of the case and US congresscritters are hardly credible "experts".		Sure thing Mr Israel - 2 Navy Admirals, a US Secretary of State, an Under-Secretary of State, a General Legal Counsel of the Department of Defense, a U.S. Ambassador, and 2 Directors of the N.S.A., and other very high ranking members of the U.S. military and U.S. government - these are people who wouldn't have access to first hand reports, but you would have such knowledge of the event, after your 4 minute Google search regarding this subject, to attempt to discredit their knowledge and understanding of the event. 		We're expected to believe Israel follows a ship for 8 hours, attacks the ship for more than an hour, had several reconnaissance flights over the vessel prior to attacking, and Israel had no idea they were attacking a U.S. vessel.		>  It's very plausible that the two sides have different recollections regarding how well marked the Liberty was. Have you ever tried reading identification markings from a fast moving aircraft at relatively low level?		Eight separate reconnaissance flights over the Liberty over an 8 hour period. **Eight**. All were not low level, all were not fast moving. Maritime reconnaissance aircraft, the first Israeli aircraft responsible for surveying the Liberty, are not "low level, fast moving objects."		Also - any pilot, even one flying a low level fast attack craft, who cannot properly identify the The Liberty - a clearly marked vessel, flying a US flag, lettering on either side of the vessel would not be serving in any competent, 1st world military.		Ship identification is an aspect of a pilot's skill set and is a skill set highly trained. To make a statement as you did shows you truly have no idea about what you speak about.		>> [At approximately 0600 hours (all times local) on the morning of June 8, 1967 an Israeli maritime reconnaissance aircraft observer reported seeing "a US Navy cargo type ship](http://www.gtr5.com/summary_of_events.htm)," just outside the coverage of the Israeli coastal radar defense net, bearing the hull markings "GTR-5".[11] This report, made to Israeli naval HQ, was also forwarded immediately to the Israeli navy intelligence directorate.[12]		>> Throughout the remainder of the day prior to the attack, Israeli reconnaissance aircraft regularly flew out to USS Liberty's position and orbited the ship before returning to their bases in Israel. A total of no fewer than eight (8) such flights were made.[13]		>> At approximately 1050 hours, the naval observer from the early morning reconnaissance flight arrived at Israeli air force HQ and sat down with the air-naval liaison officer there. The two officers consulted Jane's Fighting Ships and learned that the ship reported earlier in the day was USS Liberty, a United States Navy technical research ship.[14]		>> From 0900 hours on June 8, 1967, until the time of the attack five hours later, USS Liberty maintained a speed of approximately five knots and a generally westerly-northwesterly course.[15]		>> At 1400 hours, while approximately 17 miles off the Gaza coast, USS Liberty's crew observed three surface radar contacts closing with their position at high speed. A few moments later, the bridge radar crew observed high speed aircraft passing over the surface returns on the same heading.[16]		>> Within a few short moments, and without any warning, Israeli fighter aircraft launched a rocket attack on USS Liberty. 		But, as you imply - the Israeli Air Force is so incompetent it cannot identify a vessel it follows for 8 hours. A vessel so unique to the world at the time, a vessel clearly marked, a slow moving vessel, in daytime with clear weather, in international waters, in time of war - the Israeli Air Force fails...oh but wait, we know Israel did identify the vessel several times so all claims based on non-identification are bullshit.			**Edit** Formatting.","depth":5,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"BobIsntHere","name":"t1_cp26lni","parent_id":"t1_cp1tehm","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425329280,"created_utc":1425329280}
{"body":"> these are people who wouldn't have access to first hand reports		You twist my words good friend.  I said "first hand knowledge", access to first hand reports is by definition second hand knowledge.  My point is that credentials does not improve the quality of your sources, it at best, improves the quality of your analysis and even then in the case of politicians it often does the opposite.		> Ship identification is an aspect of a pilot's skill set and is a skill set highly trained. To make a statement as you did shows you truly have no idea about what you speak about.		Yes and like all other witness testimony it is incredibly unreliable even when trained.  This is a fact.  Is it improbable that they misidentified the ship?  Maybe, I'd like to think so, but it's far from impossible.  Hanlon's razor.		I do know the facts in the case, all I'm trying to say is that the case is very wide open and there's next to no meaningful evidence that *at the moment the attack was authorized* the IDF command were aware that the Liberty was a US warship.  No more, no less.		Now is there plenty of evidence to suggest a coverup or at least a muddling of the facts afterward?  Certainly, but it's also completely understandable why this might happen.		If the Tarnak Farm incident can happen as a total blue on blue incident while the pilot himself was being warned not to attack friendlies then is it really that hard to believe that the IDF could cock up an attack on a misidentified ship in a very hot warzone?  These things *do* happen.  You don't need a conspiracy to create a tragic blue on blue incident.		How the politicians acted after the fact can not be used as evidence to implicate the decision making process before hand.		> At approximately 0600 hours (all times local) on the morning of June 8, 1967 an Israeli maritime reconnaissance aircraft observer reported seeing "a US Navy cargo type ship,"		This is interesting, but it's hardly a slam dunk that you make it out to be.  Modified Victory ships were the most common type of cargo ships in the world at that time.  And while one would think that the Liberty would be somewhat distinctive, even a cursory glance at photos shows you that the silhouette is pretty generic.  It's very plausible that one could confuse the Victory with any of a wide range of ships that would have been in the Med at that point in time.		You don't need to resort to name calling in order to make your point either.  If you took a look at my post history, I simply tend to come down on the side of being a skeptic in general and I've certainly been accused of the exact opposite bias against Israel in many cases.  I'm not pro-Israel here, I'm simply anti-implausible conspiracy theory that hasn't leaked after 50 years despite all of the motivation in the world for many people to do so.  My personal feelings on the matter are more along the lines that US behaviour can be explained in no small part due to embarrassment that the 6th Fleet and higher command fucked up than a desire to defend Israel.  And then once the overall implications were realized the path of lease resistance was to continue to cover up the truth for both political and career reasons for many involved.		Again, how do you explain that the IDF immediately notified the US Navy if their plan was to cover things up?  Or how the IDF moved into close enough range to shout out an offer of assistance to the Liberty after they called off the attack?  Seems like a pretty mediocre plan for an organization with the wits to cover up the conspiracy for the past 50 years...  Explain those two to me in a convincing manner that doesn't rely on second hand testimony or complex webs of misinformation by shady parties and I'd be willing to listen to the rest.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ooburai","name":"t1_cp4b7fg","parent_id":"t1_cp26lni","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425494742,"created_utc":1425494742}

Moorer) investigated the attack and made the following findings:		> "We, the undersigned, having undertaken an independent investigation of Israel's attack on USS Liberty, including eyewitness testimony from surviving crewmembers, a review of naval and other official records, an examination of official statements by the Israeli and American governments, a study of the conclusions of all previous official inquiries, and a consideration of important new evidence and recent statements from individuals having direct knowledge of the attack or the cover up, hereby find the following:		  1. That on June 8, 1967, after eight hours of aerial surveillance, Israel launched a two-hour air and naval attack against USS Liberty, the world's most sophisticated intelligence ship, inflicting 34 dead and 174 wounded American servicemen (a casualty rate of seventy percent, in a crew of 294);		  2. That the Israeli air attack lasted approximately 25 minutes, during which time unmarked Israeli aircraft dropped napalm canisters on USS Liberty's bridge, and fired 30mm cannons and rockets into our ship, causing 821 holes, more than 100 of which were rocket-size; survivors estimate 30 or more sorties were flown over the ship by a minimum of 12 attacking Israeli planes which were jamming all five American emergency radio channels;		  3. That the torpedo boat attack involved not only the firing of torpedoes, but the machine-gunning of Liberty's firefighters and stretcher-bearers as they struggled to save their ship and crew; the Israeli torpedo boats later returned to machine-gun at close range three of the Liberty's life rafts that had been lowered into the water by survivors to rescue the most seriously wounded;		  4. That there is compelling evidence that Israel's attack was a deliberate attempt to destroy an American ship and kill her entire crew; evidence of such intent is supported by statements from Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Undersecretary of State George Ball, former CIA director Richard Helms, former NSA directors Lieutenant General William Odom, USA (Ret.), Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, USN (Ret.), and Marshal Carter; former NSA deputy directors Oliver Kirby and Major General John Morrison, USAF (Ret.); and former Ambassador Dwight Porter, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon in 1967;		  5. That in attacking USS Liberty, Israel committed acts of murder against American servicemen and an act of war against the United States;		  6. That fearing conflict with Israel, the White House deliberately prevented the U.S. Navy from coming to the defense of USS Liberty by recalling Sixth Fleet military rescue support while the ship was under attack; evidence of the recall of rescue aircraft is supported by statements of Captain Joe Tully, Commanding Officer of the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, and Rear Admiral Lawrence Geis, the Sixth Fleet carrier division commander, at the time of the attack; never before in American naval history has a rescue mission been cancelled when an American ship was under attack;		  7. That although Liberty was saved from almost certain destruction through the heroic efforts of the ship's Captain, William L. McGonagle (MOH), and his brave crew, surviving crewmembers were later threatened with "court-martial, imprisonment or worse" if they exposed the truth; and were abandoned by their own government;		  8. That due to the influence of Israel's powerful supporters in the United States, the White House deliberately covered up the facts of this attack from the American people;		  9. That due to continuing pressure by the pro-Israel lobby in the United States, this attack remains the only serious naval incident that has never been thoroughly investigated by Congress; to this day, no surviving crewmember has been permitted to officially and publicly testify about the attack;		  10. That there has been an official cover-up without precedent in American naval history; the existence of such a cover-up is now supported by statements of Rear Admiral Merlin Staring, USN (Ret.), former Judge Advocate General of the Navy; and Captain Ward Boston, USN, (Ret.), the chief counsel to the Navy's 1967 Court of Inquiry of Liberty attack;		  11. That the truth about Israel's attack and subsequent White House cover-up continues to be officially concealed from the American people to the present day and is a national disgrace;		  12. That a danger to our national security exists whenever our elected officials are willing to subordinate American interests to those of any foreign nation, and specifically are unwilling to challenge Israel's interests when they conflict with American interests; this policy, evidenced by the failure to defend USS Liberty and the subsequent official cover-up of the Israeli attack, endangers the safety of Americans and the security of the United States.		> WHEREUPON, we, the undersigned, in order to fulfill our duty to the brave crew of USS Liberty and to all Americans who are asked to serve in our Armed Forces, hereby call upon the Department of the Navy, the Congress of the United States and the American people to immediately take the following actions:		> FIRST: That a new Court of Inquiry be convened by the Department of the Navy, operating with Congressional oversight, to take public testimony from surviving crewmembers; and to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of the attack on the USS Liberty, with full cooperation from the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the military intelligence services, and to determine Israel's possible motive in launching said attack on a U.S. naval vessel;		> SECOND: That every appropriate committee of the Congress of the United States investigate the actions of the White House and Defense Department that prevented the rescue of the USS Liberty, thereafter threatened her surviving officers and men if they exposed the truth, and covered up the true circumstances of the attack from the American people; and		> THIRD: That the eighth day of June of every year be proclaimed to be hereafter known as		> USS LIBERTY REMEMBRANCE DAY, in order to commemorate USS Liberty's heroic crew; and to educate the American people of the danger to our national security inherent in any passionate attachment of our elected officials for any foreign nation.		> We, the undersigned, hereby affix our hands and seals, this 22nd day of October, 2003.		* Admiral Thomas H.

Taken from the [Time article](http://world.time.com/2013/03/05/did-israeli-doctors-force-contraception-on-ethiopian-immigrants/)		* However, countless Ethiopian women have reportedly been given this contraceptive without understanding or consent.			Taken from the [Guardian article](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/28/ethiopian-women-given-contraceptives-israel)		* Reuben spoke to one woman who believed she had been given a flu vaccination and had no idea she had been injected with Depo-Provera.		* Another was pregnant with her fifth child when she arrived in the transit camp, where she would live for seven years. The woman in her thirties told Reuben that officials had gathered together all the new mothers in the camp and told them they would be given Depo-Provera as it would be too difficult for them to give birth Israel.		* "No, we didn't want to take it, we refused. We said we didn't want it," the unnamed woman recalls in the film. She agreed to the injections only because she was told her immigration to Israel would be blocked and she would receive no further healthcare in the camps if she refused.		> Sterilization is almost always used to describe permanency...		No it isn't. Your limited understanding and use of the word may allow you to argue how the word is used but your argument is invalid and is not an accurate representation of how the word is used.		In many instances sterilization is temporary and you will find no definition of the words sterilized, sterilization, sterilizing, and or sterilize which claims permanency as a requirement for any of the words. 		Easy examples 		* Tattoos. When a tattoo is done a needle is used. This needle must be sterilized. After one tattoo, or sitting, is done the need must again be sterilized prior to a 2nd use.		* Same with IV drug users. 		* Same with medical equipment in operating rooms. 		* Same with Depo-Provera - it sterilizes for a (roughly) 3 month period before another round of sterilization is done.		Logic1301 should have given you an understanding on how to think about this. All X does not equal Y, some X can equal Y, some X can equal Z. X being sterilization, Y being permanent, Z being temporary. Some sterilization is permanent, some sterilization is not permanent, permanency is not a requirement for sterilization.

{"body":"> What war would Israel be getting involved in by attacking Iran?		Ongoing hostilities between the two countries has been building up since the 90's. They haven't declared formal war on each other, but both sides have been hostile to a point that it would be accurate to say that an informal war is going on. 		Iran's funding and maintaining of terrorist groups at Israel's borders, terror attacks in Argentina that killed over 100 innocent people is still an open wound. Israel has committed many covert assassinations and air strikes of Iranian targets. [Here is a link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_proxy_conflict#2010)		> Iran has as much right to protect itself as Israel. 		They do. So did Saddam. So does Assad. But Israel's doctrine on WMD's developed by it's enemies is clear. 		It's called the [Begin Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begin_Doctrine) and it has been used twice. Against a reactor in Iraq in [Operation Opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera) and against a reactor in Syria in [Operation Orchard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Orchard).		So Iran can try and protect itself, but if it is developing nuclear weapons then Israel will thwart those attempts. It doesn't matter if the whole world condemns it. In Israel's eyes an enemy with a WMD means absolute destruction of Israel and with the suspected [Samson Option](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option) it also means the absolute annihilation of the offending country.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gmz_88","name":"t1_cp12btt","parent_id":"t1_cp11fd6","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1425238958,"created_utc":1425238958}
