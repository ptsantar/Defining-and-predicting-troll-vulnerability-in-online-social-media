They're barely able to make gains in places where they have support. They managed to exploit the weakness of the Syrian and Iraqi governments, but the moment they ran in to organized reaistance like the Kurdiah forces, they are very hard pressed to make any headway.		Nationalism is a thing in the Middle East and even if ISIS was run by saints they would still have trouble taking over outside their current borders. The fact that they are raving lunatics scares off the rational people and the politicians around them. The fact that they kill other Sunni Muslims pisses of a lot of religious fanatis who would be down with killing "infidels" but draw a line there.		You can expand by being good at war or grow by being charismatic and good at diplomacy, but if you suck at both, and they do, your movement is a glorified mob. Sure, you can get peoples passions up in the short run, but as time goes by and all you have to show for your effort is perpetual chaos and violence, the alure dies and the movement goes with it.","depth":2,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"neohellpoet","name":"t1_cl7eluc","parent_id":"t1_cl7ark3","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1413135281,"created_utc":1413131681}

{"body":"Turkey would be a difficult proposition because it's got one of the world's biggest armies, and could get NATO help as well. Also historically they are like the Kurds known to be very tough fighters, and ruled over most of the Arab world for centuries. ISIS' Islam is so extreme I doubt it could win majority support in Turkey, although I've seen articles saying 1000s of Turks have joined ISIS (or maybe we should call them ISUC!) Any rebellion would be brutally put down. They are a bit like the Russians in that sense.		It's currently difficult for them to attack ISIS as they inevitably get the hostility of Lebanon, Assad's loyalists and Iran if they do that, and also the Saudis would dislike it as they've been trying to replace Assad with a wahabi regime, and would remember former Turkish domination of the Levant and Arabia. Russia also regards Assad's Syria as a client state, so they'd also also very angry.","depth":1,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cl7eow1","parent_id":"t1_cl7b0dd","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1413135467,"created_utc":1413131867}
