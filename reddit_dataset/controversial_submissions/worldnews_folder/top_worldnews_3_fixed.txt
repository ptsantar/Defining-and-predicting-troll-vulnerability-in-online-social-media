{"body":">Are we going to ignore the fact that this is based solely on the testimony of Palestinians		Just LOL at you demanding impossible standard of proof for the palestinian people, in an area where it's clear who has the upper hand, and who is the oppresser and who is the oppressor.		More reporting from HRW, before this opertaion even started:		>Human Rights Watch investigated seven incidents between January 2 and March 1, in which Israeli forces shot civilians in the vicinity of the fence. Four were killed, including a high school student on a picnic and a woman with an intellectual disability who was lost. Five others were wounded, including two journalists and two demonstrators planting olive trees, none of whom posed a threat to the soldiers or others. The Israeli military has not claimed that any of the victims in the seven cases were engaged in military operations or that armed groups were in the area when the shooting occurred.		http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/04/24/israel-stop-shooting-gaza-civilians%20		>On February 28, Israeli soldiers shot Amina Qdeih, a 58-year-old woman with an intellectual disability, who got lost while walking home from a wedding party. Her relatives heard shooting near the perimeter fence late at night, but because of fears of attack by Israeli drones overhead, they did not find her body until 6 a.m. the next morning. A hospital report said she had a gunshot wound to her abdomen and died of blood loss.		and		>On February 13, Israeli forces fatally shot 35-year-old Ibrahim Mansour in the head while he and others collected rubble for building material several hundred meters from the perimeter fence. A witness told Human Rights Watch that an Israeli military vehicle fired teargas at four apparently unarmed men, who then fled. When Mansour and others who had taken cover resumed working, Israeli forces fired at them with live ammunition, killing Mansour and wounding another worker as they tried to run away.		also		>Human Rights Watch???s research shows that the primary reason for the high Lebanese civilian death toll during the conflict was Israel???s frequent failure to abide by a fundamental obligation of the laws of war, the duty to distinguish at all times between military targets that can be legitimately attacked, and civilians, who are not subject to attack. This was compounded by Israel???s failure to take adequate safeguards to prevent civilian casualties.		http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/lebanon0907/9.htm","depth":1,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"WomenAreAlwaysRigh","name":"t1_cjirzpq","parent_id":"t1_cjidt16","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1407356886,"created_utc":1407353286}
