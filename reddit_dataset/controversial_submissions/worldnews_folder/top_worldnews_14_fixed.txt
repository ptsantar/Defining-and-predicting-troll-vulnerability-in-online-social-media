Change turn end altitude from 60 km to 100 km. For large rockets also increase the angle to 50?? although this might not be necessary because lowering AoA will have similar effect.

{"body":">yeah. Not dwindling water superlies, dwindling oil supplies, war, or starvation.		>Space exploration obviously dwarfs those petty things.		It does actually.		War will never not be.  Even if you disagree with that, there's literally no amount of money which can achieve that goal.		Starvation, same answer, though less inevitable.		Water supplies aren't dwindling globally, at least not in a meaningful way.  But again, even if you disagree, a totally viable place to find new water is in space.   Do you know what comets are?			Making humanity an interplanetary species makes us functionally eternal, at least as a species.  If we find a way off this particular planet, it provides an immunity against a nuclear apocalypse.  It offers an immediate and obvious solution for overcrowding, and potentially allows billions of humans to be relocated to places with better growing conditions and/or food supplies.  Water will literally never be an issue if we become a spacefaring race. 		Eventually going somewhere else, and colonizing, means we can outlast our own Sun.  We would no longer have all our eggs in one basket.		Obviously this is all centuries out, at best.  But as a species we are taking our baby steps right now, and we need to bust our asses a few times before we really get this thing down.  Crawl walk run, right?		What we don't need is a bunch of Luddites cloaking themselves in the mantles of moral superiority and empathy trying to sabotage and denigrate these efforts.  The problems you've listed have been problems for literally all of humanity's existence.  Despite spending all this money on space exploration, which is a fraction of a percent of the budget I might add, all the problems you've complained about are in a downward trend.  Despite all the problems, and there are many, humanity is objectively doing better than any time in its past.  That's amazing, and a part of those improvements have come from explorations into seemingly frivolous or overly dreamy ideas.		So fuck your negativity.  Our species dares to dream, and to explore.  Sorry you missed out on that general instinct, but it has served the rest of us well, and we'll carry on without you.

NASA is 0.5% of the budget and brings far more good than war. We all need to defend ourselves, but we have a more pressing need to cooexist peacefully to ensure the survival of humanity.

That's not how scientific research works. Science is not a function of money, it is a function of manpower and time. Money might pay for the manpower, but the manpower is what is limited in scientific fields. There are not enough qualified people to carry out the science that is needed to be done, and much of science is based on previous science. You can't just throw money at it to make it go faster. 		It's better to research as broadly as possible, it leads to more discoveries, and both military and space are important areas of research that benefit all of science and engineering.		> Don't get me wrong, space is cool, but what exactly will sending someone to Mars (for example) accomplish?		If you're focusing on the first trip, then you're focusing on the wrong thing. The first people on Mars will be a test run to ensure people can be sent there, successfully, without long term issues.

{"body":"Shuttles like [Discovery](http://i.imgur.com/F0lrODP.jpg) would only really "fly" on the way down, and actually did more of a [glide](http://i.imgur.com/mKeSltI.jpg). When they launched, they launched [vertically with other rockets helping them out](http://i.imgur.com/lCs9oJm.jpg) (the center orange thing is actually a fuel tank). Those rockets were kinda reusable iirc (Edit: The internal parts could be refurbished) , but to pick them up, you needed a ship to go looking for them. The shuttle was super cool because of how long people could stay in space, and because of how the core component (the glider/orbiter) could be reused after being patched up. 		* Tl;Dr: Discovery only flew on the way down, and needed help to get into space.		SpaceX, is using a system [similar](http://i.imgur.com/gS0cQkF.jpg) to [Apollo](http://i.imgur.com/WRDdINR.jpg), where all of the [parts of the rocket](http://i.imgur.com/suMI1r4.jpg) are generally unusable when/if they are fished out of the ocean. SpaceX is trying to change that by having the parts of the rocket [pilot themselves safely to the surface](https://youtu.be/CfMuvsC9k2U?t=1m6s) after they aren't needed any more. That would make multiple launches considerably cheaper because you wouldn't need to build an entirely new rocket. They have been less than successful with their first test, [however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhMSzC1crr0).		* Tl;Dr: SpaceX is using a different system than Discovery because it's probably cheaper (when they get the kinks worked out).		What you were talking about is [SSTO, or Single Stage To Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit). That's basically when you have a plane that flies from a runway, without helpful Booster rockets, [into space and back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-oVbabd1aQ). We currently don't have the means to do that, and would need [unproven technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYKlLEzDHIk) to achieve it (although a European company, among others, have a mock-ups that looks promising ??? if we can figure out how to build it). In theory, this system would be ideal, but we can't currently get it "off the ground." 		* Tl;Dr: The system you proposed is a real thing, and is actually in development right now.

{"body":"What you have to keep in mind that thanks to the rocket equation mass is really important. For every kg you add to your spacecraft you have to add additional fuel to lift it and then because your additional fuel also adds mass to your rocket you have to add additional fuel to lift the additional fuel and so on. This is an interesting read on the topic: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html		Bringing a "plane" along just so can land more easily adds a lot of weight to your payload.		Also keep in mind that the vertical landing (of the first stage) is just an additional bonus. The main goal is to get the payload into orbit and for this it doesn't really matter if you manage to land the first stage. It would just help to decrease the cost of future launches since you could reuse the first stage.		And the idea of space planes for getting into orbit also has a few problems. You would need normal engines to take off and use while in the atmosphere and then you would need some kind of rocket engine once you reach an altitude where there is not enough oxygen left. So you need to bring basically two different engines, which adds weight and brings us back to our problem we had in the beginning.

{"body":"ZetaTalk explains why SpaceX has continually been failing in its attempt to re-land its rockets, as well as other rocket failures		> &nbsp; What is the message here? Space X has had several successful resupply launches to the ISS, where [Orbital Sciences failed last October](http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/01no2014.htm) and [Russian launches failed last Spring](http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/23ma2015.htm). As with other failed launches, this most recent failure is a definitive message from the Council of Worlds. Where in the past they have chided wealthy Russians planning to block migration into Russian lands they control, or to give them intel on survival communities so that slave labor might be arranged, on this Space X failure there was no such message.		> &nbsp; In the past they have chided the Orbital Sciences backers for their plans to save themselves during the Pole Shift while keeping the knowledge of Nibiru???s approach a secret from the common man, and in part the Space X failures on June 28, 2015 bore that message from the Council as well. Space X has had success in resupplying the ISS, though has flounded on landing on a floating ocean platform.  Resupply of the ISS is OK, reuse of their launch equipment so as to help the elite escape, not OK.		> &nbsp; The message now is that the elite should not expect to get into space AT ALL. No escape. The message here is to take all hope away from such plans among the elite. They are to remain on Earth with the common man, and to the degree that they block the common man from preparing for survival with strong survival camps, they damage their own changes of survival. They can chose starving, rioting survivors or allow Obama to make his announcement and help the common man establish on safe grounds. We expect the battle to shift from attempts to block the announcement, or deny its meaning, to attempts to enslave the common man in some way. That is another fight, on another day.		> &nbsp; What of the ISS, which for today does not get its fresh supplies? The ISS has an escape pod for the astronauts on board, who can leave by this route whenever they choose. The ISS has been used for space based studies, which was to assist the elite during future travels to Mars or the Moon. What can survive in space? What is the effect of low gravity on life? None of these studies benefits the common man on Earth, nor was it intended to do so. Since man, in his present form, and in his present immature spiritual development would not be allowed to travel in space, the ISS is irrelevant. It is best it be closed down, and the astronauts returned safely to Earth.  		> -- [**ZetaTalk** Chat for July 4, 2015](http://poleshift.ning.com/forum/topics/zetatalk-chat-for-july-4-2015?commentId=3863141%3AComment%3A1002231&xg_source=activity)","depth":0,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"a_jaxx","name":"t1_cslti6n","parent_id":"t3_3bekjg","subreddit":"worldnews","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","created":1435535316,"created_utc":1435531716}
