{"body":"Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. That's why we released the [better banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tools a couple months ago, which allows us to put a user in timeout with an explanation. This helps correct behavior.		Moderators can still ban users from their communities, and it's not transparent. I don't like this, and I get a lot of complaints from confused users. However, the moderators don't have a ton of alternatives. [Improving reporting with more rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/42o2i0/moderators_subreddit_rules_now_available_for_all/) is a step in the right direction.

{"body":"Hi /u/Spez, can you comment on the criticism that Suspensions/Muting and the new tools have actually caused an increase in the animosity between users and moderators? In /r/science, this is a constant problem that we deal with. 		Muting users has done essentially the same thing as banning them has - it ultimately tells them their behavior is unacceptable, and encourages them to reach out in modmail to discuss the situation with us further. 90% of the time, this results in them sending hateful messages to use that are full of abuse. We are then told to mute them in modmail, and they are back in 72 hours to abuse us some more. We have gone to the community team to report these users, and are told completely mixed answers. In some cases, we are told that by merely messaging the user to stop abusing us in modmail, we are engaging them and thus nothing can be done. In other cases, we are told that since we didn't tell them to stop messaging us, nothing can be done.		You say that you want to improve moderator relations, but these new policies have only resulted in us fielding *more* abuse. It has gotten so bad in /r/science, that we have resorted to just banning users with automod and not having the automated reddit system send them any more messages, as the level of venomous comments in modmail has gotten too high to deal with. We have even recently had moderators receive death threats over such activities. This is the exact opposite scenario that you would wish to happen, but the policies on moderator abuse are so lax that we have had to take actions into our own hands.

{"body":"A public way for users to report mod abuse would go a long way. The best chances they have now:		* finding some other sub to post in (subreddit drama, etc.)	* posting and hoping automod doesn't catch it, and hoping the sub mods don't see it for a few hours		Ideally this would be something outside of a mod's control. /r/me_irl/complaints or /issues could be reserved for users with a +10 net submission score & +10 net comment score in the sub, and only be subject to Reddit's sitewide rules. Maybe misusing it (hate speech or other violations of the sitewide rules) could lead to a permaban, and maybe the net score before you can post has to be tweaked. 		This idea is a compromise between "users should be able to post what they want" and "a head mod has full control over their sub". There could be some site-level link from a sub to its complaints department (like in the sidebar somewhere), and tampering with that could be made against Reddit rules. Other than that, the complaint content could be invisible to users. They'd have to seek it out.		As a mod, I try to proactively encourage dissent. We get dissent in /r/rct very rarely, but it's actually allowed in our rules -- users can post directly to the sub or message the mods. We also try to get feedback from them about the sub, but the typical [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) means we rarely get responses. I don't know if this is a realistic rule to keep when your sub has millions of subscribers, but it works for us so far. That's why I think some kind of semi-in-sub but not quite system would work best. It would negate mod complaints about cluttering up the sub, yet still keep their power somewhat in check.

In this case that policy would be how they would plan to run the subreddit (how strict, what rules, what content etc) 		Choosing just from people who say the most will not really help much I think as it only randomly narrows your pool of potential leaders based on an attribute that does not really correspond to how good the ideas are. 		The best moderator might actually be a dispassionate fairly neutral user who does not have much stake in the community, but is willingly to put in the quiet work behind the scenes and doesnt have to sacrifice any big karma gains they care about to do a good job.		The best mods might also be the very active prolific poster who cares a lot about the community too though, so they shouldnt be ruled out either. 		But your suggestion, it is already subverting the idea how democracy is supposed to choose the best leaders. You have just introduced a systematic bias towards loud people who talk most, and that is an assumption about who would make the best moderator decisions that you have made (and probably cannot back up with science.)		The problem I was referring to in my earlier comment was that for a democracy to work, you need discussions of ideas, and policy and merits, so that people can choose who to vote on based on how they want to run the system they are in. 		You need to have those discussions and policy platforms otherwise you are not having a democratic contest of ideas, you are having a popularity vote which has no relevance at all to how well someone can lead/govern. (as a side note, the lack of this in real life politics, as well as the poor level of understanding of policy and governance is why democracy fails in real life to actually elect good leaders and only serves as a means to prevent terrible leaders being as common, with average results being mediocre leadership.)		To have this discussion it needs to be in the place where your electorate will be able to see it and examine it if they are to vote on it.

{"body":"> Yes, and this is a problem. I would like this problem to be addressed. I think the users are a valuable part of reddit. The admin team and mods, in general, seem to have a different opinion on this.		You're missing the point, though. At any time since moderators existed, moderators always had the power to abuse it as they wished. That's the subreddit system; the mods decide what to make of their subs, and people subscribe to it if it's good. The mods are shit ? make a new sub that is better, move on. It's not perfect but mostly, people who are mods are generally people who are genuinely interested in the subject of the subs they mod. There is abuse from time to time, but it's not general. And in some rare cases, like in defaults or other influencial subs, Admins would sometimes step in. 		The reason the mute option was introduced was not to silence users for fun, it was **not** to give more powers to the mods against users. On the contrary, it was to give mods who wanted to keep an open dialogue with users another tool to keep abuse under control, without shutting out users. 		Redditors at large seems to have this idea that mods take decisions at a whim and like to showcase their powers, but never seem to grasp the concept that 'what some Redditors want at a given moment' might not be what's best for a sub; rules exist for a reason, and need to be enforced. Just yesterday, I've seen a communicative, open, and genuinely well meaning mod get downvoted to oblivion and get insulted, for telling people to stop posting personal info about a girl in a gif. But .. it's called doxxing, which is not only against the rules of that sub, it's also against the rules of Reddit; many people get shadowbanned for that (despite spez's saying he doesn't like shadowbans).		The users are a valuable part of reddit. But not when they're acting like petulant children trying to prove a point against their parents. Mods are not their parents.

{"body":"**tldr; I'd like an option to view and participate in removed posts/comments.  For large default subs I'd like to see mod culpability via meta moderation, public mod logs and moderator elections or impeachment.**		Hi spez, I'm glad you're back. I've got a related opinion from the other side of this issue.  (by the way, I was the guy who originally suggested the controversial tab in that thread about /u/linuxer so long ago).  I think the subscribers and contributors to large subs should get a say in how it is moderated. I understand that if a user creates their own sub they should be king of that sub free to rule it as capriciously or vindictively as they want.  But when subs become significantly large or are a default the moderation should be held to a higher ethical standard. I would like to see slashdot style meta moderation by contributors and mandatory public moderation logs for default and large subreddits. Maybe even moderator elections or impeachment. I constantly see posts removed for ambiguous reasons or via selective enforcement of the rules.  When it happens to you repeatedly it can feel very Orwellian and frustrating.   It especially sucks when this happens in large default subreddits and you are mocked or muted when you ask about it.   		As a user I would like an option to be able to see and participate in deleted threads and comments. I don't need to be protected from text and it should be up to me and not the mods if I want to see it. I understand that legally you are required to remove some things, but beyond that I should have the option of seeing everything. similarly,  Reddit is successful precisely because it is democratic, The more heavily moderated it is the worse this place becomes. I honestly think that down votes should be enough for hiding anything that isn't straight up illegal. I would really prefer if mods were more or less spam custodians as opposed to gatekeepers.  If subscribers are voting something up,  I think it's wrong for moderators to remove it. 		I miss the days when this place was just science and programming. The level of discourse was much higher and people had more respect for reddiquete.  I know what I've asked for could be months of work but please consider it.

What somebody says is hardly the last word. The fact is that Reddit at both the macro and micro level is really about the users. Without users, both a subreddit as well as it Reddit itself is like an empty arena. 		Not to mention, mods do not actually **own** their subs. They are granted authority over them only because the admins let/need them. The mods may be unaccountable to the users, but the admins have the real power. A mod is basically just the operator of a fast food franchise. As the above poster said, if you want total control over your own little online sandbox, start a blog. And even then the same natural law applies - without users, your site is lame.		> Yea, mod abuse is a problem. Mod impeachment doesn't fix it, taking over other people's creations isn't a fix either.		Unless you're suggesting the mods create most of the content, calling a subreddit a moderator's creation is facetious.

This is like a business owner saying "you don't like my crappy product, go buy from someone else!". In principle this is true, but that's a gross oversimplification. A business owner can tell all his clients/customers/users to go sit and spin, and even if he doesn't have competition, the market if pushed too far can just leave them to rot, and once it happens, it's almost impossible to correct. A free market does not liberate sellers from the need for buyers. 		A large subreddit is like a franchise mixed with a public corporation. Once you cross a certain threshold and become *de facto* dependent upon outside contributions, you stop becoming the sole authority over your common asset. Suggesting that the moderators of default subs don't have to be accountable to the userbase is like saying a company board can tell the shareholders to sit and spin - that's simply not how the Force works, in theory or in practice.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"caesarfecit","name":"t1_czmxr1i","parent_id":"t1_czfuzkt","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454572893,"created_utc":1454544093}

Banning someone isn't designed to cause them to talk to themselves without realizing it for an extended period of time, and discouraging shadowbanning isn't intended to be for the benefit of moderators.		Banning pisses people off, that's a simple fact of any forum, and it's one almost everyone on the internet has accepted for a very long time. You should learn to accept and handle that as part of being a moderator.

Same thing as /r/History 		Read this and tell me if you think it deserved a perma ban when most of the rules talk about warning or temp ban for even their more serious breaking of rules. 		https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/3eunux/update_banned_from_rhistory_4_minutes_after_this/			I was permabanned for essentially saying "maybe Graham Hancock is right" in a submission about revision of early farming in the region around present day Israel. 		The mod wouldn't even discuss it and kept telling me rudely not to message then again. (this was before mute or they would have surely done that first). 		I'm an 8 year user and subscriber to and participant in history for years and years now and yet I'm permabanned because some nebulous interpretation of conspiracy theory and mod discretion mixed with whatever bad mood the mod was in that day? I'm not a troll, racist, nazis, Holocaust denier.		All I said was maybe a theory was correct in a discussion about an archeological discovery. 		Read what DavidReiss666 says about the mod in question. "I stand by whatever that mod does because I know they are a good mod". Notice he never addresses the content of what I'm asking about:		https://np.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/42neab/a_permanent_mod_mail_mute_is_needed/czdkwte		Mod discretion has become "whatever we don't like" and it immediately devolves to the most extreme examples as a rebuttal to moderate questions. 		>For example you delete all comments that doubt the existence of 'white privilege' or talk about other possible causes of socioeconomic data.		Science that isn't along acceptable topics is wrongthink and will be therefore removed under "mod discretion" 		>You also ban people who point out that these comments are removed.		>You refuse to say you are doing it, and refuse to say in your rules that you define white privilige as a scientific fact. 		This is perhaps a tenuous topic because of the ease with which mods will dismiss such topics as bigotry and racism or even nazism. 		It's the mod equivalent of national security and protecting the children. 		Whenever discussion of problematic topics comes up stereotypes are thrown around like pejoratives. 		>You claim that it falls under the rule which says people who deny the existence of gravity will be removed. However there is absolutely no scientific consensus on this (unlike gravity), as evidenced by the fact that the majority of people tend to be in uproar, gettting muted deleted and banned.		How many people who mod /r/science are scientists and how many mods of /r/History are historians? 		>https://imgur.com/a/vfK8R		>I do think people would not be so angry with you if you were at least transparent about what you are doing here.

{"body":"To speak to it from a social science perspective, privilege as part of a larger hegemonic lens of analysis is a tool. It is a way of analyzing a situation that reveals difference in access to/control over power, money, and voice. Race can be an important variable in an analysis like that. Say, for example, you were looking at economic opportunities during South African apartheid the large scale systemic inequalities along racial or ethnic lines would be very relevant. So "white privilege" (meaning whites don't face conscious and unconscious bias and barriers to do with their racial category) would be an appropriate lens to use. 		White privilege isn't  discussed like a scientific fact because that doesn't make sense for a toolbox or lens of analysis. The question that any author should be answering in their lit review is whether white privilege is relevant and an appropriate tool for analyzing the data they are discussing. Readers who engage the data and lit review and want to discuss whether white privilege is useful, relevant, or appropriate are fine. From my own perspective, I often critique it for being too flat and scholars often fail to flesh it out with other intersecting variables and lenses. 		However, if someone rants, "White privilege isn't a fact!!!!11" it suggests they don't even understand what they are discussing. If they are trying to argue that it is always an erroneous lens of analysis then they are arguing during New World slavery, Jim Crow, colonialism, and Apartheid white people weren't systematically given affordances and non-whites denied equal access to many arenas of power, politics, and so forth. That kind of slavery denialism is not welcome in our sub just as denying the holocaust will get you kicked. 		*TLDR white privilege is merely a lens of analysis for understanding power dynamics along a single dimension.

{"body":"I used to be subscribed to /r/srs, a long long time ago. Back before the drama about vote brigading occurred. Maybe I was completely blind back then, or maybe they were just better at the time... But I remember /r/srs being a subreddit where people would link a comment of someone being a genuine ass. Not a grey area or joke comment or anything. Just pure bullying and such. Basically, SRS used to link comments and threads that were guilty of doing the very things they take pride in doing, that everyone hates them for.		But then it became nasty. I'd voice my opinion about something, trying to take the diplomatic route. But the downvotes would pour in. That is, until I straight up said they weren't being fair and got banned for it. But this was after leaving for a couple months since the toxicity there was having a very bad effect one me. Got unbanned at one point, then banned again because I got featured in SRS.		In the time that I was there though, there would be comments that would actually say things like "downvote this fucker" or people clearly from SRS (announcing it or otherwise) would then rush to downvote and comment on whatever they were doing. Even when I was part of the subreddit, I never went to downvote or interact with linked comments. I just observed, then discussed it in the SRS threads.		They took more and more pride in doing things like that. There was a point where they actually changed their subreddit style to have their posts and comments featured as "negative karma" without allowing for downvotes. It's meant to be a reference to how they would "invade" threads and the comments linked to SRS, and how they wore their negative karma in those threads with pride. It's also meant to reference what that sub became: An excuse to just downvote brigade.		The fact that SRS was never dealt with kind of makes me understand why people have those conspiracy theories about how the higher ups are in on it, and are doing the same thing that the mods of SRS and other subreddits are doing: Picking and choosing what "bad behavior" they'll take care of, and removing things that they don't *like* whether those things are a problem or not.","depth":8,"score":20,"ups":20,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Xervicx","name":"t1_czfpa12","parent_id":"t1_czfog6u","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454050123,"created_utc":1454021323}

They were consistently downvoted heavily for it, and so there were multiple threads in SRS that showed that the community at the time felt like that was a badge of honor. Essentially, upvotes and downvotes in external subreddits were treated the same.		2. Their tendency to mass downvote users who post the threads or comments linked in SRS. It was alluded to a lot back when I mostly read the subreddit. Links to specific users were common, "piece of shit" was used to describe people multiple times. References to the downvotes the user(s) had received and encouragement to "keep it up" with the downvoting and abusive comments. I'm not entirely sure what SRS is like now, but it was already bad back before their ways became well known enough to where if mass downvotes came in, you could be sure that checking SRS would show that your comment had been linked there just before the downvotes started.","depth":9,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Xervicx","name":"t1_czfpi4m","parent_id":"t1_czfolw4","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454050461,"created_utc":1454021661}

{"body":"Hi Steve,		I am absolutely certain I will get downvoted for this, as is tradition every time I ask or talk about this.		I've been unemployed since August of last year and for a while now I have been trying to get a position with Reddit, Inc. I have applied for several positions I am qualified for and I fear I keep getting rejected is because of either my Reddit history or my location. I just want to let you know that I will clean up my Reddit act (if I need to), and that relocating from Oklahoma to literally anywhere else will not be an issue. 		Am I desperate for a job? Absolutely.		Is that why I want a job at Reddit? Not by a long shot. 		I sent you a PM, but I know they aren't usually responded to and I am even more certain that you will not respond to this commment. I want to be a part of the Reddit family and I will do almost anything to make that a reality.

Ron Paul was absolutely the Sanders of 2008, and Reddit was overwhelmed by threads and posts about him. They coined the term moneybomb and managed to set a single day record for indie campaign contributions. It was an attempt to show the world that Ron Paul had a serious support base and that it was worth it for the "establishment" to support him.		One guy dropped a bunch of money on a blimp. I forget what the specifics were, but I remember Ron Paul + blimp.		Ron Paul, of course, had zero support from his party for many of the same reasons why Rand Paul and Sanders don't have support from their parties. You spend your career not being an active part of your party and not helping it out (or in Sanders' case, not being a member to begin with), you don't make any friends. Being president means building a coalition, so it's really nothing personal when a bunch of strangers don't support you.		Ron Paul lost every super Tuesday state. Sanders will go roughly the same way, except unlike Paul, who didn't influence his party at all, Sanders will definitely be passing along some of his policies to the eventual winner (probably Clinton), and will not have run his campaign in vain. Paul got some new blood into the Republican party, but a lot of those folks pushed too hard and the GOP pushed back harder. So many of them dropped the idea of working with a coalition and moved on.

{"body":"They have never denied this. It's just that there are two very loud groups on reddit who raised a shit storm about it. 		There was the group that was screaming about censorship on the first page because vote totals decayed and their prized post wasn't the top of /r/about lol anymore. So the admins changed the algorithm so points wouldn't decay as fast. And then another group started bitching about how stagnant the front page was because the point totals weren't decaying fast enough. 		The second group actually had a valid complaint so the admins reverted their changes back to the original algorithm. But that algorithm is still flawed because it was never meant to handle the scale and shape reddit grew to. And the admins said exactly that when they reverted the changes. 		One of the big problems is that a person's front page is made up of the top posts of all of their subscribed subreddits. And every subreddit is a different size. AskReddit is fucking massive, 10 million subscribers or something and the top post there always has several thousand votes. But something like /r/PeanutButter only as a couple hundred subscribers and rarely has new content. Yet reddit's algorithm needs to handle sorting both of these subs the exact same way. But then you also have weird ass subreddits like IAMA where there are a lot of subs, but only the top post gets votes. And that post will have thousands of points and the next biggest will be lucky to get more than a couple dozen. So the top post there will take up the front page slot for IAMA for over a day.

{"body":">to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators		As a moderator, I'm not really sure this happened. Look in /r/ModSupport which was suppose to be a communication channel between mods and admins. The majority of the topics (which are questions) have no admin response. I have a couple topics in there from weeks ago with no admin comment. I sent a modmail to that subreddit 7 days ago just asking if the subreddit was still planned to be a communication tool between us mods and admins. I never got a reply. I'm losing count of all the "having major spam issues" questions in /r/ModSupport that receive no admin reply; a single response would be enough. It seems to have fallen to as little admin participation as /r/modtalk gets.		I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.		A year ago, reddit hired a "Community Engineer" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this. Modmail is one of the most important things for us moderators; even having an acknowledge/resolved button would be fantastic.		/r/snoogaming (created by an admin) remains abandoned by the admins with us moderators trying to pick up the slack. I had to pull teeth like no tomorrow to get a basic answer on what the future of this was from an admin perspective. This was before you returned though I think.		I barely hear anything from the admins nowadays. I get replies on /r/reddit.com PMs when I contact them about ban evasion, but I got replies like that 2 years ago so things are as they were.

No fix nor admin comments in the last 20 days. Not only that, but with reddit.com owning the app now the admins developing that app don't seem to be staying on top of their own reddit changes. I don't believe the new subreddit rule system (which was in beta for a while) is even implemented on the app? And as a moderator, subreddit rules being front and center on mobile is very important to us. If reddit is developing a new system like that, don't you think it should be implemented into AlienBlue in parallel?		I'm not trying to pick on individual admins, scenarios or people. I am trying to show a pattern that is not changing. reddit is a *professional business*. It's very concerning.

An admin making a submission is admin->mods, which we've always had. What we moderators need is a mods->admins flow on a public area. That's what I thought the subreddit was.

So since I belief this is important I am just going to make sure that you see this comment. So I'll just leave the same comment as a reply here once per week until the next time you visit reddit. At that time when you don't respond I have simple confirmation that you purposely are ignoring this and otherwise we might be able to finally have a proper conversation. 			A little while ago I left [this specific comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/czfl4n6?context=3) as a response to the same comment I am now replying to. You never answered it, when I talked with /u/kn0thing about it he flat out refused to say anything meaningful about it either. Before I continue, below is my original comment just so it is easier to follow.		>>  but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working	    	> Uh,  what? This is not what was promised to mods months ago as there was specifically talk about tools for mods to better deal with brigading. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider your answer and write something that is actually an answer? 		To continue on this track, your response doesn't make sense to begin with. You can't solve an issue top down when you are struggling to find a definition for it. Ideas about what exactly is a brigade vary (and as far as I can tell you guys never really asked around properly as well). So why not give mods the tools that allow them roughly see how many people are coming from outside the subreddit to posts, how many from outside reddit, how many are actually subscribers, etc and then based on that set limits on what those people can or can't do. 		That would be one idea, which isn't new btw. /u/relic2279 proposed something similar [over 9 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/31ur5x/do_you_think_brigading_is_a_real_issue/cq64afe). 		In any case, I wouldn't have so much of an issue with all of this if it didn't seem like you are purposely ignoring the issues at hand. In fact, it almost seems like you are arguing **against moderators being able to do any moderating**. In this same thread you said some empty line about [not liking to ban users from their communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/czfegi7) while ignoring the fact that trolls, etc are **not part of the community**. To me this entire thread feels like you are trying to appease a vocal minority that sees these sorts of posts as a perfect platform to complain about not being able to do their trolling and other unwanted behaviour. 		I don't know, but it almost feels like you are trying to actively pin things on us (moderators). Saying things that make the admins sound better to the censorship crowd and effectively slapping mods on the wrist for even thinking that we can ban people from our subs. 		Is this because you are trying to distance yourself from all the drama? But does that mean you need to crucify the volunteers that do the majority of the work? Trying to keep them just enough appeased by some token modtools that are much much less than what was promised months ago just after the blackouts? 		I am saying token modtools because some of them seem to be intentionally crippled as well. Muting is all nice and dandy but next to useless when users start to message mods individually or set a timer and come back after three days to continue with the abuse. Meanwhile we are told to not engage them where in many case it looks like that the action of muting itself is seen as engaging them...

{"body":"> How does it feel to watch /r/nottheonion upvote shit that would never appear in the onion and completely ignore articles that would?		One of the difficulties of reddit is that it requires an active and strong moderator team - and a userbase that understands how things work.		The job of the moderator is, among other things, to be the gatekeeper for the subreddit's charter: Removing submissions that shouldn't go there. Then, the users should upvote/downvote what they think is good.		Now, one problem is a lot of redditors disagree with the above. "Mods shouldn't remove things!" - but that just means things that appeal to quick browsers and the lowest common denominator will get upvotes. And people don't pay attention where things are submitted, only what they like on their frontpage, so they'll upvote whatever.		That's one way a subreddit goes to hell - any subreddit.		But it is also very difficult to mod a subreddit like /r/nto just because what's oniony is EXTREMELY subjective. Countless times when was still head mod, but had brought on a mod team to help, one of us would remove something; the OP would invariably complain, and we'd discuss. Surprising how often mods disagreed with each other on what was oniony.		Add to that that nobody's perfect, being a moderator on reddit is extremely difficult as far as presenting a united front and acting consistently is concerned, and the fact that most OPs think their submission is the shit, that's why they submitted it, why are you censoring me.............. Add to that a bit of sheer luck or unluck... and one final ingredient: Submissions go live immediately unless they hit the spam filter. So mods are always looking at live submissions and removing ones that don't fit (in a perfect world) - but meanwhile, people have already seen "Hey, THAT one was submitted!" and might not see the removal later...........		It's a perfect shitstorm that generates understandable complaints.		That being said, for all reddit's faults, there's still a hell of a lot of good here.","depth":3,"score":36,"ups":36,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"IsaacEiland-Hall","name":"t1_czg3c1n","parent_id":"t1_czfkzar","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454074524,"created_utc":1454045724}

{"body":"Hate speech is defined as		>speech that attacks or disparages a person or group of persons on the basis of origin, race, nationality, ethnicity, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.		So basically if your "truth" is that e.g. muslims are inferior or worse in some way *because* they're muslims, yes expressing that is hate speech. It's questionable how true (as in an objective fact about reality) prejudice like that can ever be, although of course there are people for whom it's perceived as truth.		If you want to criticise a group based on some apparent truth, it comes down to how you do it. This is obviously a huge grey area but it's only really an issue when someone is just trying to justify the above by dressing it up with facts. If you're not intentionally trying to justify hatred of whatever group I really doubt you need to worry about doing it accidentally.		Bear in mind that not having this kind of rule about a bare minimum of civility for other people would not be good for the ideal that freedom of speech is supposed to protect. If a community vilifies any group of people, that's going to inevitably result in marginalising and silencing that group (the protected characteristics in the definition above are frequent victims of this).

Unless that subreddit is spewing forth its members to invade other subreddits, there isn't a problem here and this idea that a mod has to fix this is dumb. 		how it works is this: in the beginning there were few subs, and people just had to put up with everyone else. Then, as people made more and more subs, the main subs got away with "this doesn't belong in this sub, go post it in this obscure tiny sub where nobody will ever see it!" so what's left is a bunch of isolated subs, one main sub that's just full of fucking trash and reposts, and reddit has become shittier for it.

{"body":"This is not a good explination. I see where your points come from, but they seem to be coming from someone who hasn't really been around on reddit too long or been a member of other/previous websites, especially before reddit was any popular. You seem to pride yourself that "Nope things are just bad now sorry but nothing we can do about it".		It *is* the point of a website to be used. *Especially* when the moderators are not the owners of the website. Again, I want to repeat that.		 Moderators do not own the website. By and large, most of them are not the people who even created a given subreddit. Even more and more you see moderators who will "Moderate" 5 or 10 really large sub because thats what they are. Some career moderator who does it just through "popularity" and effort because they don't have a job in real life and nothing else to give them purpose. 		So yes. If you get banned for a sub for yelling that you hate niggers then no fucking shit, and I'm not saying the website should just be run on an anarchy system, its too big for it and frankly some people get their feelings hurt by stuff they read. Fair enough. But banning content from a sub like /r/WorldNews because it supports Syria and the mods don't or having content removed from /r/Politics because it opposes Bernie Sanders with some shitty "Irrelevant and speculative content" or something explanation is blood boilingly stupid. 		Mods *are not* the owners of a subreddit. No one is paying them, and to say they "made anything there" comes down to if they set up some decorations. They're the janitors. They should clean up the shit that some users left behind and stick to that. It does no one any good to say "No sorry thats just how reddit is if you don't like it move to another site" because *no one benefits from it*. People in the "cool" side of every sub only hear pats on the back and praise because wow surprise everyone here likes the same Presidential Candidate and hes all over the sub for some reason, what a coincidence! And those who say, don't, are banned, their opinions removed with somewhat humiliating messages telling them theres nothing they can do about it. And they just have to watch it all happen.		And that doesn't even begin to get into mods who are just lazy and incompetent. ELI5 has a shitty robot do 80% of their work. And it sucks ass, let me tell you. You can try and ask questions and it will straight get removed because you used the word "My". **I'm not kidding**. So this would be okay. Yunno?

You know what happens when I send a very polite message over explaining the situation?		"When the bot bans something, it should be banned."		"YOU HAVE BEEN MUTED FROM CONTACTING THE ELI5 MODS FOR 72 HOURS."		So theres literally no reason to keep over and take it in the ass. ELI5 used to be, pretty alright imo. And now its bad, and more and more subs are just becoming that same thing *and people notice*. You didn't get subs like /r/SubredditCancer 2,3 years ago. But now that reddit is larger you get mods who think they're kings and queens instead of volunteer janitors. Unfortunately the latter got more respect.		So thats my rant. Take it for what you will.

Most of all, Reddit has failed to deliver on the most important criteria for a technology platform, which are stability, uniformity, and predictability of policy and enforcement.

{"body":"Here's the problem.		Just because they're a mod does not mean *they own that community.* There are tons of communities on Reddit that predate the mod being added (and then adding all of his or her like-minded shitty friends so they can control everything with an iron fist).		So either the original mods never go AWOL and have to constantly keep their mods in check or everything spirals out of control. It happens over and over and usually ends with another alt-sub becoming the next Rome that will end in fire the same way in a few years. You can't say you haven't seen that happen.		I've said it before (to ZERO reply--including directly e-mailing you) and I'll say it again: The solution to bad mods is to make all mod powers pseudo powers. Mods can delete anything they want, but all actions are logged and publically viewable, and any user can simply "view this page without mod changes."		So now NOBODY can drum up false support of "they're censoring me!" which they use to create a rift in the community. And nobody can run around deleting good, sourced, comments because they disagree. If a mod community has clearly separate ideals than the community they manage, it will become very obvious.		Hiding from the rift between mods and community doesn't *fix* it. It only covers it up and creates further dissent. The entire Pao thing was a rift that was allowed to flourish because of this long-standing Reddit policy of "if we just ignore it, it'll go away." You can't solve two opposing sides by pretending they're not different. You only solve it with honest discussion and understanding which can only happen when both sides believe the other is playing fairly. When mods can delete anything they don't like, the rift continues because people *have to wonder* whether they're getting all the facts. When there is actual transparency, *there is no doubt.*		When someone thinks "mods are censoring!" in a thread, then clicks "show all unflitered content" and only sees a bunch of racist posts, it immediately improves their perceptions of the mods. But not allowing them to see this means good mods never get vindicated and are tainted by all the bad mods abusing the shadows... shadows that your system creates.","depth":2,"score":233,"ups":233,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Katastic_Voyage","name":"t1_czfilgc","parent_id":"t1_czfevu2","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454040759,"created_utc":1454011959}

But the thing is, mods are by and large good people who simply want to keep their subreddits "clean" (by whatever standard).			My solution would be to have two types of removals: a "hard" delete and a "soft" delete. The "hard" delete would be used only on content that infringes reddit's Content Policy, and only admins or users appointed by admins would have the power to "hard" delete (but users would also have the ability to "hard" delete any of their own posts).			The "soft" delete would function as the "remove" function does now. However, there would be the option to "show me everything" in the settings. Enabling this option would allow users to see everything a mod sees (removed comments/threads would be highlighted in red just like how mods see it) minus anything that has been "hard" deleted. Users who enable this function would also be warned that this might subject them to content that might be offensive in nature.			Mods understandably want to keep their subreddits "clean", and some users appreciate their efforts in quality control.

Not only is your "solution" an avoidance of fixing the root of the problem, it's just going to cause more clutter and make communities on reddit that much more separated.

What I'm trying to express is subtle, and I'm obviously failing miserably in communicating it to you. 		I'm essentially saying that the amount of emphasis people on SRS put on the karma system to discern the type of people on Reddit (and hence, why it deserves to be brigaded and some of its users harassed) is foolish. 		For example, if they want to prove that Reddit is full of racists, they might point to the upvoting of an article concerning Sweden's decision to "expel" 60,000 migrants next year. While no doubt some racists upvoted the title, if they actually took the time to read the article and discover that the real figure will come nowhere near that, they likely wouldn't have upvoted it at all due to the disappointment. The people who did read it and are presumably not racists, would have upvoted it just because it's a story of interest for Europe. 		Do you see what I'm trying to get at? It's that there are multiple reasons why something gets upvoted or buried (few of which are great indicators of the users' character) that makes the SRS community pointless in basing their supposed dislike of the site on the karma system, even as a joke/troll.		&nbsp;			The rest of your comment was just you indulging yourself in abuse based off of your inaccurate interpretation of what I was trying to say.

After a certain amount of time on here, you sort of get tired of seeing the same content show up over and over, and it just becomes less interesting.  What becomes more interesting, however, are the redditors themselves.		Enjoying the content on SRS is much like one would enjoy a horror movie.  But like slow burn horror.  It's disturbing and fascinating to see the horrible opinions of otherwise normal people and sometimes hilarious to read the lengths these people will go to in order to avoid confronting their own bigotries.  SRS doesn't have an end goal for reddit, as none of us have any illusions of "saving" reddit.  Reddit can't be saved.  The "reddit must be destroyed" attitude is only half serious, because while I would be a little sad to see an exceedingly few amount of subreddits disappear, I wouldn't miss it all that much, and I'd never recommend the site to anyone.","depth":5,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"a_faget","name":"t1_czfrp5u","parent_id":"t1_czfq1l9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454053914,"created_utc":1454025114}

I'm not going to name the subreddits, but a quick google of 'why was I banned' or 'banned from 'subreddit' will reveal them, and I suspect you know already. 		I've said this before in other subs: Reddit is not Tumblr (or any other blog site).		To wit: Subreddits are not blogs. A Blog is 'owned' (at least operated) by a single user or handful of users to broadcast their content to an audience at large. 		It's a radio station, set to broadcast, and occasionally take callers from listeners out there in the comments section.		A Subreddit is a container for speech. It is not, and should not be treated as, a broadcast platform for the personal views of the moderator(s) in charge. 		It's *entire purpose* is to 'take callers', and the callers largely talk to each other about the subject(s) at hand. The moderator suggests a subject, and then, aside from enforcing basic rules, *gets the hell out of the way*.		Put yet another way:		If I run a Subreddit dedicated to, let's say "Transformers" and you come in and constantly harass posters and carry on about how *stupid* Transformers is and how utterly worthless everyone posting in the Transformers Sub is, maybe, after multiple warnings, I should ban or silence your username. You were actively disrupting the conversation.		What's *actually* happening, is something far more sinister. You visit the Transformers subreddit and find yourself unable to post or even reply. That's odd, you've never even been here before (or you have but respected the rules), so what gives? 		Turns out myself or a bot I made saw that you posted something and/or commented on a Subreddit dedicated to Go-Bots, and I banned you, not for being a disruptive user, but because *I personally think Go-Bots are stupid and obviously I don't want YOUR KIND here, Go-Bot filth!*		In scenario B, which is what's actually happening here on Reddit, the Mod should be corrected, and if needed, removed -- and the subreddit's users prompted to vote on a a replacement Mod(s), because I was silencing your potential speech due to something you said elsewhere that's plainly none of my business.

However, I understand it was put on the back-burner to deal with the more imminent issues facing reddit admin (Blackout 2015 never5get).  	  	Will this come back into the pipeline at some point this year? I honestly believe that presenting a new user with even just a *brief* overview of basic reddit standards, rules, and etiquette would make a world of difference for everyone who uses the site on a daily (hourly, minutely?) basis.","depth":0,"score":15,"ups":15,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"K_Lobstah","name":"t1_czfdjn9","parent_id":"t3_434h6c","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454033839,"created_utc":1454005039}
{"body":"> Will this come back into the pipeline at some point this year?		Very likely. As you said, we put it on the back burner because we had more acute pains to deal with. One of our big company goals this year is to increase engagement, and a great way of doing this is to convert our casual users into redditors, which requires education.		At this very moment, however, we're working on a few other things. Mobile is getting a lot of attention. That's where the users are going, whether we are prepared or not. The A/B testing system is critically important as well. This allows us to see if changes (e.g. to onboarding) are actually having the intended effect.","depth":1,"score":-17,"ups":-17,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spez","name":"t1_czffy78","parent_id":"t1_czfdjn9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454037119,"created_utc":1454008319}

{"body":"> People don't just get fired for no reason, 		Yes they do. 		>and when they do, they sue.		No they dont.		Reddit (or any company) can fire for any reason or no reason at all. The only thing they can't do is legally fire for a handful of protected reasons (Americans with Disabilities Act, Civil Rights Act, etc.). 		Although, any company can fire for ADA/Civil Rights reasons if they really wanted to be dicks. The burden of proof falls to the person who was fired, which is very difficult and expensive to do. If someone wants to fire you because you are gay/a woman/black/whatever, they'll typically start gathering evidence to fire you for a different reason, like showing up late or something completely subjective like "poor work performance."		Now as for Victoria. Who knows why she was fired but I don't believe she was in the wrong given how competent she was with AMAs and the public. Why didn't she leave angry? Because shitting on your previous employer is a no-no if you want to keep working in the same field/industry. Also, given how quick the community jumped to defend her and the positive publicity surrounding her, she basically had her pick at what tech company to work for next. It wouldn't surprise me to hear the big social media players (Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Twitter) actively tried to recruit her after she was let go from Reddit.","depth":4,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_czgmoic","parent_id":"t1_czff2kn","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1454119520,"created_utc":1454090720}

{"body":"So is the Guardian depending on the topic of the story. Almost all western media has a left and a right leaning. It doesn't change the fact that one or more mods specifically sent any story by the website to be deleted by their autobot even when it's posted in comments in Europe, and it's only after they did a story about the mods in worldnews deleting almost one hundred posts and comments about the girl being raped by a migrant. One can only make the conclusion since the story has been posted elsewhere that a mod or more didn't like the negative spotlight of another story about violence (this time a murder) by a migrant after things seemed to have calmed down in the past week. Personal bias and personal agendas shouldn't exist with mods in subs that contain mostly news postings, unless it's a speciality sub. For example a right or left leaning news sub that caters to a political agenda and it's known for that. This isn't a right or left issue even though every comment to me about my post wants to make it that way. It's an issue everyone should agree on. All need subs that aren't clearly described as having a leaning should be neutral in their policing and not hinder news stories when posted. The only reason breitbart was targeted his week was their negative news story about a Reddit sub, worldnews and their censorship that went on about the murder of the aid worker by a migrant. And again it wasn't just deleting a post, it was tons of comments or any mention of it too. And it's not the first time some mod there deleted a hundred or more comments about a news story involving migrants. And it's not speculation.

Prior to that issue I had written a letter it me being given a seven day ban many months ago. Because I posted a link from a website. The link was from CNN, and the story was NOT opinion. It was about refugees entering Europe and Germany. All posts about the topic had been deleted going back 15 hours. Someone may have felt that people were getting heated up as the topic was causing a lot of debates within many subs during this past summer. So worldnews began deleting posts one night on every post involving refugees. I was banned just for making a post. The mod who replied to my question when I asked why I was banned, told me that it was for posting an opinion piece so I was banned for seven days. I replied back saying its a genuine news website, CNN, and the article was from a corespondent and was NOT opinion. The mod did not reply back. That was many months ago and I am still banned even though it was supposed to last only seven days. This type of behaviour is why people create several accounts and using VPN an proxies. Reddit doesn't mind because then people create more accounts than they need but it boosts their numbers of user accounts and helps them provide larger stats for their advertisers. But they allow mods who have personal shamed a and bias to run subs. I'm was banned for posting no a story some mod didn't like in the middle of the night after that had deleted all stories involving refugees going back 15 hours. And that is what happens.

{"body":"> My experience with Reddit improved when I unsubscribed from /r/worldnews and /r/videos,		I totally agree, but seriously, it's a shame. It would be really nice to have sub where you actually get an overview of what happened in the world today and where people have a insightful discussion about the topics. That's why I am in favor of less freedom and more rules. Subs like askhistorians are some of the best and they should enforce top level comment rules in subs like worldnews. What's the point of having comments like "the US is behind ISIS"? Just make a rule that top comments need to add value to the conversation and have source for claims. 		> Maybe it's just because the subs are so big		I agree and again, I think it's because they are badly managed. All those sub value quantity over quality.		> so I found a lot of smaller subs that were much better. 		To be fair in this announcement here they said that they want to increase diversity so I guess this is good news. But I think it's a fundamental issue of reddit that the platform favors big channels. E.g. lets say something big happens in Denmark, so the ideal system would be that someone could post this news to several subs at the same time but users would only see it once. Because currently the issue is that if you are only subscribed to Denmark but something happens in Denmark that is world news then it will end up getting posted in worldnews and not the sub for Denmark as worldnews gives you far more upvotes.

{"body":"Since you say that Reddit would not exist without us the community I have a simple question, more of a request for a site wide rule than anything. 		I don't know if you know this but there's a little subreddit known as /r/undelete. It's a subreddit made with the express purpose of reposting deleted posts from other subreddits. It used to be just the stray post with barely a hundred upvotes and completely off topic. Nowadays it's more common to see posts from the front page on there than ever. 		What I want to know is, whether you think a simple site wide rule being implemented to determine whether a post can be deleted should be put in place? A lot of these posts are reaching 2000-3000 upvotes and are at the top of their subreddits before being deleted. That doesn't sound right to me.		Reddit is a community driven system and if posts are being removed for mostly arbitrary reasons(I concede that some break rules but even then would argue against deletion) it feels as though we as users are losing control of our communities. 		The mods need to be able to police a subreddit but when the mods are clearly going against the wishes of the community it stands to reason that their power to police needs to be limited if not revoked.  		Just a simple thought that I feel most on the undelete subreddit would agree with. If you don't answer I understand but I feel this is Reddit's biggest problem at the moment. The site is being led not by its users but by its moderators and that's not what Reddit and communities like it have ever been about. 		Edit: The fact that this post has gone up and down as much as it has is frightening. I'm not asking for something absurd. I'm asking for the users of a subreddit to decide what should be on their subreddit. The mods should have one simple role and that's to ensure nothing illegal is posted. 		Hell I had a recent comment on /r/games be deleted because I used the word Totalbiscuit.

Sarah would also do well to remember that these "hacked chatlogs", as she has [claimed they were earlier](http://archive.is/fPJa0), were [automatically posted on the front page of her website](https://archive.is/e1eB3#selection-259.0-259.15) - and she would know, as [she later disabled the script](https://archive.is/K5wfB) which posted them.","depth":1,"score":30,"ups":30,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"banned_main_","name":"t1_czsw912","parent_id":"t1_czfnx3k","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1455008492,"created_utc":1454979692}

I fully understand and agree with the notion that each community should have its own rules and the people running it should be able to do what they want.

Personally, I don't think mods should be able to ban people from their subreddits because of that user's activity in other subs. My political leaning shouldn't be cause for someone to ban me from a support subreddit, for example. Mods shouldn't be able to use bots to auto-ban users that fall into certain categories (ala /r/OffMyChest, etc). And mods shouldn't be using AutoMod to silence people (auto-remove every post they make). Bans should be ban.

I'm a reddit gold member (hold your applause till the end, thank you) and the main reason why is so that I can use the filtering features whilst browsing /r/all.  I'm not a sportsball fan, so when something happens and people get excited and a sports post floats to the top I can see it and then add -hockey or -steelers to my URL.  I was too old for Pokemon, so there's -pokemon.  When I'm at work I'd rather not be tempted by NSFW subreddits.  Tangent: despite it being far from the first or last on my filter list, my titlebar still says, "all subscriptions except /r/TittyDrop".		Conversely, there are subreddits which I do like, but haven't subscribed to.  I'm not a lady, but I do like the humor in /r/TwoXChromosomes and I'm not gay, but if there's some news in /r/GayBros I might stop by to read and share.		By doing my non-specific redditing in /r/all I have the opportunity to find content from the community as a whole and when I want to pare down the results I can visit individual subreddits or use my multi-reddit tabs.

You're basically saying "find me a unicorn. Can't?  See I'm right".  Why is it a requirement that rules for discussion be written out in black and white?  Why would reddit seek to make that a requirement when it's completely impossible?  Why is that a goal?  It's impossible in any context to do that.		The idea solution is let "the market" decide.  Let people go where they think the mods are doing a good job, and leave when they aren't.  That's what happens now.  Them deciding that demanding every single rule be laid out in excruciating detail by volunteer mods is stupid isn't "putting their fingers in their ears", it's them being realistic about how people interact, and the fact that you'll never have **any** mods if you require that, and from every single example ever on reddit, little moderation leads to garbage.		And let's say you find among 10k removed comments that they more frequently remove comments that seem to agree with viewpoint X compared with viewpoint Y.

{"body":"Reddit is turning into a community of users and Power Users, with moderators gaining more and more power to not only dictate what content can appear in their subreddit (as they've always been able to do), but now to be able to completely control the tone of conversation, to artificially move their comments to the top of threads, silently shadowban users on their sub through automoderator, and to manipulate the overall reddit experience for users in whatever way they see fit. It was this functionality that killed Digg, and yet Reddit is proceeding down the exact same path yet is blind to realize it. Moderators are supposed to *moderate* the conversation—that is, clean up crap—not have their opinion count more than others. 		Meanwhile, the new changes reddit has been pushing out in the past 6 months have been terrible. The rules/report stuff is an unmitigated disaster from a UX standpoint, the designs for mobile headers look like they were done by a high school design student, and reddit *still* has the bug where you click a link from google on mobile and it takes you straight to m.reddit.com rather than the deep link you were trying to get to (despite it being posted multiple times that this bug is fixed). There is an awful disparity between the desktop and (native) mobile experience, that will be made even greater with the upcoming mobile app, and is worse still with all the third party mobile apps, which are all partial feature sets of the core reddit experience. 		I was much happier under Ellen Pao. Outside of the controversies, admins were rolling out great, well implemented tools for a good 1.5 years, which mostly flew under the radar, but were important fixes. Now it feels like reddit has succumbed to the whiners and nut jobs, and has abandoned all of its good developers (or maybe they just quit) and taken on a bunch of interns to push out critical site features.

{"body":">Hi All,		>Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.		>2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).		>Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.		>Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.		>I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.		>We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.		>This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.		>As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.		>–Steve		>edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring.

{"body":"In reading through the comments, I note that this post appears to be lip service to controlling mods that act improperly and to prevent shadowbanning. 			 I think that /r/science needs to be evaluated closely for continuing the almost total banning of people who post in /r/climateskeptics. They take the attitude that any position that disputes the effect of global warming by CO2 is a false position. Even after 18 years of a flat temperature curve by satellite measurements while CO2 has continued to increase. This despite the fact that climate model runs are not empirical science and  **correlation != causation**.  Yet that phrase is banned at /r/science even though it is part and parcel of		 **ANY SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENT**.  		Unless a result can be tied to a cause through experimentation it is not correct to make the statement that X causes Y.	Yet in the field of "Climate Science" this leap of faith is considered an integral part of the theory of anthropogenic warming. No proof of connection, just an assumption that it must be correct. 	 I would point out that seven - ten years ago The belief that changes in the PDO, AMO, and variations in TSI was that they had no effect on climate. They were pooh poohed and CO2 was mainly the only thing considered. 		This has recently changed and the confluence of negative going PDO, AMO, and the lowering of the output of the Sun is now being considered as a reason for minimal change in climate over the past 18 years. Scientific progress has an interesting habit of proving Lysenkoism wrong. And make no mistake about it, those who push a scientific theory for political reasons and stifle dissent are practicing Lysenkoism. Nowhere is it more on display than at /r/science		 It is interesting that recently a mod from /r/science contacted a number of people at /r/climateskeptics offering to look into whether they were banned and to do what he could. When the discussion turned to the merits of the argument and he saw that the argument still existed, and that the people banned were not contrite and subservient, he no longer interacts with those people. 		The other thing I would point out is that quite a number of people affiliated with the website skeptical science post in /r/science on climate related matters. This website is run by cartoonist John Cook and Dr. Stephen Lewandowsky (Cook's Mentor) who recently had a paper retracted from "Frontiers in Psychiatry". For fraudulently concocting a study and writing a paper about it. John Cook was a key actor in this study that lied about climate skeptics believing the moon landings were a hoax.  YET the influence of his supporters was so great that he was asked to do an AMA for reddit last year. 		??????? You ask Frauds to do AMAs??????		The John Cook sycophants who interact in /r/science have been given free reign to act like Donald Sutherland in Invasion of the Body snatchers. Pointing their fingers and waggling their tongues and effectively screaming heretic when their positions are not supported. 		The net effect of this behavior is to have caused papers that dispute  AGW from appearing in /r/science. The AGW saga is being managed in /r/science by Cook's supporters. 	 I would simply ask that /r/science no longer be a default subreddit because it manipulates science for political purposes.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"butch123","name":"t1_d00wmbt","parent_id":"t3_434h6c","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1455590226,"created_utc":1455561426}
