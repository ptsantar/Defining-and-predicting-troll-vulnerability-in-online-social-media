{"body":"On the topic of PM harassment, how would you feel about a button that either party could press to allow a PM to be read by Reddit admins? It would open just that PM thread, and only to admins, along with a note about why it was forwarded. Sorry if something like that is already available. I just figure it's better than taking images that can be altered and it allows admins to follow along if the harassment continues from one user.","depth":0,"score":3748,"ups":3748,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Aaron215","name":"t1_ctk96h7","parent_id":"t3_3f10up","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438207792,"created_utc":1438178992}

But it also seems like it might start creating headaches for mods and admins when someone who doesn't know they've been zapped can't understand what's happening in conversations and reports it as a mystery. If they just don't get any bites on their attacks on the other hand, because the person can't see the attacks, that doesn't lead to confusion or support scenarios.

To use it to squelch and control actual user's political speech is, in my eyes, a detestable practice though. This happens all the time here on reddit. That is admin territory though. Much more common are subreddit banns.		See, it use to be the admins tried to put up a front of professional aloofness, just letting their pet powermods do the dirty work (as they still do). Lately even that curtain has dropped, and the admins are doing the shit work themselves, in plain view. Straight up banning select subs while letting others go on, even though they are guilty of exactly the same. /r/ShitRedditSays is one major hub of superMods that control dosens, if not hundereds of other subs, many of them defaults. The admins are completely ignoring, even condoning the cancerous behavior of this minorty of super powerful mods, and the blatant censorship of reddit for their own political and monetary gain.		Look up any of the "undelete" type subreddits. There are examples galore of the monitization and blatant censorship that really goes on here. It has been heading in this direction for years, and lately is really picking up speed.		Oh, I fully agree with you. We desperately need full transparency for sub banns. Legitimate anti-spam shadow banning needs to be secret, or it defeats the purpose, but it needs to be bedrock solid policy to NEVER use that for political or profit purposes against common users, simply because of a difference of opinion.	The same should go for mods banning people because of thier own petty beliefs. Freedom of speach is what this forum was designed on, and to try to control the "direction" of that is not only deserving of ridicule, but it is insanely misguided.

{"body":"Cute.  While yes, shadowbans require an admin to carry them out, when admins just rubber stamp every request, that is no different than the mods having the power directly.		So there are two scenarios.  An admin gets the requests and just shadowbans any account without investigating at all(this means the mod can lie to get the ban approved), or they have a bot that just implements any shadowban request by a mod to a certain mailbox without any human intervention at all.		Take your pick. Both result in mods having the direct ability to shadowban for any reason.		I got shadowbanned by a mod because I told him to stop censoring my posts.  He told me he never censored any post.  I gave him proof by logging out and taking a screen.  Not 5 minutes later, I was shadowbanned from all of reddit.  Which was crazy, it wasn't even a subreddit ban.  He purposely wanted it to seem like I could still post in the subreddit and an admin apparently approved it.		How the hell does that happen if admins aren't just approving every request blindly?  If an admin read the conversation, it was clear the mod lied about ghosting the comments.		The mod could have simply said, "Yes I hid the comments and I will hide any comments I don't like, I am the mod you are not."  Instead he said, "I did not censor any of your comments and all of them are still visible."		Due tell, how does a mod not have the power to shadowban if he can get someone who simply proved he lied shadowbanned in under 5 minutes?  That isn't even a rule violation in the subreddit or sitewide.

Most of them come from "verlan" (à l'anvers = upside down/reversed) which is a 90's heritage when people would reverse words. 		Exemple: "Meuf" is used to say "girl" or "woman", it comes from femme, reversed to "mefe" slightly adjusted to facilitate the prononciation.	Or "chelou" meaning "weird", the correct word is "louche".

In my office, our CS team has a concept of Public and Private comments on issues. All comments on all issues are considered private and not exposed to the clients. 		When a comment is deemed of value (or, at least, far enough along that it's not something we're afraid of showing), the comment is marked Public.

I recognize that this is not good business. If you show people how the sausage is made, it opens you up to a whole assortment of disasters. 		However, if you could come up with a system wherein certain comments are marked as interesting and valuable, and then have an automated process for posting these to a dedicated sub, you could demonstrate to the userbase the stuff you're working on without having to create a post and then stick around to answer comments (lest you are accused of hit-and-run). 		Granted, this would require some trust on your part. No amount of 'safe harbor' statements will prevent some people from holding you to the letter of a statement. 		And you really couldn't remove posts from this system without suffering accusations of trying to hide things. 		You'd also have to train the devs and cms to correctly identify comments worth sharing. The comments would have to exist a-contextually (since we don't have access to your issue tracking system), and would have to be careful not to reveal privileged information. 		If the system required a vetting process that was too complex or time consuming, then that is all you would do and it wouldn't be worth it. It has to be almost totally automated. 		If you could resolve these complications, I think it would be a great way to share with the community. It could even serve as a crowd sourcing platform for trying to come up with ideas to solve specific complications. 		It might be more work than it's worth. I'll just say as a user and a professional dev, I prefer too much communication to too little.","depth":2,"score":70,"ups":70,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"antiproton","name":"t1_ctkb3qe","parent_id":"t1_ctk9k2w","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438210741,"created_utc":1438181941}

{"body":"I'm a developer, and I love it when I get “User Stories”. So, I'm going to assume everyone is like me and give you a User Story:		---		George is a young professional and enjoys redditting during breaks (or at least, that's what he'll admit to the boss). He has a dozen or so subreddits that he follows, including /r/bestof, /r/ShitRedditSays , and /r/TumblrInAction.		One morning, a cross-reddit link is posted in the latter forum lampooning some exceptionally naïve SJWing elsewhere on reddit. (Sure, the link probably violates TIAs rules, but it was early and the mods weren't fully caffinated yet and missed it.) George laughs at the obvious troll and reflexively downvotes. He then heads to /r/bestof to see what's new there.		About an hour later (maybe less), George gets a PM. “Odd,” George thinks, “I don't usually get PMs.” He opens it to read this:		> George, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/TumblrInAction on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. This is your first warning, which will expire after a month of good behaviour.		“Oh, dear,” George thinks, “I didn't realize that was brigading. I'll make sure not to vote like that in the future.”		Three weeks later, George upvotes a thread linked from /r/bestof. It was early and, this time, it was he that hadn't had his coffee. He gets another message:		> George, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/bestof on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. This is your second warning, which will expire after a month of good behaviour. Unfortunately, because of your repeated brigading, you may no longer vote on content until you have fewer than two warnings active. Please read our <link>Reddit Warnings FAQ</link>.		George is normally a level-headed guy, but this time, he loses his cool. He creates a new account and heads over to that same link and downvotes it another time, just for good measure. He then receives the following PM:		> GeorgeAlt, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/bestof on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. Records show that you are an alternate account of George, which means you share the two warnings you already have. Both GeorgeAlt and George are now banned from reddit for the next month, at which time, both accounts will drop back to two warnings. Please be aware that creating additional accounts to circumvent this ban will result in permanent bans as well as possibly other administrative action. <more links to rules and faqs>		---		The key takeaway here is that George's punishments were proportional to his crimes, and, at first, aimed at educating him in correct behaviour. Also, his minor errors expire fairly quickly, but continued errors over time will build up. And the system automatically prevented him from getting himself in extra trouble without his working around it. (You can't brigade if you can't vote. Also note: if you can't vote, you are at an automatic disadvantage commenting, since your comment starts at 0 instead of 1.) Critically, all this happened without mod or admin intervention, which is the only way it can possibly work.

{"body":"> the entire point of shadowbanning, the entire reason that it's useful, is because users who purposely make alts to break rules don't know that they've been shadow'd.		False.  Shadowbanning wasn't ever meant to be used on USERS.  It was only ever originally intended to be used against BOTS.  Spam bots, to be specific.  And now they (the bots), like most any half-way savey user, can easily tell if they're shadowbanned or not (log out, go to your userpage... can you see  it?  No? Then you're shadowbanned) 		And so now:  shadowbans are mostly used against regular users, which was never the intention, and is incredibly cruel to those who aren't savvy enough to tell that they have been shadowbanned (even though its trivially easy) since they could potentially go on wastring their time using their account, not knowing that nobody can see what they're doing.   Thats fine if you're a bot, cruel if you're a human.   They are obsolete for so many reasons, and are just plain cruel to users who may or may not have done something that bad.		I had my account shaddowbanned once, because another account from the same IP (My girlfriend) upvoted a lot of my comments once...  Because she was supporting me in an argumet..  The system thought I was "vote manipulating" and shadowbanned me... I had no idea for days, wasted tons of time figuring out what was going on, and eventually had an Admin un-shadowban me and tell me "yea sorry.. this actually happens a lot with people who live together, and do things together on reddit, you didn't actually break any rules, it was just an unfortunate accident".  HAPPENS, ALL, THE TIME... its bullshit, and unless you know enough to check whether or not you are shadowbanned like me, you might just be fucked... because you'd never know you were banned, for all the wrong reasons too.

It's just banning a single account, and if you don't run afoul of the rules you can keep going on your new account.		You are ignoring what a shadowban is.  You get shadown banned when they set your account in the system as a spam account.  A shadowban is an anti-spam tool.  It was never meant for banning accounts based on opinions.		What else comes with a shadownban?  Because your account is flagged as a spam account, it actually will shadownban any new account created on the same IP address also used by the shadownbanned account.  This is how it currently works.  Now it does seem to have some protections against larger shared IPs.  Such as if you are in a classroom at school and 30 other people are logged in, it won't shadownban people sharing that IP with the shadowbanned account.  But your home IP is burned. Because it has so few accounts using that IP, it is blacklisted by the spam filter.  So any new accounts or existing accounts using your home IP are automatically shadowbanned.  This means roommates, spouses, children, etc.  A friend from out of town visits and uses your connection, he is shadowbanned.		Now if you have an ISP that lets you reset the IP by resetting the modem, you can do that and the next customer that gets the IP will get their accounts shadowbanned if they use reddit because now they have the flagged IP.		tl;dr  	A shadowban only happens when they set your account as a SPAM account in their anti-spam system.  It means your IP address is also flagged and any accounts sharing your IP will also be shadowbanned.  New and existing accounts.  If you have been shadowbanned, that means they want you banned from reddit forever.

{"body":""See an asshole in the morning, you've seen an asshole. See assholes all day, you're the asshole."		That's the usual quoted context of the idea I was referring to, which is neither disclaiming responsibility, nor is it an immature idea. Quite the opposite, really. It suggests that each of us look not only at others behavior, but also at our own perception of those behaviors. If you're constantly seeing other people as having a problem, perhaps it's your perception that is the problem. He/She has "**never** observed one who had emotionally matured past the age of 3" (emphasis added). Should we draw the conclusion that **nobody** has matured past the age of 3? No, that's obviously not true. Apparently, there is some context, most likely a biased one, that has shaped their perception to draw an inaccurate conclusion on this point. Confirmation bias, which we are all subject to, will reaffirm this position in their mind, and they will continue to perceive immaturity even where it doesn't actually exist.		I intentionally didn't disagree with the rest of their sentiment, because there will certainly be people who opt-in and then complain about the content that they agreed to see. Some will even do this intentionally, or even maliciously. And yeah, those people need to take responsibility for themselves and quit shitting on other people's right to free speech. What I disagreed with is the overall stereotyping view towards the mentality and maturity of those types of people, and thus that is the point I replied to. When a comment is riddled with all encompassing pronouns that are not given any identifier (read the comment again, they never say exactly who they are referring to), it's a big red flag that this is a presumptive, biased, and stereotyping view of whatever disembodied group mentality they are standing against.		tl;dr - your comment is inaccurate.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NotNowImOnReddit","name":"t1_ctlw0m1","parent_id":"t1_ctlcjtz","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438312841,"created_utc":1438284041}

{"body":"There are a few different ways.		The most popular method is to pump an account's karma up to 10,000 or more, then sell it to one of the many sites that offer illicit upvotes or legitimate-looking usernames. Prices range between five and sixty dollars per account, so if someone can inflate a few dozen (or a few hundred) at once, they stand to make a decent profit for their time.		The second method of profiting is more direct, and I touched on it briefly before. A spammer offers a repost of a previously popular submission, waits for it to be successful, and then updates the Imgur album to include a link to an external site. Those sites are full of malware and click-through advertisements, the former of which can mine your personal information (for future sale), and the latter of which nets the spammer a few cents for every visitor.		 Fortunately, it sounds like the administrators are serious about cracking down on this kind of thing, and I'm hopeful that both practices will fade out before too much longer.

{"body":"A bunch of people have already responded with regards to the humanity of black people not being an "argument" to "win."  But here's another consideration.		Let's pretend there was an "argument," and your intention was to foster this argument with the good intentions of potentially converting virulent racists to not be racist anymore.		Where is this argument taking place?  Not on coontown, that's for sure.  A sub entirely dedicated to posting about how awful black people are is the lions den for any brave souls wishing to spread a bit of truth around.  Plus, it's privately maintained; they can "silence opposition" themselves.		Where it will take place is the rest of reddit, with comments calling black people theives when there is a picture of something that is black, or endless "dindu nuffin" quotes on endless posts about somebody black doing anything.  Hosting a subreddit for racism means *racists will create accounts*, and creating an account makes it more likely for someone to comment on the rest of Reddit.		So basically, if you're true intention is to host a debate about racism, you are then putting a burden on every single subreddit not specifically dedicated to that cause to still have to participate.  Cat pics, sports teams, video game communities; every single one will also have to be about racism.  Even if that participation is banning a bunch of users who may not have even bothered to come to Reddit had they not had a racism hub to join.		"You can't win an argument by silencing the opposition" only applies when there is an actual argument going on.

{"body":""sjw" is a meaningless buzzword used by immature children who have no desire to be taken seriously or to contribute to productive discourse. It's also the common "slur" used by racists/sexists/MRAs and so on. It basically refers to anyone who doesn't think like it's 1860. Whenever I see somebody use that term when complaining online I instantly see some petulant child struggling with not getting their own way.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Ryuudou","name":"t1_ctnhk7m","parent_id":"t1_ctkmgn5","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438420654,"created_utc":1438391854}

{"body":"In real life outright racists (like those from coontown) exist in the world. They're voices can be heard walking down the street.		The burden that is being placed on each subreddit is no different than a burden that already exists in everyday life.

For the most part, the virulent racists are too far gone, they're lost.  We can't get them back.  The problem is, when you drive their message underground, where nobody can address it and where they cut out any dissent, the non-virulent racists and even the undecided just get a reinforcement of shit piled on shit.  It's the reason why you can still go to small racially homogeneous towns in this country and find racism (not always, by any means).

{"body":"> If this site TRULY wants to advocate free speech		And this is exactly my point: I don't think they should, at least not to this degree. Free speech is a great thing to a point, but some of it is harmful. Even the first amendment, which is one of the strongest guarantees of free speech in the world, has exceptions. Governments and other monopolies like, say, the root DNS, should be held to the highest standard of free speech possible, because anything they do censor can have a powerful chilling effect, unfairly destroying entire areas of discourse. They need to tread very carefully when considering the lines between free speech, harassment, threats, hate speech, etc. because the damage that can be done is so great. 		Reddit is trying to meet that standard too, but they don't have to. It's a private website providing free discussion forums to anyone who wants to form a community, but it's just one site on the entire web. The code is even open source, so it's not even the only place where you can have a reddit-style community. The threat posed by tyrannical admins is minimal at best. Worst case scenario, everyone goes to voat or back to Digg or whatever. 		Of course, they can choose to hold themselves to a high standard anyway, for idealistic reasons, but I don't think that it's working out well for anyone. In some cases, there's interesting and good debate happening about controversial things. Social justice has been a big deal here in recent years, and I've learned a lot and expanded my mind as a result. There's perennial topics like abortion and circumcision and men's rights and feminism and affirmative action where passions run high but people are still capable of having a discussion about it, and even changing their minds once in a while. That stuff is all great, and I'm all in favor of keeping it around even if one side is offensive to the other side. Then there's things like coontown, or pics of dead kids, or raping women, or fat people hate, and many variations on those. These places aren't enabling a rational discourse. No one is experiencing new and interesting ideas as a result of these places. They're just gross and harmful. As evidenced by the fact that even reddit, with its singleminded pursuit of free speech above all else, is hiding these terrible places behind a wall so that people don't see them. If there's such a concern about giving them a space too, why hide it from everyone else? Why create second-class citizens? It solves nothing, because they lose their free speech cred but they also don't fix any of the criticism they're getting!		And giving these communities a free home online doesn't just have minimal benefit, it's also got serious drawbacks. These groups get a huge platform to spread their hatred, they get talked about because of all the controversy, and they drag down the reputation of the site as a whole. Stormfront has been around for ages, and they're just as terrible as coontown, so what's the difference? The difference is no one gives a shit about Stormfront because they're doing their own thing on their own site. The coontown people are doing it here, and people talk about them because it's scandalous to have such virulent racism on one of the top sites. They all already have accounts here. When they're looking at their shit, it's right there intermixed with mainstream content. They get to feel normal, because hey, they're just using reddit like anyone else, and they're seeing all the same stuff. It's so easy for them to feel comfortable writing racist shit whenever a black person is in a video because reddit lets them create a world that is more racist than the world actually is. And those comments spread and draw more racist comments in mainstream subreddits. Or someone debates them and mentions their posting history, and all the other racists or even just misguided people get links to where they can find more racism. And again, it's all on reddit, a mainstream site, so it's getting a boost of legitimacy. This is a choice that reddit makes, to enable the spread of racism, and it's fair to criticize them for it. 		That's all fine for reddit if that's the kind of site they want to run. You can choose to have a free site where anything goes, or you can have a site where people feel comfortable just mentioning that they're black or a woman. But you can't have both. Censorship will drive the people you're censoring away, but in this case, with those people left unchecked they have created a site with a reputation for shitty stuff, which also keeps people away. You can't satisfy everyone, so who should reddit satisfy? Personally, I pick the non-racists every time. We aren't giving them the Internet death penalty here, we're just making them live somewhere else. The ones we drive away will be replaced by much better and more interesting people with different viewpoints than the typical nerdy white males of reddit. That's a much better catalyst for free speech than the "opportunity" to hear the same racist garbage over and over. 		All the concerns at this point are hypothetical, and the benefits of banning them are real. Reddit as a site will not suffer if the racist networks alone get shut down. They are doing zero good and plenty of harm. It *might* suffer if they start shutting down other stuff, but they don't seem likely to go too far, if anything they won't go far enough, and when they do really make a mistake they'll hear plenty of backlash for it and be able to undo it.","depth":8,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaos750","name":"t1_ctlnlaa","parent_id":"t1_ctldc0l","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438301182,"created_utc":1438272382}

Typically the next post.  Often they don't get a response because they're either already downvoted or being deleted.  There are some exceptions, most of them jokes, and I'm not sure what the right answer is there.  We are capable of joking about death, differences, similarities, and so much more, so why aren't we allowed to make jokes about race?  It's when there's something behind the joke that we need to worry, and I think that we typically see those downvotes, though I'm sure there are exceptions.

Because Reddit is not some special place where suddenly the people of the world will act different in response to the same things that we do and fail elsewhere.

Banning people for speech that can be directly linked to real violent activity is clearly something that should be done.

{"body":"I typically try not to read TOO much into things, but I begin to wonder if there are some seriously fat people working for Reddit that prefer to kill discussion on their problems instead of, you know, *confronting them* and losing weight. Or ignoring FPH and related subs and keep eating yourself to death, it's a free country. You get to be fat, everyone else gets to dislike you  for it.		I take the sometimes unpopular stance that *shame is not always a bad thing*. 		Yeah, FPH was often just plain mean, but killing that sub seems to have set a dangerous precedent for Reddit. Don't like what people say? That's fine. But - particularly on the internet - trying to silence discussion is essentially taking a baseball bat to a gigantic beehive and angering ALL the bees because a few of them got annoying. 		As someone surrounded by paranoid conservatives, nothing - and I mean *nothing* will reinforce their delusional conspiracy theories in their heads than trying to shut them up. 		Let 'em talk. That's right, Obama's a fascist space alien from the planet Jihad. Yup, Ted Nugent is a genius. Fluoride is a mind control agent. Sure!  Keep it coming! Let 'em rant. And then point, laugh, and shame them. It pisses them off, but after a while, no one takes them seriously because *their own words* become shrill and hilarious. Their message got out. Their message was dumb, and often easily shredded to bits by a little research and verifiable *facts*. (God, they hate facts). Now the only people nodding along are the dittoheads. 		But if you were to somehow shut down /r/conservative - or wonder of wonders - take Fox "News" off the air - you've just made the problem FAR worse. Now they feel totally justified, they feel they're right, and everyone really *was* out to get them, and their message *must* be the truth because they're being silenced. 		And honestly, the Onion's job is hard enough. Don't starve them of material.		Put another way: I saw a video here of a Klan rally recently. The Klan was allowed to walk around with their stupid rebel flags and their goofy sheets and generally be rednecks. No one stopped their little parade, and no one should even try. ...Instead, a gentleman with a tuba stood just outside the parade and quietly played goofy, cartoony 'wump, dump, wumm wammp' sound effects, lending the entire proceeding a comic vibe and pointing out the absurdity of it all without trying to stop the Klan from marching or screaming louder than they were or escalating tensions. 		*It was brilliant*. We need that Tuba Guy mentality on Reddit. Make fun of the mean people when they get too stupid, ignore them unless they get violent or break too many rules. Or just hold up a mirror and let them feel uncomfortable seeing their own words repeated to them from outside the echo chamber.		Again - shame can be constructive.","depth":6,"score":63,"ups":63,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Tin_Whiskers","name":"t1_ctkczz9","parent_id":"t1_ctkae1k","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438213442,"created_utc":1438184642}

{"body":"I don't know if I'd say evil is 'necessary', so much as I take the view that it's an inevitable part of the human condition. It's part of us as human beings. It can be managed, but attempting to suppress it or deny it outlets tends to backfire. 		Besides, allowing people to speak their minds - no matter how abhorrent their speech can sometimes be - lets you know where people stand. In my neck of the woods, the whole Confederate flag thing is a *big* subject. I personally have long identified it as an emblem of a certain mindset, as a badge racists and hateful people tend to rally behind.		And now that it's come to the fore in our national conversation, some people are realizing it's long past time for that flag to go. They're looking into their hearts and changing. And others... have slathered their cars with rebel flag bumper stickers, stuck large flagpoles into their trucks for display, and taken to wearing shirts and hats with the flag on it. It's meant to be provocative, to anger others and simultaneously make the flag's defenders feel empowered as the world moves away from them. 		And that's good. It's showing everyone who the bigots and apologists are in their community. And it's letting those same people vent, after which we can slowly move on. If we were to ban the flag outright, and/or ban their outlets of expression (like subreddits here) it would just move those people underground, give them more of a sense of grievance and community, hide them from public view, and potentially turn them into a festering menace. 		Better to let them stomp around and be petulant, where everyone can watch them and they can feel better about themselves. Better to let them be mean and possibly hurt our feelings, and thereby allow us all to grow and be open about those emotions. 		We can take the horrors out of reddit, sure. We can ban FPH, we can delete garbage like "Coontown". And they'll pop up somewhere else, whack-a-mole style. And those people will get angrier and potentially more radicalized with each blow. 		I argue its better to just have our feelings hurt by mean people than to wonder what they're up to, and give ourselves a false sense of security and unity by futile attempts at making distasteful speech invisible.

They also scrambled to kill the massive legal vulnerability Cooper exposed, heh. *That* was *my* point. :P		> Furthermore, you can't be under the impression that overtly illegal forms of racism (everything from discriminatory hiring practices to hate crimes) are born in a vacuum, can you?		Of course not. But hosting a racist discussion still isn't illegal. I'm wasn't talking about what's morally correct; I was pointing out that there was another perfectly valid line of reasoning that would have led to them taking the same result.		>And like with JailBait, there is no possible good and infinite possible bad that can come out of them hosting a sub like CoonTown.		I can think of a couple potential benefits, actually:		* It provides a nice, centralized location for folks to keep track of what those people are up to, which can be handy for dealing with any illegal activity that does spawn from it. Consider how much more difficult that would be if those discussions were being held in a private, invite-only forum.		* Likewise, it provides a nice example we can hold up of what *not* to do - "These ideas are racist and bad. If you find yourself saying things that are also being said here, you may want to re-examine your ideas." It helps us form counter-arguments to refute the points they make. It lets us learn from the mistakes of others, whether or not they recognize those mistakes themselves.		* It gives the opportunity for these folks to better themselves together, without losing their community, if they so choose. Not especially likely, but possible.		But the single biggest benefit is that it upholds the societal value of free speech (which is what resulted in the enshrining of the legal protection of free speech in the Constitution). The general idea is that what the majority thinks is right and wrong is not always spot-on, so we should allow minority opinions to be expressed even if almost everyone disagrees with them.		Imagine if we were having this conversation fifty years ago, and the sub in question wasn't Coontown but instead /r/ainbow. Overwhelming majority would likely say that sort of thing was incredibly immoral and shouldn't be tolerated - but now society has changed its views and recognized that being LGBTQ isn't a deadly sin. (I could see something loosely similar happening with pedophilia in the next few decades - recognizing that the desires themselves maybe can't be fully suppressed, but they can be managed and minimized, and that some things which are currently banned may have a use in that. **Pure speculation; not saying I support pedophilia.**)		Sometimes the majority isn't right, and we need to allow for that, by not outright banning the expressing of certain views. This lets us be exposed to ideas we disagree with, which is all-around a very good thing (this is a cornerstone of a good college education, btw); it makes us rethink about *why* we believe what we do, reinforcing the beliefs we find to still be valid and changing the views that we don't find to be valid.		Then comes the argument about whether or not that should be happening *here*, on reddit. To me, that's something for the folks who run reddit - the admins - to decide. And it seems they've mostly decided that yeah, there should still be a place for that around here, though it maybe should look a little different. I'm absolutely not going to break out the pitchforks for them taking that stance.","depth":7,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"sorator","name":"t1_ctkfbag","parent_id":"t1_ctkelzc","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438216614,"created_utc":1438187814}

It's not like the sub wasn't controversial before then and he provided them with literally no information that they didn't have. It was a PR thing plain and simple.		I'm sure they were aware of it, but it wasn't a significant vulnerability. If they had left it up, not only would they have taken PR flak for it, they probably would have taken legal flak for it as well. I'm just saying that was also a reason for them taking it down, that PR wasn't the sole possible reason.		>Do you really think people are going to openly discuss illegal activity on coontown where they know they're being watched?

I also vaguely remember stories of a Brazilian drug cartel conducting operations on a small sub, and reddit left it open so the FBI could track it more easily - I could be confused on that, though; it's a vague memory. You *might* be overestimating some folks' intelligence.		>It's not like we don't have enough examples of racism already. There are reams and reams of shitty racist opinions that have been spewed.

The only community they have is being a bunch of racist assholes, which is not one worth having.		It's *possible*, but yeah, it's definitely a longshot. I think it'd be more likely that a few folks might be convinced by people coming in from elsewhere on reddit. We're not as echo-chamber-y since subs are part of a larger site. (the "quarantine" idea would exacerbate that, though I still think it's a great idea)		>People still have the freedom to run their own shitty racist websites and have their shitty racist clubs and be racist in their own homes.		Absolutely.		>What you're essentially saying is that nobody should ever be prevented from venting whatever opinions they have in whatever context.		Absolutely not. You're taking my views on reddit in particular and generalizing them to every context ever, and that's not accurate. reddit, specifically, was founded as a place where the idea of free speech would be a high priority, and I'm glad that the admins are finding ways to still uphold that while also making good business decisions. I absolutely wouldn't expect other organizations to take the same actions if they didn't have the same founding principles. Heck, I wasn't sure reddit would keep to those founding principles, and I wouldn't blame them if they 180'd on it; I'd be disappointed, but I wouldn't be *angry*, as long as they were fairly honest about it.		>This is not one of those times. The views of /r/coontown subscribers are definitely wrong.		I agree with you, but I disagree that it means they shouldn't be able to talk about it anyway or that no good can come of them doing so, and I disagree with the idea that this site should be anything other than what the folks running it want it to be, and if they want to provide a space for those folks to talk about those things, I won't yell at them for doing so.		>Should all biologists be forced to read the opinions of young-earth creationists and anti-evolutionists? Should doctors be made to learn about crystal healing and homeopathy because "hey man, it's good to be exposed to ideas you disagree with!"? 		Never said anyone should be forced to it - I'm saying folks should have the opportunity if they want it. There was a time when prevailing medical opinion was that acupuncture and chiropractic ^(why is it "chiropractic" and not "chiropracty"? ugh) were complete bunk, but that's changed, specifically because some folks who were interested sought out those they thought held invalid views and engaged them and found that there was some validity to those views after all. 		>No. Those arguments are over and to continue them only gives credence to disproven and outmoded ideas. 		I don't see how letting someone continue saying nonsense somehow gives that nonsense meaning.		>Most of society has moved on from the ideas expressed by /r/coontown[2] too. There is no longer anything to be gained from their discussion. 		I don't think what gets discussed in /r/coontown will lead to anything especially productive, but I'm willing to leave the door open for it to happen in spite of my low expectations. Especially since they *will* have those discussions elsewhere if they don't have them on reddit, so not allowing them to have them here doesn't really accomplish anything.

The proper response to speech you disagree with is *more speech* - you can talk louder than them; you can engage with them to try and show them how they're wrong and you're right; you can make an example of them and show *others* how they're wrong and you're right; etc. Silencing their speech is the wrong approach.		Someone talking about how they hate gays does not in any way prevent someone else talking about how they love gays or how they are gay. Just think of the logistics - think of literal speech. You talking doesn't prevent me from also talking at the same time. (Doing so means we probably won't be *listening* to each other, but the idea is a right to *speak* not a right to be *heard*.) And allowing someone to say something does not in any way validate or endorse or approve of what they say - this is, for example, why politicians are supposed to explicitly endorse the messages they put out while campaigning, because simply allowing it to happen is not the same as endorsing it. (Whether or not they actually do that as they should is a whole other issue.)		Would you rather they congregate in a true echo-chamber, a closed forum where no one is allowed to speak except to agree with what they say? Wouldn't that be *more* validating than having the occasional open discussion where people call them out for being bigoted sociopaths and expressing why, exactly, that is a bad thing?		The proper solution here is *more* speech, not less.

You jump from, in your own words, "subs that's easy to determine" to subs that aren't (or in some cases, made up to be). In a sense, it's comparing the maliciousness of Fat People Hate, borderline paedophilia of Jailbait and ardent hate speech of CT with the passive aggressive angst of /r/Atheism. Or, moreso, suggest that Christians would just want /r/Atheism banned simply for being atheist - not for being hate-filled, or harassing Reddit users outside their subs. *That is a slippery slope,* because none of these cases are even remotely comparable (or slightly realistic and reasonable.)		> I could see the pro-christians pushing to ban anything atheistic		You can? Is there an actual large voice on reddit that's looking to ban r/Atheism and just *waiting* on the opportunity on the basis that they're Christian? I mean, there are people who want r/Atheism gone because it's seen as whiny, but that's a different conversation.		> SRS wanting to ban who knows what.		I'm going to guess they'd like CT banned for the same reasons other people pointed out in this thread: Reddit seems hypocritical at this point. That's all it comes down to.		The line is clear. It's been drawn in the sand in the past, and their past actions have made it abundantly clear of what Reddit *says* it doesn't tolerate. But it was merely bullshit. The argument isn't whether or not there's a "slippery slope," because banning hate subs like FPH aren't going to lead to bans of subs *that aren't hateful* like /r/Atheism. Or even pointless subs like RedPill and KotakuInAction. The argument is whether or not Reddit intends on sticking to its own word or if it's deciding to be hypocritical.

She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association.

Stop concerning yourself about it.		>Racism continues to exist because not enough has been done to educate people about why such ideas are inherently wrong and inhuman.		You can't educate people through *suppression of ideas and opinions*. That's not education. That's just tyranny.		You educate people through a public education system fundamentally based on scientific truth and critical thinking, and then you hope that this equips your society with the tools necessary to avoid falling prey to bigotry.		That's where the line is. Any further and you're just instituting a society where everyone is told *on gunpoint* what to think, what to believe and what to do. That's not okay.		>Enforcing a morality on an issue like this, how white supremacy is a complete and utter valueless idea and relic of the past, in no way means that reddit will have to enforce a morality on a topic outside of race.

It's got nothing to do with the particulars of morals that you're enforcing. It's got to do with the *mechanisms of enforcement*.		When you want to eliminate a subreddit like /r/CoonTown, you have to institute policy and technical mechanisms needed to actually execute that elimination. Those mechanisms can be misappropriated at a future date for the elimination of a subreddit that isn't regarded as so universally vile, and might possess a social function. That doesn't mean those two subs are thematically related. We're talking about a misuse of policy and technology here.		And look, I understand that you're coming from a good place on this. You're justifying the underlying policy and technological mechanisms via a morally commendable example. But you need to understand that the mechanisms themselves are unacceptable. I'm not trying to defend /r/CoonTown or white supremacy here. They're despicable places and ideas. There's no debate about that. But I am trying to tell you that the mechanisms used to get rid of them are fundamentally broken. They're corruptible.

Yes, there's a hypothetical slippery slope. I don't think that banning Coontown and friends means that the site is slipping down it though.

Those distasteful corners of the website are a litmus test for the freedom of Reddit's users.

{"body":"> By the time you start talking about which things to censor you've already lost what makes reddit great.		Well, then the battle is already lost because reddit has always censored tons of stuff. Things like doxxing, which aren't technically illegal unless they're harassment, are forbidden site-wide and have been for as long as I can remember. Jailbait is another example. That one, they censored due to bad media coverage basically. You're not even allowed to post links to other parts of reddit and say "Hey, everyone down vote this!" or anything like that. There's no law against brigading, that's entirely reddit's decision. 		>There are lots of distasteful things to be found on reddit and lots of wonderful things too. That's because right now reddit is a mirror that reflects humanity. The good and the bad. 		And that's a lovely idea, but I think there are two problems with that. One, most people don't come to the reddit "mirror" looking to see the worst that humanity has to offer. So gradually, the only people coming to reddit are those who either can tolerate the gross stuff, or those who are rolling around in it. Two, it helps to not just reflect, but *amplify* the worst in humanity by giving them a great place to congregate and organize. That's fine if reddit want to do that, it's their site, but I don't think it's a good idea. Plus, if you're looking for a mirror, the internet as a whole is a much better, fairer, more accurate mirror than reddit alone could ever be. 		>If people have a problem with something someone says on Reddit they are misguided if they try to blame Reddit for that person's opinions, and they are fooling themselves if they think that removing those ideas from reddit will make them go away.		I don't disagree. Censorship alone isn't going to get rid of ideas. They have a point, though: Reddit is voluntarily hosting this terrible stuff, and they don't have to. Is that making Reddit better? Is it making the internet better? Is it making the world better? I think it's fair to criticize them for their choice, because it is a choice, and I don't think "free speech" alone justifies it. 		>You are supporting the idea that people should be able to come together and discuss whatever they want freely.		They should be able to come together and discuss freely... but that doesn't mean that reddit has to give them free, prime real estate to do it. 		>Reddit has still managed to keep working toward the ideal that people should be able to talk about whatever they want.		That's a good ideal, and I agree with it, but it isn't reddit's responsibility to make that happen on their own. Every website censors content to some degree, reddit is no different. Is it really so bad if the racists have to start their own forum? Frankly, I think it's a win-win. The racists no longer have to fear a ban by the admins, because they are the admins, and the rest of us can choose whether or not we want to support their efforts, see their posts, etc. Free speech lives on stronger than ever, and if you look at both the new racist site and reddit.com, *more* ideas are being expressed, not less.		>"The worst of the worst" according to what? "Borderline cases" according to what? The "free exchange of ideas" limited to a subset of approved ideas is*n't* a free exchange of ideas at all.		Yeah, it isn't. I don't care if reddit, or any other site, restricts the speech they allow. Especially when the topics being banned are so reprehensible. As long as everyone is equally free to create their own site discussing whatever they want however they want, the free exchange of ideas is there, and my desire for freedom of speech is satisfied.","depth":7,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"chaos750","name":"t1_ctktvur","parent_id":"t1_ctkrd1i","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438236535,"created_utc":1438207735}

Things like doxxing, which aren't technically illegal unless they're harassment, are forbidden site-wide and have been for as long as I can remember. Jailbait is another example. 		Doxxing isn't illegal but it is a legal minefield and opens reddit to all kinds of liability. I understand why they take the stand they do against it. It's to protect them and their users. It also helps protect the free exchange of ideas because I can post openly without worrying as much that I'm going to tracked down and attacked in the real world for my statements here. A compromise certainly, but a reasonable one. 		Jailbait wasn't taken down because the idea behind it was declared unacceptable. It was taken down because it became a liability after it was found that people were using it to request illegal material (for the record, the illegal stuff was only sent over PM, nothing illegal was posted to the subreddit directly). The negative media attention was certainly a motivation as well and in that aspect reddit failed to live up to its ideals, but it has allowed the idea behind that subreddit to continue in its replacement which thrives to this day. Reddit isn't perfect, but it tries and as long it keeps trying I'll support it.  		Brigading is a complex subject currently under a lot of debate. Part of the reasoning behind the anti-brigading rule is that it hurts the free exchange of ideas especially for minority opinions when large groups of people can coordinate to bury what it doesn't agree with and "punish" users who dare to even discuss those things. Personally I hope that Reddit ultimately decides to go after those kinds of coordinated attacks while leaving subreddits that serve to direct people to cool or interesting posts and subreddits out of it. I have a "spreading ideas is good, attacking ideas is bad" sort of view on Brigading. We've yet to see what the rules end up like. 		> most people don't come to the reddit "mirror" looking to see the worst that humanity has to offer.		Most people will never see the worst either, not unless they actively look for it. No one is forcing new users into coontown to talk about things they don't want to. People *should* expect to be exposed to unpleasant things on the internet, just like in the real world. Reddit already gives people the ability to filter out the things they don't want to see and create their own experience. They are going a step farther and putting the more unpopular stuff behind another wall (opt in). This isn't really a problem. 		>  it helps to not just reflect, but amplify the worst in humanity by giving them a great place to congregate and organize.		Same with the good. It's not really an issue with reddit, it happens everywhere like-minded people gather. Providing a place for people to get together, organize and discuss things is a good thing. What results from that is up to the people involved. I don't think the internet makes a better mirror than reddit, because reddit *is* a part of the internet. Reddit is the internet mirror focused on a wide area. What you see is people doing people stuff.		> Reddit is voluntarily hosting this terrible stuff, and they don't have to. Is that making Reddit better? Is it making the internet better? Is it making the world better? 		I think it does. I really do. Reddit doesn't have to be a platform for the open exchange of ideas and the building of communities. It could be lots of other things. A curated list of approved topics, or a cat photo repository for example, but the internet is a better when it has a well maintained site for free discussion where ideas are shared and challenged. There are few places like that, fewer popular ones and even fewer that are run as well. reddit fills a gap very well. It's why we are all here. 		> They should be able to come together and discuss freely... but that doesn't mean that reddit has to give them free, prime real estate to do it....  it isn't reddit's responsibility to make that happen on their own. Every website censors content to some degree, reddit is no different. Is it really so bad if the racists have to start their own forum? ...  As long as everyone is equally free to create their own site discussing whatever they want however they want, the free exchange of ideas is there		So this is the "They can have freedom too, just not here" argument. It's not compelling. There are a lot of good reasons why Reddit should stay available to everyone. By not censoring ideas here they avoid having to even start down the path of what do we keep and what do we censor. It absolves them of all responsibility for the content on this site. Once they officially endorse certain ideas and ban others everything they allow on the site is a reflection on them personally, right now they are just providing the space and users are responsible for what they do with it.  		It also makes them popular. Everyone is here discussing what matters to them no matter what it is. They could be fragmented into a million forums all over the internet, but by having everything in one place Reddit gains a ton of users each with unique contributions to make. Perhaps some of them have some misguided views on certain subjects but are respected experts in other areas. By having them here they can share with the rest of us, and we can expose them to different views as well.  		We'll take racists as an easy example. A bunch of racists on their own forum are completely insular but as a part of reddit they can be exposed to very different opinions and views from all over the world. It may not sway many of them, but it very well might help some of them. It also allows those of us who aren't part of those groups to explore them, to try to understand them and how they work if we're interested. It's easier to observe those types of things here than to try to track down and join closed tight-knit groups scattered all over the web.","depth":8,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kensin","name":"t1_ctkvzok","parent_id":"t1_ctktvur","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438239910,"created_utc":1438211110}

My point was that having a team that only meets in person sporadically means that when you DO get together, it's often less productive than a normal day.

This is hilarious and horrible and untrue.  Raising morale can be incredibly important.  And no, you don't do it by "cleaning up a park".  You do it by improving communication, honesty, trust, transparency, etc. This is usually easier if you have an in-person relationship.		And believe it or not, some people actually like their jobs.

What could two programmers need to sit next to one another for?  Just write the program, gosh.  Yeah...  that's not how it works with complex projects.  Some as simple as pulling data from a data feed can turn extremely complex, and face-to-face conversations are the best way to resolve the complex technical problems.  A 3 minute in-person conversation can clear up something that might take hours of back and forth email.  And since you're there you see everything that programming friend does and it gives you an idea how you can copy his methods on your own unrelated goals.  Etc.  There's so many ways this is valuable, and that example was literally just pulling data from some data source.  If you're trying to build something really complex, it can be even more vital to have face time.		"Plenty of ideas on the site", jesus h. christ man.  Sure.  Who's going to choose which ones get made?  Which ones are even feasible?  Which ones align with the 'right now' and then the 'next six months' and then the 'future goals'?

People need to report what they are working on, what progress is being made and what they need from others. And others need to take note and do the same, whether they are in the office or not. The problems I faced were mainly in that area. If people start going their own merry way because they don't care or don't know what others are doing, it all falls apart.

To me it seems, the longer these 'wars' go on, the more extremes they attract and the more rational people they chase away from their group, until you have two extreme groups that no longer represent the original ideas. 		It's like Mothers Against Drunk Driving founder being driven away from her own org once she felt they they had accomplished their original mission, but it wasn't enough for the extremists that had been rallied to the cause so it continues without her trying to return us to prohibition bit by bit.		This can happen to MRAs, SJWS, people who want to preserve their cultural heritage, GGers, redpillers. The moderate voices of reason that recognize the legitimate issues brought up get drowned out once the hateful masses start jumping onto the bandwagon to join the war. Additionally they become afraid to be associated with the very groups fighting for the things they believe in.		It makes me sad that we have made so much progress in womans rights for example, yet I've known people to tell me.

{"body":"> There is one big problem with that. Mods can't directly shadowban anyone.	> 	Thus they have to ask an admin to do the shadowban.

All completely true. 		>Why are admins blindly approving shadowban requests from moderators without validating a rule was even broken? 		They aren't. 		>Are moderators lying and claiming accounts are SPAM accounts when they are not?		No. The issue I think you may be having difficulty with here is the purpose of a shadowban. From my reading of your comments (and correct me if I'm wrong), you're thinking shadowbans are for spammers. Yes, that is their original purpose and their stated purpose, but that is naive. They are used for all bans handed out by the admins. Why is that you ask? Because that's the only one they have. It is the only type of site-wide ban built into the system because until relatively recently (before the massive increase in the population of this website and the trolls and hate it brought with it) spam was one of the only community issues that required admin intervention. There has been no reason to create a public hardban because no one has cared until recently. Now that there is such an uproar, there is supposedly one being developed. Yay. The big spooky shadowbans are going away, everyone can rest easy and enjoy a hard ban to the same effect. 		No one is deceiving the admins and tricking them into thinking regular users are spammers. The admins aren't rubber stamping bans. They have tools above and beyond the moderators, they see a lot more. They can see what links an account has visited, where it has voted, where it came from, where it went next, the IP, browser session information, a lot of stuff. People are not getting banned for nothing, they are getting banned for breaking the rules. Don't be misled by the people you see saying "I did nothing wrong and the admins are ignoring me!" Four years here and I've never met someone who said that and was telling the truth (as evidenced by yesterday's post in /r/videos).		>On top of that, ghosting individual comments is a tool provided to mods by admins. Mods can't ghost comments if admins don't let them.		True as well. This is an Automoderator function, which started out as a user created bot that was not associated with the admins in any way. It was only later after its creator was hired by reddit inc that it became integrated into the site. 		> I would argue that admins should not be giving tools to mods that allow them to hide individual comments at will in a way users will most likely never detect.		The answer for this is simple. This is a result of mods using anti-spam features to pseudo ban a user. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop mods from doing this without taking those anti-spam capabilities away entirely, which would be a colossally stupid thing to do. The two abilities are one in the same, completely tied together. There is no way to remove one without removing the other. 		>Technically mods using them to hide opinions is an abuse of those tools. Why are admins not banning mods who do that?		This goes back to my other point. Because the mods' word is law in their subreddit if they chose to make it so. That is the official sitewide policy.

Why not? If that mod of a single subreddit shows a user breaking a sitewide rule?

See for many the admins don't do enough. They will occasionally react to such a request, they don't do it in 100% of the cases. And it's not entirely their fault, they don't have the right tools and sometimes they simply have to deal with more important matter. And as far as I can see, the tagging tool is not a mass ban tool. The only thing I've seen is mods stating that it's one of many things that helps them decide whether somebody should get banned to keep their subreddit peaceful or not. Is it a perfect tool? Certainly not. But it's kind of a desperate measure to the problems that arise with having such a huge accumulation of people and the fact that some people decide to use the platform to make others feel bad. 		The alternative isn't doing nothing, but keeping an eye out for such people when you're a mod is certainly tiresome and can lead to being burned out. That's not something you should have happen with something that is supposed to be just a hobby.","depth":8,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Werner__Herzog","name":"t1_ctkf21i","parent_id":"t1_ctkeazq","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438216259,"created_utc":1438187459}
{"body":"If someone is harassing you, the admins generally do take care of it. What they haven't done is they haven't banned entire subs for the actions of a few dicksnots. Sometimes, though, harassment isn't as clear cut and sometimes people take things as harassment that to others are not. That's part of the problem too. That's why Reddit needs a clear policy on harassment. 		As to whether or not the tool is a mass ban item - it can be used to build one. It could be used to plug in all of those names into automod and use automod's subreddit specific shadowban function (not a real shadowban, but automod has a feature that bans that person silently from that sub/removes their posts/does not allow them to post or whatnot). Which is exactly why I'm saying that it is a bad idea. It is a group of usernames that can very, very easily be taken and used for purposes that are shitty. 		Grouping people up in the way that they have is also very disingenuous. It groups KiA and MensRights with Coontown when they are NOTHING alike. It throws in commenters and submitters even if they've submitted AGAINST the POV of the sub. It also seems to randomly link to a submitted comment or post, even if there are previous ones, or ones after that. It takes one small sample and paints a broad picture that is inherently flawed.		If this tool was made by CoonTown against users of BlackLadies, would you feel the same? Would you feel the same if the tool was made by TheRedPill against women's subreddits, or against SRS? If you wouldn't that should tell you right there that there is some bias. If it is just a tool, it should be cool for any group to make a list of another group and to pass it around to users for them to install and then use - because what's the harm? It isn't like users do shitty things sometimes, right? 		If the issue is admins not doing what you need, contact them. Work with them. Make direct needs understood. Putting a tool that is inherently going to cause some shit (because this is reddit - someone is going to cause some shit) up for anyone regardless of intent (not JUST mods) is a terrible, poorly thought out idea. It is less than a bandaid to fix a sucking chest wound.","depth":9,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"yggdrasils_roots","name":"t1_ctkfxye","parent_id":"t1_ctkf21i","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438217473,"created_utc":1438188673}

This attitude largely spawned from the treatment the men's rights movement gets from feminism. Look up the videos that came out from the attempted men's rights conference in Toronto. They were gathering to discuss what can be done to lower the higher rate of suicide among young adult males.		The result was a group of feminists stormed the area with megaphones shouting "we don't care what you have to say" until the conference was disbanded, and nothing was accomplished or discussed. This group of feminists was painted as "the good guys" for fighting misogyny by the media. 		This is the kind of shit the men's right movement deals with, so it makes sense that they can get bitter sometimes.		Edit: Also, when they show up elsewhere with this attitude, it's usually to refute false facts being presented as part of feminist arguments (which are typically being used to attempt to marginalize/demonize men). This gets called misogyny, of course. Also, the men's rights movement is about gender equality, and it just so happens that the areas in society/law where men are treated worse than women tend to be a result of feminist-led policies.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hfxRos","name":"t1_ctlgo40","parent_id":"t1_ctkg36q","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438289602,"created_utc":1438260802}

On the other hand, tweets promoting an AMA are mmk, because bringing users to a thing in which they are asked to participate is cool.  However, promoting specific posts and asking that followers vote would not.		So for example, onsite brigading by subs that promote certain views, whether they be a link posted into SRS or KiA where users are invited to express there opinions is a problem, but bestof as a subreddit isn't, because while is shines a light on a posts or set of posts, its not actively encouraging users to cause trouble, and SRD is even less of an issue because they actively ban pissers.		So were I spez, I'd be much more worried about offsite and opinionated brigades as opposed to meta-subs that either don't hold an opinion, and/or actively ban people who get involved.

That's a big problem, but I think the technical solution to this is going to be different from the technical solution for "offensive" brigading.  For the /r/bestof users, I would deal with it by preventing people from voting on things in subreddits they are not currently subscribed to and that problem is immediately solved.  The SRS style that is usually provided as an example of brigading is malicious and intentional, so that requires something more complicated because it's likely that people would subscribe to subreddits that have opinions they oppose just to get around the first measure.  I don't think there's a single measure of what should be done, but another potential option in addition to the ones being worked on could be a quota system where either you only get a certain number of downvotes to use in a day, or a ratio quota where you have to have let's say >=70% upvotes and <30% downvotes per day.

{"body":"As somebody who has used reddit actively for a few months now, I still don't understand why "brigading" is even an offense. 		It seems ridiculous to me. If I see something I find interesting that I have an opinion to share on, or to upovte or downvote something because I think it's a fantastic post or a terrible one, what difference does it make if I find out about the topic/post/comment on my own, or I find it via a link from another subbreddit?		The entire idea that brigading is negative and has to be mitigated relies on the assumption that everybody on reddit lacks the ability to form their own opinions and conclusions on a topic, and that's pretty insulting. Instead of banning and punishing brigading, people should be punished or have their posts deleted for, you know, actually making bad/hostile posts, regardless of where the user found the topic they are replying to. 		For instance, about 30 mins ago, I found out about something I find super interesting that I have something to say about on, let's call it subbreddit Y. However, since I found it via Subreddit X and made a comment in the thread that linked to subreddit Y, I can't pot in subreddit Y without risking an immediate ban even if I am posting the same thing I would have had I found about subreddit Y on my own, without subreddit X. The best I can do is message the moderators of subbreddit Y beforehand and hope that they message me back and give me instructions on how not to cross the line, if that's not impossible.

Discussions of these issues are not only valuable if they always lead to everybody agreeing that feminism is good, black people need to start an anticolonialist revolution, and Islam isn't ruining the world.

I have absolutely no objection to people being exposed to new ideas! The thing is, though, that **all these conversations** have been had **hundreds of times already.** We're not *advancing* the debate, we're *duplicating* the debate by starting off at the first floor every single time.		This is known as "derailing" and it happens all. the. fucking. time on this site. Just look at any post (or subreddit) which even *hints* at supporting feminism.		If people were **actually interested** in having an honest intellectual discussion, debate, or argument, you would think they would expose themselves to the available material on the subject, including literally thousands of previous "debates" on the subject, before opening their mouths and adding their uninformed takes. 		This doesn't happen, obviously, which tells me something about how concerned people are about "learning about issues."		But really, most of my point here is that I don't think tolerating "hate" subreddits has a thin sliver of anything to do with "advancing the conversation." I think that's a bullshit reason, and it doesn't justify keeping them around. Keep them around if you want, or justify it some other way, but "Coontown needs to be here because we as a society need to have a conversation" doesn't hold any water either.

This is my entire point, actually, and I'm glad you put it like this. My experience is that on this site, it is very difficult to have *precisely* this kind of nuanced conversation if you're starting from ground zero every time. 		Because when you're having these interesting conversations about where lines are, or gray areas, and things like that, and people derail those conversations with *fundamental* questions that have been answered dozens of times and from which the discussions in question have evolved... you lose something.

When you're having a discussion with people which rests upon, for example, the supposition that the patriarchy is a thing that exists, it's very hard to have that kind of conversation when people who are inexperienced and vocal about their ignorance come in with things like "THE PATRIARCHY ISN'T REAL AND FEMINISTS HATE MEN" It's like yeah, that conversation has been had over and over again, and you should go have it somewhere else if you want to fight about it. Educate yourself or take it elsewhere.		Blow that up to the macro scale of Reddit and that's what I'm talking about when I say that "not all conversation is valuable."		What I'm saying is that I think it's absolutely fine, and would in fact be helpful, to say that a certain baseline level of "discussion" needs to happen elsewhere, that Reddit is not interested in facilitating or perpetuating.		I'm not saying "ban everything", I'm saying that the lines of what Reddit does and does not tolerate can be shifted a little bit at this point, and Reddit would be better off for it.

People who want censorship are most often simply trying to bully and silence those they disagree with. They are unable to articulate their ideas clearly because they come from a position of prejudice themselves and are using victim-hood as a way to bully others.

No one looked at that banning and thought that it made their "arguments" more legitimate. The "debate", if there even is a debate to be had on the topic, can continue. Neither side has been silenced. The marketplace of ideas is still intact because it's not limited to reddit, despite the "front page of the internet" motto.

Everything that's been banned, with the possible exception of jailbait a few years ago, has been pretty universally accepted as terrible on its own.

{"body":"It honestly surprises me how many people can hold this view. I'm disappointed in xkcd for oversimplifying it so far. Free speech is only *nominally* respected if the major venues in which people speak are shut down. It's like saying that deporting illegal immigrants isn't actually hurtful, because they're just as free to pursue employment in their own country. Maybe employment is hard to come by in their country. Maybe their family lives over here and deporting them will split up parents and children. Sure, *technically* we are following the letter of the law, but are we following the spirit that Americans are so proud of, the spirit of embracing the huddled masses and the wretched refuse of your teeming shore?		I'd argue not. (Apologies for the US-centric metaphor, but given the US majority userbase here I think it speaks well.)		Reddit has to acknowledge that it is a large, popular site. There are very few, possibly no, others like it. Giving people a place to talk here, where there are so many others to share a discussion, is a very different thing from giving people a place to talk on some dying web 1.0 site. A new domain name is not going to provide the community and exciting diversity that reddit already has. We saw this when a lot of people started talking about "reddit alternatives"—they tried finding a new door. It hasn't really worked. Nothing has matched reddit. Because the diversity of this website is what makes these conversations valuable. There may be folks you don't agree with, but there will also be folks you do agree with, and the fun part is in mixing the two, learning more, and broadening your horizons.

I can start my own site if I get banned from another, and it's just as accessible as any other website. Sure, I won't have the built in audience, but that's the marketplace of ideas for you.

I firmly believe that a hive mind somewhere else is less harmful than one here. We're talking about places like coontown, there's nothing being refined there. This isn't a debate about the nature of race in society, it's a debate about whether black people are humans or animals. No one is going to change their minds. It's not a debate worth having. It's not like there are interesting new points to be made. But, by giving them a platform on reddit instead of an obscure racist forum somewhere else, they gain legitimacy. They gain the ability to curate a front page for themselves that makes racism look normal. They get to see some racism, and then immediately jump to a video of a black person in one of the default subs where they can take a steaming pile of shit in the comments. And if it's not overt enough, it'll be upvoted by fellow racists, or people who don't hear the dog whistle or think it's funny. The ensuing debate will mention a racist sub and give it some nice free advertising. Checking out another subreddit is lower friction that another site entirely. The controversy over such horrible racism on such a popular site gives them advertising too. None of this stuff happens with sites like Stormfront, at least not nearly to this degree, it's unique to the way reddit works. 		And now we're at the point where reddit has a reputation for this stuff, which keeps people with other viewpoints away. We can have a site where black people and women feel comfortable, or we can have one where racists and sexists do. We can't have both. There isn't enough isolation between communities to do that, even with the new quarantining. By banning the worst racist subs, we lose racists but gain the people those racists were keeping away. That's going to result in better discussion, the exact opposite of a chilling effect, because the discussion the racists want to have has been done many times before. There are new, modern, more relevant discussions to be had, and if the price to pay is that racists have to find a new place to complain, I say bring it on.

{"body":"> We can have a site where black people and women feel comfortable, or we can have one where racists and sexists do. We can't have both.		I think this may be the crux of the issue. Because I don't think that's true at all. I think we *can* have both. In many ways, we *do* have both.		I'm a bisexual female of color and I feel comfortable on reddit. In fact, I feel more comfortable on reddit than I have on pretty much any other social media site. I feel comfortable *because* I can have conversations like this one, where we can discuss complicated issues in totally civil tones and come to more nuanced conclusions as a result. I have not seen that on any other site, tbh.		I used to spend time on tumblr, but the identity politics so popular there became incredibly stifling, uncomfortable, and legitimately dangerous in some cases, to the point where I couldn't log on without holding my breath and crossing my fingers there was no hate or abuse on my dashboard: hate and abuse predicated on the assumption that the people being abused *deserved* it, because they were somehow racist or sexist, based purely on the definitions of the abusers. I saw people pressured to separate themselves from their families, harass their own friends, and repudiate their own gender identities because these things were inherently "oppressive."		I left and came here. It's been a breath of fresh air. Despite being a woman of color, nobody has sent me any harassing messages. In fact, I haven't even read any tirades about how women and people of color are ruining America. Not even on the default subs.		I'm sure those things exist, but *I don't seek them out.* And just as those things may exist, there are plenty of discussions of how to stop institutionalized racism in America. There are discussions of how to reconcile the bloody history that founded our country with the diversity it now holds. There are discussions of transgender visibility. There are posts celebrating record-breaking female athletes. *All* of these things exist on reddit, and I can read what I want, and participate where I want.		That's amazing, to me. That's glorious and that's exactly the kind of community I want to foster. I do not actually want a community where only the topics curated by admins and determined to be *palatable* to a wide audience can exist. I want a community where *everything* can exist, and I can decide what I find palatable. I don't want anybody else deciding that for me.		edit to add:		> Checking out another subreddit is lower friction that another site entirely.		I think this works both ways. Just as going *to* coontown is easier than going to a separate, racist site, people *on* coontown can more easily be linked somewhere else on reddit, where an active debate is happening about what constitutes racism and how it hurts people. Minds can be changed both ways. And that's fine with me. That is a true marketplace of ideas, and I am confident that given the *chance* to compete, non-racists will win.

I could understand punishing a user with a demonstrated history of using hateful words to troll for reactions, even though I'm still inclined to trust the community and the structure of the voting system to deal with those comments, but I'm going to remain firmly against punishing these comments on a case by case basis. 		I know I've personally been accused of making racist comments on this site against a minority group to which I belong (hard to tell, our user names are all blue), and the particular comment I'm thinking of was not hateful, nor could it have even been perceived as hateful when taken in the context of the entire post.  It was actually supportive, and included a link to peer reviewed science as a source.  Anecdotal, I know, but relevant to the conversation.  All it takes is for one person to read it the wrong way (or pick a few words out of the center of a sentence) and I lose an years old account if you let that policy go through.  If Bill the Admin arrives at his hate speech moderation queue in a sour mood and reads the few words in the middle of a sentence that when isolated from the words before or after make a terrible sentence, boom, ban.		Or in another hypothetical case, let's say a level headed person who was raised in a small southern US town has always just accepted some racist idea as a matter of fact.  He arrives in a subreddit where somebody is refuting that idea, and he makes a comment consisting of what he believes to be innocuous fact, but others construe it as hate speech.  In one universe, he engages in the conversation where by the end he realizes his assessment of the facts were wrong and his mind is opened however more slightly (this really does happen sometimes, I promise).  In another universe, his first comment is reported and deleted and he's banned, never having reached the conclusion that his assessment of the fact was wrong.  He goes about his daily life with 60+ year old ideas about differences between races.

{"body":"It's times like this I wish there was a disagree button. You've got my upvote, for bringing up a good point and contributing to to conversation. But I have to disagree with your both your tone and your conclusion.		/u/spez was right on earlier when he said that silencing the opposition is no way to win an argument.		There are some topics that seem so taboo that respectable people refuse to discuss them. /r/CoonTown is rather the poster-child for this. I'll not defend them.		But I will defend the people who discuss other taboo topics, like polygamy or even those that argue against certain aspects of the established Age of Consent laws. (These topics are becoming less taboo and more taboo over time. So, incidentally, did racism, though I'd like to think we're living on the right side of this historical discussion.)		I see no effective way to eliminate some taboo topics without eliminating the others. I believe /u/spez believes likewise. His solution, and I think it's a good one, is to quarantine these communities so that it is clear that Reddit, Inc. does not endorse their views. (Although if you believe Reddit, Inc. endorses even 0.1% of what redditors post, you're probably pretty offended by Reddit, Inc.) It keeps the taboo topics separated so that they don't show up for the vast majority of users, which is good. Those users probably expect not to be subjected to those taboo topics.		And lastly, neither the decision to ban nor not to ban would be clearly and unambiguously right or wrong. There's no phoney hand-wringing or cynical moralizing here.

But anyways, your point is that it's *difficult* to maintain those kinds of clear and effective distinctions, and to always make the right ones, and I agree with that. So, it's not about there being "value in the conversation" and it's certainly not about "winning an argument"--there is no value in a place like /r/CoonTown and there is no argument to be won or lost. Reddit has just decided that it doesn't want to be in the business of maintaining those kinds of distinctions, because that's easier for them. So be it.

However that isn't to say that reddit is not, nor should not be, a forum of both global as well as niche subs that may only want input from established community members.		The only "anti-brigading" measures I believe should be implemented are tools that only permit subscribers actions once they have met certain requirements. For instance you could allow mods to stipulate that people can only vote on items in their sub after their comments have received a specified amount of karma.		There are many, many ways this could be broken down and many subs may want different ways to limit participation. For instance one sub may want to prevent users from submitting links until they've acquired a specified amount of comment karma on that sub. Other subs may want to restrict users from commenting unless they've already submitted a successful link.

Now on the iPhone version if you get the Pro upgrade you should not be getting ads. At least I've never seen them. However there is confusion because people bought the upgrade on the original version (the unofficial version made by /u/jase) and for some reason didn't get the free upgrade when it was released for a week around the time of the launch of the new, official app. Pro upgrades aren't carried over from app to app because a) the apps are owned in the App Store world by different developers and b) Apple IDs aren't shared or available to developers so there is no way to tell if someone bought the Pro upgrade on the original version so it can automatically be credited to the new version.

{"body":"Oh, hey, it's 2015 and you guys are waking up and thinking, "Oh, hey, it's 2015, this smartphone fad really isn't going away... hey guys, let's make an app for the smartphone users, because not everyone wants to ride the Cupertino bus to perpetual 2007." Yeah, great idea. Here's a better one. Leave the API open, or what have you, IANAP, but we have like 5 or 6 Reddit apps that work great. Everyone has a favorite and there is no clear best. I prrefer Sync and BaconReader. Have both installed, each serves a purpose (Sync has a nicer interface, BaconReader has the best comment browsing of any of them, it's the only one that can collapse all). With Apple, one size fits all. And that may have worked in the last decade, but for those of us living in the future, with bona fide personal computers in our pockets, we need choices. One size does not fit all with us. I have an HTC One M8 because I love the speakers and I don't need a fancy camera. Some other guy chose the Galaxy S6 because he needs a fingerprint reader and a better camera than I do. And that lady over there has a Motorola, and can just tap the edge of her phone to see the time and date, and can open the camera with a flick of her wrist. We're not going anywhere, and we're certainly not riding the Cupertino train to 2007.		I think it's safe to say none of us want you to make a new app for us. What would really be cool, and could be the same thing you want, is if you hired one of the leading developers or teams. OneLouder, who makes BaconReader, also have Twitter and Facebook apps, a great weather app, and more. They might be a bit too big, but you can't fault their ambition. I think for official status, Reddit is Fun's developer might be the best choice. I think you'll find that TalkLittle's design is faithful to Reddit's own design. It's a good app, but I don't use it for that reason. Looks too native. I like different. But I don't fault the RiF fans.		Setting smartphones aside, let me tell you the big problem I have with the way some subreddits (ironically, /r/Android is one) are run. You got some mods, who see a post that has an opportunity for karma, so they'll delete the post, and then they'll repost it themselves. You guys have said that Reddit is a place where people can come together and have good conversations. Yet ranking is based on karma, and if you have people making great posts, yet moderators are cannibalizing these posts for themselves, you're disenfranchising users. What I propose is not simple and might not make sense on the server end, but I'm gonna say it anyway. If someone posts a link, they "own" it, for karma purposes. If anyone reposts it, all karma flows to the original submitter, even if the sub bans them. Then you won't have sketchy mods and admins cannibalizing posts.		Ban evasion won't work. We live in a world with dynamic IPs and VPNs. You want to do what you want to do? Stop looking at IPs and start looking into heuristic message scanning. We're creatures of habit, there is software that can search for patterns. But that's not accurate enough. You want to ban me, for instance? You scan my post history and search for me amongst your other members, I bet you get more false positives than you want. I really think a shadowban commune (where being shadowbanned means only other shadowbanned users can see your posts). That way, the "nobody is reacting to my posts, I must be shadowbanned" trigger doesn't happen.		STFU about brigading as long as SRS and others are open. Nobody gives a shit. If the original and most prolific offenders are allowed to operate, nobody cares what you want to do about the less prolific ones. I mean, seriously. Either it's allowed or it isn't. Get off the fence. You can't move forward on the fence. Get off the fence, on one side or another, then put one foot in front of the other, and keep moving forward. You're going to piss a lot of people off, but don't be afraid to say, "This is OUR site and this is how we're running it."		On the tech side, I really don't think you can stop brigading with code. As long as you have two users who can access the sub doing the brigading and the sub to be brigaded, one user will probably always be able to tell the other user about the other sub and the other user will be able to get to the other sub and do what they're going to do. You have to do it with policy. Put your foot down, show an example, spell out exactly what it is (some are unclear), and say, "This shit will get you banned. Please, try it and be an example to all the other little fuckwads who want to do it." Then ban a bunch of them at once, and dare others to do it. Bring some people in and swing the ban hammers. Happy to help if you need it.		Source(s): Ran a forum for a couple years, albeit 10 years ago. Always been interested in the sociology of online communities, well, since about 2000 or so.

What reddit will be responsible for is pernicious and trackable offenses that are committed via reddit.		If any single opinion that you have is controversial enough that you think it could legitimately get you fired, then I would urge you to rethink your stance. 		Personally I find any similarities that people draw between something like CoonTown and something like KiA to be laughable, disingenuous and overtly misinformed. The fact that you're on a list with them is a tad ridiculous, and I'm probably on the list too, since I've made (dissenting) comments in KiA. And that's one of the key differences, in my eyes; you can go to KiA and partake in the conversation as someone who disagrees with them, but you can't go to CoonTown for any reason.

Pretty speech needs no one to defend it. Everyone likes it already. It's the ugly speech, the one that makes me people like me and you feel disgusted, the one that needs defense, and without that defense, any community -such reddit- becomes vulnerable to groupthink and cultural stagnation.		So yes, I do feel that being put in a list simply for posting in a controversial subreddit makes me, or any 'reasonable person', to paraphrase Ellen Pao, 'conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express my ideas or participate in the conversation', and given the harassment many gamergate supporters have been through, to also 'fear for my safety and those around me'.

I hate that the 2x tries to silence anyone who has different opinions, especially when its not breaking the rules (at least until they secretly change them after linking me to the rules and realizing I was indeed not breaking them)		"Having a conversation about the comparisons doesn't automatically mean it's derailing the topic of fgm."","depth":4,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_ctkenu6","parent_id":"t1_ctkebou","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438215719,"created_utc":1438186919}

It's a pointer.

{"body":"The important and controlling question is: how does reddit *know* that someone's copyright in media being linked to is being violated? The answer is that it requires proof originating from a legal process: either a court decision for that particular media, or law enforcement representing to reddit that criminal copyright violation is occurring, or a DMCA takedown process (which largely does not apply to reddit, as they largely do not host most content that might be DMCAd (unless it's text, or is a graphic element served as part of CSS)).		Further, in this age of *licenses*, it's possible that whoever is posting links to outside-hosted material has been granted a license allowing them to host that material and link to it — and that license may be granted explicitly through license language, unwittingly through license language, or implicitly through case law and legislation of the applicable jurisdictions from where it was distributed and where it is hosted. Those are all legal technicalities which reddit doesn't control, and which reddit is unqualified to interpret or enforce — that would be a court's job, and reddit is technically an "*uninterested third party*".		Without the legal process, anyone could "claim" they had copyright interest in something and use that to censor discussion and chill public participation. For reddit, or any forum host, to *reasonably know* that the copyright is actually being violated, they need the legal process followed.		When reddit *has* been informed that a community existed solely for the purpose of criminal copyright infringement, they shut the community and its offshoots down — the visble example being /r/thefappening, which was shut down once reddit administration was approached by law enforcement investigating the theft of the pictures.","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bardfinn","name":"t1_ctkj46u","parent_id":"t1_ctkgt2m","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438221675,"created_utc":1438192875}

A user can create an account and there are zero presubscribed subs, this will dramatically reduce the "everyone in one place" effect that generates so much noise. Users completely understand that they can op-out of default subs, but many (myself included) only drop from a handful of those subs.  	  	Much like the re-alignment of the default subs about 2 years ago, the damage is done and we just move forward.  	  	Hopefully this option can protect specific subs from completely being drowned in signal/noise issues from a huge influx of new users, specifically those that do not fit the desired democratic for the sub itself.

I don't think that the using of tools like that should automatically lead to a ban, but when they're used to keep track of a specific group of people for potentially nefarious reasons, it's a bit scary, and such behaviour should be harshly discouraged in the type of forum the admins are trying to create of Reddit.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"goatsandbros","name":"t1_ctkbh53","parent_id":"t1_ctkb9ww","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1438211281,"created_utc":1438182481}

Keep track of and map banned users to IP addresses (nodes) and email addresses.  		While a user can change his address, it cannot be done very many times.		If a single node has 5 banned users, then it is possibly a troll, you could confirm by looking at the content.		If a node has 50, then block the address and maybe notify the net-admin (whois) that "127.0.0.2 has been blacklisted from reddit for xxx."		If my employees of my children get me blacklisted on reddit, there will be a reckoning.		It should be a timed blacklist, maybe 60 days?

They're already so close...		* Have a tile view like Shiny Reddit has.	** Shiny Reddit Pro - Chrome Web Store || https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shiny-reddit-pro/nihdcibdbpkakpaolelklbgckofeaofp?hl=en		* Automatically post all the times a link or photo was shared across all subreddits.  And links to those same posts / links with dates when they were originally posted.  The bots that do that are so kind.		* Create a way to Publish bad PMs to a Wall of Shame.  Recipient gets too many dick picks, boom they have a way to share it with the Reddit for creepy PMs.  And if you're worried about new accounts... just set it so you have to wait a day before you can PM anyone... OR... set it so users can block PMs form people who have accounts under X days old.  That way if I want creepy dick picks, and I'm a girl, I can turn off that block... but if not, easy out.  And if someone from an established account wants to send me a creepy message, I can still share it to the world and shame that fucker.  Or set it so you can make your account only able to receive PMs if you initiate them with that person.  Boom... we never have people getting messages they don't want ever again, and if they do we can all have a good laugh at the perv's expense.  "It's so tiny!  He he."		* Bring back FatPeopleHate.

They made horrible life choices and we are calling them out on it.  It's lime smoking or doing meth.  They made the choice not to put the fork down.

Just walk your ass around the block.  Fucking fat people did it to themselves.  No different than if someone was a skinhead with a Swastika tattoo.  They made the choice to do that, and we should be free to call them out on it.		* Have an annual election day for moderators.  Because... fuck the mods.  They aren't good people, 99% of the time they're just cunts on power trips.  Seriously.  Fuck.  The.  Mods.  At least if we had elected mods we'd know we were living with our own shitty choices.

They got sued for sharing the couple's personal information with everyone, who then harassed the gay couple for months afterwards with death threats and the like.
