{"body":"With regards to your insistence that "college" is an inappropriate term- I'd just like to point out that in the US there is a distinction between colleges and universities, but the term "college" is commonly used in reference to all undergraduate programs.  The exact delineation between colleges and universities is hazy and often varies from state to state, but generally to qualify as a university the school must have significant doctorate and/or professional programs and research.  In contrast, "college" traditionally refers to 4-year undergraduate liberal arts schools; these schools may also have graduate programs, but such programs are usually small or otherwise insignificant (even if the undergraduate quality is strong).		You will often hear US universities referred to as a "university system," where the the 4-year undergraduate program(s) of the university are *college(s)* under the umbrella of the larger university, along with the associated doctoral and professional colleges.  While universities themselves are not technically colleges, they must by definition include at least one college; thus the term "college" is used to refer to all institutions of higher education (both universities and colleges).		Additionally, note that the classification may refer to the historical role of the school, rather than its current definition.  For example, The College of William and Mary is an extremely prestigious school in Virginia that was founded in 1693.  It would have every right to change its name to "William and Mary University," considering its numerous graduate and professional programs and overall academic strength.  However, it chose to retain the term "college" due (at least in part) to its history as a primarily undergraduate liberal arts program, as well as the fact that it was one of 9 "colonial colleges" founded before the American Revolution.		My alma mater, Virginia Tech (which Reddit will be highlighting on the 22nd), is classified as a university.  In fact, its official name is "Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University" but "Virginia Tech" is much easier to say.  Within the university are many different colleges, such as the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, and The College of Architecture and Urban Studies.  Technically I received my bachelor's degree from "The Pamplin College of Business of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University," but the question people ask is "where did you go to college?" to which I respond "Virginia Tech."		TL;DR- All US universities are colleges, but not colleges are universities.  "College" is a perfectly acceptable and commonly used term for all 4-year undergraduate institutions, so correcting its use here is inaccurate.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"XOLegato","name":"t1_c4dhdlx","parent_id":"t1_c4cx5vz","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1334731443,"created_utc":1334702643}
