{"body":"Is there any chance you guys are ever going to take a look at the [10% rule for self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and revise it a bit to make it more fair to creative people who legitimately have something to share to the reddit community? I ask because I know that rule is turning a lot of creative people away from reddit because recently any posts about what they're currently working on tend to get deleted. There's a difference between spamming 100 links to a blog nobody cares about full of ads, and say, an indie game developer who makes 1 game every couple of years and wants to tell people about it and answer questions, but doesnt necessarily want to have to post 10 advice animals in the mean time?		This isn't my main account, its just the one I post on the most because I don't really want reddit posts on my other account showing up in google searches for my name. SO I just use the other one to talk about stuff I'm working on (not spam, one post once in a while and when they don't get deleted for self promotion they get upvoted a lot and people seem to enjoy them and I answer questions and participate in the discussions). Or I used to at least. It's been difficult lately.		At least there seems to be quite a double standard where anyone SUPER FAMOUS AND POPULAR already gets a free pass for promoting their works on reddit (celebrity AMAs and people like JimKB), whereas all the little guys who can't afford massive marketing campaigns for their works get shunned away and basically told that reddit doesn't value their work. I'm [not the only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5UjfCZUzg) who thinks this.		If you want specific complaints about the 10% rule its:  	- comments don't count  	- posts from many years ago before this rule was strict count against it  	- posts in subreddits that WANT original content and posts from creators (like /r/gamedev) count against you in all other subreddits  	- posts on alternate accounts don't count (I like keeping my "business" account separated since I don't want people to easily see like, my political opinions and stuff)  	- the rule just encourages people to either spam up advice animals, or lie about being the author ("my friend just made..."), or use sockpuppet accounts. All of these seem less valuable to me than letting authors be honest about it, and it makes reddit a worse place as a result.  	- A spambot or true spammer can get around a rule like "90% of posts must not be self promotion" with bots and scripts and proxies and sockpuppets really easily, so this rule just ends up targeting honest creatives who are proud of what they made and want to share it with a site they visit every day.","depth":0,"score":2542,"ups":2542,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Plorp","name":"t1_cw34nuj","parent_id":"t3_3p4shh","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445133953,"created_utc":1445105153}

The user above clearly has not read through the page, because most of the exceptions they carved out are already specifically mentioned in the policy.  It's quite a biased take on the matter if you ask me.   		The rule is intended to prevent people from shamelessly trying to use the community for profit at the expense of a level playing ground, and it's mostly used to ban legit spammers.  We see this all the time on news-oriented subs.  A new blog will pop up out of nowhere, and we will see 4 or 5 users who submit nothing but that domain (or rather, they will make a few posts to /r/freekarma first), and every submission will immediately get 4 or 5 upvotes.  This is very clearly spam, and the best "rule" we have to articulate it is the 10% spam threshold.  We spend enough time arguing with ~~special flowers~~ spammers in modmail - and having the site wide rule to fall back on really helps end the discussion. 	  	It's fine that new blogs are trying to gain traction, but when we see this kind of spamming and vote manipulation, it only hurts the content creators who actually try to play by the rules.  If we were to allow this sort of behavior, then everyone who isn't CNN or BBC or ArsTechnica would have to organize spam rings just to get seen.   Spamming leads to clickbait, and clickbait leads to shit content.

When you excessively self-promote your own content, you get a lot of eyes on your stuff (the desired effect) but you also get the mod's eyes on your stuff too. Mods will recognize the same domains being submitted over & over again. When this happens, they'll start to investigate and keep track.

I've brought down a couple myself, though I know mods who bring down spam rings *all the time*. 		> It doesnt matter how fair a policy is if it doesnt accomplish what it is meant to.		Without being a mod of a large subreddit or default subreddit yourself, how do you know it isn't accomplishing what it's meant to do?

{"body":"> The 10% system is a huge barrier for me to do that and hence I think it is flawed.		Then you should be arguing *for* the 10% rule, believe it or not. :) There is a pretty huge group of moderators that don't want *any* self-promotion whatsoever. They believe that reddit's [self-serve ads](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/) are the solution for people wanting to share their own content, or content they benefit from in some way. That's literally what ads are for - for self-promotion. 		So you say you want to share your content and they say, "Cool, buy an ad. That's what they're there for." :) But you don't want to pay. And that's where the 10% rule comes in.... it's a compromise. It's mods like me saying, "Ok, we'll let you self-promote for free, but only if you're an active contributing member of reddit and your self-promotion is minimal." Minimal being 10% of your activity. Anything more is what we consider excessive. It's spamming. If you want to spam, if you want to submit more than 10%, reddit has ads for that very purpose. If those other mods have their way, there would be *no* 10% rule at all because there would be no self promotion or people being allowed to submit their own stuff. If you wanted to do that, you'd have to use reddit's self-serve ads (which admittedly, are cheap I'm told).		So for me, the 10% rule is one of the few objective (and fair, since it applies to everyone and anyone) ways to limit excessive self-promotion. You say you want to share your content and that's fine. But what about when Huffington Post starts taking advantage? Or CNN.com? Or Vice.com? You wouldn't be able to compete with those powerhouses. The little guys wouldn't benefit at all. In fact, they'd be ones most hurt by us removing our rules regarding self-promotion. Right now, those rules keep the playing field somewhat level. If we remove those rules, it's open season and the big boys are going to be the ones playing on the field. :P","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"relic2279","name":"t1_cw3fxfk","parent_id":"t1_cw3fbkj","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445153945,"created_utc":1445125145}

He said the "kind of content that stays on the front page is next level lame now... terrible... because it's just subpar meaningless entertainment posts that stick around. Really starting to look like a facebook news feed out here."  He wants that to change.  To content he likes and approves of.

IF you are subscribed to nearly 50-75 subs, and there are only 50 posts per page on the front page, you're not going to even see a single post from each and every sub.  You're not going to ever see all the content if you just stay on your frontpage.  So I'd imagine if you want to see the interesting stuff deeper in your subscribed subs you'd go into those subs as you *have* to.  This is even more true if you are browsing /r/all instead of your own homepage since it ignores what you are subbed to and unsubbed from and just shows you all the most popular/upvoted content.		It sounds like you expect your front page to show you every post to every one of your subs within any given 24 hours.  That's just not going to happen by design.

Although I feel like that's a generalization, I understand what you're saying.  I think, perhaps, it boils down to a matter of opinion and what you, the user, want out of Reddit, the service.  Without solid measuring or statistics its probably a bad idea to go just off of what the comments say.  Without this kind of data, what should the developers to?

My argument is that there should be a more objective look taken at how the system functions and WHY it functions this way instead of just giving it the axe.  Change is great, especially when that change implements positive aspects of it previous incarnation.  Again, my own personal taste has me thinking that the system is fine.  As for the shooting you'd mentioned: as callous as it sounds, the event didn't directly affect me and I knew no one involved with it.  It's hard for me to relate to things like that since I've never experienced anything like it.

{"body":"> Without solid measuring or statistics its probably a bad idea to go just off of what the comments say. Without this kind of data, what should the developers to?		I have mentioned elsewhere how I would solve it-- make those user-set variables. I would add these two variables:		* Front page refresh rate:		1. Slow	2. Medium	3. Fast	4. Every load		and 		* Front page randomness		1. most poular	3. balanced	4. random	4. chaotic < pulls in a larger amount of content from non-subscribed subs		But even without going that far, simply changing the refresh rate would largely address the problem.

You realize that is irrelevant, right? I used that story as an example, but your opinion of the specific story has zero bearing on the validity of the point. The statement would be equally true if your best friend had been shot-- you still would have missed the story on Reddit. 		Or, for example, a quick glance at your post history tells me you like Rick and Morty. Would you be equally as uncaring if you missed the story about how the entire production staff was killed by a freak meteor strike? 		I don't care how good the algorithm gets, you will always see some stories you don't care about and miss others you do. What matters is that it was a big, breaking news story, and the Reddit front page completely missed it for several hours, even if you were subscribed to the relevant subs. 		And contrary to what everyone is saying, it was NOT because the posts were not getting upvotes. They got plenty of upvotes.

{"body":"Can you try to be a bit more specific with your complaint? While reading what you said I couldn't get a cohesive idea of what you feel is wrong with the front page.		So far I'm getting that you think the front page is "staler" than normal, and this confuses me because my frontpage went back to "normal" a while ago, shortly after the shooting.		Basically, my frontpage is the "resource" that yours used to be.		I don't see posts staying there all day, and it's same "lame" content mixed with good content that it's always been for me. I check reddit's first few pages in the morning, afternoon, and night. My frontpage is usually completely different from morning to night, and from night to the next morning unless I stay on reddit until 4am or some stupid shit.		Anyways, I'm just confused about what you're actually complaining about. Are you complaining that the logarithm supposedly killed the frontpage or are you complaining about the content itself lately?		It really sounds like you're just complaining about content quality and using "the algorithm" as a scapegoat.		I'm actually seeing similar things all over reddit. People see a boring/bad post on the frontpage for more than 4 hrs and they go "ugh that stupid algorithm" without actually knowing it's the algorithms fault, and it just spreads through the community as the new scapegoat excuse for a patch of bad content quality after a brief period of legitimate issues with the algorithm.		I think people are thinking about this issue in the wrong way. They're quick to blame the algorithm because it's this unseen entity that controls some stuff, and they experienced a hiccup with algorithm that made the frontpage stale and now it's super easy for people to place false blame on the algorithm instead of maybe looking for other reasons.","depth":3,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Kiwi150","name":"t1_cw41y0s","parent_id":"t1_cw3438q","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445212948,"created_utc":1445184148}

Make sure you are actually subbed to ones with content you want to see, and unsubbed from ones you don't.		Then you can create multireddits.  You can use the [left-hand sidebar](http://i.imgur.com/tmvHpM8.png) (click the edge of the page to make it appear) to then create, save, and access your multireddits.  Or you can just browse to one by using a URL like this https://www.reddit.com/r/news+worldnews.  Just keep adding more subs with a "+subname".		Also, not sure how other apps work, but in Alien Blue, a subscriptions group will basically function as a multireddit.  Just go to the home screen of the app where you see the links to Front page, your account, and your subs and tap Edit at the upper right.  Then tap Groups at the bottom left.  You can then create new groups to then add subs into.  Subs can also be in multiple groups.

{"body":"All of your front page are posts from less than a day old.  It literally can't have posts older than 24 hours on it.		Let me try to explain it a different way.  Lets say subreddit X has one post a day in it and they only get ~10 points on each on average.  Subreddit Y, on the other hand, has hundreds of posts in it made daily, and the top 10% of the daily hot posts get 1000+ points.  Now, when you go to your front page (not the subreddit's front), you'll see mostly subreddit Y, but you'll still always see that one daily subreddit X post, even though there's tons of other posts in subreddit Y that trump the daily X post in points.		Your front page consists of a mix of the hot posts in 50 subreddits.  You will always see at least one post from each, regardless of score (well, considering your front page is set to show 50 posts, otherwise you'd have to go to the next page to see more, which makes calling it the 'front page' kinda confusing for this discussion).","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"aperson","name":"t1_cw37umn","parent_id":"t1_cw36zl1","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445139782,"created_utc":1445110982}

Because if they know what caused the front page to change, and they know people are complaining, why haven't they simply reverted to the previous algorithm?  Instead there are a lot of vague explanations and doublespeak.		Starting from the position of assuming Reddit is being deceptive comes from the context of the past year which have presented many signs that Reddit is trying to commercialize and monetize itself.

That is precisely the strangest part.  They know the userbase is unhappy and they know they are making the userbase more unhappy by not fixing the algorithm, yet they say they are going to update the algorithm for the future instead of just simply restoring the previous algorithm *for the time being*.		Now, in a user-centric community, what could possibly explain such stupidity?  The only answer that makes sense is money.		Someone elsewhere in the thread hinted that the current algorithm might make Reddit more money.  In other words, if sponsors are paying to promote certain posts (like celebrity AMAs for instance), then they are going to want reassurance of a certain amount (of time) of visibility on the front page for their post.  If enough sponsors are paying to control enough posts and keeping all of them on the front page, that would certainly work to make things feel more stale and make Reddit more money at the same time.

This doesn't make any sense. I'm asking you why you're suspicious; your answer is "they're hiding the thing I'm suspicious of". Your argument is circular.		> Someone elsewhere in the thread hinted that the current algorithm might make Reddit more money.

It is even *more* feasible that Reddit could generate revenue by adding more DFP ad slots, or licensing their API, or selling a new tier of membership. Your theory hinges on the idea that enough avenues have been exhausted to make such a tremendously risky move worth Conde Nasts' while. And to what end?

{"body":"It's been a slow change happening over the course of the last couple years as the site has gotten more popular. We're getting an influx of new users, mostly the Facebook and Twitter crowd who were sick of hearing "I saw that on reddit first." So they think this site is similar to other social media sites and they just enjoy the content instead of helping curate it. These people will only visit default subs (thank fucking god) and will never volunteer as a Knight of New. If they do visit /new, they are more likely to upvote asinine Facebook level content rather than new and interesting original content. Granted, these people also believe they are hot shit, and that everyone wants to hear their sob story in r/pics , so they are flooding /new with trite bullshit that our brave KoN can't control.		What really brought it to everyone's attention was how news stories were not appearing until much, much later than other news aggregation sites.		We've seen this happen before, and it will happen again. This site has simply become too popular for its own good. Unfortunately, the people in charge are more interested in monetizing the site, and making it a nice tidy package for investors, than actually staying true to the original creators ideals.		Basically if you've been on this site for as long as I have, you'll find the default subs unrecognizable and damn near intolerable. The influx of extremists from both the left and the right has completely ruined subs like r/politics (left) and r/news (right) to the point where intelligent, constructive discussion has deteriorated down to people only upvoting things that reinforce their own preconceived notions. Leaving well thought-out debates buried in "controversial". Nobody takes the time to read the sidebar, read up on reddiquette or even the damn article. They don't lurk to get a feel for how a quality post is made, or to see if what they want to say has already been said in another comment. They simply read the headline, post some crazy rant about their own anecdotal experience, and maybe upvote the first 3 comments they happen to agree with. It's fundamentally different in almost every way than it was 5 years ago, and the site is worse for it.		The only thing that makes this site even remotely worthwhile is the fact that these cancerous users have no idea that the site is much bigger than what they see on their front page. Good forbid they ever learn how to subscribe to the last few quality subs that exist here. Unfortunately, a high quality post on a non-default sub that makes it to /all can often times be a harbinger for the death of that sub (see FPH). Which is why some subs make sure to stay off /all.		And don't get me started on these fucking power users like gallowboob & cant_trust_hillary who've made sure people see this site as some kind of popularity contest, whilst promoting the insane idea that this site is an aggregator for content found on other sites, rather than a bastion for quality, original content, and intelligent discussion. The poor grammar and lack of people proof reading their posts has also started to reach intolerable levels.		Oh well, things change.

Reddit *was* the place to be for instant top breaking news but they need posts to stay on the front page to cultivate a different demographic of user. Look at the recent DIY fiasco where a guy built his son a kitchen. The *first* users were Reddit's old demographic. 15-25 year old males. They threw at the DIY guy stuff you'd expect to see on 4Chan. Reddit wants to distance itself from those people since they're not profitable.		They want to be come a 'hub' where middle aged women can sit and congregate. They *are* profitable. Look at every decision they've made in the last 2 years. TwoX on the front page. (That back fired). That demographic is itching for a medium where to discuss stuff but are stuck on Facebook right now because that's what they know. That's why Facebook just added "Reply" and semi-threaded posts.  		And everyone is pretty much trying to re-invent Usenet and IRC. (I people just gave up trying to re-invent IRC. It *works*).		Edit: Fark did the same thing. They got rid of Boobies on the main page.

You should not be focused on getting new clients, rather you should be focused on nurturing and shaping your current clients.		Reddit is like a contagion.  People who are Redditors have a contagious disease that propagates similarly to how a normal disease propagates.  To reduce the population's resistance to Reddititis, you need to maximize the number of vectors by which the disease can infect others.  That means diversifying your subject matter, which entails finding ways to expand the interests of your userbase to open up their friend circles to non-redditors.		Efforts like "Upvoted" and the "Reddit Journal of Science" only serve to re-enforce entrenched interests.

Here are some ideas just off the top of my head that would be at the *very least*, better than how this situation is currently dealt with:		1. allow redditrequest to take into account a mod vote. Maybe a super majority of a current mod team. One issue some may perceive with this is that top mods will be more reluctant to add team members for fear of getting booted at some point. To that I say: fine. The system will self correct. If someone just tries to top-mod a subreddit all by themselves or with a few people, the subreddit itself will stagnate and probably fail. Subreddits with teams that work well together and are active will ultimately rise to the top.		2. Admins have access to mod log data. If there is a request for a subreddit, and the admins can see that there has been 250,000 actions in say.. the last 10 months, and a top mod has basically 0 actions... they should take that into heavy consideration. 		The perfect doesn't have to be the enemy of the good. If there is a mod that has basically 0 actions when the subreddit as a whole has done a quarter of a million, and there is a super majority of a mod team that is saying something is an issue, would it really kill the admins to defer to what active mods might be saying?

User content will stay in their relevant threads, and if someone wants to track it down, they would have to find every Subbreddit, every thread that the user has posted to, and, find the comment if it's a large, text heavy thread.

{"body":"I think you misunderstand how banning works and how and what shadowbanning is. Mods cannot shadowban users from reddit. Only admins can do that, and their decision making process isn't just to rubber stamp every notification from a mod. At ELI5 we only reported people who were spambots or who admitted to constantly circumventing bans by using new accounts and then taunting us endlessly in modmail about it. We never even get replies from the admins about whether a shadowban has taken place, or whether any other measure was implemented. In that sense, it is out of the mod's hands.		A mod can undo a regular ban on a subreddit, but that isn't a shadowban, and it's the kind of ban that you are very aware of as it actively and vocally blocks you from using the sub.		Now, there *is* a quasi-shadowban than mods can do using the automod bot. Basically you tell the bot to 'shadowban' a user, and the bot will automatically and silently remove all posts made by that user on the subreddit you're moderator for. This functions like a shadowban, but extends to only the one sub that the mod is involved in. I'm on the fence on that one. As a formerly active mod it was a very useful tool for incessant trolls that never said a nice word in their lives. On the other hand, it was a cruel punishment to innocent users if the mod used it inappropriately. I've seen and heard of a few instances in which a mod shadowbanned a user who should have received a regular ban, or even just a warning / temp ban, and I was vocal that this was a shitty thing to do and not conducive to a healthy community/mod relationship.		Should mods be accountable for the "power" they wield? Of course, as should all authority figures. However, you've got to take into account the nature and purpose of reddit. Subs are not your sandboxes to play in freely, they are self-started communities with leaders of their own and rules of their own. When a mod exceeds his purpose and harasses you outside of the sub repeatedly after you've asked them to stop, then that's a violation of the Reddit ToS and you should report them.		>Mods are still users and it makes no sense that admins aren't holding mods to the same rules non-mod users are held to.

{"body":"Firstly, you are making a big, and very telling assumption. I am not referring to the banning of KIA posters by offmychest, I hardly had that incident in mind.  I am not referring to that single incident, but a large stream of separate incidents that point to a problem in the power dynamic between users and moderators in a community.  Users clearly do not have enough tools at hand to take some control of the content they want to see, while moderators have too much power.		While it is often that a person can just "go make another sub", it is more frequent that it is near impossible for a new sub to take off, or to have that subreddit even be able to get attention, as the moderator with the larger community will always have the ability to gain more, and will shut out all other "sister-communities".		I am talking about the taking over of places like /r/xkcd or /r/amd.  The shutting down of /r/askreddit.  The lack of decent moderation in places like /r/atheism and /r/adviceanimals for so very long. 		However, I'll humor your post.		>If you want to be a part of other subs/communities that have banned users from TiA or KiA; then either remove yourself from said toxic subs or quit complaining.		Firstly, on your general attitude about how you should just "remove yourself or stop complaining".	___		You seem to be using the same logic as libertarians here, and your post fails for the same reasons as theirs do.  It turns out that actions have consequences beyond the simple reality you are putting forward, and people actually aren't able to just "change" on a dime to improve their lives or change their mindsets.		People don't just "remove themselves" from "toxic" subs.  People in these "toxic" places are people.  They have honest intentions, they believe they are doing nothing wrong, they have a mindset that is shared among just about every other human being in existence.  Their posting to these subs is not inherently done with some evil intention, hostility, or otherwise.  Their actions, their opinions, are formed by what they have seen in their past, their experiences, and so on.  To label them all with a single brush, to regard all posters to a place as a single, unified, group of harassers or what-not you make a massive mistake that is repeated time and time again through history.		When you just tell people "you should change, stop posting to these subs, stop disagreeing with me, and we will let you speak here" all you do is say "All your experiences, your beliefs, are shit, are invalid, are wrong, and you don't belong with us".  People don't just "remove themselves" from toxic areas, people don't just magically change beliefs.  It requires exposure, and the outright banning of people just because they are part of "toxic" external communities prevents that from happening.		That attitude you have towards the actions similar to those of /r/offmychest, to allow those communities to isolate, to hide away, to attempt to keep out all opposing views like that isn't helping anyone.  It encourages people to stay in a bubble, to stick with those who agree with them, to stay safe, at the expense of understanding one another because "how dare they disagree?!?".		If reddit's goals are to create the most discussion, to expand the views of the most people, reddit should be invested in the idea that all people should be allowed to speak, and speak while being heard.  		___		/r/offmychest specifically is a bit of a different situation, with three main thoughts on it.		1) The subreddit has every right to moderate away views which have taken over and forced other views out.		2) The subreddit has every right to take actions against another community attacking them.		However:		3) The sub, being called /r/offmychest, not /r/offmyfeministchest, does not have the right to push some ideaology or ideal, to outright ban anyone from any community which is against feminst ideals.  No community with a default name of that sort, pretending to be an area for just expressing ideals, should not become an area dedicated to ensuring that "these ideas may not be expressed here".  Not when the vast majority of people wanting to use that sub are not there for that expressed reason.  I don't want to see places like /r/holocaust to become about denial of it.  I do not want to see /r/globalwarming to become about global warming denial.  /r/offmychest should be a subreddit about expressing something you have had pent up, to "vent".  It shouldn't be a sub that selectively denies people the ability to do so.  If it becomes that, then reddit's system has failed, and I do understand that the cases I give are far more extreme and visibly wrong, that's the point of using an example.		4) Many people post to KIA or TIA without really being part of the community, outright banning them is not something that is justifiable as it is the banning of many people who did nothing wrong, having committed no hostile actions.  /r/offmychest may be justified in the outright ban, if it has a legitamate issue with attacks from another sub, and has no way to counter it outside of those bans, but I highly doubt that is the case.","depth":8,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bioemerl","name":"t1_cw38zv7","parent_id":"t1_cw370zh","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445141817,"created_utc":1445113017}

A ban evasion isn't shadowbannable if the original ban was a troll ban.  That said, very few people are claiming to be shadowbanned for having a second account.		People are complaining mostly about posting opinions a mod doesn't like and getting instantly shadowbanned.  The mod doesn't even give them a subreddit ban at all, just jumps straight to the shadowban.		This is why it is obviously that admins are just blindly rubberstamping and approving shadowban requests.

As far as I can tell, not a single mod has ever been booted from reddit for lying to an admin to get someone shadowbanned who didn't deserve it.

Nearly every major sub has policies that are nearly the opposite of this concept though.

Mods remove posts without warning to the poster and then use automod to shadowban the posting users by deleting all comments of theirs in the future. It was mostly by accident that I discovered this happened to be a couple times for completely reasonable posts. 		This practice without transparency of it leads to looking through some threads with the impression with the idea that there is consensus on certain issues when in reality all the people who disagree are just being silenced by moderators. 		If the sub itself embraces a specific political view and will delete/ban anyone who has a different view those subs should be encouraged to spell out those positions in policy somewhere so people know what they are seeing is a VERY moderated version of opinions.		When people go to Foxnews they know they are getting right wing spin, when they go to MSNBC or CNN they know they slant more progressive.

It just so happens that those threads, more often than not, have to do with some ongoing reddit drama, and moderating those threads consequently leads to accusations of moderator bias and censorship. It's certainly something that's exaggerated, or which people misunderstand (whether deliberately or not). When a mod then tries to explain themselves, they're called a liar at best, a shill, or some other derogatory term. Redditors very much have an anarchist streak to them, very libertarian, and I'd almost call them right-wing if it weren't for all the Bernie love (though I have a suspicion that it's not so much for his policies as they're cynical of 'establishment' politicians). So users on the site don't take well to perceived censorship or overzealous moderation.		However, the next question is whether or not reddit should give in to its users demands for more transparency and lack of order, or if the admins should double-down on making it easier for mods to dictate the rules and climates of the subreddits that they run (and if you don't like one subreddit, then start your own).","depth":8,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"AdvocateForLucifer","name":"t1_cw38lo0","parent_id":"t1_cw3892l","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445141114,"created_utc":1445112314}

But with reddit there's flexibility to grow.  If a sub becomes too big, too boring, too neutral, or you don't like what a mod is doing - make your own subreddit or sub to one that you like more.  Then the people who like the original subreddit can stay there and have what they want, and you can go to the new place and have what you want.		Thing is people are incredibly complex, even **twins** are going to have fundamental disagreements about how they view certain aspects of life.  You can't just fit everyone into the same box, reddit allows the natural fragmentation of human preferences to play out on its site.

KIA goes after the media, censorship, the far left, and what they call 'professional victims'. Their opponents say they're hate group bitter that they can't freely be bigots and harass people.

{"body":"If there's one wikipedia article you should be wary of, it's the gamergate one. I've heard the best way to really see how much of a crapshoot it is, is to switch it to a different language and then translate it. You'll find that the international editors are a bit more impartial when it comes to chronicling the massive affair.		Another good alternative to Wikipedia on this topic is (oddly enough) KnowYourMeme. [They've done a pretty good job on reporting what's been such an incredibly polarizing topic.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/gamergate)		Anyways, if you ask for a tl;dr of the whole thing, expect a bunch of different answers. 		Mine is that you have GG complaining about ethical breaches first in gaming journalism, and now pretty much anywhere else that the media and social justice culture intersects. So it's kind of grown into a largely anti-PC movement, ranging from completely unsympathetic to political correctness, to respectful disagreement and an unwillingness to participate.		Opponents of GG (often termed aGG) have countered, accusing GG of being (among other things) misogynistic, and essentially in opposition to much of social justice culture, which centers a lot around political correctness.

{"body":"Honestly, I think at least the way you just explained it that sounds like it is a justified decision. 	Even if the editor of say pc gamer had cancer, I wouldn't expect to see it as news in gaming or games either, as much as I would hope they recover, or obviously in the case of a terminal diagnosis have as little suffering and as much time with lobed ones as possible, it seems to be very much bringing personal stuff which isn't relevant to the subreddit, but the disbanding of an e- sports team is gaming news valid. 		I think that level of personal news would only really suit a gaming news sub if the person was actually making games or was a really really famous historical figure in gaming. 		Of course I can only really react to what you have presented. It could be that the way the actual censorship happened was also recklessly sweeping away valid gaming stuff along with any mentions of total biscuits personal news, which would be bad. 		But honestly, to my mind the justification of him not being a big enough gaming figure to have submissions about his health actually makes perfect sense to me, and I have enjoyed some of his works and appreciate the positive influence people like him have had pushing back against shitty corporate gaming trends. 		Am I missing something gaming censorship wise that you didn't cover, misunderstanding the issues perhaps? 	Or equally if I am not, are you making what seems to me to be a non partisan issue into a bit of unnecessary drama jumping to the "SJW conspiracy censorship" conclusion?

{"body":"I think bestof gets a pass because most of the time its a positive brigade on something already upvoted. So they take a comment that was at +400 and put it at +2000. So, maybe it looks like a sub loves a comment when they really just like it. Not much harm.		The other subs do something different though.   	1) They make posts more downvoted. Like a comment from -10 to -200. This is bad because it hides the comment from view and sometimes limits how often the downvoted user can post. And it eliminates the possibility of the comment getting "rescued" by a change in heart of the sub. Not to mention, high downvote counts just feel shitty.  	2) They change the direction of votes, taking something from a +10 to a -30 or a -5 to a +100. This is probably the worst type of vote manipulation because it's outside users imposing their views on a community they don't belong to. Oh r/conservative doesn't like Bernie Sanders? Well they're going to now! Many communities are created specifically so that users can discuss issues with people in some way similar to them (politically, religiously, philosophically, etc), which brigading undermines.		Brigading in these two ways can be harmful both to communities and individuals. Often good comments either made by a linked user or expressing an opinion different from the brigaders are buried throughout the thread. Sometimes even a linked user's unrelated comments in other subs are downvoted by overzealous witch hunters. 		Now, bestof can be guilty of both of these as well, usually when someone disagrees with the "best of" comment. And when it happens they're actually even worse than the others because of sheer volume of users. But even if it's worse in magnitude, it's lesser in frequency. SRS, SRD, worstof, etc have this problem pretty regularly.		IMO moderators need some kind of read only mode for their sub that can be either forced for all non-subscribers or for all non-approved submitters. This would deny both commenting *and* voting in the sub. As much as I'd enjoy watching the clusterfuck that would result from bestof, SRD, and SRS being banned, I don't think that would be the way to solve the problem.","depth":3,"score":7,"ups":7,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"freet0","name":"t1_cw3pyvo","parent_id":"t1_cw34v32","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445174065,"created_utc":1445145265}

{"body":"Hey Steve,		Honestly, I am going to bring it up. What is up with the front page? I don't know what it was like before, I am not going to pretend that I know it changed or didn't change. I am going to talk about it as it is now. It's slow. Very slow. It rarely updates. Is there a way we can take the frequency that your account visits the front page at and weigh older front page posts according to that time scale so that 30% of the oldest content is gone every time you login? Or better yet take the links that the account visits and remove them into an archive section? I got a few ideas here.		Well I'm a software engineer and I know the answer is yes, you could probably any of those things. You could easily get the time spent on the front page per person and update the page accordingly to drop the older posts off quicker or by visited or such. It wouldn't be "easy" but I can't see it being impossible. It just depends on prioritization. Do you want engineers to work on the front page of the internet or work on something else?		I don't have the answer for you. I know a lot of people would prefer to see the front page change and some people might get scared at not seeing what everyone else sees but I think customized front pages would be worth testing out much like the new algorithm.		Edit for clarification:  	I am not saying it's changed in anyway. I am saying the front page is considered slow to a lot of people. You can change how fast it weighs things down by how much those accounts hit the front page. This is a possible solution that would allow people who visit reddit's front page a lot to see different things each time. Essentially think about how messages on reddit work now. You click a link and the go away. If they have updates, more messages, comments, information, etc they come back. Think of that dynamic system but for the front page for each user.

{"body":"Okay reality check time.		Some of you appear to be confused about some basic facts about reddit, 21st century capitalism, and your role here. Let me clue you in:		1. Reddit is a private business. It's not a non-profit, it's not a government service. Any values it professes exist as part of its branding in an attempt to maximize profitability.		2. You. You are not a consumer. You are a commidity. And not "you" you, you as a number. You're a tick on the counter. You serve one purpose; increasing the number of ad impressions that can be offered to reddit's customer base, the advertisers.		3. Nobody cares if you're happy. Nobody cares if you fuck off to Voat or whatever, because there are tons of new users every day. You will be replaced. You will not be missed. And in fact, you almos t certainly AREN'T going to leave reddit for good. And they know it.		4. Moderators are more valuable to Reddit than you are. They wrangle your bullshit, and they shape the "flavor" of the subreddits.		5. Subreddit culture and nature is intended to appeal to advertisers. They want subreddits that advertisers *want* to associate their brands with. They want a userbase that segments itself into marketable groups. Subreddits that involve demographics that nobody wants to appeal to (racists, redpillers, gamergate) are worthless to advertisers, and thus useless to reddit. (Kidding about gamergate. The fact that you've formed an identity around consumer behavior makes you both easily marketed to. You're gold. Just add 'gol durn SJWs' to a product tagline and BOOM, sales.)		6. SRS is a spooky campfire story reprehensible shits tell each other so they don't have to face the facts that nobody agrees with or likes them. Nothing will be done about SRS because they're honestly not a problem.		**Summary:**	Capitalism. You're a product, marketed to advertisers. The admins will do the bare minimum to placate you, while focusing on the vast vast vast majority who isn't going anywhere, simply because it's more efficient than catering to noisy whiners.		**edit:** I'm being downvoted, but not disagreed with.

{"body":""Is there any chance you guys are ever going to take a look at the 10% rule for self promotion and revise it a bit to make it more fair to creative people who legitimately have something to share to the reddit community? I ask because I know that rule is turning a lot of creative people away from reddit because recently any posts about what they're currently working on tend to get deleted. There's a difference between spamming 100 links to a blog nobody cares about full of ads, and say, an indie game developer who makes 1 game every couple of years and wants to tell people about it and answer questions, but doesnt necessarily want to have to post 10 advice animals in the mean time?	This isn't my main account, its just the one I post on the most because I don't really want reddit posts on my other account showing up in google searches for my name. SO I just use the other one to talk about stuff I'm working on (not spam, one post once in a while and when they don't get deleted for self promotion they get upvoted a lot and people seem to enjoy them and I answer questions and participate in the discussions).

{"body":">all such jerks		Here's a good life tip for you; If you think everyone is a jerk, the problem is really you.		EDIT: Holy shit looked at your profile and you really need a grip on reality. Like every other post is you saying how you'd treat some chick you never met "right" and how you "love" her mind. Jesus you don't even know these women or what they want or if YOU would even like them. This is an example of some new shit going on where guys grow up through their teens jacking off to internet porn never talking to women because it's "difficult" and they don't want to face rejection because they can't be vulnerable. Then in their 20s they become crazy fucking stalkers obsessed with women they hardly know or try to become friends with women that don't want them in hopes it creates a relationship. 		Or maybe you're an amazing troll.","depth":1,"score":11,"ups":11,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"houssc","name":"t1_cw360rx","parent_id":"t1_cw34ux3","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1445136436,"created_utc":1445107636}
