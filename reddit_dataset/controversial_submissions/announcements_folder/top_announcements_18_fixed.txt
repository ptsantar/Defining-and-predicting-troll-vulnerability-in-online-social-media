EDIT: I've talked with the team (who knew more about this) and this is what /u/umbrae had to say:		> This meme has been incredibly hard to kill, but whatever you're perceiving is almost certainly imaginary in terms of change to the site. Software wise, absolutely nothing has changed. There was a short period of time where we [made a change](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3g6ghn/reddit_change_the_scores_of_extremelypopular/) that made the velocity of the front page slower, but we [reverted that weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3inm1c/reddit_change_the_increase_to_the_soft_cap_on/) and all algorithms that determine hotness are exactly as they were. Nothing has changed.		> What's probably happening is that the initial change spawned a bit of a meme and that we're all party to some sort of cognitive bias that is snowballing, even though the change was reverted long ago. It also may be entirely true that the front page *is* too slow, but that it *always has been* too slow, and we're only now noticing it. So we'll look at front page velocity either way.","depth":1,"score":1751,"ups":1751,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mart2d2","name":"t1_cv9jiku","parent_id":"t1_cv9jfa5","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1442903944,"created_utc":1442875144}
{"body":"It seems like there are two types of user - one that checks in once or twice and wants to see what is happening today. For those, the slower updates are good so they don't miss big stuff.

{"body":"Reddit could really use an intelligent bumping system. The lack thereof has always bugged me. The system I always wanted to see would analyse the rate at which new comments get posted, the level of diversity of usernames who comment (to prevent to excessive self bumping), and the word count in a comment (to discourage one word, canned replies). Furthermore the last bit of the algorithm should analyze for copy pasta gags. This algorithm could be used not only to order posts on the front page, but also to order threads within a post. That way, users could be steered to mix of threads could both use more attention and threads that have the most active ongoing dialogue.

Considering Reddit's history with open source, they'll probably use a pre-built search engine. It still requires figuring out server balancing, maintaining interfaces between their current databases and it, and automating updates.		Whether it requires a new team or not also depends on whether they have set up their search code to be modular, i.e. easy to swap with different code.		Regarding code modification, you may have to change the way you index the data to allow for searches to include all attributes, such as usernames, sub-reddits, tags, titles, description, etc.		Edit: according to [this post by a reddit engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/wqx7o/does_reddit_using_amazon_cloud_search/c5fut4i), they're using [Amazon Cloud Search](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/), which should be pretty good.

There are two possibilities.

Or it could be highly conserved genes, in that whatever gene leads to this flavor profile was very important to both hops and cilantro for avoiding predation or reproducing.

(and I will happily go on record that I never bore ill will towards Ellen Pao; she did fine by me) but much of the excellent input from yourself, and from the other admins have frequently fallen under the upvote radar.		I'm very glad that I have the ability to lookup admins by username and read through recent comments.  Doing this, I have often learned pieces of the story that I would have otherwise missed out upon.		Part of me wishes this wasn't the case; that I didn't have to go through the list of big players on Reddit to learn what has been going on; what "official" statements have been made.

As often is the case with these burgeoning online communities, the more time that passes, the more difficult it can become to outsiders to understand and become aware of the political details involved.  This can risk closing off the community, which is contrary to the ideals of social networking.		I hate to be one to just point out problems without offering solutions; but I don't know if I have terribly good solutions.  I don't know if I'm such a major demographic, but I suppose I would like to see a centralized place, that regularly tracks the activity of these sort of accounts, and gives an account of what details have been revealed. And then have that place well advertised to users, while at the same time not coming off as spammy and propaganda; just a neutral accounting of what's new.

I really think it's true, though.		I work in software, so I could hazard a guess.  Comments refer to a "parent" comment and so, in order to preserve referential integrity, you wouldn't be able to just delete a parent comment (otherwise, all those children underneath it would refer to a parent that doesn't exist; they would be orphaned).  So, one way to handle this would be to add a column to the database table- something like "IsDeleted".  Then, when you delete a comment, it just sets this value to "True" for the comment you're deleting.  But that means the comment is still there.  It's just that the interface doesn't show it on the screen for comments that have IsDeleted = True.  Furthermore, once it is flagged as deleted, you, the author, have no interface to get back to it and edit it.  Because of all this, when I want to delete a comment, I first edit the text to be a single period and THEN I click delete.  That way, I know that the single period is sitting in the "CommentText" column for the row that I've marked as deleted rather than the original text.

We're using Hadoop for log ingestion (EMR), which gives us some data around requests to the site and tracking pixels for things like page-views.  Our hadoop jobs read/write to/from S3, and we have a Hive warehouse built on top of this data.  A bunch of Hive queries are run periodically (hourly, daily, etc) against this data to do ETL to build reporting tables (all dependencies managed via Azkaban, though I just found out about [pinball](https://github.com/pinterest/pinball) and it looks pretty sweet).  We have a few dashboards and reports on those reporting tables so we can get nice summaries about things that matter.		We've also recently put up a streaming pipeline, built primarily on Kafka.  Events hit an endpoint, which ships them to the Kafka cluster.  We're operating on a single cluster right now (plus one for testing), though that may change to separate functional clusters at some point.		A number of Kafka consumers (managed by Mesos and Marathon) ingest data from the cluster, transform it to an appropriate format, then dump it off to S3 in a very similar way to Pinterest's Secor tool.  The format and location output to allows our existing Hive warehouse to pick up the new data, and bring it into the same ETL pipeline we use from the batch ingest data.		Currently, we're playing around a bit with Spark, and we'll have that in there in production at some point when we have the time to properly integrate it.  Storm is also an option for some of what we'd like to do, but I've had some issues with it in the past, and have heard a number of anecdotal stories about problems with it.  I love the _idea_, but it may not work for us down the line.  We'll have to see.		All in all, it's a very barebones system right now, but we have huge plans for it all.  I love finding new systems and tools and figuring out which fit nicely into our future plans and infra, though with only one engineer working in the area, there's a very limited amount of bandwidth available.  We've found a few really nice third-party tools and vendors who build some awesome stuff in the surrounding area to take some of the systems maintenance load off, allowing us to expand our systems more quickly, but there still some integration work to do there.		*edit: I'm always happy to talk data and answer any questions I can!","depth":1,"score":154,"ups":154,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Kaitaan","name":"t1_cv9m1em","parent_id":"t1_cv9krl9","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1442908282,"created_utc":1442879482}

{"body":"It is 'unlimited', but I think the implied caveat there is that you actually have to still be able to do your job.  If you take 364 days off in a year, we probably won't keep you around as an employee.  But as long as you're doing your job (and doing it well), why bother to count how much time off you take? 		I've taken 3-4 weeks in the last year.  Much of that was vacation I'd booked before even accepting the job here, but nobody gives me any shit for taking vacations.

{"body":"Haha, just a simple joke. I can actually offer some insight into the role. I've been a CTO for hire for a number of years (for 3-4 companies depending on how we count them) and I've run two companies of my own (one consulting and the other an accelerator-funded SAAS company). As well, the 10 years I've spent on Reddit should give you some idea of my advance and crippling age.		In short: there are many ways to be a successful CTO. It all depends on your strengths, your style as a leader, and your working relationships with the CEO and other CxOs. 		The key thing to consider is that you're not focussed solely on the technology anymore because you now have three audiences: your department, your customers, and your CEO. Each (rightfully) has their own demands and it's up to you what approach you take to prioritize between them (as an exercise between now and when you start, really think about how you'll do that).		Regardless of what you're focussing on at any one time, maintaining the long-view and not becoming too focussed on any one thing is critical. Your release milestones are stepping stones that are part of the bigger picture and it's your job to make sure those are aligned. There's a best-practice in aviation of scanning the instrument panel to give you an overall view of where you're at and where you're headed so that you don't become fixated on any one aspect or distracted by the view out the window(s). Your instrument panel as a CTO includes the company objectives as directed by the CEO, the key performance metrics, and last but not least the performance metrics of your infrastructure. The panel doesn't exist yet? Then you lead the charge to build it.		There is a long road of challenges ahead and what those challenges are depends on when you join. In the beginning you're focussed a lot on getting the product off the ground, then moves into growing the team, organizing the people and processes, then -- in no particular order -- budgeting, resolving scaling issues, talking to partners, identifying efficiencies, advancing the product, speaking at conferences etc etc. When you find yourself spending more then 50% of your time doing any one thing, then you hire for it. But it's important that you do it yourself first so you know what to look for. Don't have the budget? Make a case for it and get it done.			tl;dr Keep your three audiences happy (department, customers, and CEO), maintain the long-view, know what, when, and who to hire. Oh, and enjoy the shit out the experience!		Ping me any time if you have questions, now or even after you start.

The beta program (specifically, the [reddit.com beta program](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/wiki/index)) isn't really a separate team - it's just an avenue for us to test certain features out before we release them to everyone. The best way to keep up with what's going on with the beta program is to subscribe to r/beta. We did recently beta-test [color-coded modmail, which shipped today](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3lusfx/moderators_colorcoded_modmail/), but most of our recent features have been more mod/community focused, which don't make as much sense for an individual beta program.

Right because all tasks are 100% parallelizable and you never need to tune your architecture or servers. /Sarcasm		This is why people like me exist.  People lie to pretend that the physical world doesn't exist and is infinitely capable.  You follow this philosophy you end up like the reddit team, overworked and unable to deal with all the complex race conditions and failure modes building your app in AWS brings to you at scale.   AWS is good for small or transient apps that wouldn't show up as a rounding error on a budget for a respectably large IT dept.   Reliability Engineering starts at reliability, then consistency and then speed.   To be reliable, you need consistency at the physical level and thats where you start.  		What you describe is what happens when automation engineers try to be architects and infrastructure engineers.  But if what you were saying is true, reddit would already be the most stable site ever because they could just spin up more nodes. This is not the case.  		Time and time again, I have had AWS/VPS developers try and replicate what I can do in private, they have all failed miserably every time.  Yet I have always been able to improve performance and reduce costs with dedicated typically by 300%.  Always cost overruns with these people, while my apps stay on course.  Its absurd and a ridiculous propostion as I mentioned above that you can even compare a VPC with a 10 GBE.  You can't compare a VPS with a Dedicated server.  the costing numbers are like 6 to 1 in favor of dedicated.","depth":2,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SweetIrony","name":"t1_cvagc2u","parent_id":"t1_cvab46k","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1442975397,"created_utc":1442946597}

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.		>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.		>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.		On the other hand, Linus Torvalds himself has stated his preference for Linux:	>Well, I think it's justified, but it's justified if you actually make a GNU distribution of Linux ... the same way that I think that "Red Hat Linux" is fine, or "SuSE Linux" or "Debian Linux", because if you actually make your own distribution of Linux, you get to name the thing, but calling Linux in general "GNU Linux" I think is just ridiculous.

{"body":"I'm glad to hear you're improving the ads system.  Reddit must cost a crapton of money to run.  Possibly even a metric crapton.  I was just thinking about the financial viability of Reddit the other night.  Here's what I came up with, for what it might be worth.			We all know advertising doesn't work on the internet.  So... it's time to change the game.  Now what's a game changer in advertising?  Well, the internet's "seen it all" right?  Ah yeah, they've seen popups, popunders, sideline ads, headline ads, and adblock takes care of it all.  None of that is new - or old.  I'd estimate the average age of the redditor to be mid 20's, maybe late 20's.  What they haven't seen is what happened before us.  Go back just 10-20 years and look at Paul Harvey.  Heck of a guy - and one of the last to utilize "inline ads."  Even as a kid I couldn't help but to respect him.  Did I buy a Wahl shaver?  You betcha.			This isn't a new idea.  It's an old one.  Use respect and honesty and somehow come up with a plan that works in the modern era.  If just going that far back doesn't work, go back further.  Look for ideas from the hundred years of commercial broadcast and find a new way of making money for the site we all love.  I'd say for the most part the users of reddit have the expectation of honesty from the site, and to a lesser degree, have respect for what you're trying to do.  			Whatever your plan is, I hope it works.  Are you in a position to extrapolate on the advertising plan just yet?","depth":0,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JohnCub","name":"t1_cv9k7ge","parent_id":"t3_3lv3qo","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1442905114,"created_utc":1442876314}

{"body":"Hey JohnCub,		What you're describing it basically what the ad industry calls 'native ads'. Reddit was actually one of the first companies to run true native ads, with the launch of our Sponsored Headlines. They actually perform pretty well for blending into the content. 		There are a number of things that larger advertisers have come to expect before they will buy a campaign from you. Such as viewability metrics (how long was my ad viewed for on average, etc.), and integrations to help advertisers know if they are getting an ROI on their ad spend. So there's a lot of catch-up work that needs to be done before we can truly innovate.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"ryanmerket","name":"t1_cv9l4m7","parent_id":"t1_cv9k7ge","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1442906700,"created_utc":1442877900}
{"body":"Glad to hear you guys are thinking about these alternatives.  I don't know much about ads - but I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, you might have missed what I was saying.  Here's how it plays out in my head:			There are reddit superstars.  I believe there's one by the username of editing_and_layout or something like that - he/she makes really cool gifs.  I'm going to use him/her as an example.  There are many others in the subreddits we could use but that's one I can think of that might be the "Paul Harvey" of my example.				Reddit Ad admin:  Hi, editing_and_layout, we're looking at doing something new.  We at reddit are looking to do something new.  We'd like to know what program you recommend to make such great graphics, work with the creators, and have a custom flair on your username that might help people discover their program.  In the end it would be an ad for sure but if you ever decide to stop supporting that product or the ad agreement, we'll go ahead and take it down.  For this right we'd pay you $x (or however the payment works out)  Your username would then look like: editing_and_layout ^custom ^flair-(I ^prefer ^$program)			Editing_and_Layout:  Well, that sounds ok, I use (some program) and would be happy to work with you on this.  (you know, or not - each individual would do whatever.)			So yeah, it would be some overhead, and I'm not sure how it would work in the end.  But it wouldn't have to stop with users.  Subreddits themselves could be involved.  Maybe work out a deal (exclusive or not) within subreddits that work in a similar manner.  Going with the graphics / gif idea, contact the admins of one of those related subreddits and inquire about a "this subreddit recommends" part of the sidebar that include the programs that might be helpful to participate.			It's all just ideas.  Hopefully they're of some use.  People don't want to be marketed to - me either.
