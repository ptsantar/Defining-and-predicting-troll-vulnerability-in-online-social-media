{"body":"The issue here, yet again, is one of transparency and communication.  As you've said several times, Reddit is a user-driven platform; the users are the site's resource - you as employees don't supply content for users to consume, users supply it for themselves, and essentially vote to manipulate what other users see, creating a fairly democratic system of content.  In an ideal world, such a model would require no administrator intervention, or indeed, administrators, because content is directed by the users.  Obviously almost nobody thinks that's realistic, but for any platform which is driven purely by user interaction, executive administrative decisions which impact on users must be weighed carefully because, more than in other models, such decisions risk appearing heavy handed, or worse dubiously motivated when the rationale behind them isn't immediately obvious.		This has happened time and time again.  Often rationale is perfectly legitimate, but users (who ultimately ARE the website) have to all but guess what it could be.  This absence of transparency is especially bad for a user-driven model; Reddit provides a platform, and gives users the tools to dictate what they wish to see more or less of, and these things should, in theory, do almost all of the work for you.  Of course, such a system will never be enough by itself, but when it isn't, and when moderator, or more importantly administrator interaction is required, it must be possible for users to understand the rationale behind decisions, otherwise this stops being a user-driven platform, and ultimately users become disillusioned and stop being users.		What's probably needed is application of a quality procedure to these decisions.  At the moment, administrator intervention feels arbitrary; inconsistent.  The rationale for large decisions isn't obvious, and usually seems to require a painful period of attempting to draw administrators into passing comment to understand what the hell happened and why.  Ask anyone even remotely business savvy whether that's good process and they'll look at you in horror; this isn't how management should run anywhere.  If you get down to it, you'll probably find that your users are reasonable people (well, mostly) - actually explain decisions up front, make dissemination a part of the process of taking large-scale administrative action, and I guarantee you'll see a far, far happier userbase when these sorts of decisions are necessary.		To put it bluntly, Reddit is not the most technically brilliant user-driven web platform of the modern day.  It isn't the most advanced, or the most intuitive to use.  It is still the best, however, and that's entirely because it maintains a preponderance of users compared with competitors.  The internet is a fickle thing, though, and we've all seen poor management or failure to adapt result in boycotts or mass migration over the years.  I'm sure I don't need to explain the potential consequences of users losing faith in administrative decisions.  No matter how legitimate your reasoning for making decisions, without transparency, users will draw their own conclusions, and as this episode demonstrates, it'll almost always be for the worse.","depth":2,"score":66,"ups":66,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Timmeh7","name":"t1_ckbj6dx","parent_id":"t1_ckbhi0a","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410123724,"created_utc":1410094924}

And before this is answered with the typical "well, reddit users can do what they want" I'd point out that the *admins* in the past have effectively encouraged vote brigading congress and the FTC/FCC over internet-related issues (such as SOPA/CISPA). In fact, I believe they're about to do it again this Friday over net neutrality. Imagine how they'd feel if next Friday the FCC says "any comments we receive from users that came from reddit or any other site taking part in the planned protest will be ignored".		Seems kind of hypocritical.		And note, vote brigading != vote manipulation (making fake accounts to vote multiple times). The latter is obviously bad and should be stopped.

{"body":"> but of cheating on him with various higher ups in the gaming journalism field, who all in turn had glowing things to say of Zoe.		I don't think this synopsis is quite accurate, and confuses cause and effect.  It's not primarily an issue of cheating; most of the alleged hook-ups (I can't even believe I'm bothering myself to be concerned over this) occurred outside the context of a relationship, so it was just her having some fun, as is her right.  God knows if you publicly examined everything I've been up to in the past year it'd paint a pretty similar story.  Oh, and the timing was off, such that some of the favorable mentions came before her hook-ups with them, so you can't really accuse her of sleeping around for good reviews.		What bothers me is why this is such a huge deal.  I haven't played Depression Quest but I did look at some gameplay video on YouTube and it's very obvious that it's not a game that appeals to me at all.  This isn't some case of a big media company buying off lots of reviews on a borderline AAA title like with Kane N Lynch.  Depression Quest is a *free* game that quite transparently doesn't appeal to the vast majority of gamers anyway.  Who cares?

{"body":"Reddit has improved it's stability, features(gold stuff mostly) and front page to list a few things. If you're referring to things like that, I completely agree.		How is Reddit getting worse and worse then? Corruption and accountability. Zoe fiasco is the biggest thing in my opinion. Blatant shadowbanning for no reason(only admins can shadowban) and banning related subreddits. No real reason for any of that given yet. Some weak excuses which in no way explain most of the actions admin(s) have done.		Then there is this fappening and jailbait cases which are not that of a big deals if Reddit admins just came straight and said "It costs too much to remove all infringing material and keep up with DMCAs. We also don't like to entertain the idea of getting sued, even though we aren't doing anything illegal ourselves".		Then there is the issue with subs. One can make a sub and then it's all his.

When the fucked up subreddits draw attention, who decides to ban them? The admins? Because then you're giving them power they don't want; dictation of what opinions are allowed. The users? But what if a subreddit you want banned is something I want kept? And if you're gonna go down the "ban the obviously offensive subreddits" road, I'm just going to tell you militant vegans exist. Take a look at /r/tumblrinaction for the types of things that people can get offended over. 		Don't get me wrong, I think those subreddits are fucking heinous and should be banned, but try and look at it from /u/alienth's point of view. He's in a very precarious situation. If he bans them then he has to ban everything people complain about, and then put up with the complaints from them being banned. People *still* complain that /r/jailbait was banned because it was only sexually *suggestive*, not straight up porn. Me and you both think /r/picsofdeadkids is foul, but I'm sure there's a few people who look at it out of some sort of morbid curiosty, and if we're gonna ban that, then why not ban /r/morbidreality, a completely innocent subreddit built on the notion of curiosity.","depth":5,"score":29,"ups":29,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"UnholyDemigod","name":"t1_ckbh9le","parent_id":"t1_ckbgmvs","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410113447,"created_utc":1410084647}

As such, the personal information rule is not something we find to be applicable to this incident. This is a tad extreme, but I imagine if we applied it to images the same way we applied it to personal information, we wouldn't allow anyone to post any potentially private image of themselves anywhere on reddit.","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"alienth","name":"t1_ckbiobs","parent_id":"t1_ckbijol","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410121537,"created_utc":1410092737}
{"body":"Thanks for the reply. I appreciate the openness in breaking down the situation. But I think this is going to be a pretty long road to recovery for reddit. But I find that response to be slightly lacking.		The consequences of leaked images expand vastly into "real life" and as such people deserve the right to protection. This isn't limited to the recent leaks, Reddit is very much caught up in the whole idea of revenge porn, and I believe it's definitely worth looking into drafting a new rule or set of rules determining the verification of permission to post especially in the case of sexually explicit content. It won't sink /r/gonewild or whatever if they're going to keep strict about requiring verification posts and cracking down on probable unauthorised sharing.		Also, if someone posting an image specifically verifies the *real name* of the celebrity, the fact the photo was leaked, and those photos are known to be leaked based on a statement from the celebrity's PR themselves, does that not already cross your threshold for personal information? It permits harassment and harm to them "in real life".

There would be a lot of difficult problems to solve if you were to change your policy (what topics should be banned, what are the rules and guidelines and conditions...), but so far that discussion, if you've had it internally, hasn't been made public.

The *only* people that can do anything about the content, practically speaking, is the Reddit administration team.		But they're refusing to do so, *and* they're not giving a cogent explanation for why. The blog post tries to offer an explanation, but it's not really that clear. For example:		> ...we deplore the theft of these images and we do not condone their widespread distribution.		But they *did* condone them, by the very definition of the word.		> Actions which are morally objectionable or otherwise inappropriate we choose to influence by exhortation, emphasizing positive examples, or by selectively highlighting good content and good actions.		This *does not work*. r/thefappening should be the clearest example to date that this is a failed strategy.

If they are unhappy with the service they are selling, then why not change it?		You rightly point out that censorship can be a slippery slope. Maybe it always has to be, I'm not sure. But, censorship is not at all a new idea for online forums -- it's just usually referred to as moderation. Every forum does it, *to protect the integrity of the forum*. Moderators are already a central part of subreddits (which is peculiar for a site whose administration seems to be saying that they want complete free speech above all else). I don't see any reason to believe that Reddit will fall apart if it does start censoring some of the nastiest content on the site.

{"body":"Above all these inconsistencies, in general it's not possible for institutions to be neutral on moral issues. Even the landmark Massachusetts marriage equality ruling statement from the chief justice acknowledged that rules (or laws) always endorse or condone certain behavior and morals, and thus the moral debate can't be ignored or abstracted from. (Even though the liberal or libertarian might argue that it should be.) In that case, the point was that changing the law was not a neutral act but would in fact affirm the moral worth of gay relationships. (Personally I have no problem with that, but it does acknowledge the moral issue for those who might.) The ruling and expansion of the definition of marriage under the law was made on other grounds, choice and autonomy, but also, and mainly, on what the meaning and purpose of the institution of marriage is. It's challenging to think about, and absolutely correct once you (whoever reads this, if anyone) get your head around it. 		So what is the purpose and meaning of a digital platform or community like this? That's the first discussion that needs to be had, and not by a loud minority. Comment threads here make it appear that the overwhelming majority of users have had it with the excessively abusive, illegal and threatening content on this site, as well as the site turning a blind eye, and thus condoning it. The criminal act in question today, and others that have occurred on this site, are moral and ethical issues that can not be abstracted from. The institution (corporation) cannot be "neutral."		Reddit Inc. says that: *"Virtuous behavior is only virtuous if it is not arrived at by compulsion. This is a central idea of the community we are trying to create."*		I would argue that that is inherently vague and not at all the purpose of this platform, or the central idea, as most users see it. The majority of users are petitioning for additional policies to be set in place. It also discounts socio-cultural and social psychology findings about environment, incentives, attitude and behavior.		Three more thoughts:	Abusing the original spirit of the DMCA allows corporations to pass the buck to the user while banking off illegal content and the degradation of civic spaces. That's why there has been such a push to update the law. Some of these discussions will be tough, but we've got to be having them instead of not having them at all, as we have been.		Freedom of speech has always had thoughtful exceptions that are in the public interest (slander and other false statements, obscenity, incitement, threats, IP) and many private organizations have taken basic steps that allow for rapid response or prevent horrific abuses against their visitors, or those made by their visitors, especially when they occur on a daily basis.		To be glib, the previous statement posted earlier read as out of touch and seemed to suffer from delusions of grandeur, if that's the right term. Reddit Inc. is not comparable to the government in the way that matters most, which should be obvious in the first because no one voted for employees or even the unpaid volunteer mods. Furthermore, it seems that if users *could* vote-in the employees, they'd be voting for the ones that shut down abusive subreddits and that did not shrink from moral debate that, as we are seeing live in these threads, cannot be abstracted from. In the west we do not have "hands off" governing or governments, nor governments or governors we did not vote for.		Addtionally this line, *"we choose to influence by exhortation, emphasizing positive examples[. . .] For example, this includes our selection of subreddits which populate on our default front page, subreddits we highlight in blog posts, and subreddits we promote via other media channels"* is sadly laughable. Abusive, sexist content makes its way to front page daily and is upvoted, and that's just one ongoing example. So again here we have Reddit Inc. making choices about what is morally acceptable. 		The political philosophies proposed in the original blog are in conflict, and that's very confusing. It aims to persuade with libertarianism and a dash of liberal Kant, but these philosophies don't align, and regardless Reddit adheres to neither of them (if it adhered to libertarianism, it probably wouldn't exist because its market place was not attained legally due to copyright infringement and otherwise). Furthermore neither of those of philosophies are complete, workable philosophies on their own. Libertarians here might assume that all users will be able to abstract from who they are, their personal narratives and failings, and act market rationally in the way Reddit suggests, while playing by the rules to achieve their place. Meanwhile Kant (or Rawls) would assume that users could abstract from who they are and thus, without being coerced, choose the best rules for themselves, and via that method those would also happen be the best rules for all people, all done with proper intentions, for the right reasons. As much as I do like most parts of Kant and Rawls et al, obviously that's not happening or else this thread would not exist. I recognize that they do not work alone for the same basic reason that libertarianism (a philosophy I don't find compelling at all) isn't complete. Not everyone is capable or willing to abstract in those ways in order to achieve a shared vision of the good life.		Virtue is most famously the realm of Aristotle, who would, to go back to my original point, look to define the purpose of this institution, and then see how it should operate. But if Reddit Inc. sees its point as cultivating virtue (Aristotle's belief was that that was the point of government), then, again, it's obvious that the cultivating of virtue has failed, or isn't up to the level it should, or could be -- surely people here are not getting what they deserve -- and therefore changes in policy should be made. And yes that will, in the doing, also mean Reddit Inc. changing its moral stance.		This is all aside from socio-cultural and social psychology studies that address ways of making change in positive social behavior. Reddit Inc. could use that information and take a scientific angle on setting new policies.		tldr: it's not possible for Reddit Inc. to be "neutral." They have endorsed moral stances in the past, for an obvious example: lobbying users to get involved in acts related to legislation and public policy.","depth":1,"score":26,"ups":26,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"J_Sto","name":"t1_ckbhkld","parent_id":"t1_ckbg7rp","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410115297,"created_utc":1410086497}

The subreddit wasn't for posting deals, I created it as a direct response when /r/gaming banned games giveaways.

Deal with it at the last possible moment (like /r/jailbait) once there's bad press forcing you to do so. Then you play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it doesn't set a precedent. It is **identical** to what always happens.		[Here is the blog post](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/) from when you banned /r/jailbait. Note the exact same thing. "We've decided that it's time for a change" that happens to coincide with [Anderson Cooper doing a story about it on CNN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities#.2Fr.2Fjailbait). 		To be clear, I understand *why* you're doing it. I understand that a lot of companies do the same which is **totally fine**. Just don't then make a blog post about how wonderful free speech is. If the blog post said "We actually wanted to keep allowing them but got too many notices from lawyers for that to work so we had to ban them" that would be *fine* by me. The doublepseak and hypocrisy is what's annoying me. You can't take the moral highground on this when you've let /r/photoplunder stay open for however long it has.		This is just what happens when your stance is that anything goes. If you allow subreddits devoted to sex with dogs, **of course** people will be outraged when you take down pictures of naked celebrities. It would be impossible for that to not seem capricious. If you allow subreddits like /r/niggers, **of course** they're going to be assholes who gang up to brigade. The fine users of /r/jailbait are sharing kiddy porn? What a **shocking** revelation. The point is, you can't let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall. Stand up for standards for a change. Actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be. You'll piss off some people but who cares? They're the shitty people you don't want anyway.

To that I say, with posts that have titles such as "Only cure for panic attacks" and "I decorated" it will cause people to take comfort in this sort of escape and continue to hurt themselves.

"Wow, this is really disgusting! But I bet that I can cum to it if I try hard enough." It's almost like adrenaline junkies, you start out just riding your bike really quickly down a hill and before you know it you're jumping out of air planes, off cliffs, or squirrel suit diving- always looking for the next, bigger thrill. Your brain is constantly searching for those chemical swings. With gore porn, it's almost the same thing. You started out in high school putting your AIM away message as a link to tubgirl or meatspin to prank your friends (and don't lie- we all did it), and now as a 20-something you secretly jerk off to decapitations or A Serbian Film. Because the tame stuff just doesn't do it for you.		I sort of think it's the nature of the internet. We have access to everything so long as you know where to look and because of that our morals and social norms are constantly being pushed, expanded, and in certain cases exploited. And it's creating a lot of secretly fucked up individuals. Because there's obviously a demand for that sort of thing, it's becoming more common place, and because it's so taboo it becomes a bigger turn on, and because it becomes a bigger turn on it becomes a deeper secret. On and on and on. 		I'm not saying that the people who are aroused by those things are bad people, I'm sure for a lot of them it's a source of shame. But now I'm left wondering- if we didn't hide away these images, would people be so intrigued by them?

Things like pedophilia and necrophilia are out of people's control (if the internet had influence on this, they'd be flooding the streets), usually they're born that way and they've always been around. It has to be extremely hard to be attracted to young children or fantasize about corpses when the whole of society tells you it's wrong. That's also why prosecuting and excluding these people isn't helping society to protect itself from them, it only makes matters worse afaic as it allows them to go underground and they could be more likely to act out on their urges.

Once again, the point that people are missing is that as far as we know, the normal people that are being exploited aren't sending in DMCA takedown notices to Reddit, and if they are, the posts are taken down, no problem. Usually if a post gets deleted by an admin/mod a user either doesn't care enough/doesn't want to reupload the photo in question The thing that happened with /r/theFappening is that there were so many people who had access to and an interest in the leaked photos, that people kept reuploading the photos, including the ones with underage subjects, and the only way to stop it would be to either freeze the posts on the sub (and still leave all the violating pictures up, which doesn't make sense) or to ban the sub entierely. And that's what they did.		> They cannot be bothered to whack the mole unless the request comes on legal letterhead.		Refer to /u/alienth's expression of Reddit's justification for this:		>Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we try to keep our hands off.		The whole point is that unless it *does* come on legal letterhead, reddit admins wouldn't know if something *actually* crosses a line (posts an explicit photo without the subject's permission), or if a couple is just posting it together. Obviously, this is a weird example, but the only one I could think of to do with this specific topic. You can refer to any number of arguments people have made about the consequences of admins arbitrarily and unilaterally removing content; unless they know officially it's illegal, they won't take it down.

We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat.

The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the site rules, but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us.

{"body":"In an interview recently conducted with an ex Reddit moderator, details have emerged that suggests initial speculation on content manipulation within Reddit.com for the purpose of profit for 3rd parties to be not only true, but common place in practice among certain members of its moderation team.		Although the source of these accusations has declined to comment on specific cases of such behaviour, IndieJuice has been informed that content manipulation for 3rd party profit is part of a much larger issue within Reddit’s internal posting and user relationship structure. The extent to which is currently unknown.	Original allegations of content manipulation arose from members of Reddit’s own community as part of an online controversy surrounding allegations of nepotism within the video game industry.		Such allegations were dismissed by a member of Reddit’s administration team as the work of another online community, in an attempt to discredit a known games developer, as well as embroil their associates in a sex scandal, by method of an ‘internet raid’.		Given new light on the matter, such claims are only partially valid.	While an attempt was made by an alternative online community to influence specific content on Reddit.com, the practice of content manipulation is itself an issue that has been common place on specific subreddits by members of their own moderation team.		IndieJuice’s source on this matter has suggested that moderators on particular subreddits have engaged in the practice of content manipulation to unfairly benefit specific websites, as well as platform favourable discussion for a 3rd party, at the price of ‘luxuries’. All of which remains unknown to the subreddit’s subscribers.		Though the source was unwilling to provide specific instances of such behaviour, examples were given.	Trading ‘content flair’ and an ‘ask me anything’, for particular users, was ‘standard’ in a ‘favour for favour’ trade. Though the purpose might vary for a moderator accepting such a request, it was implied that such trades are made at an equal benefit for both parties involved.		The implication of such evidence in the case of pre-existing questions of nepotism raises further concern for the question of corruption within the video game industry.	Current discussion on the matter has only ever suggested at the existence of such corruption and has, as such, been limited to possibility.		The form of corruption suggested by IndieJuice’s source is extensive. It is also very particular, in that it extends itself far beyond normal questions of ethical conduct and acceptable practice.		Though IndieJuice is unable to mention further specifics that implicate members of Reddit’s administration team in general, informal, misconduct despite the interview revealing as much, what may be said is that specific moderators are involved in the original controversy of ethical press coverage itself.		The scale of this entire issue has yet to make itself known, though the source did hint at the fact that major video game news sites, and members of their associated press, might also be involved; or at the very least, specific well-known individuals acting of their own accord.		Though the original controversy raised on Reddit focused specifically on a game developer, recent events have caused the entire ethic of journalism within the video game industry to come into question.	This also includes quality of content and the nature of favourable reviews in the instance of pre-existing relationships.		Reaction to this issue has been mixed, by those both within the scope of controversy, and those beyond.	What may be said is that it is no longer an issue of ‘misogynists’ on the loose in social media, but of the ability of those whom wish to express themselves being able to do so safely.

However, in this very extreme circumstance without precedent, a questionable subreddit was BREAKING the freaking site for everyone, so we had no choice but to ban it."		This is reasonable to me, but people love finding conspiracy where there is none and crying oppression/censorship when that's not really what's going on. Since when did reddit become "the man?" We all love this site for its freedom, and it's largely because of the work of the site creators and admins that we've been able to create that culture. Can we not lend them a little credence when they try to explain their actions?

A subreddit got banned in order to protect the site as a whole. Had reddit not banned it they would have had to continue allocating more resources to policing it, which surely would have sparked more outrage as to why effort was being spent on allowing people to keep endlessly mirroring stolen photos. They made a reasonable call they had to make and chose the lesser of two evils. No one's trying to censor or oppress anyone. It's still reddit. Grow up and deal with it. 		To the top commenters who are trying to discredit a justified explanation by calling out other subreddits they don't like: So you want an open platform, but when a forum begins to break the foundation of that platform in a way that would harm the experience for everyone, you think that should be allowed to continue?

The only content reddit "hosts" is a bunch of text and links. All images and other content is hosted on third-party servers. It's up to each subreddit's mods to determine from there. That's my understanding of how reddit is supposed to work.		I have no skin in this game regarding any of these issues that you guys are banning subreddits and stuff for. Hell, I think this latest scandal is....well, yeah I'll save that for some other time.		Anyways, my point is you guys are doing yourselves a disservice by censoring content. You drive people away. You're not solving the root problem, which is stuff on third-party sites. Victims of crap like nude pictures should be going to the source instead of where these things are posted.		If you want to be truly open, neutral, and transparent, the only time you would ever ban anything or anyone is for doxing or crap against your rules that is HOSTED on your site. Individual subreddit mods should be policing their own crap. If a subreddit has popped up because of a scandal, go to the source.		Blatantly banning stuff like this just creates copycats and makes way more work for yourself. You can't be open and trasnparent and yet ban subreddits and users for stuff hosted on third-party sites. It's the third-party's site that is responsible for following the law.		I'm not a lawyer, but that's how I see the way this place should work.		However, if you guys want to please corporate overlords and bend to advertisers every demand, then that's fine by me. You just can't call yourself open and transparent. It also comes down to what you guys are trying to be.		But the easy way out is just to ban these subreddits and still attempt to call yourselves open and transparent. The more honorable way would be to post a warning for users like you do on 18+ stuff and then attempt to notify third-party websites of the content. You could ban LINKS to those sites with "illegal" content.		Otherwise, taking the easy way and banning these things like whack-a-mole when crap hits the fan will just only further create more backlash and you'll start losing trust of users who would never remotely go to these subreddits but value this place because it's (up until recently) been very open and accessible).

{"body":"I am a big proponent of the idea that all ideas and subreddits should be allowed to exist. Do I wanna spend time on some of the more vile or hateful material?

There is the risk in some people's minds that the nastier bits will spill over and ruin the rest, but just by existing on the internet you run that risk, and I am of the more optimistic opinion that the more loving and educated content could spill into those subs and maybe change someones mind.		Even if that is an impossible dream though, reddit to me represents the natural evolution of the world wide web. Rather than simply organizing the internet by pages of similar types of media (ala youtube, and imgur) it is organized based on ideas with any outlet, (video, audio, text, etc.) possible being used to comment on and add to those ideas. Since reddit really is the best home to that organization of content, I just prefer it not censor ideas and let them live or die on their own.		Controlling the front page of r/all is one thing, and I can understand why you wouldn't want thefappening to dominate the front page as the wrong content could actively drive new users away, but once I find or think of a subreddit I want to subscribe to I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be allowed to do that.

Last year it got to the point that I felt ashamed to be a fellow programmer after reading a particular disgusting comment thread on Hacker News and that made me ask around a bit what other programmers' stance is on Hacker News and everyone I talked to agreed that the community is unhelpful, rude and snarky, so much so that the people I talked to either don't go there anymore at all or just go there for the links but ignore the comments like I do.		Your mileage might vary of course, some people strive in an atmosphere like that. In the end, you should make up your own mind. But do keep in mind that if you happen to find the comments as appalling as I do, not all developers are like that, there are lots of people who are friendly and enjoy helping fellow programmers, people who are open to new ideas and reinventing the wheel when the wheel sucks, you just won't find a lot of them on Hacker News.

It was messy, and continues to be. 		For those at Reddit HQ who disagreed with allowing the photos to exist, I imagine living with the decisions that were made was quite difficult.  It's possible some people were very much against this policy, some perhaps made themselves unavailable for the duration of this cleanup effort.  		Who knows, maybe some of their best IT people got 'sick', went home, and stayed home because of this decision.  I have no personal insight into this, but it's possible.  People make stands for principle all the time.  And perhaps Reddit's IT dept. was hamstrung as a result and they were forced to take more drastic measures than would have normally been necessary.		People are reacting to this photo hacking event with every possible emotion across the spectrum; some acting like it's Christmas, some acting like this is the worst possible blow for personal privacy and everything inbetween.  It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest to hear that employees at Reddit went home 'sick' when they found out their bosses didn't just ban the photos outright on day one.		Now, had the photo leak been something like clandestine photos of John Boehner doing lines of coke with Vladimir Putin off the belly of an albino crocodile...

No matter how vigilant the mods or how quickly they remove offending content, according to this precedent the sub should now be banned.		Malicious links are in the same boat. Just put out warnings across the subreddit and deal with them as they turn up. If it gets so bad that you must do something, disable hyperlinks and put safe hyperlinks in the sub sidebar. But really when people click untrusted links they get what they deserve.		Last I heard, high traffic was a good thing for a website. I wonder what the ad revenue was like over the last week or so. I find it hard to believe that the demand is so consistently ferocious that reddit has effectively been DDoSed for days. That might happen initially when the news first broke, but not for this long. The solution is either to ride it out if it's a short-term surge, or use the increased revenue from ads and gold to up capacity if the traffic increase seems stable.

First thing that should be talked about is the Zoe Quin event. 25000 deleted comments and nothing posted to talk about it. What? 		Zoe quin was a controversial topic and i can understand getting rid of people who where saying hurtful and painful things about her BUT this doesn't mean that you can just delete pages worth of info about her and what people think of the fiasco. that's just constructive criticism. I'm guessing the excuses used here will be that it was all spam but it wasn't.		Communicating with your community is the most important part of keeping this site alive. you are trying to do this here but when Zoe Quin happened you stayed silent unless messaged and still you didn't say much there.		as for "the fappening"  i found the fact that there was a blog post about freedom of speech and not a message when the /r/fappening was accessed to be a little silly. explaining why you took it off there would of been a huge clarification for anyone who wanted to access the site.		i also think that stopping all image/site links would of been a good idea so that people could still talk about it but not share the profanity would of been good so that people could share their ideas and information on the topic (which is the main point of Reddit).		i still have more to say but i have an appointment. please ask questions and if the Reddit admins/mods want to ask me anything or talk the comment and DON'T PRIVATE MESSAGE ME. everyone needs to hear your thought processes and how you are working through this.		thanks		The Gamer #373		Edit 1: that was alot quicker than i thought it was going to be. back to ranting		now I personally don't like the fact that celeb nudes where leaked or that people took advantage of this. iI want to make sure everyone knows that i am biased in what i say as is everyone and you should try to form your own oppinion on what you see and believe in		the handling of the fappening was in my position, fine. you took down the sub because it was causing harm to users and the server. also this prevented people from getting hit with malware from shady download sites and other such things. this is also why removing thumbnails wouldn't work. there would still be a problem that is incredibly hard to deal with.		the only problem here is communication. in so many relationships communication is what makes or breaks everything. Reddits admins/mods (i'm unsure if i should be addressing mods here so im including them non the less) need to tell us what they are doing and why. this happens on most subs but Zoe Quin and the fappening(this needs another name or it wont be taken seriously) where different. these occurrence saw large scale removal of content without context or reason. this leads to distrust which leads to the relationship breaking. new sites will come and replace you so the main person you are hurting are yourselves. you have two opptions from here on out		TL;DR for the lazy/time restricted		1: continue with sloppy communication and suspicious behavior and shady occurrences and suffer a loss of users and supporters.		2:start telling us what you are doing and why so we can work through crisis's with you. we are here for you, you are still our site and we will do whatever it takes to keep you pure and running		a similar occurrence is happening on another site that i frequent called Hugelol. the site recently banned a large number of its old users because of stupid behavior, of course this wasn't told to people and everyone thought that it was happening in spite of the old users. now there is a new site being crowd funded to replace it.		thanks for reading/TL;DRing and have a nice day		The Gamer #373","depth":0,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thegamer373","name":"t1_ckbhbf5","parent_id":"t3_2fpdax","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410113760,"created_utc":1410084960}

{"body":"> Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!		> A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).		Then shouldn't you refund the money? If someone is paying to essentially 'tip' a person online for a post that they enjoyed and the administrators delete the comment, shouldn't that person get their money back, as it has essentially now served no purpose other than to go into your own holdings? I agree that it shouldn't be sent to a charity that may go against the gold-buyers wishes, but what's worse than that, I think, is for you to hold on to it.		Otherwise, I mostly agree with the comments that say that reddit doesn't care about the moral implications of having private nude pictures on the website, as much as it cares about the media reaction. Reddit is a site riddled with racism, sexism, homophobia, pedophilia, gore, necrophilia, and more. Trying to position yourself as being 'in the moral right' seems a meaningless statement when subreddits like /r/niggers and /r/WatchPeopleDie are still allowed to operate and upload links to your servers.		I understand reddit's aim to bring users censor-free content to appease their demand, but you have to be consistent with it. 4chan reached a similar crossroads in its development: it was forced to either change /b/ to include less offensive material, or allow it to go effectively unmonitored, and chose the latter, because it espoused moot and 4chan's view in allowing *all* information to be free, even if said information was a detriment to society. I won't say if I agree with 4chan's path, nor that I disagree with the way reddit has handled the situation, but I will say that reddit can't take both paths in this situation without sacrificing its consistency: either you weed out all the other detrimental subreddits and clean this website up, or you let *everything* be legitimate content.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hippiechan","name":"t1_ckbzjsf","parent_id":"t3_2fpdax","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410159792,"created_utc":1410130992}

To do otherwise is extremely hypocritical. You should not profit from what you refuse to allow. 		I will not be making any gold purchases (which I have done in the past) until Reddit does this or something similar (or, someone points out something that I feel absolves them such as a large charitable donation in the past).		This should be easy enough to do because you must track which comments gold was purchased in relation to and so should easily be able to determine which subreddit those comments are in and whether or not it was banned. As you say, the amounts are small so, it won't harm you significantly either. 		You should leave the person whose comment was gilded with the gold because, it could well have been a comment that was criticising the subreddit/post for exactly the reasons you banned the subreddit and, getting into arguments about the meaning of comments is tricky so, just let them all keep the gold privileges to avoid these arguments.

I stated as much. Everyone is hypocritical about things in their life, big and small.

Fortunately, given the multiple [Modes of Persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion), your statement is not true.

A quick look reveals a lot of posts along a theme of "good", "ethics", "morality" and some higher standard you are fighting for. What defines this? A holy text? Some murky concept of social justice?

"Thumbnails are automatically grabbed and hosted on reddit's servers, making those thumbnails subject to a legal DMCA takedown.

Where applicable, the reddit admins complied with these DMCA takedowns, and where not applicable they responded to the issuing entity that the actual takedown notice should be going to Imgur since that's where the images were being hosted.

People were so intent on sharing these images that they kept sprouting up despite numerous warnings and attempts to stop, so in the interest of not being charged with federal felonies, the admins decided to nuke the hub of activity from orbit and let people find somewhere else to share their child porn.

The problem with an open concept website is always going to be marred if the owners have something to lose. Think about your "freedom of speech" from a Constitutional standpoint, as long as it doesn't contain slander. Sure you have the right to say something but the Constitution doesn't uphold you being "right." Now try to apply that to an online website where slander become "liable" and it gives the ever money hungry lawyers out there, "evidence" to submit to the courts. Now the media gets hold of it, Reddit and 4chan are the scourge of the internet (as being reported) the moral majority bring their pitchforks and the DCMA's roll in. 		Will another website/platform arise out of the ashes because of the Fappening? 4chan survives because of anonymity, Reddit at then end of the day has a Board of Directors. Do we as a community on Reddit keep lighting up the front page and attacking the mods and admins of the site, or just let it go until the next shiny is dangled in our face and the community acts as it always has with the arrows to the left.		I personally don't like Reddit getting thrown under the bus because of the Fappening, but the reality is, we as a whole knew it was coming, it was discussed days before the post made it to the site. Those who wanted to participate did, but with anything in life there are consequences that go further than the instant gratification most were seeking. On the whole you take the good with the bad, you avoid  subs that personally offend you, but human nature is always going to be fascinated by the forbidden, the odd and bizarre and on Reddit Jlaws nudes.		I hope you don't leave nxnnx, because we need to weather through this, and keep Reddit what it is, a sometime wonderful, trolling, entertaining and omg wtf was that site, who will band together one day, and step on your neck the next, with a dedicated group of admins and mods to suss through it all. /speech. ;-)","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"witqueen","name":"t1_ckbi5qm","parent_id":"t1_ckbhwlw","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410118878,"created_utc":1410090078}

You have no rights on reddit, except those specifically outlined in contract.  Terms of use can and will be changed at the owner's whim.		Please don't act like reddit is a bastion for anything, and especially don't act like it is something that should be saved.  It is not up to you what reddit does.  If you do not feel that they are living up to your expectations of a neutral platform or whatever brought you here, then purchase a major interest in thr company or use another platform.  This isn't a "If you don't like Murica, why don't you just geeeidouut?!"  This is about your right to choose how you interact on the Internet.  Your only real fundamental right, here, is the right not to partake.		I have never had illusions about what reddit is, and every time one of these comes around, I notice how many people utterly depend on it or feel that they are owed something.  You are owed nothing.  Keep that in mind when leveling criticism.  Don't hold this relationship to any other standard than that of a business relationship.  At the end of the day, unless you are throwing some serious money around, or can guilt-trip or market-pressure someone in the company to make moves on your behalf, you have no power.		Like I said "deal with it".  Reddit relies on its users for revenue.  You can go elsewhere and not give them your business.  You can flock en masse to another outlet.

Individual victims of the stolen photos?  Not entirely sure really- there have been so many random 'leaks' it's hard to keep up.. From what I was reading on Reddit a big chunk of the photos leaked were from one guy who was involved with multiple women (I could be wrong).  I'm also unaware of how many of said celebrities have actually contacted Reddit via legal counsel to have their photos removed; all I've been reading about is JLAW.  The main reason these celebrities were given notice that their photos were leaked is because.. they're celebrities.  They are 'public figures' held under a microscope.  Most of their lives are the entertainment of others.  Of course when something happens that pertains to them it's going to eventually make the news, especially the seriousness of this case.  It is quite possible that the women found on other subreddits may not even be aware that their photos have been posted without their knowledge because they are not in the same 'media capacity' as said celebrities and may not use reddit or have even heard about Reddit (I know quite a few people in the latter category lol).  Keep in mind everything I'm saying are more hypothetical than anything, which would make realistic solutions almost impossible to police fully.  There is so much technology out there, and I may be naive saying this, but surely there are methods to ensure that someone who posts a photo is really that person?			> So then we move on to the idea that there could be a volunteer system where people step up to help moderate reddit.

Moderation systems are nice, but it's clearly lacking or does not have totally set rules across the board (based on the examples of subreddits that people have been posting, as well as what I have personally seen in the /r/creepyPMs subreddit).  I say use post-bar lawyers/lawyers in general simply because they can reflect that they see on the subreddits and apply that to laws already in place.  AT THE VERY LEAST come up with guidelines or something for every subreddit that is created, and ensure that the owners/managers of said subreddit is adhering to those guideline.  Evaluation/audit of each subreddit can be implemented and every complaint looked after and find out why there were complaints made or if they are even valid.  Again, these may be in place already, or they might sound far-fetched but I'd rather give some ideas than to just sit and complain.		> A business owner has to ensure that everyone has equal access, not that everyone has equal outcomes.

There's no way that we can evaluate the situation unless there is actual proof that women/men have been made victim to invasion of privacy.. But why doesn't Reddit make a blog post relating to this.. ask if anyone who has been a victim of this or knows of someone who has been victim come forward and speak to them?  Again they get an arbitrator on their behalf and sort the mess out.  Then they'll have proof that it's not just celebrities who fall victim.  So many different scenarios that can come to mind.  They can have an 'internal meeting' and sort out the details.		I love the dialogue we are having on the topic, rather than the simple 'fuck you reddit'.

Most of the major points have already been covered, but I'd like to share my thoughts on the following excerpt:	 	> We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.	 	Wonderful sentiments, but not at all relevant. Or even true. 	 	First, see also /r/lolicons and drown in your hypocrisy. 	 	Second, you've essentially slapped the label of "pedophile" on anyone who looked at these photos. That's similar to labeling all Muslims as terrorists or all cops as fascists. 	 	It's o.k. to say, *'Some of the pictures included younger actresses. These photos were taken when the actress was under the age of 18, which could be construed as child pornography in some places.'* It's not o.k. to accuse millions of people of being complicit in distributing child porn - because that's not what happened. 		It's o.k. to say, *'A combination of heavy traffic which brought down the servers and legal pressure from these celebrities' lawyers were the major factors in our decision to remove the pictures.'* It's not o.k. to say,*'This content was disgusting, so we took it down.'* The latter is disingenuous - and, while removing content is the prerogative of you and your team, it's a slippery slope. The reddit community (your customer base) did not grow to number in the millions because of censorship. Free and open exchange of ideas and content is the lifeblood of this site.

[**AACS encryption key controversy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg#AACS_encryption_key_controversy) of article  [**Digg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg): [](#sfw) 		---		>On May 1, 2007, an article appeared on Digg's homepage that contained the [encryption key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_key) for the [AACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System) [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) protection of [HD DVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_DVD) and [Blu-ray Disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc). Then Digg, "acting on the advice of its lawyers," removed posting submissions about the secret number from its database and banned several users for submitting it. The removals were seen by many Digg users as a capitulation to corporate interests and an assault on free speech.  A statement by [Jay Adelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Adelson) attributed the article's take-down to an attempt to comply with [cease and desist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist) letters from the [Advanced Access Content System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System) consortium and cited Digg's [Terms of Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use) as justification for taking down the article.  Although some users defended Digg's actions,    as a whole the community staged a widespread revolt with numerous articles and comments being made using the encryption key.   The scope of the user response was so great that one of the Digg users referred to it as a "digital [Boston Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)".  The response was also directly responsible for Digg reversing the policy and stating: "But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, you've made it clear. You'd rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company. We hear you, and effective immediately we won't delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be." 		>		---		^Interesting: [^Dalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalet) ^| [^Brogaig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogaig) ^| [^Taye ^Diggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taye_Diggs) ^| [^Charles ^Diggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Diggs) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckbgkxs) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ckbgkxs)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","depth":1,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autowikibot","name":"t1_ckbgkxs","parent_id":"t1_ckbgkup","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410109286,"created_utc":1410080486}

That's a different story entirely. Thumbnails of CP has nothing to do with DMCA and everything to do with laws against CP.

Here's what I have a problem with.			>We remove what we're required to remove by law, **and what violates any rules which we have set forth.** 		Yes, I suppose I take exception to those rules. Or rather, their permissiveness to foster hategroups and other content which can have disastrous results. I refuse to link those subs, as so many others do, because I frankly don't want a hand in their proliferation but suffice it to say that after following someone else's link in utter disbelief, I found a sub that should certain demographics of young teens visit I can only imagine a few suicides would result. I don't find it funny and I don't think this game of morality where we pretend it's all about free speech trumps reality. We don't enjoy free speech on moderated forums. While reddit can and does ban people, it is generally done at the subreddit level. But either way, you can be banned for anything the mods dislike whatsoever and your free speech is obviously not guaranteed. So why should these rules suddenly in this instance bend to self-policing, free will, free speech? Because it sounds lofty? As you pointed out when you asked how we might feel if a loved one had their naked photos posted, I ask you how you'd feel if someone you loved killed themselves because of the disgusting hatred found *on your website*?		It sounds nice to say it's up to the community and that we are "as neutral a platform as possible, [that lets] the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them" but we are *all* responsible for actions, or any ill that comes of our *inaction* as well. That goes for Reddit as a whole as well.		Like any private club, you can admit whom you like and ban whom you like but if you want Reddit to be a place of which you can be proud then take greater pride in making sure it is not a haven for hatred instead of taking too much pride in its neutrality. You make those rules you mentioned. You also obey the law but you didnt write the law -but you did write the rules. Reddit can operate however you wish it to, your hands are not tied in this. Which is why I take exception to it. You are choosing neutrality over compassion, novelty over safety. Please, get rid of the fappening nonsense and absolutely refuse to allow underage nudity etc -and try to find the empathy to get rid of the other horrific subs we neither need nor want attached to our good name. 		**EDIT**		Thanks to whomever for downvoting me for having an opinion but I know Alienth will read his inbox, such as it is. But you see that, Alienth? Reddit downvotes and upvotes -and I notice you too have a lot of downvotes.

{"body":"TL;DR: "We took down the subreddits on DMCA and legal grounds; and though some of us at Reddit find it morally unconscionable, our own morality was not the reason for the subreddits being banned."		I can respect that. It would have been nice had the information been a little more forthcoming, rather than allow speculation to get out of control.		As for people bringing up other subreddits with questionable content, the line has to be drawn somewhere, and that line is when Reddit itself is directly in legal crosshairs. That's an understandable place to draw that line without disturbing the delicate balance of things.		Now, personally, I think there's other things to talk about with regards to The Fappening. If McKayla was underage (which EXIF data in the photos apparently refutes), wouldn't she be open to charges of manufacturing child porn, and possibly even distribution? If the photos had been bought by TMZ for the alleged six-figure payday to the leakers, and then found their way online "through proper/conventional channels," would there be this uproar? I feel like the photos would have been click-bait on every celebrity gossip site within the hour. The hypocrisy in the media over this is ridiculous. Some of the sites with the loudest mouths condemning the leak pedal the same wares every other day of the week - but now it's an unfathomable disgrace? Sure, it's a violation of privacy ...a violation that our celebrity-obsessed culture has been willing to ignore forever. I'll step off the soapbox, but this whole situation is ass-backwards.

{"body":"/u/alienth - thank you.  It's easy for community members to forget that reddit is a website run by **PEOPLE**.  Any major change in the traffic of reddit, the **PEOPLE** who run the site must make changes to accommodate the new performance requirements.  Reddit has to take action when copyrighted or certain illegal material is posted.  No matter how small that action may seem at first glance, in high quantities, these responsive actions become all consuming, creating instability for the whole.		On another note - I'd venture a guess that the overwhelming majority of the voices dissentiong over the take down of /r/thefappening are individuals who either personally posted, viewed, or intended to view the content of the now-banned subreddits.  My personal judgement on the issue aside, I can't help but point to the 4chan effect at work here (anonymity serving as a vehicle for actions that would otherwise be socially unacceptable).  If you're mad that you can't go to reddit and find the leaked pics, you are either ignorant of how to use the internet, abhorrently lazy, or unreasonable to the point of irrelevance.  		Seriously? You have to rage at reddit for taking down a sub that was putting their product at risk?  #1 rule in business is survival.  The Whack-a-Mole /u/alienth described is legally mandated.  They don't have a choice whether to comply or not (non-compliance would have resulted in fines, collapsing of the business).  The statutes were in conflict with individual users' desires to post the content, and it pitted the few reddit employees against the many anonymous posters.

{"body":"I've never seen a community so butt hurt about something. I wish people would stop arguing that there are "worse things on reddit" and that reddit is taking a moral stance that they don't actually believe. Reddit did what it had to do to remain legally afloat, and child porn is explicitly banned from this website, and they handled the constant DMCA notices the best they could. From what I can tell of the situation, the community won't admit that anything they were doing (constantly making subreddits to host pictures that were not supposed to be on reddit for a variety of reasons) was wrong. Child porn is wrong, and posting content that is legally owned by someone without their consent is wrong, but instead of addressing that, the community just argues that there are worse things (in their opinion) on reddit. When it comes down to it, it doesn't matter if there are worse things on reddit because the subreddit bans weren't about those "worse things". Stick to the actual issue at hand instead of trying to invalidate the reddit mod's stance in this issue with other arguments that do not apply. Ultimately, everyone needs to understand that while reddit tries it's best to remain impartial, there are certain things that shouldn't be on the front page of the internet. Is someone going to honestly tell me that they can't go get their porn fix somewhere else? And if your porn fix requires illegal pornography or needs to be comprised of stolen pictures of people for you to get off, I don't think I'm the only one who wouldn't mind if you left the website like people are threatening too.

{"body":"> The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following: These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occuring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the site rules[7] , but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.		Admins, I think your response was understandable and you reacted the best you could.

{"body":"**Please read this fully before downvoting me.**	I've been a lurker for many years, and I've only just recently made an account just compete in a gaming contest. And to me, as an *outsider* so to speak, this is ridiculous. Nobody seems to understand that Reddit has to follow the same laws as we do. And as a company and "community managers" they have even more responsibility to follow the law. If they're given all these DMCA requests, and daily I imagine after all the different uploads, then unfortunately they'll have to do so. *I know it's disgusting that **Photo Plunder** still exists which is in fact worse as people target individuals, and **anon.ib** or whatever it's called which is known to have a small community who target teenage girls on SnapChat to try and get nudes from them.* But unfortunately they don't have huge lawyers and much attention from outside of Reddit.  This is why Reddit allows them to go on, because they *support freedom of speech, and a free to express community.* If you want these to be removed, the best thing to do is probably get these subreddits lots of attention in the press, eventually meaning Reddit will have to remove them. But then we're backto square one meaning Reddit is no longer about our freedom....    		Now, in my understanding Reddit could have asked the mods at **thefappening** to make all posts self posts, therefore not containing the thumbnails Reddit apparently was DMCAd over. (If this is wrong, I'm sorry) So maybe not the best way to go about this situation by just removing the subreddits.    		Also, if we all support internet privacy then surely **WE'RE** the hypocrites for supporting stolen leaked photos. At least Reddit has stayed linear about what they believe all the time.   		Now, this is my opinion here, but I believe Reddit had all this backlash due to one moderator from **thefappening..** When all this was going off, he did an AMA about his time running this subreddit, all his comments were "boofuckinghoo look at me my subreddit has gone down, upvote me for details." He constantly was like "well, the admins are not getting back in touch with me, I want to carry on been part of reddit history." Honestly I think his constant flood of new fappening based subreddits and all the attention he rose on the topic made this worse. Let's be honest. Once we've all seen the celebs how many would go back to thefappening? These leaks weren't going to carry on forever and Reddit already has hundreds of subreddits dedicated to celebs and their exposed nudity. So I believe fappening was going to die out anyway and I honestly didn't think many people would care. But no, this one moderator had to keep on *bitching* about, making out this situation was him vs Reddit, instead of the celebs exposed photos.    		I don't know; this has been silly and I hope everybody goes on with their days and forgets about this. If you're truly upset about this, there is /r/offmychest for you to rant and /r/needafriend if you're lonely and want to talk about how bad Reddit is for making this choice.","depth":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":true,"author":"Orzih","name":"t1_ckbhslr","parent_id":"t3_2fpdax","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410116709,"created_utc":1410087909}

{"body":">A: We take down what we're required to be law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.		[I responded to yishan about this in the other thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/ckb7hsm?context=3) Here is what I said:		I don't think thumbnails are really even an issue after doing some reading. Multiple court cases have set precedent for thumbnails being fair use.		>Fair use. A search engine’s practice of creating small reproductions (“thumbnails”) of images and placing them on its own website (known as “inlining”) did not undermine the potential market for the sale or licensing of those images. Important factors: The thumbnails were much smaller and of much poorer quality than the original photos and served to help the public access the images by indexing them. (Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 336 F.3d. 811 (9th Cir. 2003).)		-	 	>Fair use. It was a fair use, not an infringement, to reproduce Grateful Dead concert posters within a book. Important factors: The Second Circuit focused on the fact that the posters were reduced to thumbnail size and reproduced within the context of a timeline. (Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006).)		-		>Fair use. A Google search engine infringed a subscription-only website (featuring nude models) by reproducing thumbnails. Important factors: The court of appeals aligned this case with Kelly v. Arriba-Soft (above), which also permitted thumbnails under fair use principles. (Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon. com, Inc., 508 F. 3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007).)		Thought this was interesting/related a bit too:		>In 2008, a district court ruled that prior to requesting a takedown notice, a copyright owner must consider the likelihood of a claim of fair use. In that case, Universal Music issued a takedown notice for a video of a child dancing to the song, “Let’s Go Crazy,” by Prince. The owner of the video claimed that since Universal didn’t consider the issue of fair use, Universal could have not had a “good faith belief” they were entitled to a takedown. Faced with this novel issue a district court agreed that the failure to consider fair use when sending a DMCA notice could give rise to a claim of failing to act in good faith. (Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 572 F. Supp 2d 1150 (N.D. Cal. 2008).)

{"body":"Just to let you know... I think you folks did fine. Banning a sub because it generates too many DCMA requests for the staff to handle is the sensible and correct solution. Reddit runs pretty lean and a massive surge in DCMA requests is a significant logistical problem.		Reddit's free speech policy is also just fine. As I see it it's pretty much anything goes until/unless problems arise. Whether the problems are detected because folks are clicking the "report" link, or because of wider publicity, is pretty much immaterial to me. 		Obviously reddit is a business and it it takes significant revenue to operate. Bad publicity will reduce the amount of revenue available, and if severe enough this would result in layoffs and possibly closing the site. This means that anything that generates a ton of bad publicity is going to get addressed (banned, rule changes, etc). Jailbait, creepshots, thefappening (and whatever sub is next) wrote their own obituary just by the nature of their content and the publicity surrounding their subs. Folks who don't understand this need to start their own businesses and learn this the hard way.		Some concrete suggestions:		1. Implement a hard "absolutely no thumbnails captured or stored" capability. Either as an admin setting or as a mod setting.	2. Implement a "DMCA flood" temporary ban admin setting for subs. The "temporary ban" page could explain that your receiving too many DMCA requests related to the sub and that the sub is offline until the situation is resolved (and by resolved I guess I mean "delete all posts within such and such a period" or permanently banning the sub... the choices at that point are pretty limitted). You could also use this message space to explain to people that they are being dicks (though maybe run this part by marketing and see if they can tart it up a bit).	3. If you want to mess with folks (i.e. this is half in jest) implement a "ban a sub" voting scheme. If 50% + 1 redditors who visited the site in the prior 30 days since a vote was called, vote to ban a sub then down it comes. You could even require a 1% of the monthly average of the number of active redditors to sign a petition to nominate a sub for a ban vote. After a failed vote the sub can't be nominated for a ban vote for the following 6 months. Hook this up with some easy advertising and it could even generate revenue (eg. like buying gold a redditor could spend $20 advertising their position on a specific petition or ban vote).		I think the team handled this pretty well. My daily redditing was not impacted in the least by any of this mess.		Don't let the haters get you down.

If somebody has broken into your house, stolen all the nude photos of your wife, and then set them up on placards on the street, then any media company can, and should, choose not to distribute images of that content.		As for a subreddit dedicated to pictures of dead children - revolting.  I've never seen it before tonight, and the fact that it even has 2500+ subcribers is sad, but the pictures themselves aren't illegal, they're not stolen.  Are they immoral?  Maybe in some people's mind, but that's irrelevant.  The pics of the celebrities on the other hand - stolen property.  It's a no brainer for Reddit Admins - it's stolen property hosted on another site linked to Reddit, it's deplorable, we don't want it here - goodbye.		Yet we have mods that have somehow become mods on subs such as r/Worldnews, who have been given the power to remove real news that the community overwhelmingly votes up as news on a regular basis, day in and day out, and not a peep is made about it.  This is what is making Reddit suck.  This farming out of what should be Admin jobs, to 15 year old boys who believe that it's their duty to delete posts that are rising to number one on a news sub because - well, it's opinion / analysis, not news (and it's also critical of the United States, or Israel, or it glorifies Putin, but I'll ban it because it 'analysis').		This is the thing Admins - do your job.  The celebrity pics are illegal - keep them off your site.  Allow volunteer mods to remove them based on specific criteria if you wish.

Please don't project how you feel, assume everyone feels the same way, while at the same time trying to use this as evidence "we" are hypocrites.  More on this later.		>We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.		This seems a round about way of calling anyone on /r/thefappening as child pornography peddlers.		From what I had seen on there was there was a discussion whether or not the images were of a celebrity who was 17 at the time (after people saw them and started doing some detective work).  Some stated just to delete them just in case, others reasoned they weren't because if they were the celebrity in question would be guilty of child pornography and the feds would soon be arresting her.  Eventually /r/TheFappening was closed for a bit and when it came back up the mods said they were CP according to lawyers and most people seemed to go and delete the images to be on the safe side.  Even though it was confusing because publicly the person in question was denying it was them, so if it wasn't them then it wasn't CP?  Regardless, most comments I saw it didn't matter if someone claimed there were, they didn't want anything to do with them because of the hefty legal ramifications and social stigma should they be underage images.		However, legally, there seems to be some confusion as to what is or is not child porn.  If there are any experienced lawyers in this field that want to correct me feel free, but this is based on my last reading of case law in school.  Firstly, CP isn't illegal in the US simply because of the image, the image itself is considered free speech.  It is illegal because of the exploitation and abuse of minors that accompanies production of CP.  Secondly just because a minor is nude in an image, it does not mean it is CP.  I can't seem to remember the case or find the wiki for it, but there is an album cover of a nude 16 year old female.  It was deemed by the courts not to CP because the image was not deemed "sexual in nature".  Similar to pictures parents take of children playing in the bath or a video of a kid who just so happens to be streaking without a diaper.  These in themselves, according to the court, are not CP.		Now it is obvious to most of us that should Reddit get a notice of CP regardless of what the legal criteria is for CP, it would and should take it down.  Reddit admins aren't in a place to be qualified to determine what is or is not CP, only that it follows the law.  However, what was said in the quoted doesn't seem to just be about following the law, but calling out anyone who was on /r/TheFappening in a disingenuous manner.		>The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following: These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occuring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the site rules, but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.		As others have pointed out, simply disabling thumbnails would have prevented DMCAs no?  On top of this, and maybe I am ignorant to how moderation or admin functions on this site, but from what I have seen stated in /r/TheFappening is the posts were set to "approve by mod only".  To my understanding the only way new posts were put on /r/TheFappening was if one of the mods read through the content, checked if it followed Reddit site-wide rules, then put it up.  The last time I was there there were very few new posts because of this.		So between these (if accurate and true), your claim of needing to play "whack-a-mole" is false.  And generally I have the rule that one should not contribute conspiracy when stupidity can better attributed to stupidity.  It seems in my estimation, perhaps others, that either you knew these things and choose to ignore them, from bias stemming by your own admission of how this subject made you feel.  Or you didn't know and a poor informed choice.  There could be other reason, but based on what you have said thus far this is what I see.  Feel free to set the record.		What this comes down to is irresponsibility and a double standard for certain classes of people.  I for one, would not feel grief or anger if someone I knew had their pictures they wanted to keep private on the internet, because they were irresponsible and reckless to take them in the first place.  We live in a digital age, we are constantly photographed, tracked, listened to, recorded, cataloged, and databased by private, corporate, and government.  Am I outraged by this fact?  Sure I am.  We should all be secure in our persons, places, and things - but this is not the world we live in.  It is not news that your phone can be hacked and your pictures stolen.  It has happened dozens of times to well known celebrities.		It was an illegal act for the images to be taken and their privacy violated, that really isn't under question.  But I am not going to feel sorry for someone who engages in naive reckless behavior, regardless if they are well known or someone close to me.		TL;DR What this seems to come down to is those in charge of Reddit felt bad and didn't have the fortitude to stand their ground on what they claim to believe in, who gave into pressure, and play mental gymnastics to justify what they have done.  Given the history shown in the comments seems to be on par for this sites management.

I'm sure mostly all of us can agree that rape promotion, pictures of animal cruelty, dead children, and worse are terrible things we'd all like to see expunged/censored/eliminated/etc. The problem is when things start getting censored then things/quotes taken completely out of context can be twisted to make arguments for why posts, users, or entire subreddits should be censored.		An example of this is  r/theredpill I know many people hate that sub, feel it's overly misogynistic and people have even levied the criticism that it promotes rape. I am not a poster there, but I do read it. I do not agree with every piece of advice they espouse, but there is also a considerable amount of truth mixed in that many men/women would prefer not to have to face. 		This isn't the time or place to get into the merits of that subreddit, I am merely citing it as an example of a sub that many would like to see gone, but not truly guilty of objective immorality. 		Again, I merely caution that starting censorship beyond what legally is required is a slippery slope best avoided, not to mention the potential for abuse that it creates.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"omegadeity","name":"t1_ckca57h","parent_id":"t1_ckc8oic","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1410186597,"created_utc":1410157797}

Sabotage, is what I'm getting at.		Rather than making phone calls, sending paperwork, waiting on email replies for days at a time, how much easier would it be for a lawyer (or anyone else) to just create a few new accounts, maybe get some other people on board to do the same thing, then start sharing links of underage girls or other types of bannable content?

Banning thumbnails instead of banning entire subs would be a great show of respect and service for users here.  		2. Besides the thumbnails, it looks like they banned /r/TheFappening for CP.

I have a major problem with giving them unfettered access to pornographic (and violent) material which would normally be restricted to those under 18. And there is plenty of it to go around it seems.

Also, it seems like there continues to be what looks like to be underage girls who like to post pictures to /r/gonewild. Why is there no age verification to be able to post there?		I always thought that this was reddit's greatest weakness. Especially considering that Facebook has been able to control these things on their website. It clearly is an issue legally as well - should an attorney general find that any of those girls who are posting images on here are in fact underage. It surprises me that there has been no legal action.		But in the light of recent events, I can't help but wonder if reddit's system of control (or lack thereof) will come under increasing scrutiny. I would hope that reddit can take care of things properly (like instigating age verification for some of the subreddits).
