Advice: apply a machine learning classifier to separate herp-derp from actual substantial posts. Then give us the curated feed. You could call this feature "-herpderp" and would work by adding "-herpderp" to the URL of any subreddit. Ideally, it would curate the comments too, not just the subreddit feed.		I could do it myself but I don't want to implement a feature off-site.
