Subscriptions, however, allow you to budget for the long term, you can measure attrition rates, you can measure growth rates, you can keep trends, you can plan based on subscription end dates, etc.  All of this is vitally important for budgeting, especially since they are looking to hire and since employees add a hell of a lot to the overhead they need to get on a model that is fairly easy to trend and does not have a lot of peaks and troughs.  This also, which I am not saying they are doing, allows them to seek financing after they have enough historical data.

{"body":"I hardly think that a subscription is necessarily a beginning of a paywall and furthermore I am guessing Conde Nast has very little to do with this initiative.  Reddit admins are wanting to be able to better serve the community **as a whole** and to do that they need money. 		Frankly the user base for Reddit is a not very profitable one in regards to an advertising model, IMHO.  Not knowing the politics of Conde Nast and how it relates with its subsidiaries I won't venture to guess at whether they did this with or without the blessing of Conde Nast.  They may have retained full decision making power in the buyout, it is hard to say.		You have to look at it from the perspective of what is the Reddit user base.  From my experience over the last 3-4 years it is primarily technically savvy, educated, 18-30 years old males who are very anti corporation.  A large subset of this group is still in college and lacking disposable income.  Another large subset of the group is technically savvy enough to have installed adblock and is not truly interested in seeing web advertising even if they disable adblock, if they were Reddit could implement CPC advertising as well.  This demographic really limits what advertisers will be willing to advertise on Reddit in the first place. It isn't always about the page views it is the likelihood that the demographic will actually complete an ad view and subsequently make a purchase.		Of course there are advertisers out there that are simply looking for name recognition and are willing to pay CPM but most affiliate marketers and smaller advertising companies are looking to pay CPC or very low CPM rates because it is all about conversion ratios to them.  Simply put if they don't see the return there isn't a point to continue advertising on Reddit.  Furthermore Reddit has dedicated very little page real estate to advertising as per the demands of their user base which further lowers their advertisers chances of conversion.  Think about it, I am down here in the comments and I don't see a single ad, I have to be at the very top of the page pretty much to even be exposed to any ad space.		Everyone can bitch and complain about ads but Reddit is about as non intrusive as you can get.  Reddit has decreased its possible advertising sources by going to a CPM model, but they surely did that because they are aware of what I just told you that CPC and their user base don't really mix very well.  Frankly Redditors just don't want ads but they want premium service.

Once again a small subset of the demographic.  What products do you suggest beyond Reddit themed products?		>Limited geolocating and too focused on subreddits.		Geolocating is great, but you don't have the demographic data.  You can use IP address lookups but that can be clunky and slow in implementation.  We, as users, don't provide any information to Reddit about ourselves so to target, which is what advertising is ALL ABOUT, you have to focus on sub reddits to hopefully appeal to the demographic that you are aiming for.		>They need to fix their ad system so advertisers can advertise the way they want.		If advertisers could advertise the way that they wanted Reddit would be dead.  Advertisers want to target by age, gender, location, and interests a la Facebook advertising.  You have seen the blow back Facebook has had due to their privacy concerns, part of the appeal to so many Reddit users is the entire lack of information you have to provide to become a member.		>It's as simple as that.		You seemingly do not have any grasp on advertising, especially web advertising, and demographics.  You have no idea what is simple and what is not and are not in any position to be making such broad statements.  Also, judging by your comments you think geolocation is the panacea of advertising, it is only a small part of the much bigger pie.  Geolocation is used to serve locally relevant ads sure, but the big benefit of geolocation is market segregation.  People in CA will be more likely to purchase certain types of things than people in TX for example.  This can be broken down all the way to zip codes.  Geolocation is used more for statistical analysis then later targeted ads, other demographic data such as age, gender, preferences, etc is much more valuable than geolocation.  So to say it is as simple as that is just a farce at best.  I by no means purport that I am an expert, but I do have some experience in the field, primarily affiliate marketing, and came at these truths the hard way (i.e. cost me a lot of money).","depth":6,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"joshlrogers","name":"t1_c0uq5rr","parent_id":"t1_c0uq2zc","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1279674634,"created_utc":1279645834}

The banks will most likely pass this fine on downstream till it eventually hits the merchant. Furthermore, the bank will also most likely either terminate your relationship or increase transaction fees.

Admins: you probably can guess what the "press" on this will look like. But have you thought about what could happen if you admitted this is a mistake, and reversed the decision?

Edit: I think the real explanation is that, while the sorting is fast, getting all of the comments together is slow. I would guess that user comments are in database table by thread, not by user, which means a user-comment sort would require touching every single one of these threads' tables, which actually would be slow.

They are probably going to add lots of features only subscribed people will get.  And in turn that is going to turn off new users, and old users who don't just want to pay a corporate site for access to news sites.		If I was Reddit I would worry a bit too about what a subscription model is going to get them into.  Lots of stories that make the front page as links to the NY Times, LA Times or other big news papers.  And these sites had problems with Google News directing traffic to them.   Google could at least say they weren't being paid by the user directly.  Reddit ain't going to have the luxury.    The NY Times and other major internet sites may come to Reddit saying "You get paid by your users, and we would like our cut now, please".

{"body":"The problem with the donation model is a business one.  And it's unfortunate, especially given that they might actually get more money, say on a yearly basis, using a donations approach.		But donations are unstable. There's no guarantee of recurring payments: you might have huge variations from one month to the next. And they're going to be using this money to hire new employees. This means they need far more stability than the donation model can provide.  		Sub models are known to be far more stable, someone who pays for a few months is very likely to pay for another month after that.  That knowledge lets you hire people with confidence, knowing you can pay their salary.  That confidence in income is very important.		So that's the problem.  If they could somehow know that they'd get X amount each month from donations, it might be different.  But the inherent nature of donations precludes that confidence.	*******	__EDIT__: After some thinking, though, let me say something a little different:  Conde Nast can inherently give reddit some cushion to try the pledge drive approach, and see if revenues from quarterly drives can be consistent.  But that would require Conde's participation and approval of that method of making money (and that's what Conde would want it to be, a way of making money. Not a limited goal of paying for site costs, but a chance to see how much redditors will pay up each quarter.  A chance for profit.).  		So the question for drives to be successful (in the eyes of management) would become: How willing are redditors to pay money in a "donation drive" fashion, not just to keep reddit afloat, but to surpass that, to pay into the site's profit directly?","depth":1,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"theinternetftw","name":"t1_c0uqdgq","parent_id":"t1_c0upxww","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1279678737,"created_utc":1279649937}

For reddit, the prize might be some nice swag (exclusive t-shirts, buttons, a special poster signed by the reddit crew, soap, tie-in products from members in the community, etc).		Also, instead of looking at monthly payments (the cup half empty), rewards should be looked into (the cup half full) -- like a sam's club for reddit members.  Moving this kind of advertising off-site would be a nice work around with issues like adblocker.  When people head to reddit, they aren't usually looking to buy products. Purchasing has to be placed in a communty context -- like the purchase of reddit soap.  Another more generalized method is a reddit credit card reward program -- albeit this isn't the best time for that.  Perhaps a simpler reward program can be arranged with Paypal.  		**Edit:** Another thing, if you have to come to the community to increase your revenue -- when Conde Nast isn't offering any help financially (and it's an old media company anyway) *it's time to ditch Conde Nast*.

I admit I'm a complete tightass, so this seemed like a bargain compared to a "real" monthly subscription. Your blog posting did not state any limitations (by time or features) on the membership purchased by my early-stage donation, so of course I thought it was life-membership.		But what is the point of a "charter member" if it doesn't convey advantages over waiting and seeing and getting a regular subscription when that is introduced? That's the whole point of being a charter member - that one helped found the institution.		I don't want my money back. Subscribing was *far* more of a dilemma because it required linking you to my PayPal account and my real name (also indirectly linking my username with my bank account details).

It would have been cheap of me to send you a postcard, but there's no way you can give my privacy back to me now.		There's also no way I'm paying a monthly fee for reddit. You're an internet discussion website - who pays for those? I don't pay a subscription for MySpace, Slashdot, Digg or Facebook.

That, or you could set it up so you get more features if you donate more money (or even physical merch like others suggested).

{"body":"You have a deep point here -- others are making it, but I like your style.		You may be interested in McKenzie Wark's [A Hacker Manifesto](http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html). In Wark's terminology, "hackers" are those who create and contribute -- curating links for reddit could be portrayed as a low rung of hackerdom, while the "vectorialist" class (in this case, Reddit), who owns the means of distribution, deprives us from full ownership. 		> 06. As the abstraction of private property was extended to information, it produced the hacker class as a class. Hackers must sell their capacity for abstraction to a class that owns the means of production, the vectoralist class - the emergent ruling class of our time. The vectorialist class is waging an intensive struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property. Patents and copyrights all end up in the hands, not of their creators, but of the vectoralist class that owns the means of realising the value of these abstractions. The vectoralist class struggles to monopolise abstraction. Hackers find themselves dispossessed both individually, and as a class. Hackers come piecemeal to struggle against the particular forms in which abstraction is commodified and made into the private property of the vectoralist class. Hackers come to struggle collectively against the usurious charges the vectoralists extort for access to the information that hackers collectively produce, but that vectoralists collectively come to own. Hackers come as a class to recognise their class interest is best expressed through the struggle to free the production of abstraction not just from the particular fetters of this or that form of property, but to abstract the form of property itself.		Wark cleverly reuses the language of Marx while talking about something ontologically much deeper. I expect him to become influential in the 2020s.		The sad thing is, the Nash equilibrium of this whole thing is "nobody contributes". I, for one, rarely submit a link to reddit, while keeping a busy personal link log. And precisely because I'm a lurker, Reddit has more value to me than to those who spend time and effort on it. Hence being more willing to pay for Gold.

Instead of subreddits like "pics" or "atheism," you could have "marketing" or "HR". This way people can submit ideas or relevant links that other people in the company would like or would find important. Other people in the company vote submissions up/down so C-level people could see what the hottest topics are. If this was adopted, HR could assess what benefits are most important to employees (who wants free bacon on Fridays?!), employees can submit their work and if it is voted on heavily management will see it (great job Johnson, 500 people loved your idea), or management can see what isn't working so wasteful activities are eliminated (Health is important so we are not providing bacon on Fridays any more - 1000 downvotes). If there is a fear that people wont submit, you could make it anonymous.		In addition to the money selling the code and selling hours of technical expertise to properly configure it, you could have subject experts (how to interpret results), packaged reports or other add ons for sale (added bonus of user community potentially getting some free add ons) and I am sure other things that I haven't thought of.

{"body":"I have to [agree with masklinn](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/crn62/reddit_gold_now_with_actual_features/c0uq9n9)		I pretty much expected this to turn into a subscription based program and I'm prefectly fine with that. Furthermore, if you donated when your "subscription" runs out you still get to remain a member of the Lounge.		I'm sure I'll donate again, well before my subscription/donation runs out.		As for the features, I won't use them. I'll continue leaving the ads up because they are non-intrusive and I have actually clicked-thru on some of them. I've also placed an ad so I feel an obligation to keep them on the site.		I think the real issue here is that most of the people that donated really don't want any special features for just subscribers, they want reddit to remain as is and to have uptime improved and the search box to work. I'm pretty sure the Lounge has already made us feel special amongst each other.		I would suggest that moving forward we keep the Lounge for the original 9000 that donated and have a different sub for subscribers that the original 9000 can get into if they continue subscribing.		I don't know how everyone else feels other than what I see in this thread. I just know I gave money to reddit because I use it so much and I really don't care about special features for subscribers/donors.

{"body":"There's a lot of comments here, I doubt anyone will read mine, but I thought I should chime in with my $0,02.		I think I represent, probably, a good percentage of today's youth, especially the ones on reddit. I'm mid-20s, I'm employed, and I have disposable income. For me, $3,99 a month (even 10, 20) isn't a *lot* in the grand scheme of things. I use Reddit a great deal. Seriously, it's the site which accounts for probably 95% of my home-browsing, not including sites which are linked to from Reddit. Not a day goes by when I find that I'm not on it. In that respect, I could easily justify paying a subscription. I like to feel like I'm supporting things I love, and helping a site which has provided me with days worth of laughter and hilarity over the years would make me feel good. Equally, it's not a big deal. If I'd had enough, I just wouldn't renew, or would wait until I felt it was worth it again. With that said, I obviously hope that Reddit doesn't go down the path of thinking "Hey, people will pay for this stuff, let's start restricting *normal* users to win some more subscriptions".		The features themselves - Sorry admins, they're not that awesome. I guess I just don't use Reddit in that way. I'm happy to browse along for a few hours in one sub-reddit, and then when I get bored / hit old content, I switch to a new one, rinse and repeat ad infinitum. I have not one single person on my friends' list - I've never seen the point, I still don't. I can see how some people would find the features useful, so don't get me wrong; I'm sure they're great, and really well done, for the people that use them, but the feeling that I'm part of helping my single most visited site out is more than enough for me.		I'm curious as to what the "one other thing" is. Something a bit more significant than just sorting and friends list enhancements it seems, but I'll obviously reserve judgment until I know what it is.		With the positive stuff said, I'll move on to the negative. I *hate* recurring bills. Ok, it seems this wouldn't actually be automatically billed, but it would still be something I needed to remember to do. I have enough bills going out every month. It's not a question of money, as I've said, it's just that I, and apparently a lot of other people, don't like the thought of cash rolling out (or needing to be pushed out) from their account every month. I like the idea of a "Help Reddit Pledge drive" every few months... 3 times a year perhaps, although I think there's a risk that revenue from this could begin to dry up after the second or third drive, when the usual folks who donate start to think "Hell, it's this time again, I already gave 3 months ago and 6 months ago, goddamnit, someone else can donate this time". Additional to this is that it's non-guaranteed revenue and almost impossible to predict.		So, my suggestion is this, and I've said it before, but I'll say it again:		I love the SomethingAwful business model. Before I signed up there I bitched and moaned about "Oh my God, why the hell should I pay $10 to post on a forum". I think at the time they limited page views per day to non-registered members as well (not sure if they ever did that, or if they still do?). In any case, in the end, my friend said "Dude, I'm just gonna buy you a membership, you *won't* regret it". He did, I didn't, and I loved it.		So, Reddit, why can you not do this:		Charge a one-time $x fee to be able to get the current "Gold" features, and use this as a gateway to other services.		Archive content which is >x months old and charge an additional one-time $x fee for Archives access. Fix the search feature (maybe easier if 90% of the content was archived) and the ability to search in the Archives access fee. It sounds almost silly, but their ability to pay, what is it, $5?, and give someone a custom title is insanely popular, paying to have a custom avatar and/or different name, and get tough on retards and trolls who ruin this community. Ban them, probate them, whatever, and make them pay again to regain access to what they had before - This would require community interaction, as this would be too time consuming to carry out yourselves. Let mods nominate people for banning and the community (for example, people with >1 year membership) can vote, 1000 votes and the vote is passed and we can help make Reddit a better place.		edit: I meant to say as well, that if you're concerned that one-off fees aren't gonna bring in a decent revenue stream I think you should give it a shot. People join all the time. Users will over time, as they appreciate the site more, feel more likely to want to sign-up. Pad this out with some better merchandise - strike a deal with someone, and I think you could have a great little money spinner.","depth":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"cagsmith","name":"t1_c0usjwe","parent_id":"t3_crn62","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1279741592,"created_utc":1279712792}

Further, not only is it bad, it's _morally wrong_ for a business to provide things to users in exchange for money, while simultaneously forcing nothing, and reducing _no access or features_ to _anybody_ for _any reason_.
