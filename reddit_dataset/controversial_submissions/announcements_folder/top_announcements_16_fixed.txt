{"body":"I still hate /u/Shitty_Watercolour for that, I followed redditnoir like a dogs tail. Even the sub became locked. FUCK YOU shitty watercolour!		EDIT: Story time kids. Once upon a time as the legend goes there was a guy named Redditnoir who was a novelty account *juuust* like Shitty but not quite. You see, Noir went around replying to comments with a part of a story... would've been a great story had he completed it... Noir always wrote as though he was a detective looking for someone in the dirty cold city named Reddit some say it was /u/karmanut, other say it was /u/potato_in_my_anus, other thought he was just chasing his tail. Noir ventured through the red light districts full of those pretty /r/gonewild girls with the neck beards staring greedily and throwing upvotes hoping for more. Unfortunately, Noir mashed too many toes... pushed is nose in too many dark corners... on his search... and Shitty was sent after him to silence him **at all cost.**		It wasn't till that faithful day, while following his clues, [Shitty found him](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s62r2/every_single_time_i_open_my_oven_i_dont_wait_long/c4beubx?context=4) and blindsided him with more paintings than he could write stories to. The dark side of the hive mind seeing defeat started mailing threats to Noir, who knew things would never die down... did the bravest thing a man could ever do. He loaded his gun, pointed the barrel to the underside of his chin... and pulled the trigger. Me myself? I don't think he did it, I think he was man enough to click that deactivate button and is now free, free to explore that mysterious place that's mentioned in /r/outside.		The overlords of Reddit more specifically that slime bag,  mainly /u/yishan, they rewarded /u/Shitty_Watercolour handsomely with votes, karma and reddit gold.
