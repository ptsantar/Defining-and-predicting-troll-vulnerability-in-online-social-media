{"body":"Freedom of speech comes from freedom of body. Real adults are autonomous. Real self awareness, real self actualization. Think about it. The only variable in the universe we can truly control is our bodies. Our organisms. No matter how offended we get, or how many rules we make, laws we write there is only us.		I cant make anyone do anything. The nerves coming out of my brain only go to my body. If i want XYZ then i have to take action on that, be committed & follow through.		Complaining about other people, censoring them, banning them, trying to control them, that is all juvenile. This is how children behave. A person sees the world through the lense of their own moral compass, adults too. Adults adapt to the world. A child wants the world to adapt to it. Only a child will try to force the other humans to line up and dance exactly the way they want. Only a child would throw a temper tantrum when they dont get what they want.		Look at SJWs. They have a viewpoint, and they bully & shame others in an attempt to force people onto their side.		Example. Lets say a person on Tumnlr or /r/SRS complains about lack of women in engineering. Thats all it is, children complaining. Youd think, as an adult, that if a woman truly believed that women were under represented in STEM, and truly believed that something should be done about this shed become an engineer.  Right? Apply to college, put one foot in front of the other & be a rocket scientist. But they dont. Instead they bitch and moan, complain about other people.		How does complaining and fighting help them achieve their goals? How does calling people names and throwing temper tantrums help them close the gap between where they are & where they want to be?		If you want X, then go do X. No one can do it for you. No matter how much you pretend that your not part of the problem, it will only be a belief until you take committed action on what you want. Most of these people dont even know what they truly want or who they really are. They are so far away from getting that critical leverage we all need to perform at our best.		Reddit **panders** to these people. College students at first. People who have had their hand held through every challenge, coddled around every hurdle. So this is what we have, impotebt control freaks.		Thats why the downvote button exists. These people see content, then get offended. They feel 'something must be done', next launching a tirade about how it 'should be' according to them. Finally they slap the downvote button, and repeat. They dont have the adult sense of self awareness to understand the attachment that caused their frumpyness. They just go with the flow and stumble around trying to control everything. The vote buttons facilitate acting out on these desires.		When you get older you start to develop clear vision of where you want to be. You cease all action that does not meaningfully contribute to that dream. You pull goals out of your vision, achieve them, then carry the momentum forward. You dont stop doing this to protest about how other people are not changing the world for you. Thats fucking retarded.		You dont stop to complain about other people because that doesnt help you with your goals. If i was a mod on reddit, how would shadowbanning people make your mile faster? How does doing any of this busybody shit going to make your garden greener? These people could have masters degrees, they could be 50 years old.		But if they cant master self awareness & self actualization then they are babies. Crying and wailing about the world around them, constantly blogging and protesting, but never lidting a finger to do it for themselves.		A bunch of lame ass hipsters protested about litter near a reservoir in my area. Did any of them stop to think that, if they wanted a clean reservoir, maybe they should get trash bags and go clean it. None of them realize that. They dont want to work, they want everything handed to them. They want the world spoon fed into their ignorant gaping mouths.		My wife and i walk the reservoir monthly to clean up trash. Know why? Because i care enough to do more than block traffic and pretend im not part of the problem. These people stay on reddit because there is a button they can push when they are offended or disagree. A button that makes them feel like they are important, that lends significance to their bigitry with a vote. A button that doesnt help them achieve their goals or take action. A button that lets you get away with doing nothing.		Imagine if, everytime you voted you had to comment on why. Imagine if you couldnt vote at all without submitting a rational argument.

I haven't read all your comment but this bit caught my attention, I've been here for a while and I can tell you the downvote was here from the start, way before the "likes" and "+1" became popular and all the other sites started copying the modality such as StackOverflow for example.		originally these were supposed to "train" an algorithm that should give you links based on your preferences, you were supposed to indicate what you liked and what not in order to achieve that but it didn't worked and over the years it evolved into the community-based popularism that is now and that shapes the content of the site.

I had the gall to make a post after the Ellen Pao trial ended asking her to come do an AMA. After being roundly upvoted for the first 40 minutes all of my comments at 10 upvotes or more, I all of a sudden was slammed with downvotes and personal insults. One guy even accused me of being an "ISIS supporter/sympathizer" (no joke). 		Here is the edits I made that night:		>Edit: Off to bed. It's divisive issue to be sure. After the first 30 minutes of being posted, all my comments were positive karma, most by 5 or more points, several more than 10. In less than 10 minutes they've all been buried to -5 to -10 and falling. Seems a little strange but oh well. I guess that's how the cookie crumbles.		>Edit 2: By the end of me writing my last edit, all of my comments had been buried. That is an awfully swift dive for the middle of the night on a Sunday. In 40 minutes my comments were at 10 upvotes. Less than 10 minutes later they were all completely buried. Guess the Australians are big fans of interim CEO's.		>Edit 3: Holy shit. The speed at which these dowvotes have happened is downright amazing, considering the position they started from. In 20 minutes, they somehow attracted double the negative offset of the first 40 minutes of my post. Not to mention that this post is still 62% upvoted after 179 votes. Seems a few people agree. What the hell is going on in the comment section? And I got called a terrorist sympathizer (which is being upvoted!!!) to boot! All for asking the head of the company to come speak to us. Holy shit. This is some fucking weird juju.		Just after the third edit, the AMA was removed bc "We ask that when requesting public figures, users include some public way of contacting the person requested.". After this AMA request the policy was actually changed to this current policy. Previously it had been a suggestion to provide a public info if the person making the request had it. After this post, it was not optionial any more in the side bar.

{"body":"Streisand Effect time! Here's an entire Fortune article detailing the scandal: http://fortune.com/2012/10/25/ellen-pao-buddy-fletcher/		>After achieving coveted positions in the rarefied world of finance, Fletcher and Pao each filed sensational lawsuits that now jeopardize their careers, no matter the outcome. Fletcher, 46, sued the iconic Dakota apartment building, located on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, accusing the board of racial discrimination after it questioned his ability to pay for an additional unit in the complex. The lawsuit triggered a series of events that ultimately led to the bankruptcy of one of Fletcher’s funds and investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Then, just as Fletcher’s predicament was intensifying, Pao, 43, sued her employer, the venerable venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, for sexual discrimination, alleging that her superiors ignored her complaints of maltreatment by some male colleagues — and curtailed her career for raising the issues.		...		>Following the Dakota’s incendiary allegations, three Louisiana pension funds requested money from their investment in a Fletcher vehicle called the FIA Leveraged Fund, which was registered in the Cayman Islands. At first they wanted to take some profits off the table. Eventually they redeemed their entire investments. Fletcher issued an IOU, saying that the assets weren’t liquid. The funds rejected the note. By the end of 2011, neither Fletcher nor the Louisiana pension funds could agree on an acceptable payment. The relationship between them deteriorated, and after an unsatisfactory meeting with Fletcher in December, the investors filed a petition in the Cayman Islands to liquidate the Leveraged Fund and get their money back.","depth":4,"score":14,"ups":14,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"richmomz","name":"t1_cr8v4kc","parent_id":"t1_cr8a9mc","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431640117,"created_utc":1431611317}

If they chose to wait until you said something annoying before actually banning you, that's still fine by me - they could have banned you before and stopped you from saying it at all.

{"body":"If anybody else was in the dark about this like I was, this is what I learned in the last 15 minutes and it's kind of fascinating:  [Ellen Pao's husband](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fletcher) lost [$100 million](http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2012/04/liquidation_ordered_for_hedge.html) from a Firefighter's pension fund in what sounds like a [Bernie Madoff type scheme](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/pension-funds-sue-on-a-deal-gone-cold/?_r=0).  Now the fund is suing and he's being investigated by the FBI and the SEC.  He's probably going to jail.		Apparently though he taught Ellen a few tricks about how to make money through frivolous litigation, he had sued the firm he worked for when he didn't get his expected bonus and later sued the building he was living in when it wouldn't sell him an apartment he wanted, both instances he claimed it was because he was black.  He didn't win the first one but somehow got $1.8 million out of it and the other was still pending at the time of that NYTimes article.  		So Ellen sues her old boss which everyone knows about because maybe she was discriminated against but also because they are in some deep, deep shit.  She lost and now she doesn't want to pay her lawyer, which everyone also knows about.  Sound like a Coen Brothers movie yet?		And while all this is going on Reddit has the fantastic idea of hiring her to run the company.  What in the living fuck they were thinking I do not know.  They can't fire her, they must be thinking she'll sue them too.  That brings us to the shadowbanning.  I don't know if she's doing it or not, it could just as easily be someone trying to pin it on her to build a case against her for her dismissal.  They are definitely going to need some ammo.  I feel bad for her though.  I'm not sure why but I do.  That's a lot to be dealing with.		Okay I'm tired of typing, gonna probably be shadowbanned now, nice knowing you, Reddit.","depth":2,"score":68,"ups":68,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cr8h5e3","parent_id":"t1_cr85zyq","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431598550,"created_utc":1431569750}

His fund is in [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy), and he is accused of civil fraud.   		>He began his career as a quantitative equity trader at [Bear Stearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns) and later worked at [Kidder, Peabody & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidder,_Peabody_%26_Co.) Fletcher, who is [African American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American), sued Kidder Peabody for racial discrimination. Although his racial discrimination claims were dismissed, he eventually won an arbitration award of US$1.26 million.  Fletcher has also been involved in litigation centered on a dispute with the board of [The Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dakota) apartment building in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).		>Fletcher founded Fletcher Asset Management in 1991. His main fund, Fletcher International, may have been insolvent since 2008 and was declared bankrupt in 2012. Money from the fund was used to finance his brother's movie project, according to the bankruptcy court trustee. 		>		---		^Interesting: [^Buddy ^Fletcher ^\(politician)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fletcher_\(politician\)) ^| [^Ellen ^Pao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Pao) ^| [^Cornwall, ^Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall,_Connecticut) ^| [^Harvard ^College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College) 		^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cr8h68z) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cr8h68z)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","depth":3,"score":8,"ups":8,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"autowikibot","name":"t1_cr8h68z","parent_id":"t1_cr8h5e3","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431598595,"created_utc":1431569795}

{"body":"I see this argument ensue pretty often, so I thought I'd chip in. There are a few things you need to keep in mind.  		I can only speak for myself, but I don't just get out there and select a few users to ban because I need to fulfill a ban quotum. A user only gets banned if they manage to draw enough attention towards them while they're around thousands of other users who can manage to behave. If a users spouts slurs or harasses other users to give a few examples, I'd deem the user worthy of removal from the community. "But what about free speech?" Well, consider free speech in a social situation. If someone were as unpleasant to my face as some users can be on the internet, I would not want to stay in touch with them. A ban prevents a shitty user from being a nuisance to others.		Having said this, of course unjustified bans happen. Unfortunately there's not much that can be done about it. Though most of the mods (keep in mind they're just humans as well) are more than willing to do things for users as long as they are respectful.

{"body":"It's a reasonable concern, I think. The way I look at it is that if the rules are clear about what is and is not permitted, then having a moderation log is not a liability for me as a mod but actually a safeguard against unwarranted witch-hunting. The democratizing benefits of acting as a deterrent against misconduct are an added bonus.		i think too, having a public log like this is something that can strengthen the community's relationship with the moderators, increase the level of trust. If they can see that you aren't doing shady things like so many other subreddits are accused of, then they will feel more at ease.		It does seem plausible to me though that someone will take the logs out of context and try to make a case against a moderator, and that having those logs available will aid them in that agenda. Such people will try to rabblerouse with whatever tools are available regardless of the existence of a public moderation log, in my opinion. And having that log public means that your community is more empowered to use it to defend you, and you are more empowered to show them the facts and adequately handle those stirring the pot.		Of course it's all hypothetical at this point. I've not yet seen such things occur on subreddits which make their logs public through other means. I haven't been keeping a close eye on them of course, but it's not been anything I've seen referenced in subredditdrama, and it certainly hasnt happened in /r/morrowind or /r/elderscrolls since i set this up there. I believe an experimental run is warranted, honestly. If problems arise, then they can be identified and learned from. If it turns out that public logs are on the whole a bad idea for the functionality of a community, then they need not be adopted.","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Mumberthrax","name":"t1_cr8pvj3","parent_id":"t1_cr8orf0","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431622220,"created_utc":1431593420}

I just don't see how I can have any faith in a site that is functionally identical, except that the new admins apparently are saying "no really guys, we'll do it better, we swear!" It just kind of sounds too much like "four legs good" to me, so of course I have to wonder how long it takes until "two legs bad" becomes "two legs *better*".","depth":5,"score":9,"ups":9,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NonaSuomi282","name":"t1_cr8674k","parent_id":"t1_cr85y97","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431579565,"created_utc":1431550765}

I don't think there is any system to stop one person from managing as many communities as they want, though even here you're always free to start a new community that doesn't have the mods in question. 		They do have a way to lay a claim to a claimed and unused community, which is nice. 		It's not as simple as your analogy makes it seem.

{"body":"> Conversely, does Voat have a system to prevent a large group from brigading a small sub and abusing such a system?		Does reddit?  Reddit seems to rely on mods to just ban people based on if the moderator feels it is a brigade.		There was a post in IAMA for elon musk from the spacex subreddit.  The spacex subreddit had a vote for the best question and posted it in the ama.  Naturally everyone who wanted it answered upvoted it because that is what you are supposed to do. 		The IAMA mod considered this a brigade and removed it purely because it had a lot of upvotes.  He considered it a brigade because the question was popular.		And worse yet, the mod removed it after Elon Musk already answered it.  So he removed Elon Musk's post when it was Elon Musk's AMA.  Did admins fix it?  Fuck no.  Did they allow the mod to attack a high profile AMA poster?  Yes.		Brigade protection should be 100% transparent to the users and require no moderator involvement.  It should be automated.  Such as discounting a large amount of votes in a short amount of time, most likely temporarily.  You could even just discount votes based on the subreddit the users were last using.  People coming form random subreddits with no connection to the swarm would see their votes counted, but swarm votes(brigade or not) would be held back to give the overall community to decide what is good or bad.		Remember at its core, a brigade is a populist action.  They exist because large amount of users can support the same thing.","depth":6,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Galen00","name":"t1_cr876cu","parent_id":"t1_cr8674k","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431581085,"created_utc":1431552285}

She's a wildly unpopular moderator on /r/ASOIAF who was basically the reason behind the creation of /r/Freefolk. Admins are under no obligation to listen to mods, but if one is being heavily downvoted and complains about it, I'm sure they'll look into it. Unfortunately they don't seem to take any action on overly abusive mods. I've no doubt that many people who downvoted her received the same ban.		Luckily the admin was very understanding otherwise this account would still be gone. However as a precaution I'm not going to downvote anymore unless someone is just being outright abusive so that it will help other users filter out bad comments.

Based on the posts from others describing the same thing, I am pretty sure that it is only happening to subreddits where mods are chummy with admins and semi-popular.		It is no secret that admins blacklist subreddits that have mods they don't like.(they will remove mods only if the subreddit is extremely popular, otherwise they just ignore you)		But get banned in say r/android? If you create an alt and go back, you will be automatically shadowbanned.		My guess is they are flagging your original account as spam which flags your IP.  Then the anti-spam system handles the shadowban.		Before you create a new account to get around the subreddit ban, if you change your ip address and never log into your banned account with the new ip, you will avoid any shadowban.  Because of the IP address being used to link your new account to the old one, that does suggest the anti-spam filter doing the dirty work.		The reason why so many accounts are posting about this is because people who have been shadowbanned now know how it works. Using a proxy to stop the auto shadowban is trivial to do.  So even if admins shadownban everyone telling the truth in this thread, people who have dealt with it are confident they can make a new account with ease and keep on posting.

As someone who has literally never participated in any part of the SRSphere, their moderators face vast walls of trolls and troublemakers on a scale that even moderators of much larger subreddits would not expect to contend with. If they developed a fine-grained system of, like, half-bans and quarter-bans and expiring bans and ban appeals and all that rigmarole, the moderators would have no time to do anything else -- especially because these exceptions and work-arounds would themselves generate additional enforcement work. (Every troll you un-ban and then re-ban has just generated additional work at several points: the initial ban; the appeals process; the unbanning; the re-banning. Much easier to just leave them banned.)		Yes, this means that people have to be on their Best Behaviour in there, at least until they've developed enough of an identity and following to skirt around some of these issues.

The reality of the situation is that it's far from impossible to do. But nobody said it was going to be easy. It's not *supposed* to be easy. The mods of the original subreddit spent possibly *years* slowly building up their community and you expect to just take all their subscribers and be a mega-hit overnight?

This is nice, but in the past you used to be able to publicise WHY you had made your own community.		Exodus were common from one bad mod team to a new, better, improved mod team.		Now moderators all band together, defend one another and use the "no witchhunting" rule to shut down and remove any posts that would result in that kind of thing.		It's not better.

Fucking ironically its exactly this kind of behaviour - people calling out bad decisions by a team that resulted in reddit going from small to very VERY big.

You've been around. You know how many communities exist today because of the many drama fallouts and exodus' that occurred. You know that there are massively fewer of those happening now.

{"body":"Meh... Why remove non-copyright content in the first place? Reddit's lack of free speech has made me turn away from it as a community as a whole. It's a parody of it's once famous self.			Simply put... Comments and content on a website like this are categorised as a forum. Peoples opinions in the open air for everyone to see, consider and then 'react' upon. Be it acclaim, indifference or condemnation. Removing threads and comments is not akin to an editor in print journalism and reddit should not take any stance on its content at all period. It is 'the forum' and not the 'mediator' of a debate. This website is not print journalism and the views expressed here should always remain unedited and accessible to all.			Removing content is advocating the removal of people to think as they please. I may find your views abominable but I will defend your right to express them. Censorship is always tied to someone's idea of morality and morality as we know is biased at best and physically dangerous et al. Finally you'll also find that the ones who censor content do so because they are unable to deal with it. They will either reject an idea or obsess over it. Rejecting an idea is fine except it's also a rejection of who we are as humans and doing so means we cannot learn as a whole and grow. Obsession implies some form of guilt at finding an unwholesome idea some how appealing and in hoping to remove all the naughty words from the dictionary you reveal who you truly are. The one who desires to know them in the first place. Both denying others to do so and harbouring an unhealthy approach to dealing with your own humanity.		I'll also add: removing comments is not just censorship you're destroying the very idea of a forum. The walls, the roof the seating of the auditorium; gone and meaningless.

{"body":"Dear Sir:		I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.		You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.		However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.		If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.		Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.		Yours truly,		Prince Alyusi Islassis","depth":2,"score":86,"ups":86,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Warlizard","name":"t1_cr83kx5","parent_id":"t1_cr836eu","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431575661,"created_utc":1431546861}

{"body":"You may want to ask an attorney about what the DMCA does.		IANAL IANYL ATINLA — this is my *understanding* of how DMCA takedowns work:		Someone issues a DMCA takedown. Verifying whether or not the person issuing the takedown is *actually* a rightsholder is a lengthy, arduous process that involves court action and subpoenas and protracted amounts of time; acting on the DMCA takedown generally absolves the service provider of liability for hosting the content.		The person who posted the allegedly-infringing content can file a counter-notice, which serves as their legal assertion to the service provider that they, in fact, are the rightsholder to the content; the service provider can then either restore the content or not, ~~as they see fit~~ (edit: seems like they're required to restore it unless the takedown issuer sues you within fourteen days of the counternotice), but still avoid legal liability for hosting it, and at that point the person who filed the takedown and the person who fiked the counter notice can take legal action against one another, if their respective jurisdictions allow.		The issue here is that reddit, and any service provider, is an uninterested third party to the question of who has the rights; they have been issued a license by one party, but that license means diddly-squat if they didn't have the rights in the first place. 		The whole point of the DMCA takedown scheme is meant to be that the notices themselves are meant to serve as fact-checking under penalty of perjury, with legal names and addresses and staking legal fact-finding and consequences; sadly for many people, penalty of perjury is something that simply doesn't motivate them. And there's no method to, in good faith, distinguish between DMCA takedown trolls and DMCA takedown righteous (unless the troll has been court sanctioned).","depth":3,"score":25,"ups":25,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bardfinn","name":"t1_cr846uv","parent_id":"t1_cr81x1j","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431576566,"created_utc":1431547766}

{"body":">  Why shouldn't I make money off a recommendation I'm going to make regardless?		I think commenters here indicated that the subreddit in question was banned because mods were deleting other content and reposting it with their own affiliate links.		As a user most affiliate links I have seen have been one of three things:		1) Clickbait (bikini celebs posters for example)		2) "cool stuff" other people found and reposted with their amazon link, 99% with the intention of getting you to click it, not because you posted it and wanted to see the cool thing you found on amazon and tacked on the link thinking "oh, might as well get some money in the process"		3) Intentional "Click my amazon link it really helps me out" links (rare)			edit:		In short:		Imo if you post content with the context of sharing information and instead only have the intention of making money off of the click, you are a spammer.  An AMA at-least the readers get their questions answered and everyone gets some value out of it.  A comedy sketch featuring a sponsored product people get value out of.  Tacking your link on the top of other amazon links because why not, not spam, but has potential to be spammy. Reposting amazon links for the intention of profit, nobody gets value out of.		edit2: I forgot one more, chrome extensions injecting their amazon affiliate ID onto other amazon links, maybe spam","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"slyf","name":"t1_cr953k8","parent_id":"t1_cr8yiuf","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431657108,"created_utc":1431628308}

{"body":"Once upon a time brigading meant an organized (concerted and premeditated) effort to effect a thread or subreddit through spam/redundant posting or targeted burying or upvoting of comments. An actual brigade is a kind of premeditated operation where some form of communication and direction of resources is going on. Proving for the existence of a brigade has a slightly higher standard of evidence, but whether it is many people or one person violating a subreddit's policies there really shouldn't be a difference.		On reddit however brigading is so loosely defined that it it used to apply to unpopular speech, and it is also used to attack people who visit a thread from a specific subreddit that the moderator estimates people who post undesirable content come from (not necessarilly content in violation with rules) which ends up indicating corrupt moderation and guilt by association practices, as it implies people who are clicking through are necessarily sympathetic to that subreddit or its values when this may not be the case at all.

Because what appears as hate speech critical of a race, creed or culture, to one person, can be progressive speech in support of secular human rights to someone else.

How are we to judge speech examining women's rights with respect to Islam? Is speech which addresses the plight of the Palestinians "hate speech" against Jewish Israelis? Or vice versa? Obviously it's a grey area and it is incumbent on the reader to determine for him or herself what side of the line particular speech falls on. If moderators want to enforce particular boundaries for their community, that is certainly reasonable; I share your distaste for racism and bigotry, but I see no universal way to determine what constitutes "hate speech."		>Why should reddit allow posting sexualized pictures of women taken without their consent?		Consent is not required for photography in a public space. If you're in a place with a reasonable expectation of privacy, then there are different rules. If I take a picture of a guy on the street and I want to share it with my friends, I see no problem with that. Likewise, if I'm in public and someone takes a picture of me, I don't care what they do with it. Outside of commercial use requiring consent, street photography is fair game for anyone, in my opinion. 		>If you want to support the posting of that kind of content, start your own website.		And the inverse is true for you... if you want to participate in a site that blocks anything you find rude or distasteful, then start your own website and you can block whatever you want! Ultimately, it's up to neither of us, the admins will make the call about what is or isn't allowed.","depth":6,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"zbogom","name":"t1_cr8nook","parent_id":"t1_cr8m1mh","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431613194,"created_utc":1431584394}

{"body":"Cntrl-F:		In January of this year, we published our first transparency report[1] . In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons[2] , and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.	Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove everything: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than this, surprised and censored Snoo[3]  .	There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a "discuss this on reddit," which is rather un-reddit-like.	Today, this changes.	Effective immediately, we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.	Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled "Test post, please ignore", as seen in its original state here[4]  , featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.	Should we receive a valid DMCA request[5] for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why[6]  .	A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to /r/ChillingEffects[7] , and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.	You can view an example of a removed post and comment here[8] .	We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.	Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.	edits for grammar		Was not dissapointed!","depth":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"69_Me_Senpai","name":"t1_cr87xz3","parent_id":"t3_35uyil","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1431582360,"created_utc":1431553560}
