{"body":"In general, I would agree that management does act as you have described. However by definition, a manager is there to manage and or orchestrate a business (group, etc) and not necessarily interact in the day to day dealings. It would stand to reason that a manager would not have policies that are unrelated to their day to day function memorized and when dealing with something like a public release would not strictly adhere to them. 		As far as rediquette being "firm guidelines" for reddit employees I'd disagree. Per the [wiki entry](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), "**Reddiquette** is an **informal** expression of the values of many redditors, as written by redditors themselves," [emphasis per the wiki]. Informal is defined as "not according to the prescribed, official, or customary way or manner" ([source](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/informal)). So while I agree, [Reddit] company leaders should strive to adhere to the reddiquette, I disagree on the premise that they should be followed strictly. My personal opinion is that strict guidelines should be contained in an employee handbook. 		I would like to apologize if I offended you - it was not my intention.

{"body":"The short answer: Yeah.		The long (emotional) answer:		Have you ever gotten caught looking at something you weren't supposed to? Maybe you were innocently glancing at a document on someone's desk while you were visiting their office, and it turned out to be highly confidential? Or maybe you were letting your eyes roam over the figure of a woman whose back was turned, only to realize she was watching you through a mirror?		Realizing your gaze is being observed when you thought it wasn't is a jarring experience because your gaze says a lot about who you are. I think everyone understands that there are times when you have to self-censor what you look at and other times when you can look around freely. 		According to the article linked above, cursor position is a pretty good proxy for what users are looking at, yet most people are used to the idea that they can look around a single web page freely without being observed and judged. It's only when they begin to contemplate clicking on something that they consider what they're saying about themselves in the process.		Maybe the "right" solution to this privacy problem is to modify browsers so that web pages can't collect cursor position data, or to modify window managers so that browsers don't even have access to cursor position data until the user clicks, but that's not really the point.		The point is that I would feel violated if reddit started collecting this information about me, which would be a big change because right now I feel like reddit and I are aligned ethically, mostly because the site admins do a great job of balancing user privacy with preventing abuse, and balancing free speech with avoiding legal trouble. I'd hate to lose that "we're in this together" feeling.		The long (logical) answer:		Reddit has the same problem that Google has, which is that they're both big, popular, trusted sites that users pour personal information into intentionally (in the form of submitting content) and unintentionally (in the form of having their clicks essentially recorded in the form of httpd's access.log entries, and maybe some day cursor position polling data being stored in log files). That's not a problem today because both Reddit and Google are being run by upstanding individuals who thoroughly understand that cashing in on that information to the detriment of their users would be wrong. There are at least two potential problems there.		1. Fuckups. Remember when Google accidentally collected a bunch of WiFi traffic with its Street View cars? Good leadership at Reddit and Google can't prevent programming errors, nor can it prevent rogue programmers from dipping into data streams before they're properly anonymized and aggregated.		2. Mortality. Some day, everyone who works for Google and Reddit right now will be dead. The data they've collected (intentionally or unintentionally) will most likely live on. Who knows whether or not I'll feel I can trust the new CEO with the knowledge that every time my gaze comes to rest on a post title that contains the phrase "Judge Judy", I'm off to the porn subreddits to satisfy myself?

Why is it unnecessary?  If they're using it to understand how people use their website, it seems pretty important.		I've long wanted to start keeping stats, for example, on what features of RES are used, not used, turned off immediately, etc...  Why?  Because it'd help me know more the next time I consider adding a feature, and it'd help me remove cruft from RES.		However, peoples' paranoid attitudes about ANYTHING being kept track of have made me resistant to take action on that - which ultimately makes RES less of a good product than it could be.		I've got NO interest in collecting that data to sell to anyone, I've got NO interest in it being tied to usernames, etc - I'm just interested in improving RES - but I'm terrified to even consider tracking that data because of the small but incredibly vocal minority who feel that anything "tracking" related at all is inherently evil.","depth":5,"score":12,"ups":12,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"honestbleeps","name":"t1_cnqbdxv","parent_id":"t1_cnqb1vo","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1421393309,"created_utc":1421364509}

The amount of people involved are a vast minority. However, the majority of IP requests that Reddit gets have to do with Child Pornography. Because those requests of a very, very delicate nature Reddit must make an exception to that rule in order to not fuck up child pornography investigations. 		Now, since they must do this for one case, they may as well include that into their ToS as to be open and clear about how they operate.

They have two choices when it comes to this statement, do not inform the user base and still do what they do regardless but with even less accountability, or inform the user base and add an extra statement to prevent them from breaking their own ToS in a rare case.

While I don't have access to every news story or every court case, I very well doubt someone has not gotten convicted because reddit was party to an investigation but didn't have this wording in their ToS.  So your argument about them needing to change it 'so they won't break their own ToS' holds little weight.		So while you may still believe I am idiot, just take a moment to really think about the situation.  Just because you can type a wall of text doesn't make you well educated, or well spoken.		By the way...I never expected any privacy from reddit, or any other internet site, because i understand full well that there is no such thing as true privacy on the internet.  However when sites make it easier and easier for LE or the ruling class to get to data, it is worrisome.		EDIT: Also, there is the following statement in the user agreement "We want you to enjoy reddit, so if you have an issue or dispute, you agree to raise it and try to resolve it with us informally."  Basically, they are trying to remove any legal avenue for you to dispute them in the event something happens.  Say someone manages to use your username to do lots of trading in 'bad stuff'.  They associate the name with you and you get railroaded by the legal system.  While this is likely a 'minority' of users that it could ever happen to, I bet if it were to happen to you, your tune would be quite different.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cnqib6r","parent_id":"t1_cnqht6c","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1421405921,"created_utc":1421377121}

This feature isn't necessarily reactive, it's also proactive. Not everyone has a degree in digital forensics and can realize when they've said "too much" and need to create a new account.

{"body":"TL;DR At Bottom.		-----		It's very possible, so explain further for anyone else			The router you both go into has a public IP Address. Think of this as the number on your house but for your internet. 		With this internet business you have internal and external IP Addresses. In your home, your internal one can not be seen from the outside. But the External one that your router has, can be seen from the outside.		We use this cool-ass Technology called NAT, or Network Address Translation. 		To explain NAT basically, Your router removes your IP address and uses it's own when it sends your data to the internet. So that websites can tell how to get back, then when your data gets back to the router, it sends it back to you (knowing how to get to your computer) Quick, Clean, easy.		So like,		This means any data you send, goes through your router and then it forwards it as routers do.. but with it's own Public IP address because the internet knows how to get to your routers IP, and your router knows how to get to you. Pretty simple, it just substitutes it's own numbers in before pushing the data outwards.		------		To answer your question. Only your router knows you are behind it, and the internet only knows how to get to your router. Not you, that's up to the router itself to give the data back to you.		so when you have a naughty friend on your little internal network, that the world doesn't know about...   How do websites like wikipedia and reddit know that your router isn't just you being a dick?			They don't. Unfortunately you can have an entire network of idiots in your house using that NAT technology that allows your router to 'pass the message on' under it's own 'name/identifier' 		-----		But to make it quick and finish off / TL;DR		Your router forwards your packets under it's own 'name/number/ip/whatever you want to call it' and data of anyone else who is in your house.

Or does this feature already exist and I just haven't found it?		In losing the threaded appearance of what makes reddit reddit, the functionality of the app is greatly diminished. 		For example, when there are two IAmA	Hosts in the same thread (e.g. two guys in a band) the app won't recognize the other one as OP. If the other OP replies to a question first, it will show his answer as the "question"... So only both answers are shown. 		Also sometimes when the questions are already answered by another user, and the OP chimes in to say "yes, that's exactly it" as a response to the user response, I don't actually get to see the original question and have to guess at it. Terribly annoying. 		2) is there a subreddit for the official IAmA app where I could post these and further concerns like /r/alienblue is for alienblue? 		In alien blue, the subreddit (feedback channel) is clearly visible on the sidebar. I am not sure of the origins of the devs for the IAmA app, but it sure would be nice to have it be consistent throughout the apps. 		3) paid version to get rid of apps for IAmA?		As with alien blue now, I assume this update means that we will be seeing ads on the mobile IAmA app in weeks to come. Or am I wrong about that?	Is there going to be a one-time IAP to get rid of said ads then?

There's another user, GangHisKawn, who covets MarcoPOolo's position, popularity, karma ranking, or fame.		There's a third user, TeeJoeCare, who just wants to watch the world burn.		So GangHisKawn finds out MarcoPOolo's password — and passes it over to TeeJoeCare, and says "do your worst". And TeeJoeCare finds the "CBAN" (comment burn and nuke) button on MarcoPOolo's account and pushes it.		Now, even if MarcoPOolo recovers control of his account, *everything he has ever done is gone*. Vanished. Irrecoverable, unless there's a copy stored on a third party server somewhere.		That's *bad*.		The other reason I wouldn't implement that feature is because the systems that serve older content are distinct from the systems that serve newer content — and by initiating a purge of a long-standing account, that might involve heavily taxing the databases hosting older content, which could have serious implications for the stability and availability of the infrastructure reddit runs on.
