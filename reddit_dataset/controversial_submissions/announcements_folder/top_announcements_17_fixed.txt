{"body":"I can't answer for anyone else, but there are a few small things I feel are lacking from Baconit.		- Lack of markdown formatting in full comments view	- No way to save comments		There are also some things that I feel Readit does better.		- I think it looks better.  However, being largely a stereotypical programmer, I'm not good at quantifying that.	- Default styles aren't bad, but they seem to take up a lot of space (see: panorama headers).  Readit seems to do a good job of keeping things compact while also presenting as much information as I would like.	- Readit makes comment hierarchy more obvious by displaying a number of lines to the left of a comment, the number of lines corresponding to the number of parents the comment has.  I'm not sure how much the average redditor cares about this, but I find it helpful quite often.	- Flipping between the link/text and the comments is quick and easy.	- Editing flairs in-app	- Miscellaneous other small features that make ~~life~~ redditing easier.		That said, there are a few things Baconit does better.		- Baconit makes it easy to collapse a comment with a double-tap or a sideways swipe.  Readit requires that you tap the username/flair to collapse.	- The trial lasts only 15 days.	- No ability to star subs.  Readit offers to pin subs to Start, but I prefer not to.	- A profound lack of bacon.		^^^^These	^^^^my	^^^^opinions	^^^^and	^^^^not	^^^^a	^^^^professional	^^^^review	^^^^or	^^^^endorsement.	^^^^The	^^^^list(s)	^^^^above	^^^^is/are	^^^^non-exhaustive.	^^^^By	^^^^reading	^^^^the	^^^^letter	^^^^'I'	^^^^at	^^^^the	^^^^beginning	^^^^of	^^^^this	^^^^comment	^^^^you	^^^^accept	^^^^all	^^^^liability	^^^^for	^^^^any	^^^^problems	^^^^caused	^^^^by	^^^^reading	^^^^this	^^^^comment.	^^^^You	^^^^also	^^^^forfeit	^^^^your	^^^^rights	^^^^to	^^^^say	^^^^or	^^^^think	^^^^negative	^^^^things	^^^^about	^^^^me.	^^^^Point	^^^^2.2	^^^^is	^^^^an	^^^^exception	^^^^to	^^^^the	^^^^latter	^^^^half	^^^^of	^^^^point	^^^^2.1.	^^^^The	^^^^parentheses	^^^^in	^^^^the	^^^^fine	^^^^print	^^^^were	^^^^a	^^^^pain	^^^^to	^^^^deal	^^^^with.","depth":4,"score":6,"ups":6,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"jonnywoh","name":"t1_ck9m3qd","parent_id":"t1_ck9kpnb","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1409917302,"created_utc":1409888502}
