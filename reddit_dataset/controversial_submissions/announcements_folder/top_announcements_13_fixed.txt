{"body":"Ok, this isn't actually a fix, though.

{"body":"So the threshold actually *is* super low. There's two sides to it: minimum number of votes, and upvote ratio.		The minimum number of votes is very small right now. The idea is just to filter out things that haven't hit a sample size that means anything yet. Things with a vote balance near 50/50 with a small number of votes will be flagged as controversial. This should hit almost every subreddit, and we can definitely play with the numbers if we need to.","depth":1,"score":207,"ups":207,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"umbrae","name":"t1_cih4kou","parent_id":"t1_cih498i","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1403767754,"created_utc":1403738954}

{"body":"We could, but that's not really the intent of the minimum number of votes.

Again I would imagine users are smart enough to know a troll when they see one, and if they don't the comments should help, but if all else fails the overall karma score and controversy tag is a sufficient indicator. 		> r/TiA isn't 'small' anymore, but when it was, this would've been an issue.

{"body":"Reddit didn't skew the counts anywhere *near* enough for someone to have 125 upvotes along with 70 downvotes. It'd be more like 145|20, if that. The total votes were always the same, and the amount of added downvotes was based on an algorithm and was only in relation to the number of upvotes -- thus, no comment with 100 legit upvotes would ever have more than like ~10 fake downvotes. Edit: And with comments especially, the vote fuzzing was either barely significant or completely meaningless. I've had comments that got 80 upvotes without any downvotes at all -- according to you, I should've gotten at least a few due to the fuzzing, but I didn't. Because reddit's algorithm simply doesn't work as loosely as you think.		Late edit to clarify (in case people happen to see this): When I said 		>no comment with 100 legit upvotes would ever have more than like ~10 fake downvotes.		I didn't phrase that correctly. What I meant to say was that if a comment has like 120 upvotes *total*, there won't be more than like 10 fake *downvotes* on it. Thus, the overall score of +110 is gonna be pretty darn accurate. The numbers don't start getting *really* fuzzed until we're talking about a front-page AMA or some shit -- where the votes will seemingly be like 2000|-1000 or some shit. In like Warwick Davis's AMA, the votes were something similar to that, though in reality, he probably got less upvotes *and* much less downvotes than what they "show" you. Something like a popular AMA with 2000|-1000 is probably actually more like 2500|-500, or *better*. Those are really the only times where the vote-fuzzing has an actual effect. Comments are less likely to be fuzzed in the first place until/unless they get like *hundreds* of votes. 		tl:dr -- if your comment has less than 200-300 total votes, I'd be willing to bet decent money that every single one of those votes came from legit users, not from vote-fuzzing. And IMO (though this is mostly just speculation based on my own comments), I don't think I've seen hardly *any* comments where it was apparent that vote-fuzzing was happening at all. Like I said, I still have a comment (in like seddit or something) that's got like 80 upvotes and 0 downvotes. So obviously the vote-fuzzing didn't take effect in that case. I think it's used once a post hits a certain threshold -- it might be used for comments too, but in this case we're talking about comments that have been upvoted to like 4 figures (similar to a popular post's votes, basically).","depth":8,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"frogma","name":"t1_ciheuce","parent_id":"t1_cih9nzr","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1403795319,"created_utc":1403766519}

{"body":"I remember last May there was an /r/AskReddit thread asking how reddit would ultimately meet its demise and I have to say that reading through these comments it's all sounding a bit familiar. 		With so many users accusing the admin of commitment bias, drawing repeated comparisons to the functionality failures of Digg v4, and the many theories similar to yours regarding what this will actually mean for the future of the site and the fundamental way in which content is shared and promoted - it's easy to feel that reddit may in fact have already sealed its fate.		One of the top comments from that thread a year ago argued that reddit was already dead - and the only reason it has been able to survive this long is that there is not yet a better alternative. While this may be true - /u/NotaMethAddict gave a very reflective and eye-opening counter-argument:		> Nobody hates reddit more than reddit. 	> 	> It's a phase every active user on this site goes through. You start off amazed at all of the fresh content and interesting things... Then repetition kicks in and you start to become jaded and dissatisfied with reddit. 	> 	> After a while you realize reddit still is an amazing aggregator of content and full of interesting people, you just need to change the way you use the site. 	> 	> [Six years ago the content wasn't any better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/p5lb/vote_up_if_you_think_bush_should_be_impeached/)	> 	> [Three years ago people were still complaining.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/aflt6/licenseplate_created_this_image/c0hc8f9) 	> 	> Today is no different. reddit experienced its cultural shift years ago, nothing has changed since then. You have just become more aware to all aspects of reddit, good and bad. What you need to do now is branch out to other subreddits and interests. Go get involved in a small community. There is so much freedom on this website it's impossible not to find something interesting. 	> 	> ---	> 	> One of my friends has started compiling a list of interesting subreddits, [this might be a good place to start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ModeratorDuck/comments/1b49kk/list_must_have_subreddits/)	> 	> [This list is much more comprehensive than the previous one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ModeratorDuck/wiki/subreddit_classification)		While all of the drama surrounding this latest "crisis" may seem like it's an indication of the beginning of the end (and while it still may very well indicate changes coming to the integral features of reddit - such as the removal of downvote button...) I think that overall, no one would want to see reddit replaced with something new - or worse - all together disappear.		At this point there are enough users on reddit that I feel there's almost no change/miscalculation that can be made by either the admin or the users that could be seen as directly responsible to the site's eventual downfall...

Reddit's search, for example, is often criticized for being horrendous.

Reddit's mobile site is sorely lacking. It can't even display everything properly without being cut off.		There's several features that I consider very important to reddit that are only in RES (such as the live preview). Presumably the majority of redditors are deprived from these features because of this (RES is well known, but I still see posts on a daily basis asking what RES is).		The ability to flag posts as either NSFW or NSFL has also been an outstanding feature request for ages. It's a topic that still comes up regularly. Likewise for the ability to edit titles.		Proper spoiler tags are also a long time request (the current ones are subreddit CSS. If the subreddit mods suck, you don't get spoiler tags. Also, they don't show up on the mobile site or if you disable subreddit CSS).		User configurable CSS and JS is another, although it's not important since Stylish or GreaseMonkey can allow this functionality on any site (although not linked to account).

And as mentioned, the lack of discussion was very offputting.		Unfortunately, it's difficult to come up with a solution that pleases both sides. We can't just fix the percentage while still displaying the vote counts, as that would allow bots to determine if they're being accepted (by looking for a new inconsistency between votes and the unfuzzed percentage).		One "solution" would be to remove the percentage entirely. It was inaccurate and in my completely anecdotal experience, it's not commonly paid attention to (total votes and the vote distribution were far more visible). Success of a post can be approximated from the net karma for posts that are largely successful (or unsuccessful) or by the vote distribution for controversial posts (eg, +5|-5 is rather different from +5000|-5000).		It's very rough, but then again, so is the net votes that is currently being displayed (in fact, I would argue that the net votes is less useful than the fuzzed distribution). Reddit could perhaps also do more to educate users regarding how the site works. This would include things such as including more details about voting works and reddiquette.		If I were to implement it, I'd display the vote distribution natively (no need to let RES do it), and include a tooltip that details what vote fuzzing is and how it affects the score that is displayed.

It sounds like you're assuming that massive, organized bot operations are the only sort of thing we need to worry about, but that's really not the case. Those sorts of things definitely do show up sometimes, but the large majority of the vote-manipulation that's going on all the time is far more "casual", and the vote-fuzzing does a very good job at making it difficult for people to tell how much of an effect they're having.		As a simple example, one of the most common types of vote-cheating on the site is just people that create multiple accounts and use them to upvote everything they post on their main account. This is really easy for us to detect and block, but the vote-fuzzing makes it so that it's not obvious to the person that they're not actually affecting anything at all. There are quite a lot of users that have continued using really simple cheating methods like this for months or even years, because the fuzzing makes it so they haven't realized it's never worked.","depth":3,"score":33,"ups":33,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Deimorz","name":"t1_cihble3","parent_id":"t1_cih7mah","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1403784621,"created_utc":1403755821}

Taking the log of n would be of some use in distinguishing posts with low engagement, limiting the detail (integer or one decimal resolution) would limit the ability of bots to determine how effective they're being in moderations.		As for the issues with smaller subs getting hit by downvote brigades / trolls, giving more visibility on subscribers to mods, limiting voting to subscribers, and/or setting minimum age to moderate, would be useful.		I'd also like for mods to have the ability to override vote-based hiding of comments.

I don't think this is true (edit: for comments). Vote fuzzing didn't kick in until a certain threshold.

That could be true to, but it is sort of a pick your poison situation.

I upvote everyone I'm in discussion with and everyone who comments me, unless they are way off topic, abusive or simply breaking the rules of the subreddit.

Herein lies the problem; we can never know whether a comment really got a (22|21) rating, because we can never know which comments were fuzzed. Maybe it really only had a (10|9) rating for example, and it was padded with 12 extra votes on either side because ~~an account flagged for spam voted on it 12 times~~ 12 accounts flagged for spam voted on it.		Many people have been asserting that fuzzing doesn't apply to comments or submissions with small numbers of votes, but this is not true. The fuzzing can occur on *any* comment. The admin that made the last announcement mentioned a few examples of fuzzing with low vote counts. There's no reason to assume fuzzing wouldn't apply.

Nothing changes. I don't *need* to know if my upvotes are effective. It's a brute force operation. I'll check once in awhile to see if I'm banned, other than that I don't care. If I wanted to be more subtle about it, I'd use something like Amazon Mechanical Turk to get upvotes.		It's not public, but Reddit has, I'm sure, *many* anti-spam measures in place. Weighting new accounts with no history less than an established account, stuff like that. 		The "fuzzing" of vote counts has been and still is completely ineffective.

Again, as "you don't seem to have read it":		 * Even with fuzzing in place, there are ways around knowing "if your vote counted or not". It doesn't matter.	 * Nobody writing spam tools for reddit is going to check if every vote they made counted. Period.	 * If I'm writing spam tools for reddit, I don't care about fuzzing. I just don't. I'm going to do it either way. **It takes no more API requests or "VPS" power to determine if my votes count** than it does to check if I'm shadowbanned. And it doesn't matter anyway. 		If I'm trying to spam reddit, **I am not checking if I'm shadowbanned or if my votes have any effect** after every vote. Period. That would be completely pointless. Inbetween my first and second check to see if my votes are effective, the community will have already decided if my post is worthwhile.		Frankly, there is no blatant spam on reddit, at least as the general public users of the site would see it. As a normal user, I've literally never seen a single spam post (except maybe /r/HailCorporate type stuff) ever. It doesn't exist. It gets downvoted by the community, never seen because of the knights of /new/, or removed by moderators. It basically doesn't happen.

Anyway, why they don't rely solely on this is because showing exact votes lets bot authors figure out immediately if a cheating method is working or not.

I never once saw a solely-upvoted comment up to about 30 points show a fuzzed downvote. It would stay (30|0) through dozens of refreshes and never move. Starting at 31 to about 60 it'd randomly receive a fuzzed downvote. You could tell it was fuzz due to changing on refresh between (32|1) and (31|0). Once a comment hit hundreds of upvotes, it could have quite a few fuzzed votes, but at that point there were so many total votes on the comment that exact counts didn't matter as much as general score: Super-positive? Well-liked. Near-zero? Controversial.		You could still find controversial comments before this dagger was added by refreshing the page a few times. If a comment with a score of 2 stayed 2 through 10 refreshes it was just barely read and probably 2|0 or 3|1. If it randomly bounced between 0, 1, 2, and 3, it had a decent and nearly equal number of up and downvotes (30|28 or the like). (Yes, even the total score on a comment with enough votes was--and still is--fuzzed, despite comments from admins to the contrary. It just doesn't amount to more than a point or two of change each pageview. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that changes on refresh aren't new votes when it's a comment from >6 months ago that can't even be voted on anymore.

{"body":"I partnered with Reddit as a shill four years ago so that I could develop deep cover so that when this change, which they started planning four years ago, finally came about and I got involved in a thread about it, nobody would be able to call me a shill. But you've found me out you sleuth and have ruined everything. God damn it. Thanks a lot. Now it was all for nothing, all this endless chatting. I've made a huge mistake.		I'm here for conversation. I don't care about the votes. I never have. I forget to vote most of the time because it's not why I'm here. And the people that nauseate me on this site more than any other, an answer I should have given in that recent "what makes you go from zero to rage instantly" askreddit question, and one of the few types I remember to vote on because they suck so much, are the downvote whiners in every thread and the ones who base their whole participation on these stupid points. They delete their comments if they start to get downvotes because oh no my points! Or if they get downvotes they go back and edit and try to backpedal for forgiveness as the anonymous downvoting crowd pounds their opinion back into line. Many even apologize even though they didn't say anything offensive, but just stated an opinion! It's disgusting. What a bunch of noodle-spined cowards. 		I say what I think and am sometimes surprised when I come back to the conversation later and see that it's gotten a bunch of upvotes. I was just talking. Same with downvotes. Other times I know why I got votes because it was predictable, I knew they were coming, and I don't care and don't edit the post and don't delete it because I meant what I said regardless of what 5 or 50 or 500 invisible people, robots, or deskwalking cats think about it. A "herd of anonymous randos with unknown rationales" is exactly what redditors are, and that includes you and me unless we take the time to comment and discuss. Then we get some background, some context, some rationale, and that's meaningful or at least useful. 		You and I disagree for example and you have contempt for me. If you got a bunch of downvotes, which you seem to value so much, every one of them could be from someone like me. Or worse, they could be from the 16 or 20 year old knowitall version of me who has things figured out already and could run the world (and reddit) if just put in charge. If you knew that about us, and you knew our various random reasons for downvoting such as your spelling, your username, a stale RES tag, opposite political party, don't care for your tone, we sneezed while we voted, you simply disagreed with something we said earlier, we're trying to make our comment go higher than yours irrespective of whatever yours is, didn't like something else that you said, vendetta, we're a robot, whatever, you could and would easily and totally disregard our votes and feel fine about your comment or post. But when we're nothing but one or twelve or 200 identical anonymous periwinkles, you for some reason imbue us all with equal value.		I don't know if you're one of the chronic downvote whiners or the habitual deleting cowards or backpedaling comment editors, but those people are responding to people of unknown backgrounds in unknown places with unknown expertise and unknown experience and unknown rationales for voting. Since you and I have spoken and you have developed your contemptuous opinion of me, you can safely disregard me. But if I and 30 of my clones around the world had downvoted you somewhere and said nothing, I bet based on your attitude here that you'd be puzzled, hurt, unsure of yourself, irritated, bitter, reactionary, and would be here making some sardonic or nasty write-off edit about how we're a bunch of idiots who can't see sense. And you'd decide on some reasons you guessed at for why we must be downvoting and level those charges. But you'd never know. We could instead be 30 Nobel laureates who determined that your information was balls, or 30 reddiquette sticklers who felt it didn't add to the conversation, or 30 people having a bad day. Or a mix of lots of kinds for lots of unknown reasons. No idea.		I'm not here to "put things out for review" as you've said. It's not a polling or validation site for me. If I ask a question because I don't know something, clearly I want input. If I make a statement, it's what I think. I'm otherwise here for info, links out, and conversations. If someone wants to engage me in conversation, that's great. And I'll be able to tell from that whether I value their opinion or input. Yours, for example, is easy for me to dismiss now that we've interacted, just as you dismiss mine. As an anonymous downvote, I'd have dismissed you as irrelevant but at least this way you had a chance.

{"body":"Idk if you'll listen to this, but I'm still going to try. 		Once upon a time there was a pretty good site called Livejournal. When they started they were for the users, by the users. They grew a loyal fanbase that was willing to pay for perks and that used the site extensively. 		Then the site was sold and gradually over time it started to rely more and more on ads. So they made changes to the site. And they didn't listen. Because when the advertisers pay you then when they say jump you say how high, right? So you make a little change, and there's only a fraction of users who complain and maybe leave. Then you make another little change, and another fraction of users complain and maybe leave. And so it goes. 		The problem? When you add up 1%, and then 3%, and then 6%, and then 3%, and so on? Eventually your user base starts to erode, especially if another site comes along and offers a better platform. And without the userbase? Your advertisers will leave for greener pastures. 		I don't think that Reddit is plunging down the tubes or anything - I've been using the site for less than a year, so I'd be foolish to say so. But try as I might, I *cannot* think of any other motivation for this change except that you're trying to please advertisers. That makes me sad. 		So because I like the site, I'm going to say this: please listen to your users. I'll admit that this shows effort, at least, but I worry that as time goes on you'll be less and less inclined to be flexible.

Those votes only come from people that indicate they're reading your profile, and they don't impact actual sorting on the site.		---			Here's the argument:		Votes that are fuzzed don't count. Fuzzed votes don't change anything. The only information fuzzed votes used to give was that someone, or a bot, had participated on a specific piece of content.		What did that mean? Practically nothing. Now I just read the last 50 comments you made by accessing your comment history. You have no way of telling this because I don't vote or vote-cheat. I don't figure in the fuzzed votes count. The majority of "stalkers" don't indicate that they've been on your profile follow you around or whatever.		Fuzzed votes only showed a fraction of people accessing your comments or other "stalking." It didn't show people who legitimately voted on content by viewing your content in its original context having arrived there from your userpage.		So, this curiosa didn't mean anything. You knew that one or two people or bots were following you around, but you had no idea about the potential 10 others who didn't indicate to you that they were.		Further, there was nothing to worry about because their voting behavior wasn't impacting sorting at all.		---		So, as a mod, why is it important for you to see fuzzing? Answer: it's not. Your behavior is the typical user-case the admins want to stop because you were wasting your time on identifying "stalkers" that the system had already taken care of. I'm sure you can confer with your co-mods in /r/worldnews who were involved in the situation that took place before /r/technology was undefaulted. They will tell you that when voting behavior and brigades affect score, when things aren't fuzzed, that people are banned. That happens when groups of people downvote-stalk in ways to avoid vote fuzzing. In the scenario of fuzzed votes, the admins don't need to do anything because the situation is automatically resolved.		So, your use is **the** type of use the admins wanted to stop by removing fuzzed votes because you were wasting your time on something meaningless, and you thought that was an important part of moderating small subreddits.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hansjens47","name":"t1_cih5ll1","parent_id":"t1_cih5b0e","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1403770165,"created_utc":1403741365}
{"body":">The majority of "stalkers" don't indicate that they've been on your profile follow you around or whatever.		Maybe not. But my concern is with the ones who do. Yes, it's the internet, anyone can look and see what I've written. My concern is with the people who take the next step and act.		It's not uncommon for someone from an anti-women or anti-feminist sub to get angry about a user commenting on one of the various women's or feminist subs. And to go to their profile. And to downvote everything on the profile and then follow them to other, related subs and start derailing there. 		As a mod, I don't have time to go check the profile out of everyone who comes to my sub and breaks a low level rule. But if I notice there has been a lot of fuzzed voting recently, I'll check out the most recent new commenters. If one participants comments are fuzzed in particular, we'll make sure to pay attention to their activity, and be proactive about trolls. 		And we ask users who notice that someone came after all of their recent comments, or who got a nasty PM, and think that it was prompted by a recent contribution to our sub to let us know, so that we can check things out. Some stalkers get annoyed by something someone said and look for a recent person post or comment so they can reply nastily and when they get a response back, or a ban, that's when they up things by sending PMs. If we've noticed that the person's comments have been vote fuzzed, and we are therefore watching their stuff, we can often catch the comment and delete it and ban the person before anyone replies. They may send us angry modmail, but we often save people from a harassing PM. 		Proactive moderation is not easy, and it's incredibly timestaking. Vote fuzzing was one of a few tools that was great for giving us a heads up as to when something was going to happen. It allowed us to coordinate, ask mods to subscribe particular threads, or watch for certain behaviour. Sure, fuzzing isn't always a predictor. Sometimes there's fuzzing, but no drama. Sometimes there is drama, but no fuzzing. But I'd say that at *least* 80% of brigades and stalker situations had fuzzing beforehand. 		>In the scenario of fuzzed votes, the admins don't need to do anything because the situation is automatically resolved.		Dude, this is not about karma. I could not give a flying fuck about my karma or anyone else's. They are magic internet points good for a few cents via bitcoin. That's it. I do care about the subs I moderate and making sure that mods can stay on top of stuff. Prevent problems before they get bad, hopefully prevent some of our users from getting creepy PMs. Keep our users feeling safe. 		I'm not an idiot. I get how the internet works, I know people can read my profiles and stay invisible. I don't care about karma. When I say that this badly affected me as both a user and a mod and you don't understand how, have the fucking courtesy to ask. You assumed I was lying, an idiot and a narcissist.

Reddit isn't losing millions a year (though they aren't turning a profit either), and there is no reason for investors to be pressuring the website to start making money now at the risk of running the company into the ground. As the Internet stands today, there is not much profit if at all in websites like Twitter or Reddit, but the fact that there is so much traffic flow makes way for the possibility of a future profit that these investors don't want to miss out on. That also means that these websites are worth **a lot** (in the billions), just not making anything now. Some think this is another tech bubble. 		Forcing the website to turn a profit now is only going to hurt traffic flow, the only thing that gives these websites their insane value. So it's at least in my opinion that Reddit admins wouldn't have made this change unless they actually thought and believed that it would be for the betterment of the community and website. It wasn't on a whim, or because of a honestly minor change to the ads (why wouldn't they just remove up/down votes strictly for ads or just create more ad space instead of removing end-user functionality?

Since RES is touted as the be-all and end-all addon for Reddit, and spammed in almost every thread, very many new users install it. Without knowing about the fuzzing, this generated a ton of noise over the portrayed negativity. Comments like "Downvotes?

Until these issues have been addressed, I don't see the vote counts coming back. I don't buy the "hail retail" conspiracies people make.		While at it, I also think that there is too much other noise about things unrelated to the thread/article.

Also, there should be a difference between self-tagged comment and tag from other users.

Then someone could come up with a plugin that linked the ones you like together, so that it feels like one website like each subreddit doesn't feel like a separate forum, but part of the whole. Then if you don't like the way one admin handles things, you could remove it from your list, and if someone else tells you about another reddit-clone they like, you could add it. And somewhere could be a master-list of reddit clones so not everything has to be word-of-mouth.		Sounds like a neat idea.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"OakTable","name":"t1_cii1rom","parent_id":"t1_cihx6ha","subreddit":"announcements","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0ij","created":1403855145,"created_utc":1403826345}
