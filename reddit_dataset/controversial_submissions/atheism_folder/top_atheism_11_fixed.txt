Someone making minimum wage just doesn't give a shit, because there are plenty more jobs out there paying at least that.		Not sure where your from with those job trees, but you should bottle that shit and sell it. 		And that's exactly the fucking point. If food service wants it's employees to give a shit, they have the responsibility to pay them better. *Not the customer*. You ask later on in I don't care about the customer. I absolutely do. But I also care about the worker, the person you apparently think is not actually a person, but an expense that must be incentivized through a bullshit system built to make them deal with essentially being at the whim of random customers. 		An employee contracts with an employer. They pay their employer for a steady wage. Their payment is in the form of profit for the employer. The tipping system perverts that system and insulates the employer from their share of the contract. They no longer concern themselves with the expense of their employees, and only reap the profits. The employer is forcing their part of the contract onto the customer. Which creates a complete lack of stability for the employees. 			>The more a person makes, the more they want to maintain the job.		Exactly. If you want good employees, you pay good wages. Not a quarter of minimum wage and rely on a bullshit tipping culture to insulate you from your responsibility as an employer. 			>If it were, over the phone customer service would be equal to waiter customer service; and it's clearly not.		This is such a bullshit non-answer it's not with addressing beyond calling it out as such. 		>Call Comcast sometime.		We've already been over this and the company's lack of incentives to provide good customer service and their actual incentives to not. 		>Why is this different from 'wage culture'? If you do a poor job at work, will you not be fired? How is this different, except it's the customer who decides your fate rather than the company; or your boss who has a problem with you being taller, or homosexual, or a blonde? It democratizes your paycheck.		Already went over why. I sell my labor to an employer for a steady paycheck and protection from the risk. They buy it from me for the profit my work brings to them. What this does is removes their responsibility from their end of the deal while they still benefit from it. 		Some things shouldn't be democratized. Paychecks are at the top of this list. 			>Yes, and in food service the better you are the more you are paid. 		Bullshit. I could be the greatest waiter in the world. If I'm working midnights at Denny's, I'm not living in anything better than a basement studio apartment. 		>People get weeded out or stay naturally, rather than because you're the right person's cousin or you offended the wrong person at a party.		This is true in any job. 			>I don't know how you can argue that a better wage is preferable, which is what good customer service provides, and that a consistent paycheck is better for the customer in the same paragraph.		A stable, good wage is better than an unstable one with the potential to be better than good at times. 		>Or do you simply not care about the customer?		Already addressed this. I do care about the customer. However, it's not my job as a customer to pay a person's wages. It's my job to be provided a good or service. It's the employer's job to pay a wage to their employees that creates incentives for them to work.

Atheists like me are commonly told by believers that we're not like "other atheists" and that they like us. They tell us we're different. Do you know why that is? Because they don't know any other atheists personally. We're not different; they're just ignorant. It's the same thing as a racist saying they can't stand any black people but their one black friend. Ignorance and fear breeds hate.		BTW, I started the Atheist Society of Kern to help others feel supported and confident enough to speak in our community. We're 300+ strong because it means something to people. Every day someone new joins because we chose to wear a tshirt or openly challenge religious privilege in public. So I sit with large groups of people, in local establishments, in an extremely religious part of the country, to be exactly what you despise. 		Our efforts do something. What does your lack of effort do? Nothing. 		But by all means, keep telling me how I'm wrong and lonely and pathetic.
