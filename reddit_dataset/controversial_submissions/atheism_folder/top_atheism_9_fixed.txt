{"body":"I think you're conflating concepts here. Perhaps the easiest way to illuminate this is by referring to Aristotle's [four causes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes). What you're referring to is either "efficient cause" (what resulted in life/lifeforms -- that is apart from abiogenesis, consumption, and the myriad of other processes that are necessary for life to exist/form/survive/propagate) and/or "formal cause" (a statistical tendency of living creatures, but poorly thought out since living without reproducing is hardly unusual). What's being discussed is a  "final cause" (motive/purpose aka. reason). Even if arguments for reproduction being the efficient/formal cause panned out (which it's not quite clear that they do in any meaningful way), it wouldn't amount to a "reason" -- certainly not in the sense that it's being discussed. If you really are claiming that reproduction is the "final cause", you're going to need to supply an argument, and my guess is that you would not be able to supply one that's going to be sound/convincing.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Glayden","name":"t1_cn0kmv0","parent_id":"t1_cn0g2yx","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1419096430,"created_utc":1419096430}
