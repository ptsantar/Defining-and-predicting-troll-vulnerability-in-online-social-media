{"body":"Here's the thing. You said a "Geospiza Magnirostris is a  bird."	Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.	As someone who is a real life tattooed, atheist, scientist who studies birds, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Geospiza Magnirostris just "birds". If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.	If you're saying "atheist, tattooed bird family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from Geospiza Parvula to Geospiza Fortis to Certhidea Olivacea.	So your reasoning for calling a Geospiza Magnirostris a "bird" is because le random people "call this sweet ass atheist scarification a "bird"?" Let's get Geospiza Fortis and Certhidea Olivacea	 in there, then, too.	Also, calling someone an atheist or an evolutionist? It's not one or the other, that's not how /r/atheism works. They're both. A Certhidea Olivacea	is a Certhidea Olivacea and a member of the bird family. But that's not what you said. You said a Certhidea Olivacea	is an atheist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the bird family devil worshiping atheists, which means you'd call puffins, flying squirrels, and chick-fil-a neckbeards, too. Which you said you don't.

Its ok to ask, evolution without natural selection is not evolution. We were taught evolution from the primordial soup, through DNA synthesis, replication, protein synthesis and mutations. And how they lead to changes in phenotypes. Also we were taught how the combination of environmental factors and genetic factors directly affect the phenotypes that we observe in life.

Religious apologists and philosophers are no friends of empiricism. I was trying to point at the hypocrisy they tolerate for making good PR products.		>Its ok to ask, evolution without natural selection is not evolution.		That's how many schools teach it. They basically teach the tree of life, but omit the story of life, which is how you understand the tree of life, genetics and so on. It's all very neatly compartmentalized.		>Also we were taught how the combination of environmental factors and genetic factors directly affect the phenotypes that we observe in life.		I'm glad for you, I didn't get that in my experience, but let's not compare anecdotes. It would be nice to have some Catholic school standard curriculum for biology to inspect.		>" human sexuality and the science and technology of stem cells" those are good points you bring that need inmediate attention by the church and I am there with you on those.		I'm saying that there's a pattern of the Church and religious apologists denying or twisting science when they don't like the science and gladly accepting it when it doesn't bother them. And while the Catholic Church and some others may be more vague about it, that doesn't even mean the believers will accept it at such.

{"body":"You're going to make me quote the things, aren't you? I didn't think I'd have to quote the things. 		(But you're right, I really don't understand why they believe the bullshit that they do. I understand that they had to, of course, at one point, on fear of death or worse. But now? Laziness, I guess?)		That said, with respect to the Adam and Eve story, the words are pretty unambiguous.   		And I quote: (from Catholic.com) 		**The Catholic Position**		It is impossible to dismiss the events of Genesis 1 as a mere legend. They are accounts of real history, even if they are told in a style of historical writing that Westerners do not typically use.		**Adam and Eve: Real People**		It is equally impermissible to dismiss the story of Adam and Eve and the fall (Gen. 2???3) as a fiction. A question often raised in this context is whether the human race descended from an original pair of two human beings (a teaching known as monogenism) or a pool of early human couples (a teaching known as polygenism). 		In this regard, Pope Pius XII stated: "When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. **For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains either that after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parents of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents.** Now, it is in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the teaching authority of the Church proposed with regard to original sin which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam in which through generation is passed onto all and is in everyone as his own" (Humani Generis 37). 		The story of the creation and fall of man is a true one, even if not written entirely according to modern literary techniques. The Catechism states, "The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but affirms a primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man. Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first parents" (CCC 390). 		...and there I end the quote. 		Maybe I'm reading that wrong - feel free to enlighten me. In addition to fucking off, of course.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"section111","name":"t1_ck74126","parent_id":"t1_ck73f4x","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1409673743,"created_utc":1409670143}

{"body":"Fun fact:	>Darwin's finches comprise a group of 15 species endemic to the Gal??pagos (14 species) and Cocos (1 species) Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The group is monophyletic and originated from an ancestral species that reached the Gal??pagos Archipelago from Central or South America. Descendants of this ancestor on the Archipelago then colonized Cocos Island. A [study](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/299.full) identifies the grassquit genus Tiaris, and specifically the species Tiaris obscura, as the nearest living relative of Darwin's finches among the species surveyed. Darwin's finches diverged from the Tiaris group shortly after the various extant species of Tiaris diverged from one another. The initial adaptive radiation of the Tiaris group apparently occurred on the Caribbean islands and then spread to Central and South America, from where the ancestors of Darwin's finches departed for the Gal??pagos Islands approximately 2.3 MYA, at the time of the dramatic climatic changes associated with the closure of the Panamanian isthmus and the onset of Pleistocene glaciation. -*From [On the Origin of Darwin's Finches](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/299.full)*","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"archibaldjw","name":"t1_ck66l9g","parent_id":"t3_2f4to6","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1409576188,"created_utc":1409572588}

It still shows 33% for all Americans, which is pretty damn high considering it's 2014.

I agree it's silly. And the vast majority of atheists know better than to make that mistake.		>why else has this tattoo which has been posted in /r/athiesm recieved over 1500 upvotes?		How is criticizing creationism synonymous in your mind with making generalizations about *all theists?* See, this is the problem. I see it all the time in /r/atheism. Someone posts something criticizing a specific instance of religious stupidity. And then we get a hundred believers saying, "Why are you saying *all religious people* are guilty of this?" Nobody said that! Stop being so fucking defensive that you're hearing generalizations where there aren't any.

I don't know where you fall on the belief spectrum be it theist, agnostic, atheist, or whatever else. I do however understand why some people are a bit proud of their atheism. Growing up I was never forced to be religious but I was at least somewhat encouraged. I live in the bible belt south so even if every person you meet isn't a fire and brimstone type, you'll probably have a few religious friends and your parents may use the bible as justification for something here or there. EX: "Don't lie to me, god will know and punish you!" For me and I suspect a lot of us our being atheist reflects what I will loosely call a spiritual journy. It is not spiritual in the sense of being supernatural so much as we completely re-evaluated life as we knew it.  While not everyone has the same results for me personally this lead to me becoming far, far more reflecting on situations, people, and why things are the way they are. It encouraged me to look at situations differently, become more skeptical, and understand that my own perceptions are very fallible. It also caused me to be at least somewhat sympathetic to people who disagree with me or my stances, it caused me to reflect on my position in life and how my parents money and views impacted my own upbringing and growth as a human being. To say that I am an atheist doesn't automatically make me more rational, it doesn't automatically make me more intelligent, nor kinder or better than anyone else. My experiences and journy to becoming a nonbeliever and a skeptic have been a very defining point in my life that I am proud of and in many ways is reflected when I say, "I'm an atheist."		Not everyone can honestly say that about themselves and I think a lot of people would simply hope you'd infer that from them saying they are atheist as a means of gaining credibility. With that said, I think religion is harmful. I do not think we should start burning churches or outlaw religion, but it seems like we do direly need to educate people. Then again I may have just single handedly made myself into the thing you're complaining about.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NicoleTheVixen","name":"t1_ck64xm5","parent_id":"t1_ck64qjb","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1409567110,"created_utc":1409563510}
