In the case of logic, an atheist must indeed be a skeptic, as there must be an axiom for them to base their atheism on, and an axiom cannot be well rooted without evidence to support that conclusion. In this way, logical atheists are skeptics.		In the case of emotion, an individual may feel discomfort with organized religion (or religion in general) due to various tenets. However, these tenets one feels uncomfortable with (or at least in the cases I've encountered) is due to unfounded or unsupported statements, such as saying, 'X must do this because Baal says so'. If a unfounded statement is disliked, the emotion is likely a recoiling to the lack of evidence behind it.		Now, of course, I am ignoring those who are simply atheists without having encountered organized religion. These cannot be categorized because they did not necessarily come to the atheism conclusion by things they observed.		If someone is on r/atheism, they likely came to this conclusion by encountering outside experiences, so I believe I can safely say most r/atheism users are skeptics.		edit: probably something I missed in my logic, smartphone is not the best format for making arguments		edit 2: downvotes? really?

Kindness is such a powerful strategy because most of the religious teachings are permeated with the stuff and... not that many religious folks actually practice it. 		One funny way to do this to a christian friend/colleague is to invite them in teaming up for volunteering at a soup kitchen or helping with a shelter and suggest that it would be a great opportunity for them to practice what Jesus instructed in Matthew 25:34-36.

{"body":"Thank you for your respectful and thoughtful response. 	I am sorry that religion had such a negative impact on your life, congratulations on your escape/survival of what sounds like a truly terrible system of beliefs. 	 		I understand your point about what your lack of belief symbolizes, and I respect that. I suppose the issue I take with the symbolism of atheism specifically is that people tend to attribute qualities to atheism that it does not inherently have. This may mean that people ascribe to atheism logic, anti-theism, or escape from brainwashing, but also could mean that people associate it with evil, hatred, or immorality. By creating a precedent for giving meaning to atheism that it does not have, one opens the door for others to do the same. 	 	I agree that my examples were poor. They were not well thought out and hastily implemented for the emphasis of a point. My apologies. 		 	However, I will offer a different example. If someone has been the victim of rape, they may afterwards decide to abstain from sex all-together. For that person abstinence represents survival of a terrible ordeal. It would be understandable if they got a tattoo that said "abstinent and proud." However, this tattoo could easily be misinterpreted by other people who would view it with whatever preconceived biases they held towards abstinence. Indeed, some people may even attack them for their stated beliefs. The issue arises from abstinence meaning different things to different people. In this example the person may have been better served by saying they were proud of surviving their ordeal, rather than affixing that pride to a different, albeit related, aspect of their lives.	 	This is why I brought up humanism. I may not have expressed myself clearly, but my point was that as a community brought together by our happenstance common lack of belief we should display symbols of those things that are closer to what we believe  or take pride in, rather than a description of something we don't have.		 	For me I would happily state, advertise, and support my staunch stance on the [separation of church and state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Creation), my belief that religions are outdated and [toxic](http://i1.cpcache.com/product_zoom/691530756/religion_is_toxic_bumper_sticker.jpg?height=250&width=250&padToSquare=true) organizations that hurt more people than they help, or my support of [human agency and critical thought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism).

You can't know of his life experiences or what he has been through. Just be a little more open minded about these things before first passing judgement.		Even regarding atheism itself; you just say it's a lack of something (belief in religion). Personally this is just one facet of what atheism means for me. Another facet includes caring about people and treating them the same regardless of race, gender, age, social status etc. The ability to do this does not come from a lack of something but rather the addition of something; my own morals that I've grown up with, from my friends and family, and more to the point, from seeing the effect of actions performed in the name of religion and thinking about moral right and wrong.

No. Some religions say that getting a tattoo is wrong for religious reasons. I just don't see how not having faith is any different than anything else people pride themselves in.

But merely having the tattoo doesn't automatically mean all those things you say it means. I'm a middle-aged man who has nothing to prove to anybody. I happen to like tattoos. Some tattoos I have gotten are located specifically so nobody can see them (unless I want you to see them). Last year I got a tattoo with an "atheism" theme, and I certainly didn't do it to rebel against my parents (who are in their 70's). I liked the artwork. It means something to me. Part of me hopes that it will be a reminder to my loved ones when I die that I don't want some churchy funeral service. But I got it for me because I liked the artwork. Yea, OP's motives seem a little more "judgeable" because he/she put it online.

Doing so does not impart any sort of "standard" set of beliefs, only a forum that allows like-minded individuals to find community. Most of these atheist groups have as their central role to operate as activist advocates as a bulwark against the perceived encroachment of religion in public spheres like the science classroom or publicly-funded courthouses. In that respect they serve as a sort of special interest group, and they in fact can be thought of as more that sort of organization than a religious one. Many special interest groups may include religious adherents, but the focus of them tend to be political. The various atheist organizations tend to be of this variety. Any that are focused away from this and towards organizing some sort of established dogma are very much on the fringe and do not represent mainstream atheism.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EricGorall","name":"t1_cpp501e","parent_id":"t1_cpp447m","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427213880,"created_utc":1427210280}

{"body":"Sure. Broadly speaking claiming you're an atheist is exactly how you describe: a non-belief conclusion. Essentially there are two questions that handle two aspects of religion: knowledge and belief. Saying you're an atheist or a theist is essentially a belief claim, while agnosticism/gnostism is a knowledge claim. So, me saying I'm an atheist is proclaiming that I conclude that given the evidence (whatever collection that includes), I don't believe there is a god (any god). This is a belief claim. The knowledge claim may be: If enough evidence comes to light to swing me to the other side, I am open to having my mind changed (however unlikely). In so far as I do not have 100% knowledge (partially because I'm limited by my senses, my learning and my experiences), it is possible that I don't have a complete understanding (knowledge) of reality. In that sense, I have to admit from a knowledge standpoint I am agnostic. So, I'd contend that there really are only two types of people in reality: agnostic atheists and agnostic theists. 		Now, to your larger point: For many people (as in Europe, as an example), nobody really worries about whether there is a god or what flavor his is if he exists. It just doesn't really have any relevance, most particularly if you don't believe. However, for all the advancements the US comes up with, in some respects there are some segments of the population that cannot break emotionally from a conservative past and in fact have great pride in that tradition. So, in this country the religious battle is actively being fought. With 80% of the electorate falling under the "believer" category legislators find during election time that they must participate in a litmus test over who is most truly religious, and when introducing legislation religious motivations often guide what is being voted on by fellow party members. Religiously-minded educators want their views reflected in education, and particularly in the case of science textbooks, have them edited to remove areas that they feel threaten that worldview (like Evolution Theory). As a reaction/defense, the minority (atheists, freethinkers, or even liberal Christians), recognize the danger this represents and fight back against the encroachment. So, some of us feeling under assault on several levels feel we have to come out in vocal (or in this case: a tattoo), opposition proclaiming that not everybody is a Christian in this nation. For them everything is an absolute certainty, though I contend that is a belief claim and not a knowledge claim and they're not understanding that. They want absolute answers and so when they frame their arguments in absolute terms, they are confusing belief claims with knowledge claims. 		A strong atheist is someone that claims that there absolutely can't be a god. A weak atheist is someone who claims a non-believe but openness to be persuaded otherwise if enough evidence comes around to counter that non-belief. I personally think distinguishing between them is silly and probably serves the needs of conservative theists in their apologetics more than anyone, and for the same reason that they think someone calling themselves agnostic means "I just don't know". The implication is that given their certainty (what I claim is a belief and not a knowledge claim), that someone "admitting" they're a "weak atheist" or "agnostic" can be persuaded to belief. They just don't understand, is my contention (neither the implications of the definitions, nor the honesty of not having absolute knowledge).","depth":9,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EricGorall","name":"t1_cpq41cu","parent_id":"t1_cppquyf","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427287221,"created_utc":1427283621}
