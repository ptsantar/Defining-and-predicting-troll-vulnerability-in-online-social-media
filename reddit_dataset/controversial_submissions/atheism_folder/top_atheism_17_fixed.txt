I honestly don't know how well ZQ's game plays, it's about depression and the steam page makes it clear it's not supposed to be fun so probably pretty poorly, it's also fucking free so who gives a shit. What has happened and I do actually care about, is a bunch of nutters seem to think who she slept with was an excuse to run her out of her home.  And then decided to do the same thing to Sarkesian, who had literally nothing to do with any supposed ethics arguments and just made them feel uncomfortable and sad.  I don't think her arguments are perfect, they are also irrelevant to the point at hand.  Which is that GG was used as a weapon to attack her.

If you want to take an actual look at gaming report ethics, realize first that your 'reporters' aren't actually reporters, they are more like Bill Oreilly or Chris Mathews, not your evening news hour drone from your local fox channel. Commentators that sometimes give you news, the gaming world doesn't produce enough actual news for there to be somebody at every publication 24/7 generating articles about it.  So as with all commentators, get multiple viewpoints, because theirs will not always line up with your own.

For example a Buddhist and a Christian cannot be both right.  Each one of the core beliefs of both deem the other fiction.

Trying to wave your hands in the air calling yourself evolved because you think you've magically reconciled the core elements of these beliefs just makes you come off as a pompous douche that really doesn't understand what tolerance is.  		It really just boils down to the fact that as an atheist, my disagreement with the core beliefs of the religious is explicitly baked in the name, so it makes it harder to ignore for theists.  So their aversion to symbols of atheistic nature is really a problem for their tolerance not mine.  I tolerate symbols of other's faiths many times everyday.

{"body":"And that's fine.  My original comment was not about the shirt nor about the validity of religion or the lack thereof, just want to make that clear.  I'm specifically commenting on the previous post that said "If you have a religion, then you're saying that all others are fiction".  To me that seems like a logical fallacy, as that is a specific attribute of fundamentalism, and not ALL religious doctrines. 		Fundamentalism has the strict definition of "the demand for a strict adherence to orthodox theological doctrines".  While a religious person can take a fundamentalist approach to a religion, not all religious people take a necessarily take a fundamentalist approach to their practice.		I see sometimes that when considering those who are religious, some atheists automatically pigeonhole ALL of them as fundamentalists. And when considering the definition of the word, it's a false generality.  That's all I was trying to call out. I don't care to comment on the shirt.		I think fundamentalism has more to do with an ego-driven black/white view of the world, where it is necessary for the ego to identify itself with a doctrine and thus defend the doctrine like one would defend their very being.  That's more of a tribal type attitude than an attitude who considers various sides of reality and has no need to attach its identity to a particular doctrine. 		Also, my use of the word "evolution" (or evolved person) refers particularly to the scale of evolutionary cognitive development of humans according to spiral dynamics. In tribalism, the person's main drive is to survive and thus fundamentalism becomes the reality within that evolutionary category.  In the category of rationality, the person's main drive is for rational truth and thus the religious person within this category does recognize that not everyone is right, and as a free individual, they make their own decision on what doctrines to follow.  		I don't think we're necessarily disagreeing here, I just think that perhaps we're coming from different premises.

{"body":">You didn't seem to have a problem up until a minute ago		Actually it was 3 hours ago when I said this: "Context matters.

The only way you could genuinely believe that game theory is a suitable, relevant example to use here is if you completely ignore the context that I mentioned above. The underlying context is undeniable. Ignoring it is cheap and intellectually dishonest. Your prisoners' dilemma example was nothing other than a Red Herring fallacy. You were just so desperate to find something, anything, that you could use to dispute what I was saying to make you feel like you weren't fighting a losing battle, that you got tunnel vision and simply forgot what we were talking about.		>you even made yourself out to understand it better than me... Which is, of course, ridiculous so long as you make that assertion.		insecurity issues much?			> it'd be really stupid of me to try to prove how science and atheism aren't intrinsically		I wasn't asking you to prove a negative. You made a claim, *"Conflating atheism and science is as dumb as saying religion and science as intrinsically linked*". This is the opposite of the truth. I pointed that out, rather easily with some stats. All you had to do was come up with a reasonable argument why my points were invalid. You didn't.		>I don't think you've really done much to prove it either		The stats I gave are true. The correlation is far too strong for it to be random. I gave a logically sound reason for the correlation that you could not dispute. You did not provide any alternatives to explain that correlation. It depends on your definition of proof, but for the standard that's fair in these circumstances - beyond all realistic doubt - it has been proven.		>Even you yourself said at best "It's at least worthy of investigation"		No. I didn't say "at best". At *worst* it's worthy of investigation, and that's just so it's not seen as lazy to make the only obvious conclusion immediately without providing cursory justification first.		>I already mentioned that there were two MASSIVE scientific movements spurred by religion		Actually, no, you didn't mention that in this conversation. And no, it's not true. Christianity does not spur scientific movements. Religion actively discourages its followers from investigation, questioning of one's environment, or scientific inquiry. It claims God and the bible is the only answer you need. Individuals who *happened* to be religious or been a part of the church may have spurred scientific movements, but that's despite their religion, not because of it.		So no, that's not a "solid counterpoint", and yes, I already addressed it hours ago at the start of this thread.","depth":19,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_ckx4awj","parent_id":"t1_ckx2bg7","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1412134290,"created_utc":1412130690}
