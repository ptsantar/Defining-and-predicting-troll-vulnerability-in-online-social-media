{"body":"> What you've bolded is an excellent example of why it is incorrect unless you are attempting to be derogatory, "... with the intention of conversion."		After holding this discussion with another here, I will admit that my comment relied upon some mildly inaccurate assumptions. But I believe you are completely wrong in your assumption that this is only correct unless one is 'attempting to be derogatory.'		Atheism is an incredibly broad concept. I believe that it's appropriate to break it down into two groups:		A [*strong/positive atheist*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_atheism) is someone who believes there are no gods. They profess to know that there are no gods. They actively hold the belief that there are no gods. Or, perhaps more appropriately, a [positive atheist.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_atheism)		A [*weak/negative atheist*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_atheism) is someone who lacks belief in gods, but they do not profess to know whether or not they exist. *This* is the circumstance in which your argument holds true.		There is also a potential overlap with agnosticism and other non-theistic beliefs, but I think these are the ones we're primarily concerned with.		> many theists like to play fast and loose with certain words and how they're used. They like to attach labels to atheism, like 'dogmatic' atheists, in order to say, "see, you're pretty much just like us. You just beleive something else"		I'm not really concerned with how theists argue - just because they use words like 'evangelical atheism' or 'dogmatic atheists' does not mean they alone hold license to use them. Or, more specifically, it doesn't mean that these words do not hold meaning when a non-theist uses them. *Additionally,* just because a statement is derogatory does not mean it is being used 'out of context.' This is why we understand the concept of oxymorons, paradoxes, and irony - because they can be used to describe something without the exact definitions rendering them invalid. (And yes, I suppose it's ironic for me to bring that up, considering I am arguing the exact definition of the words...)		> If I say I 'believe' the sun is going to rise tomorrow morning, based on my understanding of the shape of this planet and it's movement relative to the Sun and the passage of time vs. someone else's statement that they believe in a god because they have 'faith', that those uses of 'believe' are congruent?		Absolutely, 100%, they are congruent in every meaning of the word. Here is the *exact* definition of belief:		>**belief**	>	>[ bi??l??f ] 	>	>noun	>	>noun: belief ?? plural noun: beliefs	>	>an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists:	>	>*"his belief in the value of hard work"*	>	>trust, faith, or confidence in someone or something:	>	>*"a belief in democratic politics"*		If one holds your first statement to be true (re: the sun), then it is a belief. If someone holds the second statement to be true (re: God), then it is a belief. Just because someone believes something does not mean that it is true, or that their reasoning is sound. But it is a belief nonetheless. So yes, both uses of the word 'belief' are congruent with the definition of the word belief.		> Furthermore, back to the billboard, the only definition of the use of evangelical that I think could be remotely applicable is "marked by militant or crusading zeal." and I don't see what of that billboard rises to that level.		This is a good point to argue. And this is what you should have argued at the beginning, rather than arguing whether or not the word was used appropriately. The context was appropriate to  While I'm disinclined to agree with you, it is much more rational than saying 'This word is only able to be used when it is being used in a derogatory manner.'		In regards to the billboard, I don't really have any strong feelings one way or another. But /u/Deggit's use of the words 'evangelical atheism' were appropriate to describe the fashion in which he believed this billboard was be displayed. Your argument should be geared more towards whether or not you believe this qualifies as 'evangelical atheism' *or* whether or not it is an appropriate tactic. Arguing that 'evangelical atheism' is not valid a valid concept is like trying to argue that the Sun isn't a star.","depth":11,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Moonchopper","name":"t1_cmncoyn","parent_id":"t1_cmmlova","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1417912977,"created_utc":1417912977}

While I'm sure there are a few atheists that are willing to "profess" that there is no god, if you came to the position of atheism through reason, to state knowledge of something you can't know is somewhat ironic.

To say that someone 'actively holds a belief. . . that they don't believe something' is a strange and awkward statement.		Let me see if I can clear this up a little for you.

{"body":"Absolutely agree with you. Its difficult when you have conflict about preventing suffering.		I turned away from Christianity from reading the bible personally, and I do not accept a lot of the morality in it after studying it.		The concept of hell really made me think when I was a Christian.	When I began to question it morally, it seemed like the lines of "good and evil" were essentially blurred.		Thinking that others will be suffering forever while I had an eternal paradise left me with a gut wrenching feeling. Seeing so many painful things happen to others made me question why it ever happened in the first place. Then I began to question why it even had to happen. 		To me, non-existence is better than living for ever with a choice of two options: Burn in hell and suffer for eternity for being inquisitive and moral, or live in heaven and know that other people you either knew or could have befriended are experiencing terrifyingly excruciating pain while I live in enjoyment.		I can't accept hell, or christianity's god for allowing it/creating anything in the first place knowing that those he loved will forever suffer in agony for failing to follow the translated assumptions of his followers.		If anything, my feelings of intense empathy have turned me away from god, on top of research and debate.		Church is indeed helpful to those who need that feeling of having someone to watch over them and need a community to help them with their struggles. However, assuming that I would accept him as a real being, the concept of hell and him being a jealous god who orders men women and children to be slaughtered for his people to have land, and promote the idea of slavery makes me defy his decisions proudly.","depth":7,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"razorripper","name":"t1_cmk6nt4","parent_id":"t1_cmk5j12","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1417635831,"created_utc":1417635831}

God is good, and created all things (by whatever means he chose)		2. Humans are *not* good, and often do what we know we shouldn't, despite the warnings of our hearts. 		3. Our misdeeds make us unfit to be in the presence of the greatest good the universe has to offer, and deserve some kind of punishment. 		4. God himself loves us so much that rather than abandon us to our justly earned fate, he directly intervened, at great cost to himself, purely for our good. 		5. God does not desire that any should perish, but wants *all* to come to repentance. 		6. In order to gain that union with God, you must make a conscious choice to accept the offer that God has put on the table, and to turn away from the misdeeds that put you in your position of need in the first place.

It is more the opposite even.  They are NOT confrontational, they are NOT aggressive, and absolutely insecure about the situation and talking about it at all.

{"body":"Alright guys, I hope someone can explain this to me, and maybe it's because I'm from one of the most liberal countries in the world, where religion doesn't matter, but why? Why put up a billboard? I mean, yes I am an atheist, yes I think it's foolish to believe there is an invisible, almighty being that watches and controls our every move, but why? What do they want to achieve with a billboard? I for one have never seen religious billboards, besides the ones on the church itself.		What message is this trying to send across? Does this actually work, a sign? Is the faith of some people so weak that a sign makes them change their mind about such a fundimental part of their life? Maybe this is too because my image of the world, but I would think that in the USA there is no social obligation to believe in god? I mean, it might be expected of you by your family, but not by society right? I might come off a bit offensive, but please don't take it the wrong way. I just try to understand, why the billboard, and why this message? Because if a church does this I understand, they need followers to survive, but with atheism that's not the case, atheists don't need a community to thrive, we don't give money to an atheist community, so why the need to convert? This is something I especially don't like about religious, that need to convert, just let me not  believe in peace, and I will let you believe in peace, but this doesn't make us any better...

{"body":"When I was 14 my Dad's parents came up to visit us for the winter holidays (we live quite a distance apart). They're the sort of fair-weather Christians who attend church on Easter and X-mas and maybe 4 random Sundays a year.  	They insisted that we go down to the church as a family on Christmas Eve. I said I didn't want to go. I had just come out to my family as gay and it was a weird time for me. I said going to Church made me feel uncomfortable *considering*.  	My Dad took me aside and told me that if I didn't suck it up and go down that he'd take pleasure in giving my x-mas presents to poor kids. I tried to explain to him that I just did not want to go to Church and he told me not to be such a brat.  	I caved.  	Now during this time I was going through my "goth phase" and my winter coat was a navy trench jacket. I certainly wasn't wearing my "sunday best". We travelled down in separate cars - my Dad didn't see what I was wearing til we got to Church.  	woooooooooo boy, he read me up down and under the ground right on the front porch of the Church saying "how dare you embarrass us by showing up like THAT." and "JUST WAIT TIL WE GET HOME."  	Even at such a young age, I could understand the irony.  	All was made right in the universe, however.  	As we sat down we were told that they'd just fostered an Iraqi refugee and he wanted to "sing the glory of God" for us.  	I've never heard a worse singer in my life. I'm not even joking.  	Not a single note was on tune, his voice was cracking left-right-and-center (we watched his ball drop in real time).  	He absolutely *murdered* several Christmas favorites.  	(Imagine singing "*oh siiiii-o-lent niiight* and then he does his own back up vocals *Night, night, night*, each night on a different key)  	I was **delighted**.  	It was like watching a reel of the worst AI or X Factor auditions.  	I look down the pews and see every single person in the church grinding their teeth.

Some are also just youthful and in the rebellious stage that most teens/young adults go through.    	    	I'm glad if I was able to paint a more realistic picture of the diversity of thought and practice in the atheist community.

I have co-workers who grab your hand at the lunch table to pray over lunch. If I walk down the hall at work, people have crosses setup at the end of each hall. You see one moderate bill board and you feel so incensed you chose to express your thoughts. Now imagine seeing it over and over and over, every where you look. Imagine people coming up to discuss it with you or passing no less than 10 signs on your way home telling you how wrong you are. Imagine your world was flipped and everywhere you went - the majority beat with the message that you are a horrible, immoral unforgivable person who will be punished forever for not toeing the line. It is not that atheists care about god, it's that we can't get away from it.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"mdmcgee","name":"t1_cmk60ja","parent_id":"t1_cmk5ifm","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1417634752,"created_utc":1417634752}
