I'm paraphrasing the [wikipedia article here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure), and I'll admit I didn't read the entirety of all these studies, but in 1995, there was a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) that suggested there was a very literal difference in brain structure between MtFs and non-trans males. Controls were added, and everything was accounted for (FtMs, MtFs, and non-trans males and females were all in the study), and it was found that a region linked to sex and anxiety was female-sized in MtFs, and male-sized in FtMs. Which would mean that MtFs literately have more female bran, and FtMs have a more male brain. 		This was backed up in [2000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193), [2004](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15724806), [2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186), [2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980961), [2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024) and [2009](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19341803).

If you took a matching man/woman and changed their bodies, other than getting used to the physical differences, what would their main hurdles in adapting be? Mostly societal expectations right? At least that is what I would expect. If I were all of a sudden in a females body, I may be shorter, have less strength, have new parts to get used to, but my brain is still there. Could new hormone levels alter my brain? It likely will, enough to cause me to be a whole new person? Not really. My biggest change would be external stimuli.

{"body":"No, I get what you're saying. It is kind of a dartboard treatment, but it goes without saying that the brain is a really complex instrument. We don't have the way to know what kinds of drugs are best for each individual person, we can only make assumptions. So you're just kind of throwing darts at a wall in regards to things like anti-depressants. 		It's just that there happens to be just two (primary) sex hormones, so when a person is like "I feel like I'm trans", we ask them some questions, confirm they ARE feeling what they're feeling, and then give them the opposite sex hormone. Same process for depression, it's just that depression has more than one source, so there's multiple causes for it, and thus multiple solutions. Some are talking, some aren't.		And you're right, there wouldn't be many internal changes. It's the same as getting on anti-depressants -happier, more upbeat, etc etc - but the point is that trans people AREN'T okay with how society treats them. Enough to drive a lot of them to suicide. They know on an intrinsic level that they're the opposite gender - only they don't have any way to prove it. 		And if reality changes along with your body in the scenario you're presenting (in that nobody questions you magically becoming female, because from their viewpoint, you've always been female) you wouldn't either. You would know, internally, that you're a guy, but every time you brought it up to someone they'd just say "what, no, you have boobs, you're a girl!" or "I've always known you as a girl, why're you saying you're a guy now?" 		This is what trans people have to deal with every day they're not passing. They have to deal with people basically calling them by the incorrect name - as you would, in your scenario. And beyond that, as well. You would get comments like "oh, you're a girl, that's why you don't like x" or "that's why you're not good at x". Every single comment like that would remind you that society sees you as a girl, even though you know internally that you're a guy - just that nobody believes you. 		Maybe you'd be able to suppress the emotions that that brings, but people decide to transition because they can't hold up against that forever. Every time they get called their female name, every single time they get told "you can't do that, you're a girl!", there's a mental flinch. Annoyance turns to anger, and then sadness, and then depression, because they think that they're not good enough to be seen as the gender that they KNOW they are. But nobody believes them. 		There's also the peace of mind that having the right body brings them. Not for society, but for themselves. The ability to say "I LIKE my body, I WANT to be seen in this body" - that can do a lot for a person. But that's the same with any kind of body dysphoria.		So yeah, while it may seem like transitioning just changes how society sees you, it's a lot more complicated than that. People who transition are happy that they have a body that they like, and that society can regard them as who they always know they've been. Because like it or not, humans are social creatures, and society has a lot of effect on a person.		TL;DR: You may be able to hold up against the constant wear and tear that being told "you're female" over and over again would cause, but other people can't, and that's why they decide to transition. 		Regarding your other points, I think that no, if society was expected to be fat then there wouldn't be anorexics. And maybe people wouldn't have ever thought "hey, I feel like I'm a female" if there weren't gender roles. The point is that we don't know that hypothetical society, so all we can do right now is try to make everyone happy. If a person says that dressing as a female and getting on female hormones will make them happier, and a therapist (that knows the ins and outs of the human brain) can confirm it, then I say let them go for it.

A man can wear a dress and still be a man, he can have long hair and wear make up and wear fruity perfume. A woman can have short hair, pants, she can be a mechanic and chew tobacco. Some aspects of society may look strangely upon it, but it doesn't seem to be stopping millions of people.  And there are plenty of men and women who do that and aren't transgender. 		So what is causing transgender people to think they require those physical characteristics to break from the mold? 		Is it that they want to be treated like the opposite gender? Or they just want to look like it? Hasn't everyone thought about that, what an opposite sex version of them would look like? How would they be treated if they were a different sex, or race, or anything like that? 		And if they really want to have that other body, I go back to my original statement, why do people openly and unconditionally support that? I'd wager to guess the same people scoff at women who get plastic surgery, tan, change hair color constantly, etc. Look at the fat acceptance movement, where working out and eating right is seen as a bad thing. How often for the last couple decades have we all been flooded with "Love yourself" "Be happy with who you are!" "Don't change for other people!"...except if you are transgender, then you should go and have costly, irreversible surgeries and treatments which you will need to maintain the rest of your life. But a woman says she wants bigger boobs or a man is balding and all of a sudden they are shallow narcissistic idiots. 		The entire progressive view point on it all is just consistently inconsistent to me.  		And with what I said before, it just seems terrible to end the conversation at "Reassignment surgery is the best and only solution and it will be like that forever and anything to the contrary means you hate transgender people." That is just bad science and some states have even gone as far as to make it law that doctors can't even suggest or try anything differently.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"NodbuggerX","name":"t1_cq09xue","parent_id":"t1_cq08zam","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428094208,"created_utc":1428090608}
{"body":"The thing is, we CAN'T know if it's something that other people (who don't decide to transition) experience. We only know what's in our own heads. And yeah, gender roles are societal constructs. There's nothing stopping women from acting masculine and men from acting feminine - but those actions are going to be interpreted differently based on, well, to put it bluntly, whether or not a person has boobs. 		If a flat-chested person with facial hair is doing mechanic work, it'll be regarded as normal. They may even get a couple "good job"s and "I didn't know there was a problem there." While if a long-haired person with breasts works on a hair, society would immediately 2nd guess all of their work, say "oh, can't we get someone more qualified?" and stuff like that. I'd assume that vice versa goes for nurses. 		I think that trans people want to be able to be treated most of the time like they're 100% the gender they feel they fit in more with, and be judged based on that, and not through the lens of "that person is a man doing feminine things." There's a bunch of thought experiments for "proving you're trans" with stuff like "Would you be happier as a male millionaire or a middle-class female." Some people are going to answer based on the money, others are going to answer based on the gender. Neither one is wrong.		And maybe everyone has thought "oh, I wonder what life would be like if I was X, or Y, or whatever." We can't know, because we don't have mind reading devices. Trans people say "I wonder what would happen if X or Y", and then they realize "hey, I think I would be happier if I was male/female" rather than it just being a passing thought. And so they go to a therapist, talk it out, and the rest is history. As for an actual biological cause, I don't have one. The only thing that I can show you is the brain studies. But, to my knowledge, it's the same for a lot of different psychological disorders. We don't KNOW what causes depression, or schizophrenia, or anything like that. We can do MRIs and highlight abnormalities and develop chemicals that bring those in line with how society thinks it should be, but we can't point to a specific person and say "This person has a perfect brain and everyone's should be changed to be like theirs."		I haven't heard many opinions at all about plastic surgery - I think that might just be a different of generations thing, so I'm not equipped to comment on that. However, I think that what the fat acceptance movement and the transgender movement have in common isn't changing your body, it's happiness. Both want their "members" to be happy, and the difference is in how they're doing it. FA people are wanting society to change without changing themselves, and trans people changing themselves to fit society. Both have the end goal of happiness, and I would argue that trans people are more successful due to the fact that they're not expecting society revolves around them. 		It's easier to change 7 billion people's perception than it is their opinion. 		And I agree on your last point, as well. In the future, complete reassignment may NOT be the best solution. But right now, I can't see any other solution, and that's why I'm transitioning. 		EDIT: Just got the last part: I think that's actually kind of awful. If we have laws in place preventing change, then there's no growth.

From wikipedia (sex reassignment surgery)		Female to male:		Genital reconstructive procedures (GRT) use either the clitoris, which is enlarged by androgenic hormones (Metoidioplasty), or rely on free tissue grafts from the arm, the thigh or belly and an erectile prosthetic (Phalloplasty). In either case, the urethra can be rerouted through the phallus to allow urination through the reconstructed penis. The labia majora (see vulva) are united to form a scrotum, where prosthetic testicles can be inserted.			male to female		When changing anatomical sex from male to female, the testicles are removed, and the skin of foreskin and penis is usually inverted, as a flap preserving blood and nerve supplies (a technique pioneered by Sir Harold Gillies in 1951), to form a fully sensitive vagina (vaginoplasty). A clitoris fully supplied with nerve endings (innervated) can be formed from part of the glans of the penis.","depth":1,"score":23,"ups":23,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"allthepotato","name":"t1_cpzr1gt","parent_id":"t1_cpzqjfq","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428046693,"created_utc":1428043093}

Please read what I wrote:		>The only problems that really affect the everyday life of a trans* person are the problems brought on by other people being bigots.		Look at this thread. The OP was *disowned* for dating a transgendered man. *You* are convinced that they are sick and "spit in the face of biology." These are people who face *tons* of prejudice because their view on their *own personal gender* is different than what they were born with. It's not like they're going around trying to force sex changes on everyone, you know. They're trying to be more comfortable with *themselves.*		Can you honestly say that you don't understand *why* they might commit suicide more often? Do you think that only people with diagnosed mental illnesses commit suicide and "normal" people never do? Or do you realize that people who feel that much of the world has turned against them, who have been shunned by family and friends and mocked and hated by complete strangers, who have to see politicians who hate them get voted into office and try to make laws against them, may feel like they have nothing to live for. 		You want to know why transgendered people commit suicide at higher rates?
