While I agree that jjeezy's OP referred to the promise of a reward after death, but your response was not that kamikaze had no afterlife reward, but rather that they did it "for the emporer".

The shoulds, coulds, and woulds, if you follow, are no better than an infinite argument between two close minded members of each party. I use to be religious, I then started to learn, read, delve into the history of my race. Years later I'd find myself learning even more, how to distance myself from an argument to see the big picture without bias. How to think as another person for the sake of taking other perspectives into account. What I say is not out of spite, not out of irrational dislike, not out of uneducated rhetoric, what I say is hard, cold truths. Some people on this site are just here to hate on religion, and honestly with the amount of ridicule an atheist can suffer... especially in the bible belt where I live, a place to vent your frustrations is understandable. At the end of the day you can try to go into the "far greater depths" as you so eloquently try to put it, but all you will be left with is the need for one thing. Some call it faith, others call it blind devotion, regardless of what you call it our race needs to cast it aside and embrace our ability to know, to learn, to understand, to accept, and to move forward.

(something religion vivdly faught) 		Not that *religion* fought, it was the Catholic church, more specifically the heads of the Catholic church. The catholic church have done some terrible things in the past. 		Most atheists I've heard complain about religion often refer to things that the Catholic church was responsible for. And again I say, it wasn't the whole church, it was those in charge. I'm sure there were many catholics who didn't understand, for example, why they were asked for money in exchange for forgiveness of sin (among other things) because it isn't biblical. There were people like Martin Luther who saw the wrong doings, and so famously pinned everything that wasn't biblical to the church for everyone to see. He remained true to his faith *but* stopped being catholic.		For most of your arguments against the church, it can be drawn back to the leaders in charge, *not* religion.		Islam speaks against violence heavily, but *leaders* like Osama use specifics to make people fight for his agenda - specifics that when placed in the *entire* context of the scriptures do not in fact (for example) incite violence. 		You also speak as if *religion* makes people do bad things. I think what /u/Yserbius is saying is that it religion doesn't determine what people do, its their *own* ambitions, which is not governed by religion. The people who are against the US, like radical isalmists are not against America because the Quran says they must be against you, its because the people who think America is bad for whatever reason and want support to try take it down need others to adopt their own screwed mindset that does not express their religion's true ideas. 		You need to speak with understanding of reasoning, cause and effect (history), and an understanding of reality of the ideas vs what people perceive them to be or use them to achieve, not some simple misguided words like 'something religion vividly fought' - which as I mentioned above, *is highly incorrect.*","depth":3,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"darjamsin","name":"t1_clzdvoc","parent_id":"t1_clyme2u","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1415716233,"created_utc":1415716233}

This is plainly incorrect. Evolution is as much a fact as any you can name. *Natural selection* is the theory that explains the fact of evolution.

{"body":"This is exactly why I have an issue with people making out religion to be the sole reason for extremist actions. Antitheists will hold that all religious individuals (and all religion itself) are culpable for horrific acts that are perpetrated using the influence that religion holds over people. 		There are numerous religious people who are good, caring individuals without malice or evil intent, but they too must be assaulted under the anti-theistic banner. Their complacence in a deception must be punished as well, and they are morally culpable for the actions of all those who use religion as a tool for atrocity. There's a HUGE double standard that takes place when we're discussing this disparity, that I don't think anyone seems to realize. 		The scientists who created Zyklon B, Agent Orange, and the Manhattan Project are not representatives of all of science as a whole. The Westborough Baptist Church, and the Imams who preach hate are not representative of religion as a whole. 		My issue with what /u/TheDebatheist was saying, was the moral responsibility of ALL religious peoples in ALL acts of religious violence. It seems highly intellectually dishonest to apply one standard for moral responsibility to scientists (whose work has a real, demonstrable impact on certain events) and apply another to the preaching of clerics (whose influence is social, at best, and cannot be directly connected with the actions of another). Put more simply, the inventions that scientists create *enable* atrocities (a nuclear bomb could not be detonated without a nuclear bomb having been invented and created), whereas 9/11 could have conceivably been committed using some other justification (but obviously it was not).		The same level of judgement should be applied to both, if not more strictly to scientists, due to the enormous, demonstrable impact of their work.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KomradeKitsch","name":"t1_clyr7bm","parent_id":"t1_clyq2w6","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1415654845,"created_utc":1415654845}

"So if you don't give a fuck about what the religious people really do and you're only interested what the fundamentalists do: what is your standpoint?"		It was a reply that should be taken in context with your argument. This is my point. You're straw-manning. Disingenuous or stupid, I don't know. I'll put it in context. **I don't give a flying fuck what the average religious person is or does....** when discussing the doctrine and dogma of a religion. I was addressing a chunk of your continuing argument. The broad one that states that we should judge the religion based on the followers. Not so much by the fundamentalists or the holy texts. This is absolute tosh. Fucking clearly. When we're talking about what the religion is, what impact it has, it's ideology? The average moderate follower does not come into play.		I know religion has had a major part of our history. And if it never existed? *Butterfly effect blah blah blah how can this pretentious Atheist know if we would have been better off without it.* I'm not saying that it is ever going to be easy to eradicate religion. It may not even be entirely possible. Or that it isn't a part of our history, culture, or identity. I get that. But who gives a shit if they are? Arguing from tradition is so obviously bullshit, culture constantly changes (usually for the better) and more fair systems/ideologies/rules/etc should always trump an existing less fair one, and I understand that people find comfort in attaching their identity to a religion or political party. Or even a stance on an important issue. I couldn't give a shit, ultimately. What is right, trumps polite. I understand WHY people do it, but that doesn't mean I have to support it. You don't get to enforce harmful or less optimal shit in society just because diddums doesn't want their poor ickle feelings hurt. Fuck your feelings. Equality comes first before them, period. Recognise the impact of religion in our history and learn from it. Scream? Well that's one way to be heard I guess. But no. Though I would like to see an end to religion in general. One way to help get rid of the "evil acts" in humanity, is to destroy religion, as it's almost always a major source for it. Through reason logic and evidence. By peaceful means.		"Your last paragraph is a tautology: most people are religious of fucking course most murders will be committed by religious people for religious reasons - that is their life. Again, what is your solution? Bring a war upon them to show the good will of science?"		Fuck my fucking life. Listen. Please, lord Zeus have mercy, please fucking listen.		If a religious man committed a murder for non-religious reasons, then the religious doctrine isn't directly to blame, right? If he murdered someone FOR religious reasons though, then the doctrine should be held accountable to some degree.		So if a Muslim man murdered his neighbour because... he slept with his ex. He snapped, kill the guy. Religion had (seemingly) no part to play. Despite the murderer being religious.		If however a Muslim man murders his neighbour because... he heard some "Atheistic" music from next door? And therefore, came to the conclusion than it is (by divine orders in the Q'uran) that he should put the Atheist to rest and kill him, for Allah. Then religion is most definitely accountable.		Someone can have MULTIPLE traits, but it is the motive for the action (the negative, evil action in this case) that matters.		"Do you seriously believe that these folks you lump together as only being "religious" (which seems to be very close to your definition of "fundamentalist") has done nothing for human prospering? Your turn to pick up a fucking history book."		No I don't, and once again I have to reiterate that you're misrepresenting my position or belief.		Religious people have done much good, as have many non-religious people. But read my fucking lips. The RELIGION ITSELF, for the most part, has not. In fact, religion is responsible for practically endless horrific and atrocious acts in our history. Science though? That's done a FUCKLOAD of good for us.		Am I saying that there are ZERO cases of where religion has benefited us through history? Of course not. Since I do not have perfect knowledge, (so it would be impossible to prove that negative), and that you'd also have to define "benefit". Does a comforting lie count? And there may be cases where theology has been directly responsible for progress. None that I am aware of, but there might be.		I don't think Christianity is harmful because I see harmful Christians. It's because I've read their holy texts and the reasons cited for why these people do these things. Their entirely religious motives. And I think there is STRONG evidence to say that religion does more harm than good. By a long way. For science, the complete opposite.

{"body":"No they're not all necessarily "bullshit" but they are not sound arguments for inventing and developing nuclear weapons, imho.  Here are my counterpoints:		a) So eugenics was a good program, because it yields some scientific knowledge?  I can't agree with that, but maybe it's because of my subjective view on morality, right?		b) well that has worked, hasn't it?  that wasn't the point of building the bomb at all.  it was to establish military hegemony, and hold on to it.		c) this is somewhat of a poor analogy since there are no countermeasures, save for fallout strategies and post-apocalyptic preparation.  i suppose in the long run this could be helpful once nuclear annihilation has happened, but what is the point in justifying it in the first place?  I mean, let's not design a horrible disease that can wipe out a million people instantly, and hundreds of millions more (i know the atom bombs dropped in Japan killed about half that, but they were little ones compared to what humans have now) just so we can figure out how to treat everyone for radiation sickness and fix the resulting environmental devastation.  That's a little insane, right?  Your analogy would be better if nuclear weapons were a natural occurring thing, or created on accident.  I also find the creation of biological weapons for the sake of science to be deplorable and problematic for humanity to say the least.		d) the closest thing to that is nuclear energy, and the potential for a reactor that works like the sun, creating renewable energy through nuclear fission.  Though these are worthwhile scientific ideals, I feel for the endurance of the human race that pursuing cutting edge technology like fission reactors should be secondary to ending our disposition towards high intensity warfare or fighting over resources.  I can see in a future (and indeed it's been written in science fiction in different varieties) that when humanity has no need to use them on each other, they can use them to leave earth and pursue all those science fiction fantasies. So now and certainly not in the 1940s is not a good time to have nuclear weapons, and the illusion that perpetuating their inevitable production is a problematic one to justify.  Even now the production of them has halted, and nuclear energy is regarded as the only acceptable means for pursuing more knowledge about the science, we still have enough nuclear weapons to destroy humanity many times over.  And it's all for "defense" or mutually assured destruction.  		e) which brings us to your last point.  as a weapon.  so yeah, it's justified to kill hundreds of thousands of people instantly, and hundreds of thousands if not millions in the fallout.  because, self-defense. right?  I mean, let's not forget that the isolationist tyranny of DPRK is hinged upon sitting at the table of nuclear powers.  the hegemony of nuclear armed countries negotiates the political direction of the world.  so, how simple must the mindset be that in order to justify nuclear weapons, they must exist in the first place.  		Living under impending mass destruction is a constant.  Living in India or Pakistan, you live with the knowledge that if the government collapses or somebody get a hold of a nuclear device that you can easily be obliterated without a moment's notice.  and then it's all out warfare.  		But it's for science, right?  We could potentially benefit from the knowledge of it right?  Sure.  But right now, for the last 70 years, we're lucky as all hell that we're still around, no thanks to nuclear weapons.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bastard-of-Ruckus","name":"t1_clzhm5q","parent_id":"t1_clyvtkh","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1415724290,"created_utc":1415724290}

{"body":"I mean you're mostly right.  But let's change that to "The pursuit of science" ok? I can agree that religion is responsible for more horrible shit than any branch of science, apart from cartoons of mad scientists or whatever.  In all honestly I hate organized religion, probably for the same reasons you do.  But I have a problem with the belief that all religion is the reason for religious atrocities.  I don't think it's the nature of the concept of God, messiahs, hell, etc that causes the massacre.  Rather it's the zeal, the tendency towards violence that is present in people regardless of being a James Holmes or a political tyrant or religious fanatic.  		I find it problematic to draw a line between what is done in the name of religion vs science because while one is a cult, the other is a structure for experimentation and reason.  This is why I find it convenient that atheists use the science vs. religion paradigm.  They aren't actually diametric.  There can be a cult that bases their pursuit of something horrible in a kind of science, but not all of science is bad.  Anyways, horrible things can be justified by their scientific rationalization, which is often diluted by their psychotic or genocidal tendencies that are usually divergent from the science of the act.  Let's look at Eugenics.  While the pursuit of eugenics wasn't scientific as much as it was the ideal sought by a group of maniacs, it was rationalized by scientific data.  It still is in many countries.  But if you were to rationalize it by a holy scripture, that's religious.  See the difference? While nobody is screaming "In the name of CHEMISTRY!" before releasing small pox or whatever, doesn't mean that scientific progress is separate from the development of biological warfare, nuclear weapons, eugenics and ecocide.  I think that it's easy to look at the cult and say "they're crazy, they do it in the name of their GOD."  Sure.  It's different.  I agree with that.  Atheistic atrocities are the massacre of religious people.  Plain and simple.  Buddhists, Muslims, Christians etc.  Sure if we're keeping score, it's a blip.  But I don't think that keeping score is the point.  The point is that zealous and fervent proponents of doctrine tend to miss their own faults.  And while religion flies you into buildings, and cut off people's heads, all this horrible shit, that I admit is horrible, people who are absolutely against religion have committed horrible things to destroy it too.  Maybe you view that as a good thing though, so it's subjective.  If anyone comes for my throat, I'll kill them if I can.  regardless if their belief structure stems from the Bible, Q'uran or manifesto for a perfect human race that doesn't include me!","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Bastard-of-Ruckus","name":"t1_clzk4jb","parent_id":"t1_clyvgea","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1415728961,"created_utc":1415728961}

{"body":"Nonsense. Here's why:		Science and religion do not fall under the same category. The scientific method is but a description of processes by which one can construct a reliable and accurate description of the world. It says NOTHING about what course of action you should take upon finding new knowledge, if you should use it regardless of the consequences or if you should seclude your findings, what's right or wrong, etc. This may seem to be a downfall of the scientific method, but, in fact, it may just be its greatest asset - the fact that it is by definition completely impartial allows for a kind of universality and fast-paced advancement of knowledge that Humanity has never witnessed before.		This, however, is a lot different from religion. Every monotheistic religion tells you how you should behave, think, act, what's right and wrong, what kind of food you should eat, what kind of position you should have sex in, etc. It doesn't claim the same absence of judgement that the scientific method does when it comes to morality, in fact, it takes an extremely strong position on these points. Therefore it must be held accountable if its preachments are morally repulsive and contribute to the immoral and unethical actions of its believers. It can't acquit itself of blame when these scenarios occur, the same way the scientific method can, because it takes a moral stance on these issues while the latter doesn't.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Sethzyo","name":"t1_clyrvlq","parent_id":"t1_clyheu6","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1415656009,"created_utc":1415656009}

{"body":"You seem to argue that knowledge is inherently "better" than faith. This is just nonsense, not correct or faulty - they are not comparable. They are different ways of tackling different problems. Are you going to compare the Buddha with Euler? It would be nonsensical to do. 		Firstly we can not know if humanity would've been "better of" (again, what's with this comparison?) with or without religion, since there is no test group, there is no chance for us to know. The only thing we do know is that in this particular experiment with our exact human history, religion seems to be a first necessity in order to later acquire science. This comes just from the facts.     		Your third paragraph argues on two different levels with is just dishonest. First you say that religion is inherently bad, then you go on to say that science is a tool that needs to be used correctly and that it can be used "incorrectly" (against human needs and humanity). Argue honestly and the same can be said to all of the religious problems throughout our history, and all the religious thriving throughout history.  	What about all of our scientific geniuses that lived their life with a strong faith? Are you saying that the same person would've come to the same conclusions if we just erase all that "religious bullshit"? Would Newton have come up with his Calculus if he weren't a devout believer in God? I am not implying causation, but I am implying that Newton would not have been the Newton we know today if he wasn't the Newton we know today (a trivial tautology, but you seem to need this to get this point). Strip away a major part of his life because you think it is "bullshit" and suddenly we have a different man, with different goals and different accomplishments. Who knows what he would've done? This line of argument is of course nonsensical, we do not argue with "if"'s and "ought"'s . Replace "Newton" with almost any scholar that provides the foundation for the industrial and technological revolution and the same thing can be said. Don't be so dishonest.    		Lastly, the point which seldom comes up in this debate with your kind of reasoning - we are utterly ruining our planet and how it sustains us. We cause, with the "correct" use of science, massive damage to the rain forest, ocean floors, cities with pollution, and we are not showing any real sign of stopping this compulsive behavior. Is science going to save us? I sure hope we will wake up from this psychosis soon, but that is just another version of faith. Yes, you and I would probably not be alive without the medical science, but can we say the same thing in what's about to come of our destruction of nearly every ecosystem? Science has, up to very recently, almost only been used to maximize its potential for human use - excluding the rest. Argue from any other viewpoint than humanity and suddenly science is the worst thing that has happened for those involved if we continue as we do today.

{"body":"You???ve no need for your patience today, then, my good sir, for I am neither a retard nor arguing that Adolf Hitler was an atheist. I suppose some might not allow for some space between atheist and Christian (perhaps yourself included), but I am not one of them. 		But to directly address the evidence you mention in passing: ???Gott Mit Uns??? was a phrase that pre-dates the Nazis and was the motto of the Prussians as well as the German army during WW I, and continued to be used by the German defence forces after WWII. It was only the Wehrmacht who had the belt buckles carrying this phrase, whereas the more thoroughly Nazi Waffen SS wore the phrase, ???Meine Ehre hei??t Treue.??? (???My glory is loyalty??? or something along those lines) The fact that the German army wore this traditional phrase can thus in no wise be considered evidence of Hitler???s Christian devotion. 		Secondly, the fact that Hitler spoke positively of the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran church in Mein Kampf is not the same thing as revealing his religious conviction. In fact, if you look past the superficial approval he gives them, you realize that he approves of the churches only insofar as they act as agents to perpetuate National Socialism. He even goes so far as to say that the Lutherans and Catholics should stop arguing about doctrine and work together to promote strong German national identity. This is corroborated by Speer???s recollection that while Hitler detested the church, ???he conceived of the church as an instrument that could be useful to him.??? This goes hand along with your claim that Hitler made ???repeated??? professions of Christianity. He was a politician in a country where 95% of people called themselves either Catholic or Protestant (though church participation was way, way lower) ??? so of course he would say he was a Christian. Are you seriously asking me to believe that Adolf Hitler couldn???t possibly have lied about his religious beliefs for political reasons? 		 And the Reichsconcordant somehow demonstrateds he was a Christian? That???s like saying he was peaceful because he signed a peace treaty with Russia, gave assurances to Czechoslovakia, and promised the Low Countries that his intentions were peaceful. The thing with Hitler is that HE WAS THE WORLD???S GREATEST LIAR. Yes, the Nazis signed a concordant with the Catholic church in 1933, and then proceeded to ignore it in its entirety. Within 10 days after signing the concordant, the Nazis had promulgated a sterilization law and dissolved the Catholic Youth League, both of which were highly offensive to the Roman Catholics. By 1937 it got so bad that Pope Pius issued an encyclical accusing the Nazi government of ???secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and his church.??? The fact that Hitler ruthlessly persecuted any and all clergy who did not allow their churches to become organs of the state is clear evidence that he was not motivated by Christian piety or beliefs. 		 I???m not sure what ???propaganda??? you are referring to. I???ve read 2 biographies on Hitler and 6 books on WWII this year and not one of them mentions ??? in fact they disavowed the notion when they discuss it ??? that Hitler was a Christian. It???s not like it???s a standard, accepted fact amongst historians that Hitler was a Christian and I???m a kook; in fact, it???s the exact opposite. I only ever see the claim given any sort of serious credence in a forum like this one. That???s why I asked for any serious historian who makes the claim that he was a ???Christian fanatic??? ??? because I know there aren???t any. These following books all document the intense persecution of Christianity under Hitler and the hatred of Christian teaching within the Nazi party. They aren???t Christian sources or apologists, but fairly standard, non-controversial works by academic historians that deal with the entirety of Hitler???s attitude to religion, not just a few cherry-picked quotes and factoids:		- William Shirer "Rise and fall of the Third Reich"		- Richard J Evans "The Third Reich at War"; "The Third Reich in Power"		- Ian Kershaw "Hitler"		I???ll just leave you with this quote from Hitler, lest you think I couldn???t simply cherry pick Hitler quotes to demonize my opponents: ???The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.??? 		If we define a Christian as someone who believes and acts in a way that is roughly concordant with 2000 years of teaching and belief, then Hitler was not a Christian. If you define a Christian as someone who says, ???I???m a Christian???, even though they believe the opposite of what Christians historically have believed ??? that???s your prerogative. But it also makes you a narrow-minded nincompoop. So we see that it is not I, but you, who has the tiresome and unsubstantiated position built on half-truths and faint impressions, bolstered by prejudice and a false sense of intellectual superiority.

No, Hitler persecuted atheists. He did shut down some christians who opposed him, but that's hardly new. A christian can oppose some other christians. Sometimes, it even leads to war. Said wars can even last, say, Thirty Years.  	The fact that Hitler tolerated no dissent is no evidence of his lack of beliefs.   	On the other hand, he had no such political reason to shut down all atheist and freethinking organisations, he did that just out of hatred.  		> If we define a Christian as someone who believes and acts in a way that is roughly concordant with 2000 years of teaching and belief, then Hitler was not a Christian.

I realize it is easier for you to argue against me if I was somehow arguing that Hitler was an atheist. I???m not, and I have never made that claim. This whole discussion began when YOU claimed that Hitler was a ???Christian Fanatic.??? Not a single one of my arguments was intended to prove that Hitler was an atheist. I said as much at the beginning of my post. I am merely trying to get you to substantiate your claim that Hitler was a Christian ??? I am not making a positive claim that he was an atheist.

You can't handwave it as "he did it for political gain" in this case, because he gained nothing from it politically.		  You clearly know nothing about the period or the political forces at work. First of all, Hitler didn???t sign anything ??? it was representatives of his government - and there is no indication that he was all that involved in making it come about. He clearly didn???t think anything of the document because he broke almost every article of that agreement; it was *clearly* nothing more than a political gesture and it???s only stubbornness that would cause you to argue otherwise. If he did it from some sort of piety, why would he go ahead and break almost every article of the agreement within 2 years? You go from arguing that he sought approval from the Vatican (and was thus a Christian), to saying the fact that he persecuted the church doesn???t matter because Christians always persecute other Christians. So which is it? He loved the Catholics or hated them? He cared deeply what they thought of him, or he saw them as enemies? How can his love for Christians be proof of his Christianity at the same time as his hatred for Christians can be proof for the same thing? You're being absurd.		> In what way would he have "believed the opposite of what historical christians did", anyway? That's one of the most stupid statements I've ever read.		Really? I guess you don???t read much, then. First, I didn't say "Historical Christians", I said what Christians have historically believed. Meaning, Christian belief has a relatively consistent 2000 years of tradition. The definition of 'Christian' is not a very fluid concept. A few articles from the National Reich Church???s 39 point program should suffice to demonstrate some of the beliefs promoted by Hitler's Reich that are directly antithetical to historical Christian belief: 		>5. The National Church is determined to exterminate irrevocably??? the strange and foreign faiths imported into Germany in the oil-omened year 800. (i.e. when Christianity came to Germany)		>13. The National Church demands immediate cessation of the publishing and dissemination of the Bible in Germany.		>14. The National Church declares that to it, and therefore to the German nation, it has been decided that the Feuhrer???s Mein Kampf is the greatest of all documents. It not only contains the greatest but it embodies the purest and truest ethics for the present and future life of our nation.		>19. On the altars there must be nothing but Mein Kampf (to the German and therefore to God the most sacred book) and to the left of the altar a sword.		>30. On the day of its foundation, the Christian Cross must be removed from all churches, cathedrals, and chapels??? and it must be superseded by the only unconquerable symbol, the Swastika.		In addition, Hitler thought Jesus was an Aryan ubermensch who was killed by the Jews and that Paul, a Jew, created a whole lie about him being divine and dying for sins (i.e. the central belief of every strain of Christianity ??? Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox). And if He was so motivated by his religion, why would Bormann say publically that ???National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable.??? Why would he employ Goebel, Himmler, Bormann, or Rosenberg who publically advocated for the destruction of Christianity and the return of German paganism?		If you can???t comprehend that someone might use Christian language and Christian symbolism and might still believe something radically different than Christianity, I can???t help you. Show me one ??? just one ??? reputable source (i.e. in a book written by a historian) who argues that Hitler was a Christian in any meaningful sense of the word. I was just reading portions from Richard J. Evans??? massive ???The Third Reich at War??? last night, and he is firmly of the opinion that Hitler???s intention was to stamp out Christianity.
