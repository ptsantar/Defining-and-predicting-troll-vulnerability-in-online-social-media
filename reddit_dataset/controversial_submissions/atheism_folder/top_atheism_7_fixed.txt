I am really starting to just not care anymore, booze and bullets.

So, seeing as I have failed to position myself in a position that allows me to barely live break even, if I wan't my life to matter who can I kill while I end the financial costs I inflict on the people that support me when I don't break even? 		I am a very open person, I have a few fundamental positions I feel the need to be protect passionately(Innocent until proven guilty, right to defend the people you love and the property you worked hard to obtain), but after that I can see something from anyones perspective. Alas! The minute I try to propose a compromise both sides call me radical. So what the fuck?

{"body":"You're being so absurd and petty, I can barely muster the patience to reply. But here goes.		>which is less "a reference to her lack of belief" and more "a scientific fact."		Let's put on our thinking caps and ponder this real hard. Why do you suppose she mentioned a scientific fact completely out of context? How often have you heard someone give an acceptance speech and then end it with a science factoid? You've never heard George Clooney accept an Oscar and then say, "The Sun burns 600 million tons of Hydrogen every second. Goodnight everybody!"		So we can probably conclude that there was a reason she ended her speech with a random, out-of-context science fact. Why do you suppose that is? Bear in mind, the idea that we are "just molecules" is antithetical to the central claim made by most religions that we're something more than matter, whether souls or spirits or whatever. Bear in mind, Sarah is someone who is very outspoken against religion. Her last two comedy specials were called "Jesus is Magic" and "We Are Miracles," both of which skewered religion. Bear in mind, this factoid was spoken in a context and time when celebrities often thank God. Bear in mind, at the last big celebrity awards show, the Oscars, Matthew McConaughey [made big headlines for his preachy thank you to God.](http://www.christianpost.com/news/matthew-mcconaugheys-god-speech-at-the-oscars-required-courage-115534/)		Given all of these details, you still think it's unreasonable for someone to conclude that Silverman was taking a gentle poke at religion? Again, I ask, what is your alternate hypothesis? What is your explanation for why she would include a random, out-of-context science fact at the end of her speech? And by the way, even if it wasn't her intention, why would it be unreasonable for atheists to notice it and comment on it? Why wouldn't atheists, a tiny minority in the U.S., be interested in what may have been a shout-out on a huge national stage? And more importantly who gives a shit if atheists interpret it that way? Why is your ass so chapped by something so innocuous? How exactly does it affect your life? That's the real question here.		>If you had actually read my post, you'd notice that I didn't mention religion at all. 		Your first post, the one around which this entire conversation is centered, did mention religion. As someone already pointed out, you wrote: "/r/atheism: Creating a religion out of atheism for years." Your next post seemed to imply that /r/atheism is on par with religion because it fabricates things. If that wasn't your meaning, then please explain how /r/atheism is "creating a religion." Is it because some of us are passionate about the topic? Is that your definition of religion? I truly can't wait to hear this.		>How many acceptance speeches last night referenced god?
