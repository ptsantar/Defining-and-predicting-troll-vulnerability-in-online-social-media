{"body":"Is this really what /r/atheism is now? I mean, I see people defending this as a "Fuck you" to people who kill over a religion, but this is just . . . rape. It's a painting of rape. I'm not offended, it's just in bad taste. I just don't get it, I guess.		**edit:** I've gotten a few comments that are under the impression that I want this picture taken down. This is not what I'm talking about. 		When I first came to /r/atheism years ago, I was happy I found solidarity and a comfortable spot where I could talk with nonreligious people, having dropped my Christian faith while still residing in a conservative area. But over the years, this sub has become downright hostile. You can disagree with religious views; I do too. You can post whatever you want, including a picture of Jesus getting raped. But if this sub is to be a representative (it is, after all, touted to be the largest atheist forum) of atheism, then it should held to higher standard where we champion rational thought and free thinking, not hostility towards others. In light of recent events such as the Paris shooting, I totally get people are angry with religious followers. I get that. But this was something that was voted to the front page of Reddit, and it makes /r/atheism look bad. 		**edit #2:** You guys convinced me; I'm unsubscribing to this sub (yeah, I know, boo-freaking-hoo). If I sound like I'm being butthurt by a picture, it's more than that. It's the attitude I've gotten here time and time again. I got constant comments like "If you don't like it, THEN JUST LEAVE!" And you know what? They're absolutely right. I hope subscribers on here realize how they appear to religious users who may lurk here or see the pages that get upvoted to the front page. I feel like /r/atheism subscribers don't give a shit, but they really should. If we are to convince Christians, Muslims, Mormons, etc. that skepticism and critical thinking are better methods to reach ethical choices and scientific progress, then let's act that way. Today was a good example of the disappointment I've been getting here constantly.","depth":0,"score":1952,"ups":1952,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":true,"author":"ceedubs2","name":"t1_cnjeolj","parent_id":"t3_2rudc3","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420807354,"created_utc":1420807354}
{"body":"You're not alone. Even the "pig fucking Mohammed" drawing was pointlessly insulting to _people_, more so than to the religion or its prophet. It's one thing to satirize and offend religious doctrine that goes against western ideals of freedom, especially _in_ the west, which is what simply drawing Mohammed at all accomplishes, and directly offending the followers of the religion by creating excessive and gross affronts to everything they believe in personally. I'm an atheist, definitely not a Muslim, and _even I_ am offended by the sheer crudity of these drawings and pictures. It's banal, it's childish and it serves no real purpose whatsoever, not even as legitimate satire or criticism.		It's _just_ to offend, nothing else, and if that is the only point, then you're not being a critic, you're being an asshole. You have the right to be one, I won't argue that, but that is still what you are.		And before anyone takes offense against _me_ for saying so, the freedom of speech we enjoy here gives _me_ the right to criticize _this_ kind of "criticism" as well. It doesn't just go one way, or even two ways, it goes _all_ ways.		There has to be room for satire and criticism, even of religion and even of Islam, but deliberate provocation simply for the sake of being provoking is needless, stupid and does nothing but reveal your person.","depth":1,"score":1218,"ups":1218,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Endemoniada","name":"t1_cnjfebt","parent_id":"t1_cnjeolj","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420809849,"created_utc":1420809849}

I'm not dodging your point. You think that it is marginalizing to bash someone's religion but I think that is only the case if you believe that the worth of the person is tied up into their religious beliefs. I said that two comments above. If I were to make a comic saying that Muslims are worthless people, not saying that the religion they worship is then that would be marginalizing. 		Surely, people aren't so stupid that they cannot determine the distinction between the worth of a worshiped religion and the worth of a person. I think the two are separable. And the backlash of people that can't tell the difference (that includes both people who take the comic as a personal affront and the right wing extremists that use it to further their agenda) don't have the right to dictate the speech of people in free society.

As an example: When the bikini was first introduced it was considered by many to be pornographic.  Coincidentally, with the rise of published pornography and film nudity it gradually became an acceptable fashion.  Today, a bikini is no longer at the frontier of shocking.		So, if you're trying to liberate muslims (or whoever) you need to criticize their beliefs.  Once they've seen muhammad's butthole, maybe a merely critical image won't seem so bad.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"KneelsBore","name":"t1_cnk9iad","parent_id":"t1_cnjgejg","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420866326,"created_utc":1420866326}

{"body":"Man, this is a tough one.  		On the one hand, I very much agree with nearly everything the OP said.  I do agree that there is such a thing as good taste and that decent human beings should strive for it.  I do agree that if there are two ways to do a thing, and one of them doesn't offend people, that choosing to go the inoffensive route is usually a good way to live one's life.  This is what I teach my kids.  It's about respect.  Respecting other people makes everyone's lives better.		On the other hand.		I am tired of hearing about people being murdered because they dared to speak out against religion, particularly Islam.  I agree that quieting down and self-censoring in response to this kind of violence is the wrong course and only encourages more acts of violence.  The rash of obscene Muhammad pictures after Charlie did not bother me; actually, it heartened me.  I completely empathize with the desire to post a drawing like that and think it is an understandable, if emotional, response.  On balance, I'm glad it happened that way rather than r/atheism going, "Oh, shit, we better leave these guys alone, they're SERIOUS."		So it's tough.  There are a lot of things that, on face, seem contradictory, but I do believe it's possible to value good taste and generally want to get along with people, and at the same time, be okay with a rash of offensiveness (the pictures) in response to something far, far more offensive (the murders).  In fact, I think I'd argue that it's the basic respect for decency and peace that triggers that kind of response in the first place.

{"body":"So, my first and most visceral reaction was to be offended by this image, not because of who it depicts, but rather that it was rape. Of course, I was offended within a very specific context, that this was meant to be satire.		I???m actually not convinced that it is. 		In fact, the lack of context to this piece is rather driving me crazy. I decided to obsess a bit and try to find this image on the internet. Admittedly I didn???t scour for it. Whatevs. But it really doesn???t have a lot of results on TinEye. However, it DID lead me to rule 34 and the comments really got me thinking. 		Firstly, what if this isn???t satire necessarily, but a statement? Really this is me grasping for straws. Art is highly subjective and I???m working from my own contextual knowledge about religion to come to a conclusion about its meaning. I have no reference about the artist and their beliefs or political views (this is something that can be important when reading into an art piece???s meaning)		One thought is that the rape is a sign of violation specifically attempting to parallel the ???rape??? of his body through torture. His body was not his own in the story, and suffered a molestation of a non-sexual nature. In this image, we see it sexualized. Perhaps it???s symbolic. Perhaps it???s not. 		Another thought is recalling that Jesus actually did all of this somewhat willingly. He willingly sacrificed himself for people???s sins, or that???s how the story is interpreted. With that in mind, we could see the sex become consensual in our eyes. However, I immediately think of that moment of ???weakness??? where Jesus screams out to god why this is happening to him (or something like that), and he gets no reprieve. The show must go on. This could read as a very clear ???no, please stop???. It could have started off as consensual then became non-consensual along the way, thus the rape. 		Third idea: Someone said this further down the way. Rape was kind of a big thing not only biblically, but it just happened. Conquering everyone and having sex with their women and possibly even their men. Historically, rape made sense. 			Some considerations to take into account. ??? Now I think this is mostly indicative of the source material these people used; likely a lot of stills from pornography that is not rape centric.  There is a distinct lack of violence in their body language. The man holding the left leg is standing rather statically and looking upon Christ???s body with an almost soft expression, not one hardened by a violent act. We see more motion in the man holding the left leg. He???s in a pose of action and strain, as if he???s holding the weight of the body up more so than the man on Christ???s right (our left)  The only real signs of violence we see is the thorns on his head, his hands nailed to the cross and the look of agony on his face. Now we have the difficulty of deciphering if this is true agony or intense pleasure. Let???s face it. The ???O??? face and the ???I am impaled in three different ways??? face can be similar, especially in depictions of certain porn. 			THIS IS NOT CHRIST ??? Hang in there with me on this one. I didn???t think of this one until someone mentioned it on rule 34. Who is to say this is actually christ? Look at him. Lily white skin, trademark ???Jesus??? face. As Anonymous19 so eloquently said: ???For starters, they're not even fucking Jesus. They're fucking a crappy European self insert character made up in the early middle ages that doesn't even look like a real Jewish Israelite of that time period.???		So NOW, we aren???t seeing Jesus getting raped, but rather our conceptualization of what we think Jesus is. We are raping the basic idea of the modern representation of Christ and religion. If this was a conscious decision then this may a commentary on modern religion. However, if that were the case then I think that they could have pushed that symbology further, perhaps making more of an effort for the romans to represent the modern Christian. Then again if you push that too far then it becomes satire. 		**TL;DR:::** It might actually be art and not satire, and the rape may be a metaphor for the non-sexual molestation of Jesus taken to a more sexual representation based on historical likelihood of that happening, or some sort of subjective reason.","depth":0,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":1.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nakolune","name":"t1_cnjiitf","parent_id":"t3_2rudc3","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1420817277,"created_utc":1420817277}

Judging a group of people based on a subreddit is kinda silly though, considering reddit is just a giant circle jerk for the most part. No one should think rape is okay. Sure we could make the argument for artistic freedom, but that doesnt mean this image is tasteful. The fact rape has been depicted in art before is also irrelevant as far as Im concerned. As far as I am aware, though my biblical knowledge is rather rusty, jesus was not raped while upon a crucifix, as opposed to something like [The Rape of Persephone](http://guliverlooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bernini-rape-of-persephone-1632.jpg) which is actually part of classical mythology.

The second one is, in my opinion even more important than the first. If you stop exercising free speech, then legislation tends to creep over and deny it.
