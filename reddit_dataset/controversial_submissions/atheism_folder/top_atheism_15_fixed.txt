{"body":"Thanks for your post. Pepsi isn't a small town outfit. They don't base their contracts on morals. They don't conduct business deals on emotions. All they care about is the money and it's not that important where it comes from.    	 	It's the small town mentality that won't cater gay weddings. When companies get as big as Pepsi, they just don't care. The larger a company gets, you'll find the people running them become seemingly less human as they look for profit. It's also how they justify their cost cutting measures by eliminating benefits and hundreds/thousands of jobs.    		I'm not a Christian but I visited Vatican City. Even though I disagree with nearly everything the church stands for, I have to admit I was really pleased to find they served Pepsi there instead of Coke. I'm certainly not going to boycott the company for winning that contract due to my personal beliefs. There may be a time when I go to this silly creation museum just as a laugh. I'd be happy to have a Pepsi there too. 		Same goes for MasterCard/Visa. Pretty sure the creation museum accepts those forms of payment. Should we stop using our credit cards altogether because they can be used at a place we don't agree with? It's just a contract and those cards are accepted nearly everywhere. There's no human emotions involved. 		I'm all for writing the company and saying it's not cool to do business with the place, but I don't expect them to care. Living in Arizona, I'm not big on boycotts in the first place. They tend to hurt the wrong people. I don't like the bs of Chik-Fil-A, but I still visit the location on campus because it's better than a burger and the kids working there need the paycheck. They're not working there based on their religious beliefs. They just need a job. A successful boycott would hurt them, not the owner. 		Besides, you can see how boycotts can backfire when you look at that Indiana pizza place. I've got a friend who has a gofundme account to raise money for tuition for some summer school program he is really passionate about. He only needs about $2500 but raised only a fraction. I find it heartbreaking that the "no pizza for gay weddings" people made nearly a million dollars all from some random hateful statement. They're certainly not suffering any consequences.","depth":1,"score":5,"ups":5,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"gonejellyfishin77","name":"t1_cq6zlvw","parent_id":"t1_cq6o8jj","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428617249,"created_utc":1428613649}

{"body":"Depends on your personal taste, of course, but my favorite commonly available bourbons are: Four Roses single barrel, Woodford reserve, and (surprisingly) Costco's Kirkland 7 year. The folks at /r/bourbon have some pretty comprehensive reviews, ranging from the everyday to one-time small batch bottlings, so if you find yourself wanting to experience more, that's a good place to start.		I'm not a bourbon-only guy, so my perspective is skewed a little by appreciation for bourbon against other styles of whisk(e)y, but I still am not particularly fond of some that I can still recognize as well-crafted: Belle Meade, for example, and Bulleit. Others that some seem to like, I can't even find the craft in. Notably, 1792 Ridgemont Reserve tastes only a few notches up from Jack Daniels to me. Gentleman Jack, on the other hand, while not my favorite, is pretty decent. Jack Daniels tastes like someone mixed vodka, sawdust, and cat vomit, filtered it through a sock, and slapped a "bourbon" label on it. I've only ever consumed it when commiserating with a buddy who had just been dumped, or something of that nature.","depth":8,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"brand_x","name":"t1_cq7dk03","parent_id":"t1_cq79fyj","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428640769,"created_utc":1428637169}

After the war, the Coca-Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product???as well as the plant profits made during the war.[2][3]		>Fanta was discontinued when the parent company was reunited with the German branch. Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s, Coca-Cola competed by relaunching Fanta in 1955. The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.[4]","depth":3,"score":27,"ups":27,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"JuryDutySummons","name":"t1_cq6mbun","parent_id":"t1_cq6l5ut","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428597599,"created_utc":1428593999}

They think that the whole world was created 6,000 years ago.  	  	No one is asking Pepsi to discriminate against them.  Pepsi should sell their soda to whoever can afford to buy it.  A sponsorship is different, it is saying that Pepsi approves of this movement and is willing to put their money and name behind it.","depth":1,"score":1715,"ups":1715,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Hypertension123456","name":"t1_cq6kv4p","parent_id":"t1_cq6k6ab","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428595304,"created_utc":1428591704}

{"body":"This is common in protestant religions.  There are biblical prohibitions from getting drunk and people see abstaining from alcohol as the best way to prevent getting drunk.  Also, Paul and John the Baptist did not drink wine, so their are biblical examples of abstinence.  		There has also been a strong undercurrent from the temperance movement in the US since the early 1800's.  This turned into a movement for prohibition that peaked with actual prohibition.  This was an interesting mix of different groups that all saw alcohol as a root of certain evils.  Early women's right advocates wanted to ban alcohol to cut down on domestic violence.  Early industrial factory owners did not want their workers showing up hung over.   Racists did not like how alcohol may cause Blacks to "forget their place."  And many people that wanted to help the poor though that drinking alcohol caused people to be poor (instead of being poor lead people to drink).  Churches hopped on board with this agenda.  The Salvation Army is a good example of a group founded to help the poor and rid them of drink.  By the time prohibition rolled around in the US, pretty much all of the major protestant denominations supported the complete abstinence of alcohol.  		These lines of thought did not disappear when prohibition was repealed, especially in the church, and lives on in modern views on drug prohibition. 		**tl;dr:** The bible says to not get drunk and has examples of people abstaining.  Modern church views reflect earlier beliefs that to help poor people, you had to get them to stop drinking.","depth":3,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"manova","name":"t1_cq6qzew","parent_id":"t1_cq6lgq7","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428604466,"created_utc":1428600866}

{"body":"Ken Ham's young earth is really rather insidious. It is dogmatic and at its core holds  the following idea: if the perfect infallible word of God is wrong about the age of the Earth, then perhaps it is wrong about everything else. 		Imagine holding this view. It is not a simple superficial belief. It is an identity. The Earth, regardless of any overwhelming evidence to the contrary, is young. If this is not true, then what has become of my faith? What has become of me? To not accept the young earth is to lose your very core identity, it is to lose your lifelong defining characteristic. And that is a frightening prospect.		This is why YEC is so insidious. It is inescapable and those who hold Ken Ham's beliefs sincerely believe that their faith is dependent upon the truth of the creationism. 		Obviously, this is not true and many people do reconcile their faith with science. Acknowledging the overwhelming evidence for a 4.5 billion year old Earth does not preclude belief in a god. One can still be a Christian whilst acknowledging that much of the Bible is fiction. However such compromise is inconceivable to Biblical literalists.  		So in the face of ever increasing scientific knowledge, we have a population of people tricked into believing that their faith is the most important aspect of their life and that it is dependent upon YEC. Anything at all that is potentially counter to YEC is false, "lies from the pit of hell," not "hard science," the list goes on. 		It's unfortunate that such deliberate ignorance hold so much power and it is counter productive to the advancement of a modern society. It demands robbing children and young adults of a good education, it prevents talented individuals from becoming future scientists  and doctors because they can't reconcile their YEC dependent faith with tools of modern science and medicine, it indirectly develops politicians and constituencies that put their heads in the sand with regards to climate change. It creates a large population of individuals who will forever be deprived of the pleasures of learning and knowing how truly beautiful, complex, and poorly understood our little corner of the universe really is.

{"body":"Well I'm in somewhat of a unique position as someone who used to design advertisements for a newspaper and is currently a graphic artist at a company that produces graphics to be applied to trucks, so I can tell you three things about this:		1) There are a lot of people who should know better (business owners, heads of marketing departments) who don't realize you can't just slap whatever logo you want into an advertisement without permission.		2) People who use logos without permission almost never get caught unless someone makes a fuss about it.		3) This ad was probably never seen by anyone working in Pepsi's marketing department, because they would have helped the advertiser check the specs of the truck to make sure that the most important piece of information on the ad (the call to action- the website URL) wasn't be completely obscured by a dolly.		All of that being said, I have no problem with Pepsi allowing their logo to be used in an advertisement if that actually is the case. It's not like they're sponsoring an event or something. The presence of their logo is basically just the advertiser saying "Oh yeah- we have Pepsi." The promotion itself is buy 2 tickets get 2 free if I understand it correctly- it really has nothing to do with Pepsi.","depth":2,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bgates87","name":"t1_cq77iz7","parent_id":"t1_cq6iz5j","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428630507,"created_utc":1428626907}

Because your view differs from them? "They chose to be that way so I'm free to hate them!" /r/fatpeoplehate would love you.		Regardless, this entire thread is not about that. Its about the outrage of Pepsi being associated with this religious event. Which is very similar to the whole pizza place outrage. 		- Business refuses to provide a service to lgbt whatever due to religious beliefs. Community outrage because a business should cater to everyone regardless of their personal beliefs 		- Soda company provides a service to religious event because its good for business. Atheism outrage because a business should not be associated with a religious event.		Do you really not see the parallels? If you want to be upset with the museum thing, sure I get that.

{"body":">when all evidence shows the earth is more than 4 billion years old and the universe is 13.7 billion years old		Current science says the universe is approx 13 billion years old, I wonder if you know of the many many assumptions "science" makes to get to that figure.		Some of the assumptions are:		The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the ??CDM model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold dark matter, radiation (including both photons and neutrinos), and a cosmological constant.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe		Dark matter-this is something no one has ever observed, it is a theory that has not been proven, however it is absolutely crucial to current scientific theory regarding the age of the universe. So something that has never been observed, something we don't know really exists, something that is just assumed to exist, and that is something you will believe.		Cosmologists estimate the current value of the mass density ??o of the universe, the average amount of mass within a given volume of space. When determining ??o, cosmologists must take into account both matter and energy. This is because energy has mass, according to Einstein???s famous equation E=mc2. Within Big Bang cosmology, there is a special ???critical??? density of the universe, ??c. A flat universe would imply that ??o must equal today???s value of ??c.		Observations suggest that ??o is much less than this critical density ??c. Since cosmologists have already concluded that the universe is flat, they have also concluded that ??o must equal ??c, which implies that some undetected energy making up this apparent deficit must exist. Thus, ???dark energy??? is invoked, which is said to account for about 70 percent of the universe???s total energy.		This dark energy is thought to be the cause of an acceleration or speeding up of the universe???s apparent expansion rate, as determined by observations of distant supernovas., However, George Ellis, one of the world???s leading cosmological theorists (and co-author with Stephen Hawking of a classic relativity and cosmology text), has noted that effects caused by spatial inhomogeneities could be causing cosmologists to ???see??? an acceleration that doesn???t really exist.		>where H_0 is the Hubble parameter and the function F depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the Hubble time, the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for H_0 around 68 km/s/Mpc, the Hubble time evaluates to 1/H_0 = 14.4 billion years.[5]		To get a more accurate number, the correction factor F must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the Planck values (??m, ????) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about F = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, F = 2???3 is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, ??r is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the CMB temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe)		So here again we see more assumptions, more guessing that certain parameters have never changed over 13 billion years. They have no proof of that but they go ahead and assume it to be so.		Modern science, assumes Cosmic Microwave Background temperature to be constant. Modern science also assumes that the universe is flat. A flat universe presents a problem for the Big Bang, since this requires ??o, today???s value of the average mass density ??, to equal the current value of the critical density ??c. Within the Big Bang, if ?? = ??c today, these quantities must also have been equal shortly after the Big Bang, despite the fact that ?? would have decreased over time in an expanding universe. This is because even tiny deviations of ?? from ??c would have quickly been amplified. If the early universe???s ?? had been smaller than that epoch???s value of ??c, the universe would have expanded too quickly to have even a hope of galaxy formation, but if ?? had been larger than ??c, the universe would have quickly collapsed in a ???Big Crunch.??? Avoiding these extremes requires ridiculous fine-tuning immediately after the Big Bang, ?? and ??c had to agree to more than 50 decimal places.		This problem is accompanied by the ???horizon??? or ???isotropy??? problem: The CMB coming from one part of the sky is nearly the same as the CMB coming from another part of the sky. This implies that widely separated parts of the ???primeval fireball??? were at essentially the same temperature. However, because of the presumed random conditions in the early universe, widely separated regions of the fireball should have been at different temperatures. These widely separated regions could end up at the same temperature if electromagnetic radiation had travelled from warmer to cooler parts of the fireball (much in the same way that you can be warmed by the radiant energy from a fire). However, because all electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, even 13.7 billion years is insufficient time for electromagnetic radiation to travel between such widely separated regions of the universe.		So if all of the assumptions without evidence above don't bother you and you still believe that the universe is 13 billion years old, then we should look radiometric dating.		Radiometric dating also has three HUGE assumptions, which are:		1.The radioisotope decay rates have been constant throughout the past.		We now know that the Sun can alter decay rates. We now know that decay rates in meteorites are not constant. We now know that what has been called cavitation can cause decay rates to accelerate by a factor of 10,000 times during a 90-minute experiment.		2.No parent or daughter material has been added to or taken from the specimen.		We know of many ways in which the materials can be made mobile, most particularly through ground water leaching. So if the entire Earth was flooded, as in Noah's flood, would that not cause quite a bit of contamination which would make the testing inaccurate.		3.No daughter material was present at the start.		We know that only rocks and minerals which formerly were in a hot molten condition (say lava) can be dated. But what if the original melt already had some radiogenic lead? The resulting rock would inherit a deceivingly "old" date			So you can see with the examples I have cited, that modern science does use quite a bit of "faith" to arrive at the age of the universe.","depth":1,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"greenirished","name":"t1_cq6mvps","parent_id":"t1_cq6lcqv","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428598439,"created_utc":1428594839}

{"body":"Actually I agree with OP.   If a company is going to take part of the money I spend on their products, and use it to support or promote a cause that goes against my principles and what I believe in, then that offends me somehow and I do not feel good about purchasing their products.   I no longer patronize Chic-Fil-A, Tastykake, or Papa John's Pizza for the same reason.   I would rather support a business that chooses to not use their advertising resources to promote causes I disagree with.   When businesses take a political or religious position and affiliate it with their products, they do so willingly knowing they are risking alienation of those of their customers with differing points of view.		   People and/ or businesses are free to express their beliefs and opinions, and I am free to express mine by spending my money elsewhere.","depth":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Freekmagnet","name":"t1_cq6zr2t","parent_id":"t1_cq6zcgx","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1428617475,"created_utc":1428613875}

But no one will ever know for sure and we shouldn't shit on people for believing in what they choose to believe in, because basically were all clueless sheep looking for a herder or an explanation as to why.
