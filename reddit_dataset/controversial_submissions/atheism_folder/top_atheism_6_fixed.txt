Ditto for reposting - oh the horror, someone reposted something on reddit! Get a grip.		> We already know religion is inaccurate and violent, that's why most of us are here.		So why is a cartoon which puts this concisely and, at least for some, amusingly, coming in for such heat?  There's only one reason that I can see, and that is that it ruffles the feathers of the "why can't we all get along" types who would rather that atheism remain something that's not discussed in polite company.

This is a ridiculous claim.  Re-read your own list and apply the same standard that you're (unreasonably) applying to this cartoon, and you'll find several that are at least as weak.

The tone of your post is rather hostile and it makes me want to ignore you completely instead of giving you the answers you're asking for. 		>It's not too terribly awful, but it IS the worst post on the sub right now when compared to everything else on the list.		The ones that were equally as bad are italicized. I don't really care about the cartoon, to be honest, my point is just to show that this isn't the only kind of content that is here. Content like this feeds people claiming this sub is a "circlejerk", and while that's fine, I'm trying to prove it isn't. 		People get ostracized, disowned, shunned, discriminated against, and violently murdered every day because they aren't religious. This is what needs highlighted, not how illogical christians and muslims are. I'm aggravated that this is the post that ended up on the front page, that's all. Why not the catholic school kicking out a kid with cancer, or the church's extremely dangerous views about birth control, or the lady trying to make a teacher lose his job because he's an atheist?		If we're constantly making fun of religion instead of highlighting the reasons why it's harmful using actual examples, nobody is going to listen to us. There are a lot of people out there who opt to identify as agnostic because "atheist" has a lot of stigma attached to it. They don't want the negative connotations that go along with it. I don't blame them. The reactions you get when you say you're an atheist vs an agnostic are extremely different. 		When the "religious freedom act" was passed, you noticed everyone was hopping all over it. But nobody was talking about the implications for the non-religious. When that teacher was being fired because he was gay, everyone was all over it. But the story about the same thing happening to an atheist teacher is shuffled off. 		The post is really irrelevant to me. I think it's comparatively bad to the ones I italicized and if you don't think it is, then it's a matter of opinion and I'm going to leave it at that. What I want to highlight is that it's not the only type of post that gets upvoted here, because any time a stranger wanders into this sub from /r/all, all they see are people talking about how shitty it is and how its only function is to make fun of religion because the only posts that ever reach /r/all are the shitty ones that make fun of religion.","depth":6,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"HungryMoblin","name":"t1_cqpgua7","parent_id":"t1_cqpbh3v","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1430081450,"created_utc":1430077850}

I dislike this cartoon because it is, above all, *juvenile.*  Regardless of one's faith, or lack thereof, the notion of religion has been a defining characteristic of history, culture, and civilization.  Foundational pieces of literature grapple with the issue, wars have been fought over it, and great men have debated and struggled with it.		Today we are (I believe rightfully) moving progressively towards an increasingly secular future, and while in the West this is occurring peacefully, great debates still revolve around the subject, such as the nature of morality or the merits of liberation theology.  		And then we get *this.*  A child-like mockery of religion that has no goal and will achieve nothing.  What's more, it is made worse by its presence on Reddit, where a large segment very much appears to be truly atheist or atheist friendly-- thus making this cartoon a loud, primitive shout into an echo-box of a forum.		Will it truly offend anyone?  I doubt that.  Is it funny?  Not really.  Will it achieve anything?  Certainly not.

For any position beyond the vaguest deism, it requires a leap to conclusions that have no basis. The issue is not a binary one of whether the Abrahamic god exists or whether Catholicism is true - it's a choice with literally thousands of mutually-incompatible alternatives. 		"Trust" by itself cannot somehow get you to the right conclusion - and if you think it does, you're proving the point in the OP cartoon.		> Belief in a metaphysical framework yo existence is not a flaw.		From a rational perspective, belief in something without basis is indeed a flaw. This is a fundamental point which is often missed: the rational worldview assigns importance to justification for belief, and this conflicts fundamentally with the worldview of those who consider their belief more important than a rational justification thereof.		This is precisely what the OP cartoon is skewering: each religion reaches completely different conclusions based on the same facts. That's not just restricted to e.g. the three major Abrahamic branches but to the thousands of sects within each of those branches. 		The reason this happens is quite obvious to anyone thinking about it rationally: the conclusions have no basis. If they did, it would not be possible to reach such different conclusions.		> That's how I see it anyway.

You and I simply disagree on the extent, existence, and strength of evidence at hand.		Perhaps we're disagreeing on what "rational" means. If the extent, existence, and strength of evidence is able to support as conclusions all the various varieties of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Shintoism, Scientology, etc., the process by which those conclusions are reached cannot be considered rational.		Central to rationality is the ability to provide a particular kind of warrant for belief, which provides not only the ability to select justified beliefs, but also necessarily implies rejecting other beliefs. If we can't narrow down justified belief in this way, we don't have rationality. To go ahead anyway and select a belief under these circumstances is not rational, i.e. is irrational.		I imagine you're not actually saying that you can justify your particular metaphysical beliefs as rational, whereas all those other religions cannot.		> Consider: I see the atheist worldview and its lack of apparent justification for any objective moral system as negative proof for the existence of some metaphysical underpinning to the existent universe.		As an aside, there are plenty of atheist philosophers who support moral realism - it's become quite a popular position in recent years. The only general "atheist worldview" in this respect is that morality doesn't come from gods.		Anyway, [negative proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_a_negative) is not an unambiguous term, and I'm not sure enough of what you mean here to respond. 		> We have different conclusions but I don't see either of us as simply guessing.		"Guessing" might not be the correct characterization, but again, the ability to get from the available evidence to all the different conclusions above disqualifies such conclusions as being rational.  This is reminiscent of the [principle of explosion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion), in which any conclusion can be reached if one starts with a contradiction.
