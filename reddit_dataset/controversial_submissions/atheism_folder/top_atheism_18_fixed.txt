Correct.		One of the reasons why they have to understand their attacks will fail is because of this point.		The truth of the matter is if they're determined enough and there's enough scumbags, they will defeat people who try to satirise - a lot of the media outlets standing with CH are doing so, not ~~be~~by reprinting but by blacking out their own cartoon and tagging them with #JeSuisCharlie.

In October, an armed man who happened to be muslim stormed the Canadian parliament buildings, killing one member of the Canadian armed forces. 		How did Canadians react? They didn't. There was no mass anger, hatred or hysteria. Canadians stood in solidarity with their Muslim friends, Sargent Vickers was hailed as a hero, and life "returned" to normal. I put "returned" in quotes, since life didn't change in the first place. Heck, the media was even trying to fan the flames and Canadians refused to tolerate any of it. 		In this "terror" attack, **the terrorists lost**. Nobody in Canada was terrorized. The Canadian way of life didn't change. This amounted to a minor inconvenience. A blip on the radar. Most Canadians even refuse to awknoldge that this attack was an act of terror. That's how and unintimidated the Canadian people were.*Canadians demonstrated through their actions that they will not be intimidated by cowardly "acts of terror"*.

This is akin to a six year old throwing a temper tantrum, and eventually having no choice to give up since nobody is paying attention to him.		Contrast this to the terror attacks in France.

Of course they're not. The terrorists are overjoyed. **This is exactly what the terrorists want you to do**. You're just giving them more reasons to start a holy war in France.

Several nations in Northern Europe either outright banned, cut, or had to show warning posters before showings of Monty Python's "*Life of Brian*" in the late 1970s.

Why should we put magic men in the sky and ancient "prophets" above the real life concerns that we all must face?

This is just another straw on the camel's back for how the West and its media treats Muslims, let alone bigoted individuals in society.		You have a bit of a point here, I'll concede. However, there are legitimate reasons why there is so much criticism with Islam. Before I go further, I want to first specify that I am speaking of ISLAM and not Muslims. Muslims are people who vary wildly. ISLAM is a code of ethics/rules that is more or less ignored by Muslims to varying degrees from person to person.		The code of Islam itself rather has a lot of reason to be criticized, much like the entire concept that those who insult Muhammad deserve death. This is where things get complicated. People are *involved* with their religion on a personal level, mainly because of indoctrination. Muslims have the unfortunate problem of being part of a religion that is currently rather actively criticized and many take it personally. Does this mean we shouldn't criticize something that deserved criticism?		It sounds like your entire point is in defense of the feelings of people who feel like they are being persecuted by the backlash against their faith, and I can sympathize with you there. I have Muslim friends (friends of many religions that I do not agree with, actually) who I would personally never want to hurt or cause them stress. However, considering the feelings people hold toward unreasonable things is not a strong enough reason to keep from criticizing things that deserve criticism. They are in a tough spot, they are the innocent child between the fighting parents. Most of them have no choice in the religion they belong to, and want nothing more than to not have anyone talk bad about a thing they believe strongly in. 		This situation sucks. However it shouldn't dissuade us. There are problems with Islam, biiiig problems. You want to talk about power dynamics? Well, right now Islam is encouraging bullies to seize power by terrorizing others too much to speak up against them. What we absolutely cannot do is relent to these demands. We need to pour it on hard and let them see that hurting people doesn't give them what they want.

Lots of religions have rules that might seem silly to outsiders, but treating human beings with respect rarely comes at a high cost.

Religions are equally defined by their scripture and by their current practices. You don't get to decide that Muslims aren't being true to their religion.

I would argue that by triggering widespread bullying and further marginalization of Muslims by Western powers and people, you are giving the terrorists exactly what they want.

You are asking this to happen because others will feel marginalized because of a perceived insult against them since they share a belief with those we are lashing out against.

The fact that some people now revere him now is not a good enough reason to avoid criticizing, or mocking him INCLUDING *simply showing a drawing of what could be him*. I don't care how moderate these people are, their belief demands everyone to play ball on the public field which is not reasonable.		Mormons who don't drink alcohol or caffeine don't demand that we forgo it or not talk about it as well, and if they did they would be told to fuck off.		Jahovas Witnesses don't tell us that non-believers should abstain from celebrating their birthdays, and if they did we would tell them to fuck off.		Jewish people don't tell us to stop eating the foods that they refrain from eating themselves, and if they did we would tell them to fuck off.		Scientologists sued their way all over the world, and the world told them right back to fuck off.		When Catholics try to convince others that contraception is a sin, we tell them to fuck off.		If Muslims are required to respect the legend Muhammad to properly practice their faith, they are allowed to do so, but they are not allowed to demand the same participation form the rest of the world. A lot of other people think Muhammad was rather atrocious, and deserves to be mocked. If this insults them, then so be it. Maybe it'll bring a few of them to consider WHY he is being mocked. If they are simply offended because [because I linked this image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/South_park_muhammad.jpg), well they better have a good reason why. 		We are not required to respect someone's faith, especially if that faith is based on a pretty thin premise. We won't discriminate because of it, certainly.

You sound as though you believe a persons faith deserves to be respected simply because it is their faith, and I staunchly disagree.

Those actions by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey are to protect their own states, not to eliminate or stop all Islamic terrorism.  And the news paper... talk is cheap.

When there is proof that someone knew the murder was going to take place,  that is called accessory to murder.  IF anyone knew these Islamic pigs were going to shoot up the news paper, they deserve to be in a jail cell.   But, that isn't what my point is.  These people committed acts of barbarism in a non-muslim country.  They were invited to live there, decided they didn't like the laws and took things into their own hands. and then people like you say "well it was insulting to Islam",  this mentality of blaming the victim is crap.

A lot of countries can't economically or politically just send help anywhere. But many islamic countries do send messages condemning terrorist acts and wishing other countries solidarity in their fight against islamists. If you aren't seeing that, then maybe it's time to broaden your horizons.		>Is there a large movement in the Islamic world urging others to stop harming the non-believers that don't follow their rules?		Contrary to common image, many Muslims have spoken out against 9/11, and [against terrorist attacks in general](http://kurzman.unc.edu/islamic-statements-against-terrorism/).		You have to remember that almost all islamic countries have repressive theocratic regimes. There were also only a few movements against communism from within communists countries during the cold war and those were crushed by the Soviets. People are getting thrown in jail for hosting relatively innocent online forums, so I doubt anyone would risk trying to start a movement.		*Edit: Besides, I'm pretty sure even I am underestimating how common the feeling is among average muslims that what these terrorists did was wrong and does not reflect the teachings of Islam. I am beginning to think that we in the west don't really know how the average muslim feels, because it's not newsworthy. It may be that most muslims think, "This is an atrocity, I wish these stupid terrorists would stop making all muslims look bad."*		*"A 2007 Pew Research Center study of several nations throughout the Muslim world showed that opposition to suicide bombing in the Muslim world is increasing, with a majority of Muslims surveyed in 10 out of the 16 of the countries responding that suicide bombings and other violence against civilians is "never" justified..."*		*[Imams in Frankfurt](https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t31.0-8/10900178_10152957917738607_7122904503430702313_o.jpg)*		>They were invited to live there, decided they didn't like the laws and took things into their own hands. 		It was a few people, not all muslims in France. No reason to punish them all, unless you believe that the religion of Islam is responsible.

You can argue it, but its not a very good argument. They key word is "serious" - I doubt anyone thinks that this cartoon contains a serious criticism of Islam. Its a crude insult against muslims as pig fuckers.		>whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law		I'm pretty sure depictions of bestiality fall into this category.

Two brothers were responsible for the shooting. This attack wasn't supported by all muslims nor even most muslims.

As a matter of fact, Muhammad explicitly told his followers *not* to harm Christians or Jews in a letter to St. Catherine.  		>s is a message from Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as a covenant to those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them.	Verily I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend them, because Christians are my citizens; and by Allah! I hold out against anything that displeases them.	No compulsion is to be on them. Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from their monasteries. No one is to destroy a house of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims??? houses.	Should anyone take any of these, he would spoil God???s covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against all that they hate.	No one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight. The Muslims are to fight for them. If a female Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting her church to pray. Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants.	No one of the nation is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day.???		Last day is referring to the end of the world.		http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2009/12/30/prophet-muhammads-promise-to-christians/125		http://www.bedawi.com/Ahtiname_Copy_1638.JPG		http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/charter1.html		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtiname_of_Muhammad		>They make me and many others feel anger over the way they treat females.		Females aren't treated badly at all in Islam, you can ask them yourself if you want.  They're even allowed to divorce their husbands if they're harming them.  Much of Islam is about simply taking care of and protecting yourself and your family.  [Here's a good place to ask them about it.](/r/islam)		>They make me and others irate over their rejection of science they do not like.		Okay, so their views differ from yours and that upsets you.  Boo-hoo.  People are always going to have different opinions on things, regardless of if there's evidence that their opinion is wrong or not.  Not to even mention the fact that science will never be able to disprove the existence of a supreme being or beings, as if a supreme being or beings exist, that could explain everything scientific in a pinch.  Of course nothing will ever be able to prove the existence of a supreme being or beings either, short of these beings manifesting themselves on Earth.  Either way we'll never be able to know for sure, so there's no sense getting worked up about it.		>They make me and others furious for the way some members of their religion feel them believing in whatever they believe in insists they must kill others that believe differently than they do.		Again, see that quote from Muhammad's document I sent you.		The Atheists also aren't doing much better right now anyway, posting shit like this.  "Someone loosely affiliated with a massive group of people based around the entire globe killed some people, let's try to offend the entire group as much as possible.".

Regardless of how some people decide to "twist" things, the document says what the document says, and the document in question is literally from the founder of the religion himself.  He is a far better representation of what Islam stands for than some terrorists who violate the doctrines of their own religion.		>You might try your thoughts on females under Muslims at /r/TwoXChromosomes and see what kind of a reception they get. I'll just say you are completely full of shit on that remark alone. Trying to use /r/islam as a source on female treatment is especially fucked up and non-neutral.		/r/TwoXChromosomes is a cesspool like /r/atheism, full of bias and ignorance, which in no way should be used to represent the views of their respective group's members.  On /r/Islam on the other hand, you're going to be talking to *actual* Muslim women who reply to your post, with *actual* experience being a Muslim woman.  You're right, it won't be very objective, but it doesn't need to be.

Your view, or anyone else's view on the matter, is irrelevant simply because you don't have to experience it.  It's like saying a sexual fetish is disgusting - it may be disgusting to you, but the people who actually have that fetish like it, and them having said fetish doesn't effect you at all.		>Not that anything you've written or I've written matters because you are not intelligent enough to comprehend that religions are offensive things.		Quite the contrary.  It is you who lacks the intellectual ability to process the fact that religion doesn't offend people, people are offended by religion.  A religion existing and people following that religion does not affect anybody whatsoever, save for the followers of it.  It's people like you who decide "I don't like that because it's different, so I'm going to make a big deal out of it.", and that's what causes major issues.

Look at it this way - terrorists are mentally ill, full of hatred, and don't even follow the key doctrines of their own religion(s).  This is true for *all* terrorists.
