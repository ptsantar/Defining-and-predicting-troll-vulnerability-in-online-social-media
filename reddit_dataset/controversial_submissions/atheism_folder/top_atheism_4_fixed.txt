{"body":"Hey mate, I used to have up to 3 migraines per week, built up over my life and lasted years, it is **absolute hell**, and when you get them you can often get disillusioned and feel that no medication or drug will ever work - I went through that, I think a lot of people do - feel like it's hopeless and a terrible thing you just have to deal with, but there is hope, so don't give up - or more importantly don't let your wife give up.		For me, a triptan worked as well, naratriptan. 		I don't know if any doctor has ever explained how migraines work to you, but it was explained to me that a migraine starts with a trigger (ie some foods, stress, sleeping pattern, etc) which the brain reacts to by contracting tiny blood vessels in the brain - the trigger isn't the problem, the reaction is. The brain isn't supposed to restrict blood vessels like that; but when it does, oxygen starts failing to reach parts of the brain and you get the precursor symptoms (eg blotchy vision loss, ringing ears, pins and needles in face/head). At some point your brain then reacts to the lack of bloodflow/oxygen, and starts dramatically dilating the blood vessels, the drastic change from the contraction to dilation actually causes the vessels to split and rip - a real physical injury which causes the intense headache, nausea, etc that sufferers deal with.		The reason I go into that long explanation (which you may already know), is because the triptans are serotonin receptor agonists, they interrupt the brain during the above process, so it doesn't contract *or* dilate the blood vessels. This is important, because if you take the triptan *after* the pain sets in, it's usually too late. Sure, it will stop it from getting any worse, but it won't make it any better because the vessels are already ripped. It needs to be taken during the precursor, then the pain just never sets in **its like magic**! When I first experienced it, I couldn't believe after I was having the funky vision the pain never came, I felt completely normal.		Having said all that, if your wife does take it during the precursor and the migraine still sets in I have no idea how to help, but maybe try a couple other triptan class drugs to test.		At the end of the day though, they're not made to be taken that frequently, but they're amazing to save you when you just can't deal with a migraine, or whilst searching for a preventative that works. I did end up finding a preventative that works for me though, but it's one that doesn't work for everyone (inderal).","depth":6,"score":47,"ups":47,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nottherightnumbers","name":"t1_cr3528d","parent_id":"t1_cr32hab","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431135963,"created_utc":1431132363}
{"body":"My ex-SS has these and is currently seeing a neurologist. I'll pass along these meds becasue all th symptoms you describe fit her pretty damned close.		I do have to ask a question though, do you feel pressure when you get in your outside of your cranium.  The optometrist said it may be swollen glands. The neuro did an MRI and her brain looks good but the resolution is good enough to see if the glands may be the reason so he suggested trying different pills until she finds one that works.

{"body":"I did feel pressure, but it was in my head behind my brow, often came along with other precursors *before* the pain/nausea stage of a migraine. But it wasn't really indicative on it's own (ie if I felt it, I wouldn't necessarily take a triptan unless I also started having funky vision).		I'm hesitant to give any more advice, because migraine symptoms can often be misdiagnosed, there's a lot of conditions that can lead to similar symptoms. And, I'm repeating what's been told to me by doctors, I'm no expert myself, my experience may not be the same as everyone's.		I suppose the main message I'm trying to get across is the process that occurs *before* the migraine, because, by the time the pain and nausea sets in, the process is over - no drugs can help at that stage except to manage the pain.		In my experience, the naratriptan that I took before the migraine fully hit would just make it go away, it was amazing. It made me realise that I'm not crazy and migraines aren't a normal part of my life I have to live with, inspired me to really give a few preventatives a good, thorough try, and I ended up finding that inderal works for me.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"nottherightnumbers","name":"t1_cr3a3eb","parent_id":"t1_cr36m4h","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431146136,"created_utc":1431142536}

Basically you will get momentary relief taking antibiotics but because you have now killed off all of the good bacteria along with only a small amount of the bad, the bad bacteria has a lot more room to spread out and cause problems. I read so many stories of people like your friend who end up getting on round after round of antibiotics to cure sinus infections that just keep on recurring. Your friend might want to check out Manuka honey (I swear I'm not a quack!) there are studies that show that it can defeat the bacteria that causes sinus infections.

{"body":"Religious people may be sane, but their core beliefs about the nature of reality are pretty insane. Many have been indoctrinated and taught a twisted set of reasoning skills that is supposed to make their religion seem like the only reasonable and emotionally fulfilling path. It's a toxic combination that can lead many people who may have been perfectly rational and sane down a path of insanity forced upon them by a cult of religious fundamentalism or extremism. 		So in a sense, I think you've got a sort of spectrum of religious people, using Christianity in America as an example. You've got the severely brainwashed on one end and on the other you've got people who are just misguided and may be able to be persuaded. 		I'm an anti-theist because I think religion makes no sense and is a poisonous way of thinking. I don't hate all religious people or anything like that, but I don't respect the belief itself, while at the same time acknowledging that some people are actually brainwashed while others are just wrong. 		The main problems I have with religion are that 1. It's not a rational way of thinking. Even if your religion is one that's not as crazy and weird, you still hold a belief that it makes perfect sense to believe in something sincerely without any proof. Religion gets its own category of belief that doesn't have to be justified rationally, for no good reason. 2. Religion can lead to absolutist morality, or anti-scientific thinking. 3. It is tribalistic and divides our society. 		I could go on, but I just want people to see that anti-theism is not just a type of atheism that hates religion because we don't like other people's beliefs. It's founded (at least for me) on a sincere concern and unease about many of the things that religion propagates, such as irrationality, dogma, absolute morality and anti-scientific thinking. Not all religions or all religious people fall into all of these categories but at the very least, nearly all religion is at least irrational.","depth":6,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"EndiaBanana","name":"t1_cr3hz0l","parent_id":"t1_cr2wsj6","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431175985,"created_utc":1431172385}

{"body":">though if you ask me, anyone who earnestly believes that they have true knowledge about the nature of an afterlife or god has a mental illness		This is the dogma of the modern age, that we can't possibly know anything about the afterlife. As philosopher of science Neal Grossman points out [here](http://anti-matters.org/articles/8/public/8-8-1-PB.pdf),		*"One conclusion I have come to over the years is that both the atheist and the believer, from the fundamaterialist to the fundamentalist, share something in common. In fact, from an epistemological perspective, what they have in common is much more significant than what they disagree about. What they agree about is this: beliefs pertaining to the possible existence of a transcendent reality ??? God, soul, afterlife, and so on ??? are based on faith, not fact. If this is true, then there can be no factual evidence that pertains to such beliefs. This metabelief ??? that beliefs about a transcendent reality cannot be empirically based ??? is so deeply entrenched in our culture that it has the status of a taboo. The taboo is very democratic in that it allows everyone to believe whatever he or she wants to believe about such matters. This allows fundamaterialists to feel comfortable in their conviction that reason is on their side, that there is no afterlife, and that those who believe otherwise have fallen prey to the forces of irrationality and wishful thinking. But it also allows fundamentalists to feel comfortable in their conviction that they have God on their side, and that those who believe otherwise have fallen prey to the forces of evil. Thus, although the fundamentalist and the fundamaterialist are on opposite extremes of the spectrum of possible attitudes towards an afterlife, their extreme positions unite them as strange bedfellows in their battles against the possibility that there are matters of fact about the afterlife that empirical research might discover. The very suggestion that empirical research might be relevant to beliefs pertaining to a transcendent reality ??? that such beliefs are subject to empirical constraint ??? runs strongly against this taboo, and is hence very threatening to most elements of our culture."*		Other than that, I agree with you. If you believe in a wonderful afterlife, committing suicide is perfectly logical. Even murdering others isn't that bad, because this life is just a role-playing game anyway.		The problem is that this is mistakenly assumed to be an argument *against* the reality of an afterlife, when *in reality* it's that a belief in an afterlife is logically incompatible with our widely held belief in the sanctity of life. You can't have both, you really have to choose.		But of course, most people don't actually believe in an afterlife, even when they say that they do. You only need to look at a person's behavior at a funeral to find out what they really believe about the nature of death.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"thepastIdwell","name":"t1_cr3ip4e","parent_id":"t1_cr30vsq","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431178718,"created_utc":1431175118}

{"body":"How does belief in God have the capacity to affect mental health negatively? How do you define mental illness? What is it, according to your understanding? And does the concept of God make a difference? 			Regardless of what beliefs we hold about the nature of reality, to say that "neither are real" is at the end of the day an assumption. That's a fact. This, more than anything else, reveals our epistemological assumptions. You could easily argue that strict empiricism is more indicative of mental illness than a rationalist epistemology. When we hold non-empirical concepts are definitively not real, then they are necessarily regarded as delusions. But that position is predicated on a non-verifiable epistemological assumption in the first place. So, really, it's just as delusional as the concepts that such people categorize as delusions, if not more. 			In regards to the study, it most likely demonstrates that the more mentally unsound you are the more punitive the concept of God you tend to believe, and vice versa. And that's nothing new, I mean, this idea is very well articulated in various religions. In Islam for instance, one quote says that that "I am as My servants thinks I am." Not an easily understood statement, but what it's essentially saying is that God manifests within a person based on their concept of God. But their concept of God is predicated on what drives them to conceive of such a concept. And what drives a person to conceptualize in that way is predicated on their subconscious and pre-conscious states, spiritual states if you will. When you go deep enough, looking at this from a philosophy of mind perspective, we can say that this starts touching on the non empirically reduceable feature of the mind, which is where the idea of freewill and agency are introduced. The point of all that is to show where mental illness plays a role. It comes in prior to concepts created by the mind and also prior to emotions; it causes in us certain sorts of emotions and certain sorts of thinking that eventually form our concepts of reality. This does not work backwards. So to say that religion causes or has the capacity to lead to mental illness, I think, is not accurate whatsoever. I mean, I agree to an extent, that there are thoughts that are very destructive, but those thoughts again are firstly predicated on prior emotions that lead to them. 			Both statements that you quoted are saying the same thing. When I say, in the first quote, language that is familiar, it means that a Catholic will use words that are intrinsic to Catholicism that they feel best denote concepts that they are trying to communicate. Others whose identity is most predicated on politics may contrive conspiracy theories about how the Communists are trying to get him, or how the government is after him, and so on. So, in my experience, I've seen mental illness articulated by many different people in many different ways based on their own self identity.","depth":5,"score":0,"ups":0,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"unknown_poo","name":"t1_cr2xy11","parent_id":"t1_cr2wt5r","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431122550,"created_utc":1431118950}

{"body":"You first say that you can prove that there is no transcendent nature to reality. Then you say "to a reasonable degree." You either can prove it or you can't since this is a necessary statement. In doing so you're inadvertently admitting that there is the possibility that the nature of reality is transcendent. In that case you've contradicted yourself. Secondly, you try to use a purported lack of evidence as proof of its non-existence, which is a typical logical fallacy known as the argument from ignorance. As for the use of the ad hominem fallacy by religious zealots, it's also employed by fundamentalist Atheists.			To say that you can't prove that reality is as scientists have discovered so far is self-contradictory since your view of reality is precisely based on only what some scientists have "discovered" so far. However, there are two problems with this. Firstly, science uses induction, and so their views of the universe are hypothesis rather than concrete and definitive. You can't prove that which itself is not a definitive proof. Science is not meant to prove anything either. Secondly, the conclusions arrived at by scientists are not monolithic since methods and philosophies, and therefore speculation, among them differ. There are scientists that view reality as transcendent as well. The difference of opinion is ultimately predicated on starting axioms or presuppositions, non-provable propositions that are accepted as true. These form our epistemological assumptions. I'll expand on that later.			Your second argument is this:			(1) The idea of transcendence came from materialism (a person)	(2) The claim cannot be separated from its source	(3) Therefore, there is no evidence to support transcendence	(4) Therefore, transcendence is false			(1) This premise assumes that the human mind is ultimately empirically reduceable.(2) is ambiguous and doesn't really mean anything. It also assumes that the mind cannot make conclusions about a reality beyond immediate sense perception. However, a reduction is only appropriate whenever all features of the object of reduction are accounted for. A cursory reading of philosophy of mind and neuroscience shows that this is not the case with the mind. Even fundamentalists like Harris and Dawkins accept this. The great Atheist philosopher, Thomas Nagel, explains how we are cognitively closed off from addressing the hard problems of consciousness, so it's not a matter of having insufficient technology to complete a reductional analysis. Concepts, laws, ideas, and so on, are abstract and not reduceable, but, we can still conceptualize and talk about them and hold them as real. (3) Assumes that the only type of evidence is empirical evidence or observation. This causes the argument to descend into circular reasoning by holding that the only valid evidence is empirical, and since transcendence is not empirical, it does not exist.			Even if humans cannot say anything in particular about higher orders of existence, we can still say that there are higher orders of existence. We know that the universe exists. We know that the brain cannot comprehend the universe, and for that matter reality as it really is, fully. Therefore, the universe is necessarily transcendent in relation to human observation. Kant calls "reality as it really is" the neumenal world, similar to Plato's concept of the world of ideas, which is closed off to us by means of empirical analysis. What we understand of the noumenal world is described in Plato's allegory of the cave; the shadows are the phenomenal world, that is, the world of empirical observation.			Consider this; that which is not empirically reduceable is transcendent. Neither the mind nor the universe, the noumenal world, are empirically reduceable. Therefore, they are, in terms of their natures, transcendent. This is to use reason to make conclusions about reality, and in philosophy, is called "a priori" evidence using deductive logic. Conclusions in deductive reasoning are certain if they are predicated on premises that are also certain. These sort of premises are called Principles, as per Aristotle. When you from the general to the particular you are making necessary statements.			While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable. Empiricism relies solely on "a posteriori" evidence and uses inductive reasoning in which premises supply strong evidence for (not absolute proof of) the truth of the conclusion. This is the purvey empirical science. We move from the particular to the general so you are making probable statements. The issue is that since observation is flawed, we cannot know, through induction, the ultimate nature of reality. This doesn't mean it's not strong or not valuable or pragmatic. Those are separate issues.			Husserl describes "a priori" science as used to describe the nature of "being", and this is what metaphysics uses. He argues that you can't use empirical sciences to resolve philosophical problems, and that is the key issue here.			>Because in all of those cases you are trying to deal in pure logic just analyzing the arguments presented, and you forget the key question. Well, how the fuck do YOU fucking know, asshole?			It sounds like you're riling yourself up into a state of self-righteousness. I never said that I know. However, logically speaking, my position seems to be stronger, even certain thanks to science, since I argue from what is certain.","depth":9,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"unknown_poo","name":"t1_cr8bwwu","parent_id":"t1_cr4vq0m","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431564095,"created_utc":1431560495}

{"body":"Hi. I've done some research on this a couple years ago, particularly with regards to how violent media (especially video games) affect violent behavior. In short, evidence pointed toward that violent media (and media in general) might change how you did the violent act (i.e. fans of *The Matrix* might wear trenchcoats, horror movie fans might wear a mask similar to Jason's, etc), but rarely changed whether or not a violent event was likely to happen. Here it's a little different, but I'm betting the violent outburst would have likely happened regardless of religion, though the justification might be significantly different.		Something else to consider is that people with serious problems with mental illness tend to attach themselves strongly to a religious belief.

{"body":"What an awful tragedy.		I can't think of a clearer example of the devastating consequences that too often the result from the synergy of mental illness and religious belief. How is it okay for religious institutions to sell lies to people without being held to any account for the results? You never know what kind of nut might get the wrong idea.		Religious apologists will point out this man was obviously criminally insane and delusional, and will argue that this mental illness, not his religious belief, is to blame. Others will cite this incident as another example of religion being used to justify horrific actions.		Examining this, it is certainly true that the percentage of all self-described religious believers who commit crimes anything like the ones committed by this Christian man is very small. It is also seems reasonable to expect that of this small fraction, quite a large percentage have psychological problems, and, in fact, are suffering from some variety of mental illness. Does this relieve religious belief of any sort of culpability in this matter?		Looking at it in a slightly different way, the percentage of ALL people who commit a crime like this is very, very small. Maybe it would be useful to ask what percentage of those people who do commit such atrocities also profess some sort of religious belief.  		Exact statistics about this are difficult to find, but a lot can be inferred from other sources. Crime rates are highest in areas where religious belief is highest. Religion in prison is ubiquitous. Over 92% of inmates self-identify as "very religious", with over 75% being Christian, 15% Muslim, and a smattering of other faiths (only 0.02% of inmates say they are atheists, as opposed to 3 to 12% of the general population). There are virtually no politicians who describe themselves as atheists, and how many of them are corrupt? Serial killers also are overwhelmingly religious. 		My point here is that often-stated claim that religion is somehow a deterrent to crime is not supported by any evidence anywhere. While it may or may not be used by criminals to justify their crimes in one way or another, it certainly does nothing whatsoever to prevent them.		This murderous sicko, Randy Janzen, seems to actually have believed that by murdering his daughter, his wife, and his sister he was in some way protecting them from suffering and pain, and that they were not dying, in the sense that he was ending their lives, but rather that he was delivering them to a blissful pain-free afterlife. This is a delusion, in my opinion, but the church has made sure that it is a delusion which is believed whole-heartedly by the majority of people today. And some of them are batshit crazy, and get dangerous ideas.		Janzen did these murders with a revolver, apparently shooting them, probably in the head, at close range. It does not get much more up-close-and-personal than that. I don???t think any normal person would be able to commit such an act of violence against three loved ones, in three separate acts. This is a deeply mentally disturbed human being. He was also apparently massively deluded by religious lies.		Janzen was either a cold-blooded killer using religion as an excuse, trying to portray himself as mentally incompetent by appearing to be a delusional but well-intentioned father who was pushed beyond reason by the suffering of loved ones, or he truly was a deluded person with tenuous attachment to reality, driven to desperation by watching his daughter suffer, and for whom all his life religion had offered false hope for a better life for her beyond the grave. In either case, religion plays a central role. Whether it provides a cover-story and an excuse or promises an end to suffering in heaven, it undeniably has a key role in the mindset of this murderer and in the commission of his crimes.		If an honest accounting of the true role of religion in the deaths of human beings, in all the murders and executions and suicides and violent deaths in armed conflicts through history was possible, I think the results would be staggering, and very damning. From the Spaniards baptizing the natives of the Americas into Christianity before killing them, claiming as a justification that now, at least, they would be rewarded in heaven, to the children of certain religious sects being denied vaccination and health-care by their parents, and on to a host of other awfulness, religion, and in particular the Abrahamic incarnations of it, play a central role.		Indoctrination in childhood, social pressure and societal acceptance of religion are key. No sensible person would buy the literal interpretation of the Bible as true if they hadn???t had it drilled into them since before the age of reason. You couple this conditioning of young minds with the false promises that religion makes, promises which speak to the natural human fear of death and the natural tribalism in our souls, and you have a truly destructive force in the world. You have a bunch of silly lies which must never be doubted, and you have a clerical class of profiteers whose interests lie in the perpetuation of these lies and who desperately try to oppose all attempts to gain knowledge and all free inquiry and free expression because they know these are the enemy of these ancient lies they depend on for their livelihood.		The other component is the broad societal acceptance of religion, and the tolerance it undeservedly gets. 		I???m sick of it. When is somebody with influence going to stand up and point out that it???s not okay to lie, cradle to grave, to everybody. If this Janzing character hadn???t been lied to about a heaven his whole life, would he have acted as he did? Without that pablum of there being ???a better place??? would he have shot his family to death? Perhaps. But he wouldn???t have had this accepted, widespread institutional fantasy about ???the next life???, purveyed by this ancient stupid lying cult, and believed by countless other victims of childhood conditioning, to fall back on.		I think sooner or later the religions of the world need to be held responsible for their bullshit. Sooner or later they should be called out and made to pay for spreading absolute falsehoods to billions of people from cradle to grave, cheapening life, misrepresenting death, and imposing the ancient savage morality of barbarians squatting in goat-skin tents in puddles of shit thousands of years ago on modern people.		Religion is bullshit, and more people are coming to know it, at least on some level, every day. I say the church negligently lead that murderous motherfucker on, with their bullshit about an afterlife, and they are at least partially responsible for what happened, I???m not saying they???re murderers in this case, but they are in millions of others, so I don???t think they should get any slack for representing fantasy as truth to a mental case who then proceeded to commit a triple homicide because he believed it.		Shouldn't they have to answer in some way for this sort of thing?","depth":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Congruesome","name":"t1_cr35vbu","parent_id":"t3_35b7rt","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431137520,"created_utc":1431133920}

The central argument to the opposition has always been "most of the people who enjoy these things don't *act* that way, so something else is contributory." 		I don't think that religion is a positive influence, but--on top of there being a strict rule against suicide in Christian doctrine--most of its adherents don't act like this.

Because it's all gods plan anyway and this earth isn't really his true realm anyway... Plus he has a plan for us all so [shrug].		Atheists realize that life is a precious phenomenon spinning through space on a mudball, and know that we HAVE to act to save ourselves. Religious people? Eh.

{"body":"First of all, Christianity makes people *more* violent. So does its vile offspring, Islam. 		The Christian "doctrine" against killing is non-existent in practice. 		The commandment against it is lip-music, and ignored throughout the Bible, one of the bloodiest documents ever conceived. God Himself kills MILLIONS, while instructing the Israelites to kill millions more (except the young females, which he tells them to keep for later raping).		Religion has quantifiable effects on the brain, also. Scientific studies find the brains of very religious, conservative people are physically different, and work differently. There are other differences. Religious people tend to have lower IQs, they think from a fear-based perspective, they are less curious, more hostile to anything foreign or new, and they are quicker to become violent in stress situations.		It is unclear if these traits are genetic, or environmental, or some fusion of the these, but they are consistently discovered in study after study.		Most serial killers (not all, but certainly the majority) were raised in very strict religious, and often sexually repressive environments.		Being indoctrinated from earliest childhood, long before the age of reason, and on into adulthood, with religion, told that death is not the end, that a God watches over us and will judge us, that we are born guilty sinners who have to repent and beg forgiveness for the sins of another human being long ago, threatened with eternal torture, lied to over and over and over, all this will fuck up a brain. 		And it does fuck up brains. All over the world, over and over, religious liars ruin our brains before we could ever hope to protect ourselves, and then we countenance, or even participate in, ruining the brains of our own children.		Religion, and especially the disgusting Abrahamic faiths, with the soul-destroying death-cult of Christianity leader of the pack, is the great festering sore on humanity, it is the Big Lie. It retards us and ruins us and lies to us, it sets us against each other and steals our freedom and grinds our spirit into dust.		If this murderer wasn't Christian, I would be very surprised. The odds are overwhelming that he was, because eighty percent or more of North Americans are poisoned in this way. He speaks of an afterlife, his poor dead daughter wrote about God before she was killed, and kids get religion from their parents almost always.		So I'm saying that religion was in this man's mind, almost certainly. He was also very mentally sick, clearly, but he had that convenient silly lie about an afterlife with which to justify his actions and make excuses for them. His daughter is NOT drifting blissfully through the clouds, she's fucking dead, gone, no more. Her consciousness is at an end and her body is a shattered bloody lifeless husk. Thanks, Dad.		Now I'm tiring of all this discussion. Religion is the poison pill underneath so much human misery and at the heart of so much mental illness and so much violence and hatred and suffering, and yet it always gets a pass, because people are used to it; it's always been there.

I contend that if religion had taught this man that he and his family only had one life to live instead of teaching that death leads to eternal bliss, he would have been *far less likely* to kill them or himself.

{"body":"Certainly it didn't help, maybe if religion wasn't do prevalent in society it would have taken some time for his illness to convince him to do those kind of things, since a skeptical person would have trouble dealing with such things.  	  	My point is simply that instead of pointlessly blaming religion for this and shaking our heads in shame, we should take this opportunity to educate people on signs of mental illness, how to detect it and how to deal with it. So many people know practically nothing of mental illness, many people think that you can just will them away and that the people who are mentally ill just aren't strong enough, that is, of course, completely untrue.  	  	I mean ask people where you work or frequent what they know about depression, most people think it's people being sad about something, it isn't, I know, I have a mild chronic depression.  	  	You can't just will mental illnesses away, the same way you can't will a broken arm to fix itself, but most people don't understand that.  	  	Religion is partially to blame for this(well possibly mostly to blame) since religions of many kind consider mentally ill people as posesses or demonic, making people think that they got taken over by demons because they were weak in some way or because they didn't do right to their god, this makes the world we have to day possible, a world where sick people are blamed for having bad genes, even though we know it's not their fault.","depth":4,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spiritbx","name":"t1_cr3elst","parent_id":"t1_cr3b7s6","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1431159583,"created_utc":1431155983}
